                    ancient town, 57 miles from the seaport of Beyrout, in 33° 30' N. lat. and 36°
                    18' E. long, It occupies a site of singular beauty, On the eastern side of the
                    range of Antilibanus is a plain of vast extent, reaching far out into Arabia,
                    and having an elevation of 2200 feet above the sea. The River Barada, the Abana
                    of the Bible, rises in the centre of the mountain range, descends through a
                    sublime ravine, enters the plain, flows across it eastward for 20 miles, and
                    empties itself into a lake, which in the heat of summer becomes a morass. On the
                    banks of the Abana, about a mile from the mouth of the ravine, stands Damascus.
                    The river intersects the city, in a deep rapid current, averaging 50 feet wide.
                    On its northern bank is a large and comparatively modern suburb; but the whole
                    of the ancient walled city, and the principal buildings, are spread over the
                    plain on the south. The Abana is the life of Damascus, and has made it
                    perennial. By an admirable system of channels and pipes, many of them apparently
                    of high antiquity, its waters are not only conveyed through every quarter, but
                    into almost every house, supplying that first requisite of Eastern life and
                    luxury. The river is also extensively used for irrigation. Canals are led off
                    from it at different elevations above the city, and carried far and wide over
                    the surrounding plain, converting what would otherwise be a parched desert into
                    a paradise. The orchards, gardens, vineyards, and fields of Damascus cover a
                    circuit of at least 60 miles, and they owe their almost unrivalled beauty and
                    luxuriance to the Abana. The area irrigated and rendered fertile by it is
                    upwards of 300 square miles in extent, and the River Awaj, the ancient Pharpar,
                    irrigates nearly 100 more. There was truth, therefore, in the boastful words of
                    Naaman (2 Kings v. 12), “Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better
                    than all the waters of Israel ?”</p>
                <p>The view of Damascus from the crest of Antilibanus is scarcely surpassed in the
                    world. The elevation is about 500 feet above the city, which is nearly two miles
                    distant. The distance lends enchantment to the view; for while the peculiar
                    forms of Eastern architecture do not bear close inspection, they look like an
                    Arabian poet’s dream when seen from afar. Tapering minarets and swelling domes,
                    tipped with golden crescents, rise above the white-terraced roofs; while in some
                    places their glittering tops appear among the green foliage of the gardens. In
                    the centre of the city stands the Great Mosque, and near it are the gray
                    battlements of the old castle. Away on the south the eye follows a long suburb,
                    while below the ridge on which we stand is the <hi rend="italic">Merj,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ager Damascenus</hi> of early travellers—a green meadow
                    extending along the river from the mouth of the ravine to the city. The gardens
                    and orchards, which have been so long and so justly celebrated, encompass the
                    whole city, sweeping the base of the bleak hills, like a sea of verdure, and
                    covering an area more than 30 miles in circuit—not uniformly dense, but with
                    open spots here and there. Beyond this circuit are large clumps of trees,
                    dotting the plain almost to the horizon. The varied tints of the foliage greatly
                    enhance the beauty of this picture.</p>
                <p>The population of Damascus is estimated at 150,000. Of these about 19,000 are
                    Christians, 6000 Jews, and the rest Mahometans. Of the Christians 8000 belong to
                    the Greek or Eastern Church, and an equal number to the Catholic; and there are
                    besides small communities of Syrians, Maronites, Armenians, and Protestants. In
                    the plain round Damascus, watered by the Abana and Pharpar, there are 140
                    villages, with an aggregate population of 50,000, of whom about 1000 are
                    Christians, and 2000 Druzes.</p>
                <p>Until the capture of the city by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, in 1832, no foreign
                    consul was permitted to enter it, and no Christian or Jew was suffered to ride
                    through the streets. The massacre of 1860 showed that the spirit of the people
                    had not changed, and was only kept in check by Turkish <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n826/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0826-0791"/> troops. A few of the Mahometans, however, are now
                    more enlightened, and have gained a high position as merchants. The Christians
                    are enterprizing and industrious, and a large proportion of the trade of the
                    city is in their hands, Until the massacre they were rapidly advancing in
                    numbers, wealth, and influence; but that event gave a fatal blow to their
                    prosperity. The Jews are the leading bankers and money-dealers. Both Christians
                    and Jews occupy distinct quarters of the city.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of the city consist principally of silks, which are exported to
                    Egypt, Baghdad, and Persia; coarse woollen cloth for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >abbas,</hi> or cloaks, worn by the peasants of Syria; cotton cloths, chiefly
                    for home use; gold and silver ornaments, arms, and household utensils. An
                    extensive trade is carried on with the Bedouins of the Arabian desert. The
                    bazaars are always crowded; and on Friday, the market day, it is difficult to
                    pass through them. On the arrival of the great pilgrim caravan, in going to or
                    returning from Mecca, the city presents a gay and animated appearance. Vast
                    multitudes of Persians, Circassians, Anatolians, and Turks throng the streets,
                    and each pilgrhn is a merchant for the time being, buying or selling as the case
                    may be.</p>
                <p>The bazaars have long been celebrated, and are among the best in the East. They
                    are narrow covered lanes, with ranges of open stalls on each side. Each
                    department of trade has its own quarter or section, where may be seen Manchester
                    prints, Persian and Turkish carpets, French silks, Sheffield cutlery, amber
                    mouth-pieces for pipes, antique China, Cashmere shawls, Mocha coffee, Dutch
                    sugar, Damascus swords, and tobacco from Lebanon and Baghdad.</p>
                <p>The khans of Damascus are spacious, and some of them splendid buildings. They are
                    public marts where the leading merchants meet, and expose their wares for sale.
                    The largest is Khan Asad Pasha, situated in the Bizuriyeh, or “Seed Bazaar.” It
                    was erected about 125 years ago, and bears the name of its founder. The gate is
                    a noble specimen of Moorish architecture. The interior is a quadrangle, with a
                    gallery, and a domed roof supported on massive piers. Round it are ranges of
                    small chambers, like cells, in which the goods are stored. All the khans are
                    upon the same plan.</p>
                <p>The private houses are the admiration of every visitor. No contrast could be
                    greater than that between the exterior and interior; the rough mud walls give
                    poor promise of splendour within. The entrance is usually by a low door, and
                    through a narrow winding passage which leads to the outer court, where the
                    master has his reception room. From this another winding passage leads to the
                    harem, which is the principal part of the house. The plan of all is the same—an
                    open court, with a tesselated pavement, and one or two marble fountains; orange
                    and lemon trees, flowering shrubs, and climbing plants give freshness and
                    fragrance. All the apartments open into the court; and on the south side is an
                    open alcove, with a marble floor, and raised dais round three sides, covered
                    with cushions; the front wall is supported by an ornamented Saracenic arch. The
                    decoration of some of the rooms is gorgeous, the walls being covered in part
                    with mosaics and in part with carved work, while the ceilings are rich in
                    arabesque ornaments, elaborately gilt. A few of the modern J ewish houses have
                    been embellished at an enormous cost, but they are wanting in taste.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities.—</hi> Although Damascus is one of the oldest
                    cities in the world, its antiquities do not present such a striking appearance
                    as those of many other places of far less note. This is in some measure owing to
                    the fact that the old materials have been largely used in the erection of modern
                    houses. The walls which inclosed the old city are about three miles in circuit,
                    and their foundations are probably of the age of the Seleucidae. Some of the
                    Roman gateways are in tolerable preservation. Through the centre of the city,
                    from the east to the west gate, ran the <hi rend="italic">Via Recta,</hi> “the
                    street called Straight,” lined on each side with a double colonnade. It is now
                    mostly built over, but many fragments of columns remain <hi rend="italic">in
                    situ.</hi></p>
                <p>The castle, which stands at the north-west corner, on the bank of the river, is a
                    quadrangle 280 yards long by 200 wide, surrounded by a moat. The exterior walls
                    are in good preservation, but the interior is a heap of ruins. It is not easy to
                    determine the date of its erection, or to say whether Romans, Byzantines, or
                    Saracens contributed most to it. The foundations are not later, and may be
                    earlier, than the Roman age. A few vaults beneath the exterior battlements are
                    used as magaziues, and contain some pieces of old armour, with bows, arrows,
                    and. other weapons.</p>
                <p>The Great Mosque is the most important building in the city. It stands near the
                    castle, and is now, unfortunately, so closely hemmed in with bazaars and houses
                    that its exterior is concealed from view. It occupies a quadrangle 163 yards
                    long by 108 wide, facing the cardinal points. Along the north side is an open
                    court surrounded by cloisters, resting on pillars of granite, marble, and
                    limestone. The mosque itself extends along the whole southern side, and its
                    interior dimensions are 431 feet by 125 feet It is divided into three aisles of
                    equal breadth, by two ranges of Corinthian columns 22 feet high, supporting
                    round arches. In the centre is a dome resting on four massive piers. Underneath
                    is said to be a cave in which the head of John the Baptist is preserved in a
                    golden casket. The mosque has three minarets, one of which is 250 feet high, and
                    upon it, according to Moslem tradition, Jesus will descend on the day of
                    judgment.</p>
                <p>The style and workmanship of three periods are distinguishable in the building.
                    There are the massive foundations and exterior colonnades of a Greek or Roman
                    temple. There are next the round-topped windows and ornamented doorway of an
                    early Christian church. Over the door is an inscription in Greek to the
                    following effect:—“Thy kingdom, O Christ, is an everlasting kingdom, and thy
                    dominion endureth throughout all generations.” Then there are the minarets,
                    dome, and arcades of Saracenic origin.</p>
                <p>Round the mosque are traces of a court, 1100 feet long by 800 feet wide,
                    encompassed by colonnades similar to those of the temple of Herod in Jerusalem,
                    and the temple of the sun at Palmyra. It seems highly probable that this was the
                    site of the temple of Rimmon, mentioned in 2 Kings v. 18, and that it became in
                    .after times the seat of the worship of Jupiter. In the 4th century it was
                    converted into a church, and dedicated to John the Baptist; and in the beginning
                    of the 8th century it was seized by the Mahometans.</p>
                <p>There are many other mosques in the city, some of them large and beautiful. Among
                    them are the <hi rend="italic">Telciyeh,</hi> on the bank of the Abana at the
                    western end of the city, founded by Sultan Selim, in 1516, for the accommodation
                    of poor pilgrims, the graceful dome of which, flanked by two slender minarets,
                    is seen from afar, and the <hi rend="italic">Senaniyeh,</hi> in the centre of
                    the city, distinguished by a minaret coated with green tiles, for the
                    manufacture of which Damascus was once celebrated. It was built by Senan Pasha
                    in 1581, and has a splendid cloistered court. There are also small and richly
                    decorated chapels, connected with the tombs &lt;&lt;f Saladin, Bibars, and some
                    other great princes. Among the traditional holy places of Damascus are the
                    sanctuary of Abraham, at Burzeh, three miles north of the city; tl.e house of
                    Naaman. now a leper hospital; the scene of Paul s <pb break="no"

                    Ananias; and the spot where the apostle was let down from the wall.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ilaj,</hi> or pilgrim caravan, is one of the great sights
                    of Damascus. It starts for Mecca each year on the 15th of the month Shawall. The
                    <hi rend="italic">muhmil,</hi> a canopy of green silk containing the new
                    covering sent by the sultan for the <hi rend="italic">Kaabah,</hi> is carried on
                    the back of a dromedary, and is followed by the pasha, and great dignitaries of
                    the city, escorted by the military. The streets and house-tops along the line of
                    the procession are crowded with people. The caravan returns after an absence of
                    four months. It is rapidly declining in numbers and importance.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">history</hi> of Damascus reaches far back into the mists of
                    antiquity. Josephus says the city was founded by Uz, the son of Aram; and the
                    name of its territory, as given in the Bible, namely, <hi rend="italic">Aram
                    Dameslc</hi> (2 Sam. viii. 6), is almost identical with its modern Arab name,
                    which means “Damascus of Syria.” It was already a noted place in the days of
                    Abraham, whose steward was “Eliezer of Damascus” (Gen. xv. 2). Some centuries
                    later, it became, under the rule of the Hadads, the rival of Israel (1 Kings
                    xv., xx., and xxii.). During that period it was the scene of the romantic story
                    of the leper Naaman (2 Kings v.). A change of dynasty took place in the time of
                    the prophet Elisha, when Hadad was murdered by Hazael (2 Kings viii.); but it
                    was soon afterwards captured by Tiglath-pileser, and its people carried away to
                    Assyria (2 Kings xvi. 9; Isa. xvii. 1-3). Colonies from Assyria were then placed
                    in the city, and it continued for many centuries a dependency of that empire. It
                    was taken by Alexander the Great, and after his death was attached to the
                    kingdom of the Seleucidae. In 64 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Romans under
                    Pompey captured it, and under their rule it remained till 37 A.D., when Aretas,
                    king of Arabia, taking advantage of the death of the Emperor Tiberius, seized
                    and held it during the time of St Paul’s visit (2 Cor xi. 32; Acts ix.).</p>
                <p>Christianity appears to have spread rapidly in and around Damascus, as its
                    metropolitan, with seven of his suffragans, was present at the Council of Nice
                    in 325 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> About seventy years later the great temple
                    was converted into a Christian church. In 634 the city fell into the hands of
                    the Mahometans; and a few years later it became for a short period the capital
                    of the Mahometan empire. The caliphs who ruled it adorned the city with many
                    splendid buildings, and changed the cathedral into a mosque. A stormy period of
                    four centuries now passed over Damascus, and then an unsuccessful attempt was
                    made to capture it by the crusaders under Baldwin. The reigns of Noureddin, and
                    his more distinguished successor Saladin, form bright epochs in the history of
                    the city. Two centuries later came Tamerlane. Arab writers call him “the Wild
                    Beast,” and he deserves the name. After the city had surrendered to him, and
                    every male had paid the redemption money which he himself had assessed, he urged
                    his soldiers to an indiscriminate massacre. Never had the city so fearfully
                    experienced the horrors of conquest. Its wealth, its stores of antiquities, and
                    rich fabrics were seized; its palaces were pillaged and left in ashes; its
                    libraries, Idled with the literature of the period of the caliphs, and with the
                    writings of the fathers of the Eastern Church, were destroyed. Tradition says
                    that of the large Christian population only a single family escaped.</p>
                <p>A century later Damascus fell into the hands of the Turks under Sultan Selim, and
                    has since acknowledged their supremacy. In 1832 it was taken by the Egyptians
                    under Ibrahim Pasha, the celebrated general and son of Mehemet Ali, and this
                    conquest is chiefly remarkable for the effect it produced on the inhabitants.
                    The city was then opened for the first time to the representatives of foreign
                    powers. The British consul entered it mounted, and in full costume, escorted by
                    Egyptian soldiers; and the first effectual check was given to Moslem fanaticism.
                    In 1841 the Egyptians were driven out by the English, and Damascus with the rest
                    of Syria reverted to the direct sway of the Sultan.</p>
                <p>A Protestant mission was established in Damascus in 1843, and has succeeded,
                    chiefly by its schools and the distribution of books, in greatly advancing the
                    cause of education in and around the city.</p>
                <p>The only incident worthy of record since that time is the massacre of 1860. The
                    Moslem population, taking advantage of disturbances among the Druzes in Lebanon,
                    rose against the Christians on the afternoon of Monday the 9th of July, and on
                    that and the two following days burned the whole Christian quarter, and
                    massacred in cold blood about 3000 adult males. But no estimate of the numbers
                    actually murdered can give any adequate idea of the terrible results of the
                    massacre. Thousands who escaped the sword died of wounds, or famine, or
                    subsequent privation. The Christian quarter has been mostly rebuilt, but many of
                    the most eminent and enterprizing Christian merchants removed to Beyrout and
                    Egypt. Yet notwithstanding the fanaticism of its people, and the misgovernment
                    of the Turks, Damascus is progressing. Schools have been established; the
                    streets have been cleared of rubbish, and widened; sanitary regulations are
                    enforced; and the fine new road recently made by a French company over Lebanon
                    to Beyrout has given a great impetus to trade and manufacture. (j. <hi
