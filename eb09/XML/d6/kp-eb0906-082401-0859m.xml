                <p><label type="entry">DARIEN</label>, a district of South America, of special
                    interest in the history of geographical discovery, which gives its name to the
                    great inlet of the Colombian coast otherwise known as the Gulf of Uraba, and to
                    the great neck of land more familiarly designated the Isthmus of Panama. It was
                    first reconnoitred in the first year of the 16th century by Rodrigo Bastidas of
                    Seville; and the first settlement was Santa Maria del Antigua, situated on the
                    small Darien river, north-west of the mouth of the Atrato. In 1513 Vasco Nunez
                    Balboa stood “silent upon a peak in Darien,” and saw the Pacific at his feet
                    stretching inland in the Gulf of San Miguel; and ever since that date this
                    narrow stretch of terra-firma has alternately seemed to proffer and refuse a
                    means of transit between the two oceans. The first serious attempt to turn the
                    isthmus to permanent account as a trade-route dates from the beginning of the
                    18th century, and forms an interesting chapter in Scottish history. In 1695 an
                    Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament for a company trading to Africa and
                    the Indies; and this company, under the advice of one of the most remarkable
                    economists of the period,—William Paterson, a Scotchman, and the founder of the
                    Bank of England,— determined to establish a colony on the Isthmus of Darien as a
                    general emporium for the commerce of all the nations of the world. The project
                    was taken up in Scotland with the enthusiasm of national rivalry towards
                    England, and <pb break="no"

                    country.” On the 26th of July 1698 the pioneers set sail from Leith amid the
                    cheers of an almost envious multitude; and on the 4th of November, with the loss
                    of only fifteen out of 12,000 men, they arrived at Darien, and took up their
                    quarters in a well-defended spot, with a good harbour and excellent outlook. The
                    country they named New Caledonia, and two sites selected for future cities xyere
                    designated respectively New Edinburgh and New St Andrews. At first all seemed to
                    go well; but by and by lack of provisions, sickness, and anarchy reduced the
                    settlers to the most miserable plight; and in June 1699 they reembarked in three
                    vessels, a weak and hopeless company, to sail whithersoever Providence might
                    direct. Meanwhile a supplementary expedition had been prepared in Scotland; two
                    vessels were dispatched in May, and four others followed in August. But this
                    venture proved even more unfortunate than the former. The colonists arrived
                    broken in health; their spirits were crushed by the fate of their predecessors,
                    and embittered by the harsh fanaticism of the four ministers whom the General
                    Assembly of the Church of Scotland had sent out to establish a regular
                    presbyterial organization. The last addition to the settlement was the company
                    of Captain Campbell of Finab, who arrived only to learn that a Spanish force of
                    1500 or 1600 men lay encamped at Tubacanti, on the River Santa Maria, waiting
                    for the appearance of a Spanish squadron in order to make a combined attack on
                    the fort. Captain Campbell, on the second day after his arrival, marched with
                    200 men across the isthmus to Tubacanti, stormed the camp in the night-time, and
                    dispersed the Spanish force. On his return to the fort on the fifth day he found
                    it besieged by the Spaniards from the men-of-war; and, after a vain attempt to
                    maintain its defence, he succeeded with a few companions in making his escape in
                    a small vessel. A capitulation followed, and the Darien colony was no more. Of
                    those who had taken part in the enterprize only a miserable handful ever reached
                    their native land.</p>
