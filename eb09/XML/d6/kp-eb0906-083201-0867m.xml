                    >Jean-Marie</hi> (1716-1800), a distinguished naturalist, was born at Montbar,
                    in the department of the Cote d’Or, in France, May 29, 1716. His father, Jean
                    Daubenton, a notary, who destined him for the church, after putting him through
                    a course of instruction under the Dominicans of Dijon, sent him to Paris to
                    learn theology. The secret study of medicine, however, and the lectures of
                    Baron, Mar-tinenq, and Col de Villars, of Winslow, Hunault, and Antoine de
                    Jussieu, were more attractive to young Daubenton. The death of his father in
                    1736 set him free to follow his own inclinations, and he accordingly in 1741
                    took the degree of doctor at Rheims, and returned to his native town with the
                    intention of following the practice of medicine. But fortune destined him for a
                    more brilliant career. It was about this time that Buffon, also a native of
                    Montbar, had formed the plan of bringing out a grand treatise on natural
                    history, and in 1742 he invited Daubenton to assist him by providing the
                    anatomical descriptions for that work. The characters of the two philosophers
                    were opposed in almost every respect. Buffon was violent and impatient;
                    Daubenton, gentle and patient; Buffon was rash in his judgments, and
                    imaginative, seeking rather to divine than to discover truths; Daubenton was
                    cautious, and believed nothing he had not himself been able to see or ascertain.
                    From nature each appeared to have received the qualities requisite to temper
                    those of the other; and a more suitable coadjutor than Daubenton it would have
                    been difficult for Buffon to obtain. In the first section of the natural history
                    Daubenton gave descriptions and details of the dissection of 182 species of
                    quadrupeds, thus procuring for himself a high reputation, and exciting the envy
                    of Reaumur, who considered himself as at the head of the learned in natural
                    history in France. A feeling of jealousy induced Buffon to dispense with the
                    services of Daubenton in the preparation of the subsequent parts of his work,
                    which, as a consequence, lost much in precision and scientific value. Buffon
                    afterwards perceived and acknowledged his error, and renewed his intimacy with
                    his former associate. The number of dissertations on natural history which
                    Daubenton published in the memoirs of the French Academy is very great.
                    Zoological descriptions and dissections, the comparative anatomy of recent and
                    fossil animals, vegetable physiology, mineralogy, experiments in agriculture,
                    and the introduction of the merino sheep into France gave active occupation to
                    his energies; and the cabinet of natural history in Paris, of which in 1744 he
                    was appointed keeper and demonstrator, was arranged and considerably enriched by
                    him. From 1775 Daubenton lectured on natural history in the College of Medicine,
                    and in 1783 on rural economy. He was appointed professor of mineralogy by the
                    Convention at the Jardin du Roi; and he gave lectures at the Normal School
                    during the ephemeral existence of that institution. He was likewise one of the
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des tfavans,</hi> and contributed to
                    two encyclopaedias. As a lecturer he was in high repute, and to the last
                    retained his popularity. In the winter of 1799 he was appointed a member of the
                    Conservative Senate, but at the first meeting which he attended he fell from his
                    seat in an apoplectic fit After a short illness he died at Paris, January 1,
                    1800.</p>
