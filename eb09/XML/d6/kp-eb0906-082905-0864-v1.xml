                        de</hi></label> (1767-1829), a distinguished author and statesman of France,
                    was born at Montpellier, where his father held the office of secretary to the
                    intendancy of Languedoc. From the Oratorians of the military school at Tournon
                    he imbibed an enthusiasm for study, and an admiration of the master-pieces of
                    ancient literature, which remained with him for life. At the age of sixteen he
                    entered the army; and in the following year, though under the legal age, he
                    obtained the rank of commissary. In 1791, in spite of his attachment to the
                    principles of the Revolution, he was accused before the “Club” of treasonable
                    relations with the marquis of Bouzol; but the eloquence of his defence secured
                    his acquittal. In the following year, however, while he was serving in Brittany,
                    the senseless suspicion of the times was such that his use of the ironical
                    expression <hi rend="italic">nos amis les Anglais</hi> caused him to be thrown
                    into prison. The eighteen months of durance spent at Rennes and Orleans were
                    mainly devoted to the study and translation of Horace, in imitation of whose
                    style he also produced an <hi rend="italic">$pitre H mon Sans-Culotte,</hi> as
                    he designates the keeper to whom he was intrusted. After his releaso he served
                    under Pdtiet and Massena in several important situations in the commissariat and
                    in the office of the ministry of war. His generous love of justice was
                    strikingly displayed by the appeal which he made in favour of Ferrand, whom he
                    believed to have been wrongfully removed from a post to which he himself was
                    appointed.</p>

                <p>The first consul made him secretary to the ministry at war; and, the day after
                    the battle of Marengo, nominated him one of the commissioners for the execution
                    of the convention concluded between General Berth ier and General Melas. In 1805
                    he was made a counsellor of state and intendant-general of the emperor’s
                    military household. In the following year he received the appointment of
                    intendantgeneral of the Brunswick territory, and subsequently of commissioner
                    for the execution of the treaties of Tilsit and Vienna, as well as minister
                    plenipotentiary at Berlin. In 1806 he was elected a member of the Institute, and
                    in 1808 an honorary member of the Berlin Academy. In 1811 he was appointed
                    minister secretary of state; and shortly afterwards he received the portfolio of
                    the war department. He accompanied Napoleon in his Russian campaign. When the
                    retreat from Moscow had commenced, he had to assume the functions of
                    intendant-general of the army; and his iron constitution, and capacity for
                    labour, enabled him to fulfil, with apparent ease, duties which might have
                    killed several men of ordinary strength. <hi rend="italic">C’est un lion pour le
                        travail,</hi> said Napoleon himself. After the restoration of the Bourbons
                    he was made intendant-general to the king, an appointment which he received in
                    December 1814. But on the return of Napoleon from Elba he joined the standard of
                    his old master, subscribed a considerable sum for the purpose of arming the
                    Parisian federds, and in his capacity of counsellor of state attached his
                    signature to the celebrated declaration of the 25th March. His conduct towards
                    the emperor displays a frank and simple independence of character combined with
                    a genuine devotion to Napoleon’s cause. “They don’t speak well of my <hi
                        rend="italic">arc de triomphe,”</hi> said Napoleon one day. “There aretwo
                    persons whom I have heard praise it,” replied Daru,—“your majesty and his
                    architect.” The second restoration found him compromised by his connection with
                    the Government of the Hundred Days; and he retired for a time into private life,
                    and devoted himself to literary pursuits. But in 1819 he was summoned by royal
                    ordinance to the Chamber of Peers, where his rectitude of judgment and
                    administrative knowledge signalized him as one of the most powerful defenders of
                    the national liberties. In 1821 he published his <hi rend="italic">Histoire de
                        Venise,</hi> which is by far the most important of his works, and is
                    regarded as the most complete and impartial history of that singular republic
                    equally remarkable for its strength and duration. His subsequent work, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Histoire de Bretagne</hi> (3 vols. 1826), displays great
                    labour and accuracy, but is devoid of interest, except to historical
                    antiquaries. His other productions consist of a poetical translation of Horace,
                    which, in spite of the malicious epigram of Le Brun, <hi rend="italic">Je ne lis
                        point Daru, j’aime trop mon Horace,</hi> has enjoyed in France a
                    well-merited reputation; a variety of occasional poems, discourses, and <hi
                        rend="italic">eloges</hi> pronounced in the Academy; and speeches delivered
                    in the Chamber of Peers. He died at his residence near Meulan, September 5,
                    1829, aged sixty-two. His remains were deposited in the Cimiti&amp;re
                    Montmartre, and five discourses were pronounced over his tomb by MM. Mirbel,
                    Cuvier, Silvestre de Sacy, Ternaux, and Leroy.</p>
