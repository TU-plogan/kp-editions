                    subject of this notice is entitled to the style of St Damasus. It is stated that
                    he was by birth a Spaniard; but the more authentic account is that he was born
                    at Guimaraens, in Portugal, in or about the year 304. Other writers have
                    maintained that, though of Portuguese extraction, he was born in Rome. It seems
                    certain that he went thither at an early age; and, though he was forty-eight
                    years old when deacon’s orders were conferred on him, he had at an early age
                    been admitted to the ecclesiastical career as a “reader” and secretary of the
                    church. And he is said in that capacity to have compiled the “Acts” of the
                    martyrs Petrus and Marcellinus. The writer in the <hi rend="italic">Biographic
                    Universelie</hi> says that he succeeded St Liberius on the Papal throne, but
                    this is an error. On the death of St Liberius, St Felix II. succeeded him, and
                    reigned one year and three months; and on his death Damasus was elected, in 366.
                    When St Liberius was exiled from Rome, Damasus accompanied him to Milan. He
                    received priest’s orders, was made cardinal during the pontificate of Felix II.,
                    and in 366 was elected by the Roman clergy to the Papacy in the sixty-second
                    year of his age. He died in 384.</p>
                <p>The most important event of his papacy was the publication of the law made by the
                    Emperor Valentinian in 370, to restrain the clergy from influencing their
                    penitents to enrich them. This law of 370 is most important and noteworthy from
                    having been the first of the long series of attempts to effect the same object,
                    which, revived by Frederick II. and by Edward I. of England, have occupied the
                    attention of the legislators of so many generations from the time of Damasus
                    even to the present day. Valentinian ordered that ecclesiastics and monks should
                    not frequent the houses of widows and single women. Confessors were prohibited
                    from receiving any gift or legacy from their penitents, and all donations or
                    bequests made in contravention of this law were declared to be null and void.
                    Catholic writers represent this law as having been suggested to the emperor by
                    the Pope. Anti-Catholic authors say that it was imposed on the Pope by the
                    emperor; and it is impossible to avoid feeling that the latter is by far the
                    more probable statement. In any case the law in question furnishes a highly
                    curious and suggestive picture of the church as it was under St Damasus. And St
                    Jerome himself, who had been invited to come to Rome by Damasus, and acted as
                    his secretary, confesses that the clergy had by their conduct merited a law
                    which placed them under restraints such as were not found necessary for mimes
                    charioteers, and comedians.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Damasus had to go through a severe struggle for his throne with an Anti-pope
                    named Ursinus or Urasinus. Of course the ecclesiastical writers represent the
                    successful one of the antagonists to have been animated by the most sincere and
                    heavenly-minded desires for peace and concord. But the pagan historian Ammianus,
                    as quoted by Gibbon, as well as another authority cited by him, would go to show
                    that the two competitors for the position of vicar of Christ were equally savage
                    and ferocious; and that the 137 dead bodies found in the Liberian Basilica (the
                    church of St Maria Maggiore), after a struggle between the parties, were due to
                    the ferocity of the orthodox Pope’s adherents rather than to those of the
                    Anti-pope.</p>
                <p>Gibbon says that Damasus “had the good sense or the good fortune to engage in his
                    service the zeal and-abilities of the learned Jerome, and the grateful saint has
                    celebrated the merit and purity of a very ambiguous character.” The official
                    ecclesiastical writers tell us nothing about the 137 dead bodies in the Liberian
                    Basilica, but much of the sainted Pope’s decisions as to the nature of the
                    Trinity, and inquire learnedly whether or no it were he who first ordered the
                    Hallelujah to be sung in the Roman churches at Easter. It seems more certain
                    that it was to him that the pagan prefect of Rome, Prsetextatus, replied, that
                    he would become a Christian to-morrow if they would make him a bishop I</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Damasus</hi> II. was a native of Bavaria, of the name of
                    Papon, who became bishop of Brixen in Tyrol, and was elected the 155th Pope on
                    the death of Clement II. in 1047, mainly by the influence of the Emperor Henry
                    III. He reigned but twenty-three days, having died on the 8tli of August at
                    Palestrina, whither he had gone to escape the heat of Rome. The shortness of his
                    reign, and the fact that previously to his election he was an obscure stranger,
                    have been the causes that very little is known about him.</p>
