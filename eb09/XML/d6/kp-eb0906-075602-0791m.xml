                    and on the W. by Jessor, Pábná, Bográ, and Rangpur. The Division contains a
                    total area of 18,276 square miles, with a population of 9,126,863
                    souls.</p></note> in Bengal, British India, situated between <hi rend="italic"
                    >24°</hi> 20' 12" and 23° 6' 30" N. lat., and between 89° 47' 50" and 91 ° 1'
                    10" E. long. It is bounded on the N. by Maimansinh, on the E. by Tipperah, and
                    on the S. and W. by Bákarganj and Farídpur. The district consists of a vast
                    level plain, divided into two sections by the Dhaleswarí river. The northern
                    part, again intersected by the Lakshmiá river, contains the city of Dacca, and
                    as a rule lies well above flood-level. The soil is composed of red ferruginous
                    <hi rend="italic">kankar,</hi> with a stratum of clay in the more elevated
                    parts, covered by a thin layer of vegetable mould, or by recent alluvial
                    deposits. The scenery along the Lakshmiá. is very beautiful, the banks being
                    high and wooded. About 20 miles north of Dacca city, small ridges are met with
                    in the Madhupur jungle, stretching into Maimansinh district. These hills,
                    however, are mere mounds of from 20 to 40 feet high, composed of red soil
                    containing a considerable quantity of iron ore; and the whole tract is for the
                    most part unproductive. Towards the city, the red soil is intersected by creeks
                    and morasses, whose margins yield crops of rice, mustard, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >til</hi> seed; while to the eastward of the town, a broad, alluvial,
                    well-cultivated plain reaches as far as the junction of the Dhaleswarí and
                    Lakshmiá rivers. The country lying to the south of the Dhaleswarí is the most
                    fertile part of the district. It consists entirely of rich alluvial soil,
                    annually inundated to a depth varying from 2 to 14 feet of water. The villages
                    are built on artificial mounds of earth, so as to raise them above the
                    floodlevel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> Dacca is watered by a network of rivers and
                    streams, ten of which are navigable throughout the year by native cargo boats of
                    four tons burthen. (1) The Meghná forms the eastern boundary of the district,
                    separating it from Tipperah. (2) The Ganges, or Padma river, marks the western
                    and south-western boundary, separating the district from Farídpur and Bákarganj.
                    This river, here from three to four miles in width, is liable to frequent and
                    extensive changes in its course; the old channel is now almost dry in the hot
                    months. (3) The Lakshmiá, a branch of the Brahmaputra, flows through the north
                    of the district and empties itself into the Dhaleswarí. (4) The Jamuná, or main
                    stream of the Brahmaputra, only touches on the north-western corner of the
                    district, where it joins the Ganges. (5) The Mendi-Khalí, a large branch of the
                    Meghná, communicates with the old Brahmaputra. (6) The Dhaleswarí, an offshoot
                    of the Jamuná, intersects the district from west to east, and falls into the
                    Meghná at Munshiganj. It has two large navigable branches, both of which reunite
                    with the parentstream, viz., (7) the Ghází-khálí and (8) the Burígangá.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The wild animals</hi> comprise a few tigers, leopards, and wild

                    The green monkey is very common; porpoises abound in the large rivers. Among
                    birds are vultures, crows, several varieties of eagles, fish eagles, kites,

                    feathers, principally in those of the kingfisher tribe. The common fishes are
                    the shark, ray, saw-fish, <hi rend="italic">anwári</hi> or mullet, <hi

                    Crocodiles are found in most of the large rivers. Among snakes are the cobra,

                    several varieties of tree and water snakes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Rice forms the staple product of the
                    district. It is divided into three great classes :— <hi rend="italic">boro,</hi>
                    or spring rice, sown from December to February, and reaped in April and May; <hi
                    rend="italic">áus,</hi> or autumn rice, sown from March to May, and reaped from
                    July to September; and <hi rend="italic">áman,</hi> or winter rice (the great
                    crop of the year), sown from March to May, and reaped in November and December.
                    Wheat and barley are cultivated to a small extent; pulses are largely grown;
                    also oilseeds, such as mustard, <hi rend="italic">til,</hi> and linseed. Cotton
                    was formerly a staple product, but since the decline of the fine Dacca muslins,
                    due to the introduction of Manchester goods, its cultivation has almost entirely
                    ceased. Jute cultivation has enormously extended of late years. The other crops
                    raised are indigo, sugar-cane, <hi rend="italic">pan</hi> or betel leaf,
                    cocoa-nut, turmeric, ginger, tobacco, and safflower. Of the area of the district
                    in 1870 (viz., 3217 square miles) 2245 are returned as cultivated, 24 as fallow
                    land, 672 as cultivable waste land, and 276 as uncultivable. No statistics exist
                    showing the cultivation of each kind of crop. But roughly speaking, it may be
                    said that in the rains three-fifths of the cultivated area is under rice,
                    one-fifth is fallow or uncultivated, and one-fifth under jute; and that in the
                    dry season, two-fifths is under oil seeds <pb break="no"

                    and one-fifth under other crops.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi> consist of weaving, embroidery, gold and
                    silver work, shell carving, and pottery. The weaving industry and the
                    manufacture of fine Dacca muslins have greatly fallen off, owing to the
                    competition of European piece goods. Forty different kinds of cloth were
                    formerly manufactured in this district, the bulk of which during many years was
                    made from English twist, country thread being used only for the finest muslins.
                    Those of the most delicate texture were known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab-rawdn,</hi> or “running water,” and <hi rend="italic">shabnam,</hi> or
                    “evening dew.” It is said that, in the time of the Emperor Jahangir, a piece of
                    <hi rend="italic">ab-rawdn</hi> muslin, 15 feet by 3, could be manufactured,
                    weighing only 5 <hi rend="italic">sikkas,</hi> or 900 grains, its value being
                    .£40. In 1840, the finest cloth that could be made of the above dimensions
                    weighed about 9 <hi rend="italic">sikkds,</hi> or 1600 grains, and was worth
                    £10. Since then the manufacture has still further decayed, and the finer kinds
                    are not now made at all except to order. The manufacture of indigo is largely
                    carried on with European capital. The great trading centres are NAraingauj and
                    Madanganj, at the confluence of the LakshmiA and Dhaleswari rivers, on opposite
                    banks. NArAinganj may be termed the port of Dacca, from which it is distant
                    about 9 miles by land, and 16 or 18 by water. It constitutes the great
                    south-eastern mart on the JamunA, and has regular steam communication with
                    Calcutta and the Assam districts. The general revenue of the district increased
                    from £86,926 in 1860-61 to £111,620 in 1870-71; and the civil expenditure in the
                    same period from £44,666 to £49,803. The land tax contributes about one-half of
                    the general revenue, and amounted in 1870-71 to £53,672. There are 8 magisterial
                    and 25 civil and revenue courts, besides 1 honorary magistrate’s court, situated
                    in the district. The regular police consists of a force of 430 officers and men,
                    besides a municipal and rural police. For educational purposes, there is a
                    Government college at Dacca city, together with 148 Government or aided schools,
                    attended in 1871 by a total of 7155 pupils, besides numerous unaided village
                    schools, for which no statistics exist.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diseases.—</hi> Cholera and small-pox occasionally visit the
                    district in an epidemic form. The principal endemic diseases are—intermittent
                    and remittent fever, elephantiasis, bronchocele, enlargement of the spleen,
                    dysentery and diarrhoea, rheumatism, catarrh, whooping cough, bronchitis,
                    ophthalmia, cutaneous diseases, and intestinal worms. C ittle disease is also
                    common. Five charitable dispensaries are maintained in the district, one of
                    which, the Mitford Hospital, is the largest institution of the kind in Bengal
                    out of Calcutta. There are also a lunatic asylum and an almshouse for indoor
                    paupers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The Bengal census of 1872 returned the
                    population of Dacca district at 1,852,993 persons (males, 905,775; females,
                    947,218), distributed over 2897 square miles, and residing in 5016 villages or
                    towns, and 290,593 houses. The population is thus classified according to
                    religion :—Hindus, 793,789, or 42'9 per cent.; Muhammadans, 1,050,131, or 56'7
                    per cent.; Buddhists, 4; Christians, 7844, or ‘4 percent.; “others,” 1225. The
                    proportion of males in the district population was 48’9 per cent. Six towns
                    contain a population of over 5000, viz. (1) Dacca city <hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.)</hi> population 69,212; (2) Manikganj, population: Hindus, 6381;

                    Hindus, 2030; Muhammadans, 3570; Christians, 37—total, 5645. The material
                    condition of the people particularly of the cultivating classes, has greatly
                    improved of late years owing to the increased prices of produce, and the
                    cultivation of more valuable crops.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dacca City,</hi> the principal place in the above district,
                    is situated on the left or north bank of the BurfgangA river, in 23° 43' 20" N.
                    lat. and 90° 26' 10" E. long. The city is bounded on the E. by a low alluvial
                    plain stretching to the LakshmiA river, and on the N. and N.W. by a tract of
                    jungle interspersed with Muhammadan cemeteries, deserted gardens, mosques, and
                    ruined houses. The streets, <hi rend="italic">bdzdrs,</hi> and lanes extend four
                    miles along the bank of the BurigangA, the breadth of the town being about 1|
                    miles. The <hi rend="italic">chauk,</hi> or market-place, lies at the west end,
                    near the river bank. It is a square of considerable dimensions, surrounded by
                    mosques and shops. The numerous streets which intersect the town are extremely
                    crooked; and only a few are wide enough for wheeled conveyances. In parts of the
                    city, inhabited by particular castes, such as the weavers’ and shellcutters’ <hi
                    rend="italic">bdzdrs,</hi> where building ground lets at a high rent, many
                    four-storied houses have a frontage of only 8 or 10 feet, while the side walls
                    run back to a distance of twenty yards. The opposite ends of these buildings are
                    roofed in; the middle part is left open, and constitutes a small court. The
                    ruins of the English factory, St Thomas’s church, and the houses of the European
                    residents lie along the banks of the river, and give the town a rather imposing
                    appearance when viewed from the south. In the Armeniau quarter are several large
                    brick houses, for the most part now falling into decay. Of the old fort erected
                    by NawAb IslAm KhAn, in the reign of the Emperor Jahangir, no vestige remains;
                    but the jail is built on a portion of its site. The principal Muhammadan public
                    buildings, erected by subsequent governors and now in ruins, are the Katra and
                    the LAl-bAgh Palace,—the former built by SultAn Muhammad ShujA in 1645, in front
                    of the <hi rend="italic">chauk,</hi> or market place. Its extensive front faced
                    the river, and had a lofty central gateway, flanked by smaller entrances, and by
                    two octagonal towers rising to some height above the body of the building. The
                    LAl-bAgh Palace was commenced by SultAn Muhammad Azim, the third son of the
                    Emperor Aurangzeb. It originally stood close to the BurigangA river; but the
                    channel has shifted its course, and there is now an intervening space covered
                    with trees between it and the river. The walls on the western side, and the
                    terrace aud battlement towards the river, are of a considerable height, and
                    present a commanding aspect from the w <hi rend="superscript"> y</hi> ater.
                    These outworks, with a few gateways, the audience hall, and the baths, were the
                    only parts of the building that survived in 1840. Since then, their dilapidation
                    has rapidly advanced; but even in ruin they show the extensive and magnificent
                    scale on which this princely residence was originally designed. It appears never
                    to have been completed; and when Tavernier visited Dacca, <hi rend="italic"

                    court The English factory was built about that year. The central part of the old
                    factory continued to be used as a court-house till the present century, but ow
                    ing to its ruinous state it was pulled down in 1829 or 1830; in 1840 the only
                    portion that remained was the outward wall. The French and Dutch factories were
                    taken possession of by the English in the years 1778 and 1781 respectively.</p>
                <p>The trade of Dacca, which formerly was considerable, has steadily declined since
                    the beginning of this century. In 1800 the population of the city was estimated
                    at 200,000, while a census in 1830 returned only 66,989 inhabitants. The city
                    still continued to decline, and in 1867 its population was estimated at 51,636
                    only. The rise, however, of the jute trade in late years, and increased prices
                    for country produce, have now begun to compensate for the loss of its cotton
                    manufactures. The census of 1872 showed that the population of the city had
                    increased to 69,212 souls (males, 37,395; females, 31,817) made up as

                    improvements are being carried out; and a wealthy Muhammadan gentleman lately
                    gave a donation of £5000 for the purpose of providing the city with a pure
                    water-supply, and in 1875 it was proposed to light the main thoroughfares with
                    gas. The principal local institutions are the Mitford Hospital and the Dacca

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Dacca first attained political importance
                    between 1608 and 1612. In order to check the depredations of Magh pirates from
                    Chittagong, and the rebellions of the Afghans, it was found necessary to remove
                    the seat of government of Bengal from RAjmahAl to Dacca, where the NawAb IslAm
                    KhAn erected a fort and increased the strength of the fleet and artillery, and
                    changed the name of the town to JahAngfrnagar. Subsequently, in 1704, the
                    capital of Bengal was removed to MurshidAbAd, and the government of Dacca and
                    the eastern districts made over to a deputy of the NawAb NAzim. During the time
                    of the Mughul government, the city was under the jurisdiction of a magistrate
                    <hi rend="italic">(J'aujddr)</hi> and six <hi rend="italic">amins,</hi> who,
                    with the police, were maintained by rent-free grants of land. The fleet
                    consisted of 700 war boats and state barges. Dacca was also a depdt for the
                    Mughul artillery in Eastern Bengal, and possessed a mint. On the establishment
                    of the British power the old officers and representatives of the native rulers
                    were pensioned, but the title of NawAb was continued in th family until 1845,
                    when it became extinct on the death of the last incumbent without heirs. The
                    only event of historical importance in late years was the mutiny of 1857, when
                    two companies of the 73rd Native Infantry, which were stationed in the town,
                    joined in the revolt, but were overpowered by a small European force and
                    dispersed. (w. w. H.)</p>
