                    which he displayed in his first speech gained him a very lofty reputation, which

                    leisure hours were Racine and Boileau, the latter of whom frequently mentions
                    him with high praise.</p>
                <p>In 1700 he was appointed procurator-general; and in this office, which he filled
                    for seventeen years, he gained the greatest popularity by his lenity in criminal
                    cases, and by his care of the public hospitals. In 1717 he was made chancellor
                    by the Regent Orleans; but it was only a year after that he was deprived of the
                    seals, and exiled to his estate, on account of his steady opposition to the
                    projects of the famous John Law, which had been adopted by the regent and his
                    ministers. In 1720, however, on the failure of these schemes, he was recalled;
                    and he contributed not a little, by the firmness and sagacity of his counsels,
                    to calm the public disturbance and repair the mischief which had been committed.
                    Law himself had acted as the messenger of his recall; and it is said that
                    D’Aguesseau’s consent to accept the seals from his hand greatly diminished his
                    popularity. But his reputation was much more severely shaken by his conduct in
                    connection with the bull “Unigenitus,” a measure which, with distinguished
                    bravery, he had himself opposed during the life of the late king. He allowed the
                    Great Council to assume the power of registration, which legally belonged to the
                    Parliament alone; and he assisted Dubois, the favourite of the regent, in his
                    endeavour to force the Parliament to register the bull, though he refused to
                    sanction the extreme measure of exiling the Parliament, which Dubois had
                    contemplated. Dislike of the Jansenists, and desire to put an end to the
                    religious controversies which were raging so bitterly, were probably the motives
                    which, in part at least, influenced D’Aguesseau; but the people unjustly
                    attributed his conduct to a base compliance with the favourite. He certainly
                    opposed Dubois in other matters; and when Dubois became chief minister,
                    D’Aguesseau was deprived of his office.</p>
                <p>He retired to his estate at Fresnes, where he passed five years, of which he
                    always spoke with delight. The Scriptures, which he read and compared in various
                    languages, and the jurisprudence of his own and other countries, formed the
                    subjects of his more serious studies; the rest of his time was devoted to
                    philosophy, literature, and gardening.</p>
                <p>From these occupations he was recalled to court, by the advice of Cardinal
                    Fleury, in 1727; but the seals were not restored to him till ten years later.
                    During these years he endeavoured to mediate in the disputes between the court
                    and the Parliament. When he was at last reinstated in office, he completely
                    withdrew from all political affairs, and devoted himself entirely to his duties
                    as chancellor, and to the achievement of those reforms which had long occupied
                    his thoughts. Besides some important enactments regarding donations, testaments,
                    and successions, he introduced various regulations for improving the forms of
                    procedure, for ascertaining the limits of jurisdictions, and for effecting a
                    greater uniformity in the execution of the laws throughout the several
                    provinces. These reforms constitute an epoch in the history of French
                    jurisprudence, and have placed the name of D’Aguesseau in the same rank with
                    those of L’Hopital and Lamoignon. As a magistrate also he was so conscientious
                    that Saint-Simon has complained that he spent too much time over the cases that
                    came before him.</p>
                <p>In 1750, when upwards of eighty-two years of age, D’Aguesseau retired from the
                    duties without giving up the rank of chancellor. He died on the 9th February of
                    the following year.</p>
                <p>The published writings of D’Aguesseau form a collection of thirteen volumes
                    quarto, of which the first was published at Paris in 1759, and the last in 1789.
                    The far greater part relates to matters connected with his profession, but they
                    also contain an elaborate treatise on money; several theological essays; a life
                    of his father, which is interesting from the account which it gives of his own
                    early education; and <hi rend="italic">Metaphysical Meditations,</hi> written to
