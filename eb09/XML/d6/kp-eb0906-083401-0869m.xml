                    (1423-1503), a grand master of the order of St John of Jerusalem, celebrated for
                    the zeal and ability with which he opposed the Turks, was born in 1423. He
                    belonged to a noble French family, and early devoted himself to the career of a
                    soldier; but his history is involved in obscurity till he entered the order of
                    which he was to become the head. Having distinguished himself greatly against
                    the pirates of the Levant, in 1458 he was chosen to conduct an embassy to
                    Charles VII., a duty which he performed with much success. He was after this
                    appointed to the most important offices in the order, and, finally, in 1476, was
                    by an almost unanimous vote elected grand-master. It was the period of the
                    conquests of Mahomet II., who, supreme in the East, now began to threaten
                    Europe. In December 1479 a large Turkish fleet, under Misach Palaeologus,
                    appeared in sight of Rhodes; a landing was effected, and a vigorous attack made
                    upon the city. But in July of the next year, being reinforced from Spain, the
                    knights forced the Mussulmans to retire. D’Aubusson had been dangerously wounded
                    in one of the numerous and severe fights which had taken place; but in a few
                    weeks he had so far recovered as to be able to address to the emperor of the
                    East an account of the siege, which raised his renown to the highest point
                    throughout Europe. Soon after, Mahomet II. died, leaving his kingdom to be
                    disputed between his sons Bajazet and Zizim. The latter, finding himself unable
                    to achieve success, sought the aid of D’Aubusson, who, in 1482, received him
                    with great display, but took advantage of his confidence to detain him a
                    prisoner. He was afterwards sent to France, and finally handed over to the Pope,
                    who rewarded D’Aubusson with a cardinal’s hat, and with the power of conferring
                    all benefices connected with the order without the sanction of the papacy, and
                    also suppressed the orders of St Sepulchre and St Lazarus, and bestowed their
                    wealth on the order of St John. For some years D’Aubusson devoted himself to
                    regulating the affairs of his order, so that it might retain the spirit of lofty
                    enthusiasm which originally animated it, and by which he was himself inspired,
                    and defending its interests from the bad faith of the Popes; but in 1501, being
                    appointed generalissimo of the Christian armies against the Turk, he sailed to
                    attack Mitylene. The forces he commanded, however, he found it impossible to
                    bring into agreement; and the expedition proved a failure. The measure to which
                    the rest of his life was mainly devoted was an attempt to expel Judaism from
                    Rhodes, by banishing the adult Jews and forcibly baptizing the children. He died
                    in the summer of 1503.</p>
