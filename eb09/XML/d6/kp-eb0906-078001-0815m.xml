                    in Halland, being the son of the incumbent. His mother was the daughter of a Dr
                    Auadn, to whom Queen Christina had offered, during her exile in Rome, a
                    cardinal’s hat if he joined the Romish Church. He was also nearly related to a
                    still more remarkable man, Rydelius, the philosophical bishop of Lund, and the
                    young Dalin was sent at a very early age to be instructed by him, Linnaeus being
                    one of his fellow-pupils. The quick instinct of Rydelius instantly perceived the
                    boy’s extraordinary genius, and he assisted its development in every possible
                    way. While studying deeply at Lund, Dalin had visited Stockholm in the year
                    1723, and in 1726 he proceeded thither for the purpose of entering one of the
                    public offices. Under the patronage of Baron Ralamb he rapidly rose to
                    preferment, and his skill and intelligence won him golden opinions. It was at
                    the age of twenty-four that he commenced his literary career by the publication
                    of a work that was entirely new at that time in Sweden, namely the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Argus,</hi> a weekly journal, founded on the model of Addison’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Spectator.</hi> For the two years 1733, 1734, Dalin issued his
                    brilliant paper; at the end of 1733 he had thought to give it over, but he was
                    forced to continue by the importunity of the public. It was not till 1736 that
                    the secret was known, and Dalin confessed that he had been the writer of <hi
                    rend="italic">Argus.</hi> His reputation thereupon became immense. His next work
                    was <hi rend="italic">Tankar omKritiker</hi> (Thoughts about Critics), the first
                    really aesthetic book brought out in Sweden. With the avowed purpose of
                    enlarging the horizon of his cultivation and tastes, Dalin set off, in company
                    with his pupil, Baron Ralamb’s son, on a tour through Germany and France, in
                    1739-40. On his return the shifting of political life at home caused him to
                    write his famous satiric allegories of <hi rend="italic">The Story of the
                    Horse</hi> and <hi rend="italic">April-Work,</hi> which were very popular, and
                    provoked countless imitations. He now set himself to work on the most
                    considerable of his writings, his didactic epos of <hi rend="italic">Svenska
                    ffriheten</hi> (Swedish Liberty), which first appeared in 1742. Hitherto Addison
                    and Pope had been his models; in this work he draws his inspiration from
                    Thomson, whose poem of <hi rend="italic">Liberty</hi> it emulated. In 1751 Dalin
                    received the honourable post of tutor to the crown prince, afterwards Gustavus
                    III., and gained the friendship of'the literary Crown Princess Louisa Ulrika.
                    His position at court gave rise to many personal inconveniences, and separated
                    him to a vexatious degree from the studies in which he had hitherto been
                    absorbed. He held the post of tutor to the crown prince until 1756, when he was
                    arrested on suspicion of having taken part in the attempted revolution of that
                    year, and tried for his life. He was acquitted, but was forbidden on any
                    pretence to show himself at court. This period of exile, which lasted until
                    1761, Dalin spent in the preparation of his great historical work. He had been
                    ennobled in 1751, and made privy counsellor in 1753; and now, in 1761, he once
                    more took his place at court. During his exile, however, his spirit and his
                    health had been broken; in a fit of panic he had destroyed some packets of his
                    best unpublished works, and this he constantly brooded over. On the 12th of
                    August 1763 he died at his house in Drottningholm. In the year 1767 his writings
                    in <hi rend="italic">belles lettres</hi> issued in six volumes, edited by
                    Bokman, his half-brother. Amid an enormous mass of occasional verses, anagrams,
                    epigrams, impromptus, and the like, his satires and serious poems were almost
                    buried. But some of these former, even, are found to be songs of remarkable
                    grace and delicacy, and many display a love of natural scenery and a knowledge
                    of its forms truly remarkable in that artificial age. His dramas also are of
                    interest, particularly his admirable comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Envious
                    Man;</hi> he also wrote a tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Brynhilda, or the
                    Unfortunate Love,</hi> and a pastoral in three scenes on King Adolphus
                    Frederick’s return from Finland. During the early part of his life he was
                    universally admitted to <hi rend="italic">facile princeps</hi> among the Swedish
                    poets of his time; in his later days the extravagant reputation of the poetess
                    Hedvig Nordenflycht somewhat eclipsed his glory. He possessed a singular mixture
                    of the literary qualities which we attribute severally to Pope, to Voltaire, and
                    to Thomson. As a prose writer, Dalin is chiefly memorable for his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Swedish Kingdom,,</hi> which proceeds to the end of
                    the reign of Charles IX.</p>
