                    family, but not one of the highest rank. His biographers have attempted on very
                    slight grounds to deduce his origin from the Frangipani, one of the oldest
                    senatorial families of Rome. We can affirm with greater certainty that he was
                    connected with the Elisei who took part in the building of Florence under
                    Charles the Great. Dante himself does not, with the exception of a few obscure
                    and scattered allusions, carry his ancestry beyond the warrior Cacciaguida, whom
                    he met in the sphere of Mars <hi rend="italic">(Par.</hi> xv. 87, foil.)
                    Cacciaguida there tells his descendant that he was born in the year 1106, that
                    he married an Aldighieri from the valley of the Po, that he had two brothers,
                    Moronte and Eliseo, and that he accompanied the Emperor Conrad III. upon his
                    crusade into the Holy Land, where he died among the infidels. From Eliseo was
                    descended the branch of the Elisei; from Aldighiero, son of Cacciaguida, the
                    branch of the Alighieri. Bellincione, son of Aldighiero, was the grandfather of
                    Dante. His father was a second Aldighiero, a lawyer of some reputation. By his
                    first wife, Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi, this Aldighiero had a son Francesco;
                    by his second, Donna Bella, whose family name is not known, Dante and a
                    daughter. Thus the family of Dante held a most respectable position among the
                    citizens of his beloved city; but had it been reckoned in the very first rank
                    they could not have remained in Florence after the defeat of the Guelfs at
                    Montaperti in 1260. It is clear, however, that Dante’s mother at least did so
                    remain, for Dante was born in Florence in 1265. The heads of the Guelf party did
                    not return till 1267.</p>
                <p>Dante was born under the sign of the twins, “the glorious stars pregnant with
                    virtue, to whom he owes his genius such as it is.” Astrologers considered this
                    constellation as favourable to literature and science, and Brunetto Latini, his
                    instructor, tells him in the <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi> (xv. 25, foil.)
                    that, if he follows its guidance, he cannot fail to reach the harbour of fame.
                    Boccaccio relates that before his birth his mother dreamed that she lay under a
                    very lofty laurel, growing in a green meadow, by a very clear fountain, when she
                    felt the pangs of childbirth,—that her child, feeding on the berries which fell
                    from the laurel, and on the waters of the fountain, in a very short time became
                    a shepherd, and attempted to reach the leaves of the laurel, the fruit of which
                    had nurtured him,—that, trying to obtain them he fell, and rose up, no longer a
                    man, but in the guise of a peacock. We know little of Dante’s boyhood except
                    that he was a hard student and a pupil of Brunetto Latini. Boccaccio tells us
                    that he became very familiar with Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Statius, and all
                    other famous poets; and that, “taken by the sweetness of knowing the truth of
                    the things concealed in heaven, and finding no other pleasure dearer to him in
                    life, he left all other worldly care and gave himself to this alone, and, that
                    no part of philosophy might remain unseen by him, he plunged with acute
                    intellect into the deepest recesses of theology, and so far succeeded in his
                    design that, caring nothing for heat or cold, or watchings or fastings, or any
                    other bodily discomforts, by assiduous study he came to know of the divine
                    essence and of the other separate intelligences all that the human intellect can
                    comprehend.” Leonardo Bruni says that “by study of philosophy, of theology,
                    astrology, arithmetic, and geometry, by reading of history, by the turning over
                    many curious books, watching and sweating in his studies, he acquired the
                    science which he was to adorn and explain in his verses.” Of his teacher
                    Brunetto Latini, of whom he speaks with the most loving <pb break="no"

                    does not hesitate to brand with infamy, Giovanni Viliam has left us a graphic
                    picture: He was a great philosopher, and a consummate master of rhetoric, not
                    only in knowing how to speak well, but how to write well. He it was who
                    explained the rhetoric of Tully and made the good and useful book called <hi
                    rend="italic">Tesoro,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tesoretto</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chiave del Tesoro,</hi> and other works in philosophy and of vices
                    and virtues, and he was secretary of our commune. He was a worldly man; but we
                    have made mention of him because he both began and directed the growth of the
                    Florentines, both in making them ready in speaking well and in knowing how to
                    guide and direct our republic according to the rules of politics.” Under this
                    guidance Dante became master of all the science of his age at a time when it was
                    not /impossible to know all that could be known. He was a skilful draughtsman,
                    and tells us that on the anniversary of the death of Beatrice he drew an angel
                    on a tablet. He was an intimate friend of Giotto, who has immortalized his
                    youthful lineaments in the chapel of the Bargello, and who is recorded to have
                    drawn from his friend’s inspiration the allegories of Virtue and Vice which
                    fringe the frescoes of the Scrovegni Chapel at Padua. Nor was he less sensible
                    to the delights of music. Milton had not a keener ear for the ’oud uplifted
                    angel trumpets and the immortal harps of golden wires of the cherubim and
                    seraphim; and our English poet was proud to compare his own friendship with
                    Henry Lawes with that between Dante and Casella, “met in the milder shades of
                    purgatory.” Most dear to him of all were the companions Cino di Pistoia, Lapo
                    Gianni, Guido Cavalcanti, and others, similarly gifted and dowered with like
                    tastes, who lived in the lively streets of the city of the flowers, and felt
                    with him the first warm flush of the coming renaissance. He has written no
                    sweeter or more melodious lines than those in which he expresses the wish that
                    he, with Guido and Lapo, might be wafted by enchantment over the sea wheresoever
                    they might list, shielded from fortune and evil times, and living in such
                    contentment that they should wish to live always, and that the good enchanter
                    should bring Monna Vanna and Monna Bice and that other lady into their barque,
                    where they should for ever discourse of love and be for ever happy. It is a
                    wonderful thing (says Leonardo Bruni) that, though he studied without
                    intermission, it would not have appeared to any one that he studied, from his
                    joyous mien and youthful conversation. Like Milton he was trained in the
                    strictest academical education which the age afforded; but Dante lived under a
                    warmer sun and brighter skies, and’ found in the rich variety and gaiety of his
                    early life a defence against the withering misfortunes of his later years.
                    Milton felt too early the chill breath of Puritanism, and the 3erious musing on
                    the experience of life, which saddened the verse of both poets, deepened in his
                    case into grave and desponding melancholy.</p>
                <p>We must now consider the political circumstances in which lay the activity of
                    Dante’s manhood. From 1115, the year of the death of Matilda countess of
                    Tuscany, to 1215, Florence enjoyed a nearly uninterrupted peace. Attached to the
                    Guelf party it remained undivided against itself. But in 1215 a private feud
                    between the families of Buondelmonte and Uberti introduced into the city the
                    horrors of civil war. Villani (lib. v. cap. 38) relates how Buondelmonte
                    de’Buondelmonti, a noble youth of Florence, being engaged to marry a lady of the
                    house of Amidei, allied himself instead to a Donati, and how Buondelmonte was
                    attacked and killed by the Amidei and Uberti at the foot of the Ponte Vecchio,
                    close by the pilaster which bears the image of Mars. “The death of Messer
                    Buondelmonte was the occasion and beginning of the accursed parties of Guelfs
                    and Ghibellines in Florence.” Of the seventy-two families then in Florence
                    thirty-nine became Guelf under the leadership of the Buondelmonte and the rest
                    Ghibelline under the Uberti. The strife of parties was for a while allayed by
                    the war against Pisa in 1222, and the constant struggles against Siena; but in
                    1248 Frederick II. sent into the city his natural son Frederick, prince of
                    Antioch, with 1600 German knights. The Guelfs were driven away from the town,
                    and took refuge, part in Montevarchi, part in Capraia. The Ghibellines, masters
                    of Florence, behaved with great severity, and destroyed the towers and palaces
                    of the Guelf nobles. At last the people became impatient. They rose in
                    rebellion, deposed the podestk, elected in his place a captain of the people,
                    established a more democratic constitution, and, encouraged by the death of
                    Frederick in December 1250, recalled the exiled Guelfs. Manfred, the bastard son
                    of Frederic, pursued the policy of his father. He stimulated the Ghibelline
                    Uberti to rebel against their position of subjection. A rising of the vanquished
                    party was put down by the people, in July 1258 the Ghibellines were expelled
                    from the town, and the towers of the Uberti razed to the ground. The exiles
                    betook themselves to the friendly city of Siena. Manfred seut them assistance.
                    The Florentines, after vainly demanding their surrender, despatched an army
                    against them. On September 4, 1260, was fought the great battle of Montaperti,
                    which dyed the Arbia red, and in which the Guelfs were entirely defeated. The
                    hand which held the banner of the republic was sundered by the sword of a
                    traitor. For the first time in the history of Florence the Caroccio was taken.
                    Florence lay at the mercy of her enemies. A parliament was held at Empoli, in
                    which the deputies of Siena, Pisa, Arezzo, and other Tuscan towns consulted on
                    the best means of securing their new war power. They voted that the accursed
                    Guelf city should be blotted out. But Farinata of the Uberti stood up in their
                    midst, bold and defiant as when he stood erect among the sepulchres of hell, and
                    said that if, from the whole number of the Florentines, he alone should remain,
                    he would not suffer, whilst he could wield a sword, that his country should be
                    destroyed, and that, if it were necessary to die a thousand times for her, a
                    thousand times would he be ready to encounter death. Help came to the Guelfs
                    from an unexpected quarter. Clement IV., elected Pope in 1265, offered the crown
                    of Apulia and Sicily to Charles of Anjou. The French prince, passing rapidly
                    through Lombardy, Romagna, and the Marches, reached Rome by way of Spoleto, was
                    crowned on January 6, 1266, and on February 23 defeated and killed Manfred at
                    Benevento. In such a storm of conflict did Dante first see the light. In 1267
                    the Guelfs were recalled, but instead of settling down in peace with their
                    opponents they summoned Charles of Anjou to vengeance and the Ghibellines were
                    driven out. The meteor passage of Conradin gave hope to the imperial party,
                    which was quenched when the head of the fair-haired boy fell on the scaffold at
                    Naples. Pope after Pope tried in vain to make peace. Gregory X. placed the
                    rebellious city under an interdict; Nicolas III. in 1280 patched up a hollow
                    truce. In 1282 the constitution of Florence received the final form which it
                    retained till the collapse of freedom. From the three <hi rend="italic">arti
                    maggiori</hi> were chosen six priors, in whose hands was placed the government
                    of the republic. They remained in office for two months, and during that time
                    lived and shared a common table in the Public Palace. We shall see what
                    influence this office had upon the fate of Dante. The success of the Sicilian
                    Vespers, the vacancy of the Holy See, the death of Charles of Anjou, roused
                    again the courage of the Ghibellines. They took possession of Arezzo, and
                    threatened to drive out the Guelfs from Tuscany. The historian Ammirato has left
                    us a lively <pb break="no"

                    year 1288, a prelude to the great battle of Campaldino in the following summer.
                    Then it was that Dante saw “horsemen moving camp and commencing the assault, and
                    holding muster, and the march of foragers, the shock of tournaments, and race of
                    jousts, now with trumpets and now with bells, with drums and castle signals,
                    with native things and foreign” (Zn/l xxii. 1, foil.) On June 11, 1289, at
                    Campaldino near Poppi, in the Casentino, the Ghibellines were utterly defeated.
                    They never again recovered their hold on Florence, but the violence of faction
                    survived under other names. Dante fought with distinction at Campaldino, was
                    present shortly afterwards at the battle of Caprona (Th/. xxi. 95, foil.), and
                    returned in September 1289 to his studies and his love. His peace yras of short
                    luration. On June 9, 1290, died Beatrice, whose mortal love had guided him for
                    thirteen years, and whose immortal spirit purified his later life, and revealed
                    to him the mysteries of Paradise.</p>
                <p>Dante had first met Beatrice Portinari at the house of her father Folco on
                    May-day 1274. In his own words, “already nine times after my birth the heaven of
                    light had returned as it were to the same point, when there appeared to my eyes
                    the glorious lady of my mind, who was by many called Beatrice who knew not what
                    to call her. She had already been so long in this life that already in its time
                    the starry heaven had moved towards the east the twelfth part of a degree, so
                    that she appeared to me about the beginning of her ninth year, and I saw her
                    about the end of my ninth year. Her dress on that day was of a most noble
                    colour, a subdued and goodly crimson, girdled and adorned in such sort as best
                    suited with her tender age. At that moment I saw most truly that the spirit of
                    life which hath its dwelling in the secretest chamber of the heart began to
                    tremble so violently that the least pulses of my body shook therewith; and in
                    trembling it said these words, ‘ Ecce deus fortior me qui veniens domin-abitur
                    mihi.’” In the <hi rend="italic">Vita Nuosa</hi> is written the story of his
                    passion from its commencement to within a year after the lady’s death. He saw
                    Beatrice only once or twice, and she probably knew little of him. She married
                    Simone de’ Bardi. But the worship of her lover was stronger for the remoteness
                    of its object. The last chapter of the <hi rend="italic">Vita Nuova</hi> relates
                    how, after the lapse of a year, “it was given me to behold a wonderful vision,
                    wherein I saw things which determined me that I would say nothing further of
                    this blessed one until such time as I could discourse more worthily concerning
                    her. And to this end I labour all I can, as she in truth knoweth. Therefore if
                    it be His pleasure through whom is the life of all things that my life continue
                    with me a few years, it is my hope that I shall yet write concerning her what
                    hath not before been written of any woman. After the which may it seem good unto
                    Him who is the master of grace that my spirit should go hence to behold the
                    glory of its lady, to wit, of that blessed Beatrice who now gloriously gazes on
                    the countenance of Him qui est per omnia saecula benedictus.” In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Convito</hi> he resumes the story of his life. “When I had lost
                    the first delight of my soul (that is, Beatrice) I remained so pierced with
                    sadness that no comforts availed me anything, yet after some time my mind,
                    desirous of health, sought to return to the method by which other disconsolate
                    ones had found consolation, and I set myself to read that little-known book of
                    Boetius in which he consoled himself when a prisoner and an exile. And hearing
                    that Tully had written another work, in which, treating of friendship, he had
                    given words of consolation to Laelius, I set myself to read that also.” He so
                    far recovered from the shock of his loss that in 1292 he married Gemma, daughter
                    of Manetto Donati, a connection of the celebrated Corso Donati, afterwards
                    Dante’s bitter foe. It is possible that she is the lady mentioned in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vita Nuova</hi> as sitting full of pity at her window and
                    comforting Dante for his sorrow. By this wife he had seven children, and
                    although he never mentions her in the <hi rend="italic">Divina Oommedia,</hi>
                    and although she did not accompany him into exile, there is no reason to suppose
                    that she was other than a good wife, or that the union was otherwise than happy.
                    Certain it is that he spares the memory of Corso in his great poem, and speaks
                    kindly of his kinsmen Piccarda and Forese.</p>
                <p>Dante now began to take an active part in politics. He was inscribed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">arte</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Medici</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Speziali,</hi> which made him eligible as one of the six <hi
                    rend="italic">priori</hi> to whom the government of the city was intrusted in
                    1282. Documents still existing in the archives of Florence show that he took
                    part in the deliberations of the several councils of the city in 1295, 1296,
                    1300, and 1301. Filelfo says that he served on fourteen embassies, a statement
                    not only unsupported by evidence, but impossible in itself. Filelfo does not
                    mention the only embassy in which we know for certain that Dante was engaged,
                    that to the town of San Gemignano in 1299. From June 15 to August 15, 1300, he
                    held the office of prior, which was the source of all the miseries of his life.
                    The spirit of faction had again broken out in Florence. The two rival families
                    were the Cerclti and the Donati,—the first of great wealth but recent origin,
                    the last of ancient ancestry but poor. A quarrel had arisen in Pistoia between
                    the two branches of the Cancellieri,—the Bianchi and Neri, the Whites and the
                    Blacks. The quarrel spread to Florence, the Donati took the side of the Blacks,
                    the Cerchi of the Whites. Pope Boniface was asked to mediate, and sent Cardinal
                    Matteo d’Acquasparta to maintain peace. He arrived just as Dante entered upon
                    his office as prior. The cardinal effected nothing, but Dante and his colzeagues
                    banished the heads of the rival parties in different directions to a distance
                    from the capital. The Blacks were sent to Cittk della Pieve in the Tuscan
                    mountains; the Whites, among whom was Dante’s dearest friend Guido Cavalcanti,
                    to Serrezzano in the unhealthy Maremma. After the expiration of Dante’s office
                    both parties returned, Guido Cavalcanti so ill with fever that he shortly
                    afterwards died. The Blacks sought for vengeance. The journey of Charles of
                    Valois to Rome gave them an opportunity. At a meeting held in the church of the
                    Holy Trinity the Whites were denounced as Ghibellines, enemies of France and of
                    the pope, and the French prince was invited to the town as peacemaker, to defend
                    the Guelfs against their machinations. The priori sent at the end of September
                    four ambassadors to the Pope, one of whom was Dante. He never again saw the
                    towers of his native city. Charles of Valois marched from Pavia and took up his
                    abode in the Oltr’ Arno, Corso Donati, who had been banished a second time,
                    returned in force and summoned the Blacks to arms. The prisons were broken open,
                    the podestk driven from the town, the Cerchi confined within their houses, a
                    third of the city was destroyed with fire and sword. By the help of Charles the
                    Blacks were victorious. They appointed Cante de’ Gabrielli of Gubbio as podestk,
                    a man devoted to their interests. More than 600 Whites were condemned to exile
                    and cast as beggars upon the world. On January 27, 1302, Dante with three others
                    was condemned to pay a fine of 5000 lire of small florins. If the money was not
                    paid within three days their property was to be destroyed and laid waste <hi
                    rend="italic">; if</hi> they did pay the fine they were to be exiled for two
                    years from Tuscany; in any case they were never again to hold office in the
                    republic. On March 10 Dante and fourteen others were condemned to be burned
                    alive if they should come into the power of the republic. _ Similar <pb

                    October 1315. The sentence was not formally reversed till 1494, under the
                    government of the Medici.</p>
                <p>Dante received the news of his banishment in Siena. The exiles met first at
                    Gargonza, a castle between Siena and Arezzo, and then at Arezzo itself. They
                    joined themselves to the Ghibellines, to which party the podest4 Uguccione della
                    Faggiuola belonged. The Ghibellines, however, were divided amongst themselves,
                    and the Green Ghibellines were not disposed to favour the cause of the White
                    Guelfs. They found a more sympathetic defender in Scarpetta degli Ordelafii at
                    Forli. From this place Dante probably went to Bartolommeo della Scala, lord of
                    Verona, where the country of the great Lombard gave him his first refuge and his
                    first hospitable reception. Can Grande, to whom he afterwards dedicated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Paradiso,</hi> was then a boy. Bartolommeo died in 1304, and it is
                    possible that Dante may have remained in Verona till his death. In September
                    1303 the fleur-de-lis had entered Anagni, and Christ had a second time been
                    buffeted in the person of his vicar. Boniface VIII. did not survive the insult
                    long, but died in the following month. He was succeeded by Benedict XI., who did
                    his best to give peace to his distracted country. Immediately after his
                    accession he sent the Cardinal da Prato to Florence, who arrived there in March
                    1304. The people received him with enthusiasm; ambassadors came to him from the
                    Whites; and he did his best to reconcile the two parties. But the Blacks
                    resisted all his efforts. He shook the dust from off his feet, and departed,
                    leaving the city under an interdict. Foiled by the calumnies and machinations of
                    the one party, the cardinal gave his countenance to the other. It happened that
                    Corso Donati and the heads of the Black party were absent at Pistoia. Da Prato
                    advised the Whites to attack Florence, deprived of its heads and impaired by
                    fire. An army was collected of 16,000 foot and 9000 horse. Communications were
                    opened with the Ghibellines of Bologna and Romagna. But the forces of the
                    exiles, badly led, reached the gates of the city only to find themselves
                    unsupported from within. They were driven to retreat, all hope of return became
                    impossible, and Dante felt for the first time the full bitterness of exile. It
                    was after the failure of this ill-conceived attempt that Dante’s wanderings
                    really began. Filled with contempt at the baseness and incapacity of his
                    fellowsufferers, he wished that, disdaining the support of their companionship,
                    he had stood alone, and made a party by himself. This, indeed, we must consider
                    Dante to have done, if we would understand the real nature of his Ghibellinism.
                    Dante had been born and bred a Guelf, and it was only under the pressure of
                    inevitable necessity that he and his friends allied themselves with the other
                    side. If we rise beyond the limits of mere local quarrels, we find in
                    Italianhistorytbat the Guelf party was generally speaking favourable to liberty.
                    The municipal privileges of the great Italian cities rose under the protection
                    of the Popes, while the emperors only crossed the Alps to crush their ancient
                    independence, and depress them beneath the yoke of some feudal representative.
                    The horse of Barbarossa trampled upon the ashes of Milan, whereas the
                    straw-built fortress of the Lombard league bore the name of Alexander. Had it
                    not breathed the air of freedom, the life of Florence could not have survived
                    the period of its infancy, stifled as it afterwards was by the preponderance of
                    the Medici. Dante could not have been indifferent or ungrateful to the cause
                    which had given to his beloved Italy all that made it valuable to the world. But
                    he saw that the conditions of the time were altered, and that other dangers
                    menaced the welfare of his country. There was no fear now that Florence, Siena,
                    Pisa, Arezzo should be razed to the ground in order that the castle of the lord
                    might overlook the humble cottages of his contented subjects; but there was
                    danger lest Italy should be torn in sunder by its own jealousies and passions,
                    and lest the fair domain bounded by the sea and the Alps should never properly
                    assert the force of its individuality, and should present a contemptible
                    contrast to a united France and a confederated Germany. Sick with petty quarrels
                    and dissensions Dante strained his eyes towards the hills for the appearance of
                    a deliverei; who should hush the jar of discord, discipline into effectiveness
                    the luxuriant forces of the peninsula, and, united in spiritual harmony with the
                    vicar of Christ, show for the first time to the world an example of a government
                    where the strongest force and the highest wisdom were interpenetrated by all
                    that God had given to the world of piety and justice.- In this sense and in no
                    other was Dante a Ghibelline. The vision was never realized—the hope was never
                    fulfilled. Not till our own day has Italy become united and the “greyhound of
                    deliverance” has chased from city to city the “wolf” of the papacy. But is it
                    possible to say that the dream did not work its own realization, or to deny that
                    the high ideal of the poet, after inspiring a long succession of minds as lofty
                    as his own, has become after five hundred years embodied in the constitution of
                    a state which acknowledges no stronger bond of union than a common worship of
                    the exile’s indignant and impassioned verse?</p>
                <p>It is very difficult to determine with exactness the order and the place of
                    Dante’s wanderings. Many cities and castles in Italy have claimed the honour of
                    giving him shelter, or of being for a time the home of his inspired muse. He
                    certainly spent some time with Count Guido Salvatico in the Casentino near the
                    sources of the Arno, probably in the castle of Porciano, and with Uguccione in
                    the castle of Faggiuola in the mountains of Urbino. After this he is said to
                    have visited the university of Bologna; and in August 1306 we find him at Padua.
                    Cardinal Napoleon Orsini, the legate of the French Pope Clement <hi
                    rend="italic">V.,</hi> had put Bologna under a ban, dissolved the university,
                    and driven the professors to the northern city. In May or June 1307 the same
                    cardinal collected the Whites at Arezzo and tried to induce the Florentines to
                    recall them. The name of Dante is found attached to a document signed by the
                    Whites in the church of St Gaudenzio in the Mugello. This euterprize came to
                    nothing. Dante retired to the castle of Moroello Della Spina in the Lunigiana,
                    where the marble ridges of the Apennines descend in precipitous slopes to the
                    Gulf of Spezzia. From this time till the arrival of the emperor Henry VII. in
                    Italy, October 1310, all is uncertain. His old enemy Corso Donati had at last
                    united himself with Uguccione della Faggiuola, the leader of the Ghibellines.
                    Dante thought it possible that this might lead to his return. But in 1308 Corso
                    was declared a traitor, attacked in his house, put to flight, and killed. Dante
                    lost his last hope. He left Tuscany, and went to Can Grande della Scala at
                    Verona. From this place we may believe that he visited the university of Paris,
                    studied in the Rue Fouarre, became acquainted with the Low Countries, and not
                    improbably crossed the Channel and went to Oxford, and saw where the heart of
                    Prince Harry was worshipped upon London Bridge. The election of Henry of
                    Luxembourg as emperor stirred again his hopes of a deliverer. He left Paris and
                    returned hastily to Italy. At the end of 1310, in a letter to the princes and
                    people of Italy, he proclaimed the coming of the saviour; at Milan he did
                    personal homage to his sovereign. The Florentines made every preparation to
                    resist the emperor. Dante wrote from the Casentino a letter dated March 31,
                    1311, in which he rebuked them for their stubbornness and obstinacy. Henry still
                    lingered in Lombardy at the siege of Cremona, when Dante, on April 16,1311, in a
                    celebrated epistle, upbraided his delay, argued that the crown of Italy <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n848/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0848-0813"/> was to be won on the Arno rather than on the Po,
                    and urged the tarrying emperor to hew the rebellious Florentines like Agag in
                    pieces before the Lord. Henry was as deaf to this exhortation as the Florentines
                    themselves. After reducing Lombardy he passed from Genoa to Pisa, and on June
                    29,1312, was crowned in Rome. Then at length he moved towards Tuscany by way of
                    Umbria. Leaving Cortona and Arezzo, he reached Florence on September 19. He did
                    not dare to attack it, but returned in November to Pisa. In the summer of the
                    following year he prepared to invade the kingdom of Naples; but in the
                    neighbourhood of Siena he caught a fever and died at the monastery of
                    Buonconvento, August 24,1313. The hopes of Dante and his party were buried in
                    his grave.</p>
                <p>After the death of the emperor Henry (Bruni tells us) Dante passed the rest of
                    his life in great poverty, sojourning in various places throughout Lombardy,
                    Tuscany, and the Romagna, under the protection of various lords, until at length
                    he retired to Ravenna, where he ended his life. Very little can be added to this
                    meagre story. There is reason for supposing that he stayed at Gubbio with Bosone
                    dei Rafaelli, and tradition assigns him a cell in the monastery of St Croce di
                    Fonte Avellana in the same district, situated on the slopes of Catria, one of
                    the highest of the Apennines. After the death of Pope Clement V. he addressed a
                    letter, dated July 14, 1314, to the cardinals in conclave, urging them to elect
                    an Italian Pope. About this time he came to Lucca, then lately conquered by his
                    friend Uguccione, completed the last cantos of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Purgatory,</hi> and became enamoured of the courteous Gentucca, whose name had
                    been whispered to him by her countryman on the slopes of the Mountain of
                    Purification. In August 1315 was fought the battle of Monte Catini, a day of
                    humiliation and mourning for the Guelfs. Uguccione made but little use of his
                    victory; and the Florentines marked their vengeance on his adviser by condemning
                    Dante yet once again to death if he ever should come into their power. In the
                    beginning of the following year Uguccione lost both his cities of Pisa and
                    Lucca. At this time Dante was offered an opportunity of returning to Florence.
                    The conditions given to the exiles were that they should pay a fine and walk in
                    the dress of humiliation to the church of St John, and there do penance for
                    their offences. Dante refused to tolerate this shame; and the letter is still
                    extant in which he declines to enter Florence except with honour, secure that
                    the means of life will not fail him, and that in any corner of the world he will
                    be able to gaze at the sun and the stars, and meditate on the sweetest truths of
                    philosophy. He preferred to take refuge with his most illustrious protector Can
                    Grande della Scala of Verona, then a young man of twenty-five, rich, liberal,
                    and the favoured head of the Ghibelline party. His name has been immortalized by
                    an eloquent panegyric in the seventeenth canto of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paradiso.</hi> Whilst at the court of Verona he maintained in the neighbouring
                    city of Mantua the philosophical thesis <hi rend="italic">De Aqua et Terra,</hi>
                    which is included in his minor works. The last two years of his life were spent
                    at Ravenna, under the protection of Guido da Polenta. In his service Dante
                    undertook an embassy to the Venetians. He failed in the object of his mission,
                    and, returning disheartened and broken in spirit through the unhealthy lagoons,
                    caught a fever and died in Ravenna, September 14, 1321. His bones still repose
                    there. His doom of exile has been reversed by the union of Italy, which has made
                    the city of his birth and the various cities of his wanderings component members
                    of a common country. His son Piero, who wrote a commentary on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Divina Commedia,</hi> settled in Verona. His daughter Beatrice
                    lived as a nun in Ravenna. His direct line became extinct in 1509; but the blood
                    still runs in the veins of the Marchesi Serego Alighieri, a noble family of the
                    city of the Scaligers.</p>
                <p>Dante may be said to have concentrated in himself the spirit of the middle age.
                    Whatever there was of piety, of philosophy, of poetry, of love of nature, and of
                    love of knowledge in those times is drawn to a focus in his writings. He is the
                    first great name in literature after the night of the dark ages. The Italian
                    language in all its purity and sweetness, in its aptitude for the tenderness of
                    love and the violence of passion, or the clearness of philosophical argument,
                    sprang fully grown and fully armed from his brain. The <hi rend="italic">Vita
                    Nuova</hi> is still the best introduction to the study of the Tuscan tongue; the
                    astronomy and science of the <hi rend="italic">Divine Comedy</hi> are obscure
                    only in a translation. Dante’s reputation has passed through many vicissitudes,
                    and much trouble has been spent by critics in comparing him with other poets of
                    established fame. Read and commonted upon in the Italian universities in the
                    generation immediately succeeding his death, his name became obscured as the sun
                    of the renaissance rose higher towards its meridian. In the 17th century he was
                    less read than Petrarch, Tasso, or Ariosto; in the 18th he was almost
                    universally neglected. His fame is now fully vindicated. Translations and
                    commentaries issue from every press in Europe and America. Dante societies are
                    formed to investigate the difficulties of his works. He occupies in the
                    lecture-rooms of regenerated Italy a place by the side of those great masters
                    whose humble disciple he avowed himself to be. The <hi rend="italic">Divine
                    Comedy</hi> is indeed as true an epic as the <hi rend="italic">jEneid,</hi> and
                    Dante is as real a classic as Virgil. His metre is as pliable and flexible to
                    every mood of emotion, his diction as plaintive and as sonorous. Like him he can
                    immortalize, by a simple expression, a person, a place, or a phase of nature.
                    Dante i3 even truer in description than Virgil, whether he paints the snow
                    falling in the Alps, or the homeward flight of birds, or the swelling of an
                    angry torrent. But under this gorgeous pageantry of poetry there lies a unity of
                    conception, a power of philosophic grasp, an earnestness of religion which to
                    the Roman poet were entirely unknown. Still more striking is the similarity
                    between Dante and Milton. This may be said to lie rather in the kindred nature
                    of their subjects, and in the parallel development of their minds, than in any
                    mere external resemblance. In both the man was greater than the poet, the souls
                    of both were “like a star and dwelt apart.” Both were academically trained in
                    the deepest studies of their age; the labour which made Dante lean made Milton
                    blind. The “Doricke sweetnesse” of the English poet is not absent from the
                    tender pages of the <hi rend="italic">Vita Nuova.</hi> The middle life of each
                    was spent in active controversy; each lent his services to the state; each felt
                    the quarrels of his age to be the “business of posterity,” and left his warnings
                    to ring in the ears of a later time. The lives of both were failures. “On evil
                    days though fallen and evil tongues,” they gathered the concentrated experience
                    of their lives into one immortal work, the quintessence of their hopes, their
                    knowledge, and their sufferings. But Dante is something more than this. Milton’s
                    voice is grown faint to us—we have passed into other modes of expression and of
                    thought. But if we had to select two names in literature who are still
                    exercising their full influence on mankind, and whose teaching is still
                    developing new sides to the coming generations, we should choose the names of
                    Dante and Goethe. Goethe preached a new gospel to the world, the pagan virtue of
                    self-culture, a sympathy which almost passed into indifference. There is no
                    department of modern literature or thought which does not bear upon it the
                    traces of the sage of Weimar. But if we rebel against this teaching, and yearn
                    once more for the ardour of belief, the fervour of. selfsacrifice, the scorn of
                    scorn and the hate of hate which is <pb break="no"

                    shall we find them but in the pages of the Florentine? The religion of the
                    future, if it be founded on faith, will demand that faith be reconciled with all
                    that the mind can apprehend of knowledge or the heart experience of emotion. The
                    saint of those days will be trained, not so much on ascetie counsels of
                    Imitation, or in Thoughts which base man’s greatness on the consciousness of his
                    fall, as on the verse of the poet, theologian, and philosopher, who stands with
                    equal right in the conclave of the doctors and on the slopes of Parnassus, and
                    in whom the ardour of study is one with the love of Beatrice, and both are made
                    subservient to lift the soul from the abyss of hell, along the terraces of
                    purgatory, to the spheres of paradise, till it gazes on the ineffable revelation
                    of the existence of God himself, which can only be apprehended by the eye of
                    faith.</p>
                <p>It only remains now to give a short account of Dante’s separate works. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Vita Nuova,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Young Life</hi> of Dante,
                    contains the history of his love for Beatrice. Like the <hi rend="italic">In
                    Memoriam</hi> of our own poet it follows all the varying phases of a deep and
                    overmastering passion from its commencement to its close. He describes how he
                    met Beatrice as a child, himself a child, how he often sought her glance, how
                    she once greeted him in the street, how he feigned a false love to hide his true
                    love, how he felt ill and saw in a dream the death and transfiguration of his
                    beloved, how she died, and how his health failed from sorrow, how the tender
                    compassion of another lady nearly won his heart from its first affection, how
                    Beatrice appeared to him in a vision and reclaimed his heart, and how at last he
                    saw a vision which induced him to devote himself to study that he might be more
                    fit to glorify her who gazes on the face of God for ever. This simple story is
                    interspersed with sonnetti, ballate, and canzoni, chiefly written at the time to
                    emphasize some mood of his changing passion. After each of these, in nearly
                    every case, follows an explanation in prose, which is intended to make the
                    thought and argument intelligible to those to whom the language of poetry was
                    not familiar. The book was probably completed in 1307. It was first printed by
                    Sermartelli in Florence, 1576. The latest and best edition is that by Witte,
                    published by Brockhaus, Leipsic, 1876.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Convito,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Banquet,</hi> is the
                    work of Dante’s manhood, as the <hi rend="italic">Vita Nuova</hi> is the work of
                    his youth. It consists, in the form in which it has come down to us, of an
                    introduction and three treatises, each forming an elaborate commentary in a long
                    canzone. It was intended, if completed, to have comprised commentaries on eleven
                    more canzoni, making fourteen in all, and in this shape would have formed a <hi
                    rend="italic">tesoro</hi> or hand-book of universal knowledge, such as Brunetto
                    Latini and others have left to us. It is perhaps the least well known of Dante’s
                    Italian works, but crabbed and unattractive as it is in many parts, it is well
                    worth reading, and contains many passages of great beauty and elevation. Indeed
                    a knowledge of it is quite indispensable to the full understanding of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Divina Commedia.</hi> The time of its composition is uncertain.
                    Dante mentions princes as living who died in 1309; he does not mention Henry
                    VII. as emperor, who succeeded in 1310. There are some passages which seem to
                    have been inserted at a later date. The canzoni upon which the commentary is
                    written were clearly composed between 1292 and 1300, when he sought in
                    philosophy consolation for the loss of Beatrice. The present text is very
                    defective. The <hi rend="italic">Convito</hi> was first printed in Florence by
                    Buonaccorsi in 1490.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rime di Dante.—</hi> Besides the smaller poems contained in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vita Nuova</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Convito</hi> there are a
                    considerable number of canzoni, ballate, and sonnetti bearing the poet’s name.
                    Of these many undoubtedly are genuine, others as undoubtedly spurious. Some
                    which have been preserved under the name of Dante belong to Dante de Maiano, a
                    poet of a harsher style; others which bear the name of Aldighiero are referable
                    to Dante’s sons Jacopo or Pietro, or to his grandsons; others may be ascribed to
                    Dante’s contemporaries and predecessors Cino da Pistoia and others. Those which
                    are genuine secure Dante a place among lyrical poets scarcely if at all inferior
                    to that of Petrarch. The best edition of the <hi rend="italic">Canzoniere</hi>
                    of Dante is that by Fraticelli published by Barbara at Florence. His collection
                    includes seventy-eight genuine poems, eight doubtful and fifty-four spurious. To
                    these are added an Italian paraphrase of the seven penitential psalms in <hi
                    rend="italic">terza rima,</hi> and a similar paraphrase of the Credo, the seven
                    sacraments, the ten commandments, the Lord’s Prayer, and the Ave Maria.</p>
                <p>The Latin treatise <hi rend="italic">De Monarchia,</hi> in three books, contains
                    the creed of Dante’s Ghibellinism. In it he propounds the theory that the
                    supremacy of the emperor is derived from the supremacy of the Roman people over
                    the world, which was given to them direct from God. As the emperor is intended
                    to assure their earthly happiness, so does their spiritual welfare depend upon
                    the Pope, to whom the emperor is to do honour as to the first-born of the
                    Father. The date of its composition is almost universally admitted to be the
                    time of the descent of Henry VII. into Italy, between 1310 and 1313, although
                    attempts have been made to assign it to a much earlier period. The book was
                    first printed by Oporinus at Basel in 1559.</p>
                <p>The treatise <hi rend="italic">De Vulgari Eloquio,</hi> in two books, also in
                    Latin, is mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Convito.</hi> Its object was first
                    to establish the Italian language as a literary tongue, and to distinguish
                    between the noble speech which might become the property of the whole nation, at
                    once a bond of internal unity and a line of demarcation against external
                    nations; and secondly, to lay down rules for poetical composition in the
                    language so established. The work was probably intended to be in four books, but
                    only two are extant. The first of these deals with the language, the second with
                    the style and with the composition of the canzone. The third was probably
                    intended to continue this subject, and the fourth was destined to the laws of
                    the ballata and sonnetto. This work was first published in the Italian
                    translation of Trissino at Vicenza in 1529. The original Latin was not published
                    till 1729 at Verona. The modern editions both of this work and of the <hi
                    rend="italic">De Monarchia</hi> by Fraticelli are very admirable. The work was
                    probably left unfinished in consequence of Dante’s death.</p>
                <p>Boccaccio mentions in his life of Dante that he wrote two eclogues in Latin in
                    answer to Johannes de Virgilio, who invited him to come from Ravenna to Bologna
                    and compose a great work in the Latin language. The most interesting passage in
                    the work is that in the first poem, where he expresses his hope that when he has
                    finished the three parts of his great poem his grey hairs may be crowned with
                    laurel on the banks of the Arno. Although the Latin of these poems is superior
                    to that of his prose works, we may feel thankful that Dante composed the great
                    work of hi3 life in his own vernacular These eclogues have also been printed
                    with notes by Fraticelli.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> of Dante are among the most important
                    materials for his biography. Giovanni Villani mentions three as specially
                    remarkable—one to the Government of Florence, in which he complains of
                    undeserved exile another to the Emperor Henry VII., when he lingered too long at
                    the siege of Brescia; and a third to the Italian cardinals to urge them to the
                    election of an Italian Pope after the death of Clement V. The first of these
                    letters has not come down to us, the two last are extant. Besides these we have
                    one addressed to the Cardinal da Prato, one to a <pb break="no"

                    the rejection of the emperor, and a long letter to Can Grande della Scala,
                    containing directions for interpreting the <hi rend="italic">Divina

                    Of less importance are the letters to the nephews of Count Alessandro da Romena,
                    to the Marquis Moroello Malaspina, to Cino da Pistoia, and to Guido da Polenta.
                    There are many other letters mentioned by early biographers which may yet. be
                    lying hidden in Italian archives.</p>
                <p>A treatise <hi rend="italic">De Aqua et Terra</hi> has come down to us, which
                    Dante tells us was delivered at Mantua in January 1320 (perhaps 1321) as a
                    solution of the question which was being at that time much discussed—whether on
                    any place in the earth’s surface water is higher than the earth. There is no
                    doubt about its genuineness, and it affords us a valuable insight into Dante’s
                    studies and modes of thought.</p>
                <p>We have reserved all mention of the <hi rend="italic">Divina Commedia</hi> till
                    the last. It would be useless in this place to attempt any account of the
                    contents and scope of this wonderful poem. Those who would learn what it is
                    without studying the poem itself could have no better guide than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shadow of Dante</hi> by Maria Rossetti. It will be enough here to
                    say a few words about the date of its composition. The time of the action is
                    strictly confined to the end of March and the beginning of April 1300. It is not
                    improbable that it was commenced shortly after this date. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Inferno,</hi> xix. 79, there is an allusion to the death of Pope
                    Clement V., an event which occurred in 1314. This probably marks the date of the
                    completion of this cantica. The <hi rend="italic">Purgatorio</hi> was completed
                    before 1318, as we learn from the Latin poem addressed to Johannes de Virgilio,
                    which speaks of the <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Purgatorio</hi> as completed, the <hi rend="italic">Paradiso</hi> as yet to be
                    written. The date of the poem is 1318. The last cantos of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paradiso</hi> were probably not finished until just before the poet’s
                    death.</p>
                <p>A complete <hi rend="italic">bibliography</hi> of Dante literature would require
                    an article to itself. Of the many separate works on this subject perhaps the
                    most complete is that in the fourth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Manuele

                    Brockhaus at Leipsic, of which only two volumes have as yet appeared, promises
                    to supersede all others. Grave doubts have of late years been thrown on the
                    authenticity of the chronicle of Dino Compagni, which has hitherto been regarded
                    as one of the chief authorities for the life of Dante. A summing up of the
                    evidence by W. Bernhardi, who concludes against the genuineness of the book, is
                    to be found in Von Sybel’s <hi rend="italic">Historische Zeitschrift,</hi> the
                    first number for 1877. A more copious bibliography of Dante literature is
                    subjoined, taken mainly from Scartazzini’s German work.</p>
