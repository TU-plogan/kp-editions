                    entered Winchester School, and in 1810 he was elected to a demyship at Magdalen
                    College, Oxford. The lectures of Dr Kidd at that university first awakened in
                    him a desire for the cultivation of natural science. In 1814 he graduated with
                    second class honours, and in the next year he obtained the prize for the Latin
                    essay. From 1815 to 1818 he studied medicine in London and Edinburgh; and in the
                    latter city he attended the lectures of Professor Jameson on natural science. At
                    that time the rival theories of the Huttonians and Wernerians were occupying the
                    attention of geologists. In 1819 Daubeny, in the course of a tour through
                    France, made the volcanic district of Auvergne a special study. By subsequent
                    journeys in Hungary, Transylvania, Italy, Sicily, France, and Germany he
                    extended his knowledge of volcanic phenomena; and in 1826 the results of his
                    observations were given in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">A Description of
                    Active and Extinct Volcanoes,</hi> a second edition of which was printed in
                    1848. An earlier treatise was <hi rend="italic">An Essay on the Geology and
                    Chemical Phenomena of Volcanoes,</hi> published at Oxford in 1824. Daubeny, in
                    common with Gay-Lussac and Davy, held subterraneous thermic disturbances to be
                    probably due to the contact of water with metals of the alkalies and alkaline
                    earths. In November 1822 Daubeny succeeded Dr Kidd as professor of chemistry at
                    Oxford, and twelve years later he was appointed to the chair of botany there. At
                    the Oxford Botanic Garden he conducted numerous experiments upon the effect of
                    changes in soil, light, and the composition of the atmosphere upon vegetation.
                    In 1830 he published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> a
                    paper on the iodine and bromine of mineral waters. In the following year
                    appeared his <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Atomic-Theory,</hi> which was
                    succeeded by a supplement in 1840j and in 1850 by a second edition. In 1831
                    Daubeny represented the universities of England at the first meeting of the
                    British Association, which at his request held their next session at Oxford. In
                    1836 he communicated to the Association a report on the subject of mineral and
                    thermal waters. In 1837 he visited the United States, and acquired there the
                    materials for papers on the thermal springs and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n868/mode/1up"

                    the Ashmolean Society and the British Association. In 1856 he became president
                    of the latter body at its meeting at Cheltenham. In 1841 Daubeny published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Agriculture;</hi> in 1857 his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lectures on Roman Husbandry;</hi> and in 1865 an <hi rend="italic">Essay on the
                    Trees and Shrubs of the Ancients,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the
                    Trees and Shrubs indigenous to Greece and Italy.</hi> His last literary work was
                    the collection of his miscellaneous essays, published in two volumes, in 1867.
                    In all his undertakings Daubeny was actuated by a practical spirit and a desire
                    for the advancement of knowledge; and his personal influence on his
                    contemporaries was in keeping with the high character of his various literary
                    productions.</p>
