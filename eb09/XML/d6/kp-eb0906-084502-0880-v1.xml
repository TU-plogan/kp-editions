                    (1778-1829), the eminent natural philosopher, was born on the 17th of December
                    1778, at Penzance, in Cornwall. After receiving there the rudiments of his
                    education, he was in 1792 sent for a year to the grammar school of Truro, then
                    under the direction of the Rev. Dr Cardew. There is little to record of Davy in
                    early life except his retentive memory, facility in versification, and skill in
                    story-telling. At the age of nine he went to live with Mr John Tonkin, who had
                    formerly adopted Davy’s mother and her sisters. In 1794 Davy lost his father,
                    and in the following year he was apprenticed to Mr Borlase, then a
                    surgeon-apothecary, and afterwards a physician in Penzance. During his
                    apprenticeship he spent much of his leisure in a systematic course of
                    self-education. While yet young he had exhibited an inclination for devising
                    experiments, and for examining natural products. At the end of 1797, when in his
                    nineteenth year, he turned his attention to chemistry, and read Lavoisier’s and
                    Nicholson’s treatises on that subject. His experiments were conducted in the
                    garret of his friend Mr Tonkin, who, alarmed by unexpected explosions would
                    exclaim, “This boy Humphry is incorrigible! ”—“Was there ever so idle a dog!
                    ”—“He will blow us all into the air !” One of his investigations at this time
                    was the nature of the air contained in the vesicles of sea-weed. To supply the
                    place of an air-pump in his experiments he had an old French injecting syringe,
                    and this he actually employed in his first scientific paper “On the Nature of
                    Heat and Light,” published in 1799. Though Davy’s natural talents would not have
                    permitted him to remain long in obscurity, he was in some degree indebted for an
                    early emergence into publicity to the accidental notice of Mr Davies Giddy
                    Gilbert, who, learning that the strange-looking boy, whom he observed hanging
                    over the hatch of Mr Borlase’s house, was a son of Davy the carver, and fond of
                    making chemical experiments, sought his acquaintance, and was ever afterwards
                    his steady friend. Another early friend of Davy’s was Mr Gregory Watt, who,
                    having visited Penzance in 1797 for change of air, took lodgings at the house of
                    Mrs Davy. By him and Gilbert he was introduced to the notice of Dr Beddoes, who
                    in the autumn of 1798 engaged him to superintend a pneumatic medical
                    institution, which he had just established at Bristol. Davy was now placed in a
                    sphere where his genius could expand; he was associated with men of education
                    and scientific attainments, and was provided with excellent apparatus; thus he
                    speedily entered upon that career of discovery which has rendered his name
                    illustrious. He had intended, after the termination of his engagement with Dr
                    Beddoes, to study medicine at Edinburgh, but the all-engrossing interest of his
                    chemical discoveries caused him eventually to abandon this scheme.</p>
                <p>In an essay “On Heat, Light, and Respiration,” written before he left Cornwall,
                    but published soon after his removal to Bristol, in Beddoes’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >West Country Contributions,</hi> Davy endeavoured to prove the
                    immateriality of heat, by showing its generation through the friction of two
                    pieces of ice under an exhausted receiver. His first scientific discovery was
                    that of the existence of silica in the epidermis of the stems of reeds, corn,
                    and grasses. The intoxicating effects of nitrous oxide when respired were
                    discovered by him on April 9, 1799; and in the following <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0881-0846"/> year he published a volume entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Researches, Chemical and Philosophical, chiefly concerning
                        Nitrous Oxide and its Respiration.</hi> Whilst the impression created by
                    this publication was still fresh on the public mind, Davy was recommended to
                    Count Rumford by Mr Underwood and Dr Hope as a suitable person to succeed Dr
                    Garnet as lecturer on chemistry at the Royal Institution recently established in
                    London; and accordingly, on February 16, 1801, he was chosen assistant lecturer
                    to the Institution, and director of the laboratory; his appointment to the
                    lectureship took place six weeks later. A minute on the records of the Royal
                    Institution shows that he was appointed professor of chemistry on the 31st of
                    May 1802.</p>
                <p>The ungainly exterior and peculiar manner of Davy on his first appearance in
                    London prejudiced Rumford and others against him; when, however, he began to
                    lecture, he won the approbation of all. His ingenuity and happy facility of
                    illustration gained him a high reputation; his company was courted by the
                    choicest society of the metropolis; and soon his presence was regarded as
                    indispensable in the soirees of the fashionable world. His style of lecturing
                    was well adapted to command attention—it was animated, clear, and impressive,
                    notwithstanding the naturally inharmonious tones of his voice; his experiments,
                    moreover, were both ingeniously conceived and neatly executed. The young chemist
                    was fortunate in the time in which he commenced his metropolitan career.
                    Experimental chemistry was beginning to be the fashion of the day; and the
                    discovery of the decomposition of chemical substances by voltaic electricity had
                    excited the greatest interest amongst the votaries of science. The liberality of
                    the committee of the Royal Institution supplied to Davy what few private
                    individuals could afford—a battery of 400 five-inch plates, and one of 40 plates
                    a foot in diameter. With these were conducted the brilliant investigations which
                    resulted in his discovery of potassium and sodium.</p>
                <p>The earliest of Davy’s communications to the Royal Society, and the first of his
                    contributions to electro-chemistry, was “An Account of some Galvanic
                    Combinations formed by an arrangement of <hi rend="italic">single</hi> Metallic
                    Plates and Fluids,” read in June 1801. In all hitherto constructed piles, plates
                    of two metals, or one plate of metal and another of charcoal, and some
                    interposed fluid had been employed. Davy showed in this paper that a battery
                    might be constructed of a single metal and two fluids, provided one of the
                    fluids was capable of causing oxidation on one of the surfaces of the metal. In
                    addition to the duties of his situation in the Royal Institution, to which those
                    of joint editor of the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> had been added, Davy for
                    ten successive years gave courses of lectures for the Board of Agriculture on
                    the connection between agriculture and chemistry. In 1803 he was admitted a
                    member of the Royal Society, of which he, in January 1807, became the secretary.
                    The most valuable of all his scientific writings are his communications to the
                    Royal Society, scarcely one of which does not announce some new and important
                    fact, or elucidate some principle of experimental philosophy. In February 1803
                    he read to the society an essay “On Astringent Vegetables, and their Operation
                    in Tanning and in 1805 ' ‘ An Account of some Analytic Experiments on
                    Wavellite,” and a paper “On the Method of Analyzing Stones containing a Fixed
                    Alkali, by Boracic Acid.” This method is founded on the strong affinity of that
                    acid for different substances at a high temperature, and on the ease with which
                    borates are decomposed by mineral acids.</p>
                <p>In his first Bakerian lecture, delivered to the Royal Society in November 1806,
                    Davy showed that electro-chemical phenomena were explicable by one general law,
                    and illustrated his theory of voltaic action by numerous happily-devised
                    experiments. After pointing out that in all voltaic decompositions acids
                    appeared at the positive and bases at the negative pole, he generalized bis
                    results by stating that hydrogen, the alkalies, earths, metals, and certain
                    oxides are attracted by negatively electrified and repelled by positively
                    electrified metallic surfaces, and that oxygen and acids are attracted by
                    positively and repelled by negatively electrified metallic surfaces. He then
                    proceeded to investigate the law of electro-chemical action, and concluded that
                    electro-chemical combinations and decompositions are referable to the law of
                    electric attractions and repulsions, and that both “chemical and electrical
                    attractions are produced by the same cause, acting in the one case on the
                    particles, in the other on the masses.” For these researches the French
                    Institute awarded him the prize of 3000 francs offered by the first consul for
                    the experiment most conducive to the progress of science. Davy’s discovery of
                    the production of potassium and sodium by the electrical decomposition of their
                    alkalies was made in October 1807, and an account of the new metals was given to
                    the Royal Society on the 19th of November in the second Bakerian lecture. On the
                    23d of that month a severe fever attacked him, and he was unable to resume his
                    professorial duties at the Royal Institution till March 12, 1808. In the
                    meanwhile barium and calcium, the existence of which had been predicted by Davy,
                    were discovered by Berzelius and Pontin. In 1808 Davy announced to the Royal
                    Society his discovery of magnesium and strontium. Alumina, silica, and zirconia
                    he was unable to decompose, but he showed it to be highly probable that they
                    contained metallic bases. Various opinions as to the nature of the new metals of
                    the alkalies and alkaline earths were at first entertained, some chemists
                    considering them to be compounds of hydrogen with unknown bases. In the third
                    Bakerian lecture, read in December 1808, and its appendix of next spring, Davy
                    adduced conclusive evidence of the elementary nature of potassium; he discussed
                    also the nature of sulphur, phosphorus, and carbon, and described the
                    preparation of boron, which he then regarded as a metal. The original galvanic
                    batteries used by Davy having become unserviceable through wear, a liberal
                    voluntary subscription among the members of the Royal Institution, in July 1808,
                    put him in possession of a battery of 2000 double plates, with a surface equal
                    to 128,000 square inches. His electro-chemical discoveries had, however, all
                    been made before this new power was provided. The fourth Bakerian lecture, read
                    in November 1809, brings forward proofs that oxymuriatic acid, contrary to
                    Davy’s previous supposition, is a simple body, termed by him chlorine (see vol.
                    v. p. 678), and that muriatic acid is a compound of that element and
                    hydrogen.</p>
                <p>Davy’s reputation had now reached its zenith; and his audience in the theatre of
                    the Royal Institution numbered little less than 1000. At the invitation of the
                    Dublin Society he gave, in November 1810, a’ course of lectures on
                    electro-chemical science, and in the following year other courses on the
                    elements of chemical philosophy and on geology. For the first of these he
                    received £525, and for the two latter £750; and before he left Dublin, Trinity
                    College conferred upon him the degree of LL.D. On the 8th April 1812 Davy was
                    knighted by the Prince Regent; on the next day he gave his farewell lecture at
                    the Royal Institution; and on the 11th he married Mrs Appreece, daughter and
                    heiress of Charles Kerr of Kelso, with whom he had a considerable fortune. His
                    usual employments were in great measure suspended during the winter of 1812 in
                    consequence of an injury to an eye, resulting from an explosion of chloride of
                    nitrogen, which he had begun to experiment upon after receiving intelligence of
                    its discovery by Dulong. The first and, as it proved, the only volume of Davy’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Elements of Chemical Philosophy</hi><pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n882/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0882-0847"/> appeared in 1812; and in 1813 he published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Agricultural Chemistry,</hi> the substance of
                    his lectures delivered to the Board of Agriculture.</p>
                <p>Having obtained from the French emperor permission to travel in France, Davy, on
                    October 13, 1813, went thither with his wife and Faraday, the latter in the
                    capacity of “assistant in experiments and writing.” Faraday had been engaged on
                    the 1st of March previous to help Davy in the laboratory of the Royal
                    Institution. On the 29th of October, after a detention of six or seven days at
                    Morlaix, Davy arrived in Paris, where he stayed two months, and began the course
                    of investigations on iodine which enabled him to prove its elementary character.
                    This body had hitherto been regarded as a compound by the French chemists. On
                    the 13th of December Davy was elected a corresponding member of the first class
                    of the Imperial Institute at Paris. From Paris he proceeded, in the end of
                    December, to Montpellier, and thence to Italy. At Genoa and Florence he
                    continued his experiments on iodine; and at the latter place he effected the
                    combustion of the diamond by means of the great lens in the cabinet of natural
                    history, and discovered that, when once ignited, it will continue to burn in
                    pure oxygen. He next proceeded by Rome to Naples, where he collected specimens
                    of the colours used by the ancients in their pictures, which formed the subject
                    of a memoir presented to the Royal Society. After spending the winter in Italy,
                    he returned to London on April 23, 1815.</p>
                <p>The year 1815 is memorable in the history of Davy, as that in which he turned his
                    attention to the frequent occurrence of accidents from explosions of fire-damp
                    in coalmines. At his request specimens of the gas were sent from Newcastle to
                    London for him to examine. He ascertained that it would not explode when mixed
                    with less than six or more than fourteen times its volume of air, with
                    one-seventh its volume of carbonic acid gas, or with one-sixth its volume of
                    nitrogen; that in tubes one-seventh of an inchin diameter explosive mixturesof
                    air and fire-damp could not be fired; and that metallic tubes prevented
                    explosions better than glass tubes. On November 9, 1815, Davy made known to the
                    Royal Society these results of his experiments; and before the close of the year
                    he had completed the invention of what has since been known as the Davy
                    safetylamp (see p. 72 of the present volume). In this a cage of wire-gauze, by
                    its cooling action, prevents the flame from igniting an explosive atmosphere
                    exterior to the lamp, even though the flame reach as far as the gauze. Of this
                    invaluable aid to the miner the coal-owners of Newcastle and its vicinity were
                    not slow in availing themselves; and on the 11th of October 1817 they testified
                    their appreciation of the boon disinterestedly conferred upon them by Davy, who
                    had taken out no patent for his invention, by presenting him with a suitably
                    inscribed service of plate. In the succeeding year Davy was created a baronet.
                    For his various communications to the Royal Society on the subject of fire-damp,
                    and on the nature of flame, in 1815, 1816, and 1817, he received the Rumford
                    medals.</p>
                <p>In 1818 and 1819 he produced four memoirs, “On the Fallacy of the Experiments in
                    which Water is said to have been produced by the Decomposition of Chlorine,” “On
                    some Combinations of Phosphorus,” “Observations on the Formation of Mists over
                    Lakes and Rivers,” and “On Electro-Magnetism.” In 1818 he was sent by the
                    British Government to examine the papyri of Herculaneum in the Neapolitan
                    Museum, his remarks on which are contained in a paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1821. In 1820 Davy returned to England,
                    and on the death of Sir Joseph Banks, in that year, he was elected president of
                    the Royal Society; in this position, however, it cannot be said that he always
                    appeared to advantage, or on every occasion acted in a manner calculated to
                    render himself popular amongst the members. In 1821 he busied himself with
                    electrical experiments, and in 1822 with the investigation of the fluids
                    contained in the cavities of crystals in rocks. In 1823 he read before the Royal
                    Society a paper “On the Application of Liquids formed by the Condensation of
                    Gases as Mechanical Agents.” In the same year he investigated the cause of the
                    rapid destruction of the copper sheathing of sea-going ships. It occurred to him
                    that, as sea-water acts only on positively electrified copper, the sheathing
                    would be protected if he could render it slightly negative. He found that plates
                    of copper having portions of iron or zinc attached remained unchanged after
                    prolonged immersion in sea-water. In consequence of this discovery directions
                    were given by the Government, after some preliminary experiments, to apply
                    plates of iron, or “protectors” as they were called, to several ships of the
                    royal navy; many merchantmen also were supplied with them. Experience, however,
                    showed that the bottoms of the protected ships soon became extremely
                    foul—seaweed and shell-fish accumulating in such quantities as seriously to
                    impede sailing; so that in June 1825, much to the mortification of the inventor,
                    orders were issued for the removal of the protectors.</p>
                <p>In 1826 Davy’s health had so far declined that he was with difficulty able to
                    indulge in his favourite sports of angling and shooting; and on returning to
                    London from Somersetshire he was unable to attend the anniversary dinner of the
                    Royal Society. In January 1827 he published his six anniversary discourses,
                    delivered on awarding the Royal and Copley medals. Early in 1827 he was seized
                    with an apoplectic attack, which rendered his removal to the Continent
                    advisable. After some short stay at Ravenna he removed to Salzburg, whence, on
                    account of the continuance of his illness, he sent in his resignation of the
                    presidency of the Royal Society. At the end of autumn he returned to England,
                    and in the winter he published his <hi rend="italic">Salmonia,</hi> a book of
                    some interest, written in imitation of Izaak Walton’s <hi rend="italic">Complete

                <p>In 1828 Davy quitted England, and Bpent most of the summer and autumn at Laybach.
                    In the winter he fixed his residence at Rome, whence he sent to the Royal
                    Society, “Remarks on the Electricity of the Torpedo,” written in Illyria in
                    October. This, with the exception of a posthumous work, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Consolations in Travel, or the Last Days of a
                        Philosopher,</hi> was the final production of his pen. While at Rome, he was
                    attacked by paralysis, from which he had already suffered. His wife and brother
                    having hastened to his assistance, he left Rome for Geneva, where he died on the
                    29th of May 1829. His remains were deposited on the 1st of June in the
                    burying-ground outside the walls of that city.</p>
                <p>Davy was of a sanguine, somewhat irritable temperament. To all his pursuits he
                    devoted himself with a characteristic enthusiasm and firmness of purpose. His
                    tone of mind, as indicated by his poems, was highly imaginative. “I attend
                    Davy’s lectures,” said Coleridge, “to increase my stock of metaphors.” The power
                    and perspicacity of his intellect is sufficiently attested by his numerous and
                    brilliant discoveries. He was not 21 years of age when he wrote —“It is only by
                    forming theories, and then comparing them with facts, that we can hope to
                    discover the true system of nature.” As an experimenter he was remarkably quick;
                    “with Davy,” it has been remarked, “rapidity was power.” Of the minor
                    observances of etiquette he was careless, and his great frankness of disposition
                    sometimes exposed him to annoyances which the exercise of tact and caution might
                    have obviated. His manner in society, which gave to many the impression of a
                    haughty consciousness of superiority, is ascribed by <pb break="no"
