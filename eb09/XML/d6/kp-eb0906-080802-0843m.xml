                    group which has left one record, so to speak, in our annals of art, not by their
                    pictures exactly, but by the three having been all travellers in the East, and
                    publishing, by means of engraving, works illustrating the scenery of the
                    countries they visited.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas Daniell</hi> (1749-1840), to whom the others were
                    indebted for everything, was a man of versatile ability and enormous energy. He
                    was the maker of his own fortune, having been born at the Chertsey inn, kept by
                    his father, in 1749, and apprenticed to an heraldic painter, a trade then dying
                    out, like that of stay-maker or perukier at a later time. However profitable it
                    had been, probably Daniell would not have adhered to it, as he was animated, at
                    a time when the representation of natural scenery under atmospheric conditions
                    of effect was merely struggling into existence, with a love of the romantic and
                    beautiful in architecture and nature. The sentimental affectation for landscape,
                    so cleverly satirized by Lord Macaulay, did not indeed influence him; his bias
                    was towards archaeology and botany, and led him at last to India. Up to 1784 he
                    painted topographical subjects and flower pieces. By this time his two nephews
                    had come under his influence, the youngest being apprenticed to Medland the
                    landscape engraver, and the elder, William, was under his own care. In this year
                    (1784) he embarked for India accompanied by the boy, and found at Calcutta ample
                    encouragement. Here he remained ten years, and on returning to London he
                    published his largest work, <hi rend="italic">Oriental Scenery,</hi> in six
                    large volumes, not completed till 1808. From 1795 till 1828 he continued to
                    exhibit Eastern subjects, temples, jungle hunts, &amp;c., and at the same time
                    continued the publication of illustrated works. These are— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Views of Calcutta; Oriental Scenery,</hi> 144 plates; <hi rend="italic">Views
                    in Egypt; Excavations at Ellora; Picturesque Voyage to China.</hi> These were
                    for the most part executed by an engraving process now almost forgotten, called
                    aquatint, and, although they do not show the accuracy of detail now understood,
                    are valuable authorities. He was made Royal Academician in 1799, fellow of the
                    Royal Society about the same time, and at different times member of several
                    minor societies. His nephews both died before him; his Indian period had made
                    him independent, and he lived a bachelor life in much respect at Kensington till
                    the age of ninety-one, dying 19th March 1840.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">William Daniell</hi> (1769-1837), nephew of Thomas, was born
                    1769, and was therefore fourteen when he accompanied his uncle to India. His own
                    publications, engraved in aquatint, were— <hi rend="italic">Voyage to India;
                    Zoography; Animated Nature; Views of London; Views of Bootan,</hi> a work
                    prepared from his uncle’s sketches; and a <hi rend="italic">Voyage Round Great
                    Britain,</hi> which occupied him several years. The British Institution made him
                    an honorary award of £100 for a Battle of Trafalgar, and he was elected R.A. in
                    1822. He turned to panorama painting before his death, beginning in 1832 with
                    Madras, the picture being enlivened by the Hindu mode of taming wild elephants.
                    He died 16th August 1837.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel Daniell,</hi> William’s younger brother, born 1775,
                    was brought up as an engraver, and first appears as an exhibitor in 1792. A few
                    years later he went to the Cape and travelled into the interior of Africa, with
                    his sketching materials in his haversack. The drawings he made there were
                    published, after his return, in his <hi rend="italic">African Scenery.</hi> He
                    did not rest long at home, but left for Ceylon in 1806, where he spent the
                    remaining years of his life, publishing <hi rend="italic">The Scenery, Animals,
                    and Natives of Ceylon.</hi> Camping out and malaria from the swamps cut him off
                    after a few days, illness in December 1811.</p>
