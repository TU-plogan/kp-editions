                    (1794-1872), was born 16th August 1794 at Eaux Vives, near Geneva. The ancestors
                    of his father, François Merle, were French Protestant refugees; his paternal
                    grandmother’s name, D’Aubigné, which Jean-Henri Merle subsequently added to his
                    own, was a name well known in the service of Henry IV. Jean-Henri was destined
                    by his parents to a commercial life; but the new interests awakened by his
                    course at college led him to fix his choice on the office of the Christian
                    ministry. The influence of Robert Haldane, a Scottish evangelist sojourning in
                    Geneva, told powerfully and permanently on the divinity student, and kindled in
                    him a hitherto unknown zeal for the distinctively evangelical truths of the
                    Christian faith. When in 1817 Merle went abroad to further his education,
                    Germany was about to celebrate the tercentenary of the Reformation; and thus
                    early he conceived the ambition to write the history of that great epoch. At
                    Berlin he received stimulus from teachers so unlike as were Neander and De
                    Wette. After presiding for five years over the French Protestant church in
                    Hamburg, he was in 1823 called to become pastor of a congregation in Brussels,
                    and preacher to the court. At the Belgian revolution, he preferred pastoral work
                    at home to an educational post in the family of the Dutch king; and, shortly
                    after his return to Switzerland, events rendered it impossible for those
                    like-minded with him in religious matters to remain in the national Genevese
                    church. The separation took place finally in 1833, and Merle D'Aubigné became
                    one of the founders of the new evangelical church; and, whether as pastor or as
                    professor of church history in its theological seminary, he continued to be till
                    the last days of his life an unwearied and influential labourer in the cause of
                    his church and of evangelical Protestantism. In him the Evangelical Alliance
                    found a hearty promoter. He made many friends in other lands, and repeatedly
                    visited England; he was made a D.C.L. by Oxford University, and received civic
                    honours from the city of Edinburgh. His many labours never impaired his healthy
                    frame. In his seventy-ninth year he still enjoyed perfect vigour of mind and
                    body; sudden death during the night of the 20th October 1872 removed him from
                    the midst of academic and literary work.</p>
                <p>It was as their historian that Merle D’Aubigné was most powerfully to serve the
                    cause of the Protestant churches. The first section of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Reformation,</hi> having for its central subject the earlier
                    period of the work in Germany, gave its author at once a foremost rank amongst
                    modern French ecclesiastical historians, was translated into most European
                    tongues, and was much more widely read and admired in English-speaking lands
                    than at home. It is said that 200,000 copies of the English translation were
                    sold in Great Britain alone, and about twice as many in the United States. The
                    second series of volumes, dealing with reform in the time of Calvin, was not
                    less thorough than the former series, and had a subject hitherto less
                    exhaustively treated; but it did not meet with a success so marked. This part of
                    the subject, with which the Genevese professor was most competent effectively to
                    deal, was all but completed at the time of his death. Along with the great work
                    of his life, he had written many minor treatises on the themes he had most
                    closely at heart. Of these the most important are a vindication of the character
                    and aims of Oliver Cromwell, and a sketch of the contendings of the Kirk of
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>Dr Merle D’Aubigné was in many ways well fitted to be a powerful and popular
                    expositor of history, and especially of that history to which he devoted the
                    studies of a lifetime. Indefatigable in exploring and sifting original
                    documents, he had amassed a vast wealth of authentic information; but a desire
                    to give everywhere a full and graphic picture, assisted by a gift of warm and
                    genial imaginative power, betrayed him into aiming at fulness of picturesque
                    detail concerning events and processes necessarily hidden from the eye of a
                    strict historiographer. In a few cases he seems by inference from his knowledge
                    of a later period to have filled up a narrative not sustained by documentary
                    evidence. He was able in a marvellous manner to identify himself with the
                    Reformers; but while his sympathies enabled him to do justice to great aims of
                    good men, he too frequently becomes their apologist. His expressed desire
                    everywhere to trace the working of God’s Spirit in the work of the Reformers
                    leads him to pass too lightly over secondary but weighty influences, and in his
                    heroes’’ opponents continually to discover the foes of God; and the devout
                    purpose with which he confessedly wrote inspires his pages with much that is
                    rather religious admonition than history, and causes a style otherwise simple
                    and dignified to pass into fervid rhetoric. But his work remains a noble
                    monument of painstaking sincerity and reverential love for a great subject. In
                    the main it unquestionably brings us into direct contact with the genuine spirit
                    of the most momentous period in the modern history of the Christian church.</p>
