                    Africa, formerly an independent kingdom, but in 1874 conquered and incorporated
                    by Egypt. It extends from 9° to 16° N. lat., and from 22° 30' to 28° 30' E.
                    long., thus including an area of about 105,000 square miles, with a population
                    roughly estimated at four millions. On the W. it would be conterminous with
                    Wadai were it not for a strip of independent territory; on the N. it passes off
                    into the desert of Sahara; on the E. it is separated from Kordofan by a barren
                    steppe; and on the S. it is bounded by Darfertit and several petty states</p>
                <p>The centre of the country is occupied by the Marra Mouu tains, which lift their
                    granite peaks to a height of 3500 or 4000 feet, and extend about 180 miles from
                    north to south, with an average breadth of 70 miles. The northern portion of the
                    range is also known as the Kerakeri Mountains, on account of the huge boulders
                    with which their flanks are strewn; the southern portion turns to the west and
                    takes the name of Jebel Zerlai. On all sides this mountain-mass is channelled by
                    numerous wadis, which for the most part dry up in the hot season, but in many
                    cases measure from 200 to 300 paces in breadth. Of these the most important (as
                    the Sunot, and the Azum, with their numerous affluents) have a south-west
                    direction, and ultimately contribute their waters to the Bahar-es-Salamat, which
                    passes westward through Wadai. Some of those that rise in the eastern slopes
                    seem to find their way to the Bahr-el-Arab; but the greater number are absorbed
                    or stop short in their course.</p>
                <p>The climate, except in the south, where the rains are unusually heavy and the
                    soil is a damp clay, is regarded as healthy. The rainy season lasts for three
                    months, from the middle of June to the middle of September. In the neighbourhood
                    of the wadis the vegetation is fairly rich, but elsewhere it is rather scant and
                    steppe-like. The prevailing trees are the acacias—more particularly the hazara
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Acacia nilotica—</hi> the hachub, the sayal, the
                    kittir, the hommed, the jakjak, and the makhit; while the sycamore, the ochar,
                    the hadjlidj, and, in the Marra Mountains, the <hi rend="italic">Euphorbia
                    candelabrum</hi> are also to be found. In the highlands the culture of wheat,
                    elsewhere so rare in Central Africa, is pretty extensive; but doukhn <pb

                    are the usual cereals. In the south and west onions, pepper, bananas, citrons,
                    and various fruits are grown freely; and in several places an indigenous kind of
                    tobacco of great strength is cultivated. The deleb palm is abundant in the
                    south, and on the eastern frontiers the monkey-bread or baobab compensates for
                    the deficiency of water.</p>
                <p>Copper is obtained in sufficient quantity to make it a matter of export; antimony
                    was worked in the time of Mohammed-el-Fadhl; lead occurs in Gebel Kuttum in the
                    Dar el Gharb; iron is wrought in the south-west province; and deposits of
                    rock-salt are met with in various places.</p>
                <p>Cattle, sheep, and camels are both numerous and of excellent breeds. Horses are
                    comparatively rare; and, with the exception of those imported from Dongola, they
                    belong to a small but sturdy native race. The elephant has been exterminated;
                    but the ostrich is common in the east in the country of the Hamr Arabs.</p>
                <p>The population of Darfur is of very varied origin. The <hi rend="italic">Fur</hi>
                    occupy the central highlands and part of the Dar Dima and Dar Uma districts,
                    speak a special language, and are subdivided into numerous tribes, of which the
                    most influential are the Dugunga, the Kanjara, and the Kera. They are of middle
                    height, have rather irregular features, and display a disagreeable character. Dr
                    Nachtigal found them proud, treacherous, and very ill-disposed to strangers; but
                    it must be remembered that he had to encounter not only the religious antipathy
                    of Mahometan bigotry against a Christian, but also the political antipathy of
                    irritated national feeling against a supposed Egyptian. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mas-sabdt</hi> are a tribe which, breaking off from the Fur some centuries
                    back, are now largely mingled with Arab blood, aud use the Arabic language;
                    while, on the contrary, the <hi rend="italic">Tunjur</hi> are an Arab tribe
                    which must have arrived in the Soudan at a very early date, as it has
                    incorporated a large Furian element, and no longer professes Mahometanism. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Dadjo</hi> formerly inhabited Mount Marra, but they have been
                    driven to the south and west, where they maintain a certain independence in Dar
                    Sula, but are treated as inferiors by the Fur. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zogliawa,</hi> who inhabit the northern borders, are on the contrary regarded
                    by the Fur as their equals, and have all the prestige of a race that at one time
                    made its influence felt as far as Bornu. As holding a less important place in
                    the population may be mentioned the Berti, the Birgirid, the Beraunas, the
                    Fellatas, the Jellabas, and immigrants from Wadai, Baghirmi, &lt;fcc. Genuine
                    Arab tribes are numerous, and. they are partly nomadic and partly fixed. The
                    country was divided under the “Sultan” into the five provinces of Dar Tokonavi
                    or the northern province, Dar Dali or the eastern, Dar Uma or the southern, Dar
                    Dima or the south-western, and Dar el Gharb or the western, each governed by a
                    separate chief with the exception of the last, which stood directly under the
                    authority of the king. Each province was subdivided into so many departments,
                    and each department was under the control of a <hi rend="italic">shertaya</hi>
                    {plural, <hi rend="italic">sherati).</hi> The central district of the Marra
                    Mountains, called Dar Torra, was under a special shertaya, dependent on the
                    king; and the western slopes, which form the most fertile tract in the whole
                    country, belonged to the king and the members of the royal family. The most
                    important towns are Kobe and Kabkabia, on the caravan-route across the north of
                    the country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi> —Of the Dadjo dynasty, which appears to have been
                    dominant in the Marra mountains, no history has been left except a list of royal
                    names. Next succeeded the Tunjur dynasty— Ahmed-el-Magur, Saref, Kuni, Bate,
                    Rufa’a, and Shaou. From the marriage of Rufa’a with the daughter of the chief of
                    the Kera tribe sprang Dali or Dalil, who founded the Furian kingdom, divided the
                    country into provinces, and established a penal code, which, under the nitle of
                    <hi rend="italic">Kitab Dali</hi> or Dali’s Book, is still preserved, and shows
                    principles essentially different from those of the Koran. His grandson Soleiman
                    (usually distinguished by the Furian epithet <hi rend="italic">Solon,</hi> the
                    Arab or the Red) reigned from 1596 to 1637, and was a great warrior and a
                    devoted Mussulman. Soleiman’s grandson Ahmed Bokr (1682-1722) made Islam the
                    religion of the state, and increased the prosperity of the country by
                    encouraging immigration from Bornu and Baghirmi. His rule extended as far east
                    as the Nile, or even to the banks of the Atbara. The next occupant of the
                    throne, Daura or Darut, is infamous for his cruelty; and the capture of liis
                    successor Omer Lele during a war with Wadai saved the country from an equally
                    detestable tyrant. Abu-el-Ghassem, the next monarch, was lost in a battle
                    against the same enemy, and when after a time he reappeared amongst his people,
                    he was put to death by Mohammed Tirab, who had meanwhile ascended the throne.
                    Abd-er-Rahman, surnamed el-Raschid or the Just, a poor priest of great learning
                    and piety, was chosen king instead of Tirab’s son Ishaga, and though revengeful
                    and fond of intrigue, he proved himself on the whole not unworthy of the choice.
                    It was during his reign that Napoleon was campaigning in Egypt; and the European
                    potentate responded in 1799 to the congratulatory address of his barbarian ally
                    by an order for the despatch of 2000 black slaves upwards of 16 years old,
                    strong and vigorous. To Abd-er-Rahman likewise is due the present situation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Fasher,</hi> or royal township, near the Rabat (or Lake)
                    Tendelti. Mahommed-el-Fadhl, his son, was for some time under the control of an
                    energetic eunuch, Maliommed Kurin; but he ultimately made himself independent,
                    and his reign lasted till 1839, when he died of leprosy, leaving behind him the
                    fame of a violent and blood-thirsty tyrant, who had been disgraced by the loss
                    of the important province of Kordofan. Of his 40 sons the third, Mahommed
                    Hassin, was appointed his successor. He is described as a religious but
                    avaricious man. The chief events of his reign were his fourteen expeditions
                    against the Razagat Arabs, the whole result of which was that the last years of
                    his life were spent in fairly peaceful terms with that restless tribe. He died
                    in 1873, blind and advanced in years, and the succession passed to his youngest
                    son Brahim, who soon found himself engaged in a conflict with Egypt, which
                    resulted in the destruction of the kingdom. He was slain in the battle of
                    Menovatchi, in the autumn of 1874, and his uncle Hassab Alla, who sought to
                    maintain himself, was captured in 1875 by the troops of the Khedive, and removed
                    to Cairo with his family.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Exploration.—</hi> The first European traveller who visited
                    Darfur was James Browne, who spent two years at Kobeyh or Cobbe, at that time
                    the capital. The next addition to our knowledge was due to the Sheikh
                    Mahommed-el-Tounsy, who travelled in 1803 through the north of Africa in search
                    of Omar, his father, and afterwards gave to the world an account of his
                    wanderings, which was translated into French in 1845 by M. Perron. Dr Nachtigal
                    in 1873 spent some months at Tendelti; and since the incorporation with Egypt,
                    the country has been reconnoitred by Purdy and other Egyptian generals.</p>
