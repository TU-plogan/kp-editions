                <p><label type="entry">DAMASCENUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Johannes</hi></label>, an
                    eminent theologian of the early Greek Church, derives his surname from Damascus,
                    where he was born about the close of the 7th or the beginning of the 8th
                    century. His Arabic name was Mansur, and he received the epithet Chrysorrhoas
                    (gold-pouring) on account of his eloquence. The principal account we have of his
                    life is contained in a narrative of the 10 th century, much of which is
                    obviously legendary. His father Sergius was a Christian, but notwithstanding
                    held a high office under the Saracen caliph, in which he was succeeded by his
                    son. Damascenus owed his education in philosophy, mathematics, and theology to
                    an Italian monk named Cosmas, whom Sergius had redeemed from a band of captive
                    slaves. About the year 730 he wrote several treatises in defence of
                    image-worship, which the Emperor Leo, the Isauriau, was making strenuous efforts
                    to suppress. Leo in revenge is said to have forged a treasonable letter,
                    purporting to be from Damascenus, and to have sent it to his caliph, who ordered
                    the traitor’s right hand to be cut off. According to the narrative Damascenus
                    immediately proceeded to prostrate himself before an image of the Virgin Mary,
                    implored her intercession, and had the severed hand miraculously restored. The
                    caliph was convinced by the miracle, and offered to replace Damascenus in his
                    office, but the latter resolved to forsake the world, divided his fortune among
                    his friends and the poor, and betook himself to the monastery of St Sabus, near
                    Jerusalem, where he spent the rest of his life. After the customary probation he
                    was ordained priest by the patriarch of Jerusalem. In his last years he
                    travelled through Syria contending against the iconoclasts, and in the same
                    cause he visited Constantinople at the imminent risk of his life during the
                    reign of Constantine Copronymus. The date of his death is uncertain; the last
                    notice of him is in 754. Damascenus is a saint both in the Greek and in the
                    Latin Church, his festival being observed in the former on 29th November and 4th
                    December, and in the latter on the 6th May. The works of Damascenus give him a
                    foremost place among the theologians of the early Eastern Church, and, <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0825-0790"/> according to Dorner, he “remains in later
                    times the highest authority in the theological literature of the Greeks.”
                    Several treatises have been attributed co him that are probably spurious, but
                    his undoubted works are numerous and embrace a wide range. The most important
                    contains three parts under the general title <hi rend="italic"
                    >n-rjyy</hi>-yvwo-ews (the fountain of knowledge). The first part, entitled
                    Ke^dXaia <hi rend="italic">&lt;f&gt;t.X.ocro&lt;l&gt;LKd,</hi> is an exposition
                    and application to theology of Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Dialectic.</hi> The
                    second, entitled II epi aipeo-ewv (of heresies), is a reproduction of the
                    earlier work of Epiphanius, with a continuation giving an account of the
                    heresies that arose after the time of that writer. The third part, entitled <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">*Ek8o(tis</hi><hi rend="italic">dupi/ty;</hi> ri/s <hi
                        rend="italic">op0o8o£ov 7rLar€&lt;D&lt;s</hi> (an accurate exposition of the
                    orthodox faith), is much the most important of the three, containing as it does
                    a complete system of theology founded on the teaching of the fathers and church
                    councils, from the 4th to the 7th century. It thus embodies the finished result
                    of the theological thought of the early Greek Church. Through a Latin
                    translation made by Burgundio of Pisa in the 12th century, it was well known to
                    Peter Lombard and Aquinas, and in this way it influenced the scholastic theology
                    of the West. Damascenus himself has sometimes been called the “Father of
                    Scholasticism,” and the “Lombard of the Greeks,” but these epithets are
                    appropriate only in a limited sense. On the disputed question of Damascenus’s
                    authorship of the interesting Christian romance, <hi rend="italic">Barlaam and
                        Josaphat,</hi> see note to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Barlaam and
                        Josaphat,</hi> vol. iii. p. 375. The works of Damascenus were edited by Le
                    Quien, and published with a valuable introduction in 2 vols. fol., Paris,
                    1712.</p>
