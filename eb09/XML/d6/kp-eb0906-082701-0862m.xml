                <p><label type="entry">DARJILING, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Darjeeling</hi></label>, a
                    district of British India, in the RAjshAhi Kuch-Behar commissionership, under
                    the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, is situated between 26° 30' 50" and 27° 13'
                    5" N. lat., and 88° 2' 45" and 88° 56' 35" E. long. It is bounded on the N. by
                    independent Sikkim, on the E. and S. by JalpAiguri district, and on the W. by
                    NepAl, and has an area of 1234 square miles. DAijiling consists of two
                    well-defined tracts,—viz., the lower Himalayas to the south of Sikkim, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">tardi,</hi> or plains, which extend from the south of these
                    ranges as far as the northern borders of Purniah district. The plains from which
                    the hills take their rise are only 300 feet above sea level; the mountains
                    ascend abruptly in spurs of from 6000 to 10,000 feet in height. The scenery
                    throughout the hills is picturesque, and in many parts magnificent. The two
                    highest mountains in the world, KAnchanjangA in Sikkim, and Everest in NepAl,
                    are visible from the town of DAijiling. The principal peaks within the district
                    are— PhalAlum (12,042 feet), Subargum (10,430), Tanglu (10,084), Situng, and
                    SinchAl PahAr (8607). The chief rivers are the TistA, Great and Little Ranjit,
                    RammAn, MahAnandA, Baldsan, and Jaldhakd. None of them are navigable in the
                    mountain valleys; but the TistA, after it debouches on the plains, can be
                    navigated by cargo boats of considerable burthen. Bears, leopards, and musk deer
                    are found on the higher mountains, deer on the lower ranges, and a few elephants
                    and tigers on the slopes nearest to the plains. In the lowlands, tigers,
                    rhinoceroses, deer, and wild hogs are abundant. A few wolves are also found. Of
                    small game, hares, jungle fowl, peacocks, partridges, snipe, woodcock, wild
                    ducks and geese, and green pigeons are numerous in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tardi,</hi> and jungle fowl and pheasants in the hills. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >mahsir</hi> fish is found in the TistA.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The Bengal census of 1872 returned the
                    population of the district at 94,712 persons (males, 53,057; females, 41,655),
                    thus classified:—Hindus, 69,831; Mahometans, 6248; Buddhists, 1368; Christians,
                    556; others, 16,709. The inhabitants of the hilly tract consist to a large
                    extent of NepAli immigrants and of aboriginal highland races; in the <hi
                    rend="italic">tardi</hi> the people are chiefly Hindus and Mahometans. The
                    LepchAs are considered to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the hilly portion of
                    the district. They are a fine, frank race, naturally open-hearted and
                    free-handed, fond of change and given to an out-door life; but they do not seem
                    to improve on being brought into contact with civilization. It is thought that
                    they are now being gradually driven out of the district, owing to the increase
                    of regular cultivation, and to the Government conservation of the forests. They
                    have no word for plough in their language, and they still follow the nomadic
                    form of tillage known as <hi rend="italic">jdm</hi> cultivation. This consists
                    in selecting a spot of virgin soil, clearing it of forest and jungle by burning,
                    and scraping the surface with the rudest agricultural implements. The productive
                    powers of the land become exhausted in a few years, when the clearing is
                    abandoned, a new site is chosen, and the same operations are carried on <hi
                    rend="italic">de novo.</hi> The LepchAs are also the ordinary out-door labourers
                    on the hills. They have no caste distinctions, but speak of themselves as
                    belonging to one of nine septs or clans, who all eat together and intermarry
                    with each other. In the upper or northern <hi rend="italic">tardi,</hi> along
                    the base of the hills, the Meehs form the principal ethnical feature. This tribe
                    inhabit the deadly jungle with impunity, and cultivate cotton, rice, and other
                    ordinary crops, by the <hi rend="italic">j-tim</hi> process described above.</p>
                <p>The agricultural products consist of rice, cotton, pulses, oil seeds, and jute,
                    principally grown in the tardi, and Indian corn, <hi rend="italic">mdrua,</hi>
                    and rice in the hills. Tea cultivation is the great industrial feature of
                    DArjiling district,—conducted almost entirely by means of English capital, and
                    under European supervision. This industry dates from about 1856. The first
                    planters did not meet with success; but the past ten years have been a period of
                    steadily increasing prosperity. In 1866 there were 39 tea gardens in DArjiling,
                    with a total cultivated area of 10,392 acres, and an ont-turn of 433,715 fi&gt;
                    of tea. In 1874 the gardens had increased to 113, the area under cultivation to
                    18,888 acres, and the out-turn of tea to 3,927,911 lb. The cultivation of
                    cinchona was introduced by Government about 1862, and the undertaking has now
                    attained a point which promises success The Government reserved forest extends
                    to 44,800 acres, scattered over an area of about 700 square miles. Indiarubber
                    of excellent quality is obtained from these forests.</p>
                <p>Coal of good quality seems to exist, but the supply has not hitherto been
                    utilized. A little iron is manufactured, and copper mining is carried on to a
                    somewhat greater extent; but the methods adopted by the natives are of a very
                    primitive kind. Lime is obtained in large quantities, building stone is
                    abundant, and slate is found. The principal line of communication is the
                    imperial cart road to DAijiling, which has a course of 48 miles through the
                    district. The Northern Bengal State Railway, now (1877) in course of
                    construction, will bring the district in closer connection with Calcutta, and
                    materially promote the development of its resources.</p>
                <p>In 1870-71 the Government revenue of the district amounted to &lt;£18,797, and
                    the civil expenditure to £23,869. Three magisterial and three civil and revenue
                    courts are at work in the district; the strength of the police force in 1872 was
                    213 men. The principal educational institution is St Paul’s school, intended to
                    provide good education at a moderate cost for the sons of Europeans and East
                    Indians. The higher elevations of the district may be pronounced free from
                    endemic disease of every kind except goitre, and this is by no means widely
                    spread. In the <hi rend="italic">tardi,</hi> however, and in the lower valleys,
                    malarious fevers, often of a severe and fatal type, prevail.</p>
                <p>The British connection with DArjiling dates from 1816, when, at the close of our
                    war with NepAl, we made over to the Sikkim rAjA the <hi rend="italic">tardi</hi>
                    tract, which had been wrested from him and annexed by NepAL In 1835 the nucleus
                    of the present district of British Sikkim or DArjiling was created by a cession
                    of a portion of the hills by the rAjA of Sikkim to the British as a sanatorium.
                    A military expedition against Sikkim, rendered necessary in 1850 by the
                    imprisonment of Dr Campbell, the superintendent of DArjiling, and Dr Hooker,
                    resulted in the stoppage of the allowance granted to the rAjA for the cession of
                    the hill station of DArjiling, and in the annexation of the Sikkim <hi
                    rend="italic">tardi</hi> at the foot of the hills and of a portion of the hills
                    beyond. In August 1866 the hill territory east of the TistA, acquired as the
                    result of the BhutAn campaign of 1864, was added to the jurisdiction of
                    DArjiling.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">DArj/ling Town,</hi> the well-known sanatory station, is
                    situated in 27° 2' 48" N. lat. and 88° 18' 36" E. long., near the northern
                    boundary of the district, and is 7167 feet above the sea-level. It contains an
                    ordinary population of about 4000 souls, but being a great summer resort from
                    the heat of the plains, the number fluctuates according to the season of the
                    year. The mean temperature °of the place is about 24° below that of Calcutta,
                    and only 2 above that of London. (<hi rend="superscript"> Wt</hi><pb break="no"
