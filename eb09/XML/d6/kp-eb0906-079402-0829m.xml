                    history, which in the East has attained considerable celebrity. His full name
                    and title is Kemal ud-den Abu’l BagH Muhammed Ben Musa Ben Isa ad-Damiri
                    Ash-Skafei. He was born in Cairo in the year 742 of the Hegira (1341 A.D.), and
                    died there in the year 808 (1405). Damiri’s reputation, so far as the Western
                    nations are concerned, is not based upon his work as a jurist, but wholly upon
                    his natural history, which is entitled <hi rend="italic">The Life of
                    Animals</hi> (Hayat’ul Haiwan). In this treatise the author gives the names of
                    931 beasts, birds, fishes, and insects with which he was (probably rarely by
                    personal knowledge) acquainted, arranging these alphabetically, and giving a
                    longer or shorter account of their nature and peculiarities, according as the
                    data, actual or fabulous, in his possession would allow him. As might have been
                    anticipated, he is more especially copious and minute when he comes to treat of
                    animals like the lion and the camel; but in all cases he defines the orthography
                    and vocalization of the name, gives the forms of the plurals and feminines, and
                    supplies the local or vernacular titles by which the animals were known. It is
                    unnecessary to say that Damiri does not treat natural <pb break="no"

                    modern zoologist Not only would that have been impossible at the time at which
                    he lived, but he himself did not profess to be a scientific observer, and he was
                    induced to prepare his work on natural history in consequence of the gross
                    ignorance of this subject which was exhibited by many of the theologians of the
                    period. His exposition of the natural history of his country is essentially the
                    result of his interest in theological and legal matters, and his wide
                    acquaintance with the learned culture of the Arabic language, and therefore is
                    from a scientific point of view a mere compilation; and at the same time his
                    literary knowledge induced him to interrupt the scientific continuity of his
                    narrative by disquisitions of a totally irrelevant character. Thus, in the
                    middle of his article on the Goose, he inserts a consecutive sketch of the
                    history of the Caliphate, from the death of Ali to the accession of
                    Al-Muktafi-—a period of nearly 800 years—at the end of which historical
                    interlude he resumes his article, as if it had not been interrupted. In spite,
                    however, of its deficiencies, the <hi rend="italic">Life of Animals</hi> has an
                    interest of its own and a permanent value to scholars. All references in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sunna</hi> to any particular animal are mentioned, anecdotes
                    relating to it are introduced, its uses in supplying articles of the materia
                    medica are pointed out, the means to counteract its noxious qualities are
                    indicated, the lawfulness of using its flesh as food is discussed, the proverbs
                    which allude to it are recounted, and citations from the poets who have noticed
                    it are quoted. The amount of discursive reading shown in the work is very great,
                    as it contains quotations from 560 prose authors, and from the divâns, or
                    collected editions, of 199 poets. Upon the whole, therefore, the literary value
                    of the treatise to scholars is by no means small, as it exhibits the natural
                    history of his age and country surrounded by the associations with which the
                    experience and literature of the Arabs had invested it.</p>
                <p>After finishing his work on natural history, Damîrî reproduced it in a
                    compendious form, and it has thus come down to us in a large and a smaller
                    recension. Others, moreover, (such as Al-Usyûti) formed abridgments of it.
                    Manuscript copies of the work exist in many public libraries, and the larger
                    edition has been printed, in the original language, at Cairo, in 2 vols. folio,
                    in 1278 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (1861 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> The
                    European scholar who made the first and amplest use of this work was S. Bochart,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Hierozoicon,</hi> which first appeared in 1663.</p>
                <p>The other works of Damîrî have not obtained, even in the East, the popularity
                    accorded to his <hi rend="italic">Life of Animals.</hi> His most prominent work
