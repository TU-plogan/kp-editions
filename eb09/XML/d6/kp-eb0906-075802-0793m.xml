                    of that district of Europe which lies to the N. of the Danube between the Theiss
                    on the W. and the Dniester on the E. It thus comprehended the modern provinces
                    of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia, the Bukowina, the banat of Temeswar
                    and other parts of Hungary, as well as the southern portions of Galicia.</p>
                <p>The first occupants of the district with whom we are made acquainted by history
                    are the Getae, a rude tribe of Thracian extraction, originally settled on the
                    right bank of the Danube. They first appear in connection with the Scythian
                    campaign of Darius, which nominally attached them for a moment to the Persian
                    empire. By Philip of Macedon their friendship was considered of importance, and
                    he married Medopa, the daughter of their king Cothelas; but they afterwards took
                    part in the confederation of the Scythian tribes against the invasion by which
                    Alexander the Great sought to secure his northern frontiers. About forty years
                    later Lysimachus, king of Thrace, made an attempt to subdue them, but he was
                    defeated and obliged to give his daughter in marriage to their chief; and a
                    second expedition, by which he hoped to retrieve his fortunes, left him a
                    prisoner in their hands, and brought him under obligation to his Dacian
                    son-in-law, Dromichaetes, for the restoration of his liberty. We next hear of
                    the Getae as being defeated by the Gauls, by whom many of them were sold as
                    slaves to the Athenians and other Greeks.</p>
                <p>The Getae gradually retire from the foreground of history, and give place to the
                    Daci, or Daoi, as they were called in Greek, a cognate race, who seem to have
                    migrated from Rhodope, and about 90-57 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> attained a
                    stable settlement and extensive influence under their leader Burvista. It has
                    been usual to identify the Getae and Daci as one, but though they continued to
                    occupy the same country, and were, at least for a time, politically united, the
                    allusions of the ancient writers seem to point to an essential difference. At
                    the time of the war between Octavius and Antony, the Getae sided with the former
                    and the Daci with the latter; and during the fifty years after the formation of
                    the province of Mcesia the Getae continued to disturb the Roman frontiers, while
                    the Dacians kept peacefully at home. After 73, however, the Getae almost
                    completely disappear, and the Dacians come forward as one of the most powerful
                    enemies of Rome. Their reputation was heightened by the submission which they
                    exacted from the tyrant Domitian, and the tribute by which he was obliged to
                    purchase immunity from their attacks. In 101 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    Trajan, who had succeeded to the purple, set out against them in person, and
                    defeated them with great slaughter at a place which is still called <hi
                    rend="italic">Prat de Trajan</hi> (Pratum Trajani), or Crossfield, near Thorda,
                    in Transylvania. This was followed in 104 by another invasion, in which he
                    advanced to the Dacian capital Sarmizegethusa (now Varhely), and routed
                    Decebalus, who soon after committed suicide. The country was reduced to a Roman
                    province, under the jurisdiction of a legate of praetorian rank; and colonists
                    were brought from other parts of the empire, and more especially from southern
                    Italy. In honour of the campaign of 104 the famous column of Trajan was erected
                    at Rome; and to secure his conquests the victor constructed three great military
                    roads and the bridge over the Danube, which ranked as one of the architectural
                    wonders of the world. Under Hadrian (129 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the
                    province was divided into two parts—Upper Dacia, which probably included the
                    Banat and the mountain region of Transylvania; and Lower Dacia, situated in the
                    Wallachian lowlands. Under Antoninus Pius the division became three-fold—Dacia
                    Apulensis, so called from Apulum, the modern Carlsburg; Porolissensis, from
                    Porolissum; and Malvensis, a name of unknown derivation. Dacia remained a Roman
                    province till 272, when Aurelian adopted the line of the Danube as the frontier
                    of the empire. The Roman legions and colonists retired to the southern side of
                    the river and settled in the eastern part of Upper Mcesia and the district of
                    Dardania; while their former territory was relinquished to the Goths and other
                    Germanic tribes. The name of Dacia, sometimes with the addition of <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ova</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ripensis,</hi> was applied to the new region
                    along the Danube, and Dardania was distinguished as <hi rend="italic">Dacia
                    Mediterranea,</hi> or Inland Dacia. After the time of Constantine the
                    designation, in its wider use, included Dacia Ripensis, Dacia Mediterranea,
                    Mcesia Prima, <pb break="no"

                    in its narrower use it comprehended only the first two. Numerous traces of Roman
                    occupation are found throughout the region, and in Roumania the people pride
                    themselves on their supposed descent from the Roman colonists, and use a dialect
                    which bears a strong similarity to Latin. In features they are said to have a
                    resemblance to the Dacians figured on Trajan’s pillar. See Dierauer, <hi
