                    a firmly-welded empire at his death.</p>
                <p>In the great inscription on the rock of Behistun, where he has recorded his
                    struggles and victories, Darius traces his descent from Achaemenes, through four
                    ancestors all kings like himself. He seems to have stood next to the line of
                    Cyrus in succession to the throne; and Cyrus, when setting out on his campaign
                    against the Massagetae, already suspected him of aiming at the crown. He
                    accompanied Cambyses to Egypt, but was recalled by his father to the capital at
                    the time the conspiracy was being formed against the Magian usurper Gomates, who
                    professed to be Bardes (Smerdis in Herodotus), the brother of Cambyses. With six
                    other Persian nobles Darius succeeded in overthrowing the Magian usurpation, and
                    pursued the pseudo-Smerdis to Sikhyuvatis, a fortress in Nisaea, where he was
                    put to death, April 2, 521 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The friends of Gomates
                    were massacred, the yearly festival of the Magophonia instituted, and the
                    religion of Zoroaster, which had been suppressed in favour of the idolatrous
                    worship of the Turanian (as opposed to the Aryan) Medes, was solemnly restored.
                    Darius, now twenty-eight years old, was proclaimed king.</p>
                <p>The first six years of his reign were occupied in suppressing the revolts which
                    broke out throughout the empire, occasioned partly, perhaps, by the zeal with
                    which the new monarch maintained the Zoroastrian faith, and which led him to
                    look with special favour on the monotheistic Jews. Pretender after pretender
                    appeared—Atrines and afterwards Martes, in Susiania; Nidintabel, who called
                    himself Nebuchadrezzar son of Nabonidus, in Babylonia; Phraortes, who claimed to
                    be Xathrites son of Cyaxares, in Media and Parthia; Tritantachmes, in Sagartia;
                    Phraates, in Margiana; (Eosdates, a second pseudo-Smerdis, in Persia itself; and
                    an Armenian, Aracus, in Babylon; but they were all successively crushed by
                    Darius or his generals. The most serious of these revolts were those in Media
                    and Babylonia, and it was probably during the first Babylonian revolt that the
                    long siege of Babylon mentioned by Herodotus took place, resulting in the
                    attempted plunder of the image of Bel (518 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) This
                    siege may have introduced the otherwise unknown “Darius the Mede” into the book
                    of Daniel (see article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Daniel).</hi> The Median
                    Phraortes, who probably belonged to the Turanian part of the population, proved
                    more than a match for three generals of Darius, and the king had to leave
                    Babylon, which he had just succeeded in capturing, and take the field in person,
                    before the war was finished by the seizure and crucifixion of Phraortes at
                    Ecbatana. The second capture of Babylon was followed by the execution of the
                    Behistun inscription, 515 B.C., in which Darius declares that he had translated
                    “the Ancient Book,” “the Text of the Divine Law <hi rend="italic">(Avesta)</hi>
                    and a Commentary of the Divine Law and the Prayer (ZencZ)” from Bactrian into
                    the old Persian, and had restored it to the nations of the empire (see Oppert’s
                    translation of the Median version of the Behistun inscription in <hi
                    rend="italic">Records of the Past,</hi> vol. vii.) It must have been for the
                    sake of this translation that the Assyrian cuneiform syllabary was simplified
                    into an alphabet of forty characters. A revolt of Iskunka, a chief of the Sacae,
                    was suppressed shortly after the inscription was engraved. Before this, Oroetes,
                    governor of Sardis, who had murdered Polycrates of Samos, and aimed at making
                    himself independent, had been put to death, as well as Aryandes, satrap of
                    Egypt, who had issued a silver coinage of his own.</p>
                <p>Darius now set about consolidating and organizing his empire. An elaborate
                    bureaucratic system was instituted, and the empire divided into a varying number
                    of provinces, each under a governor or satrap <hi rend="italic"
                    >(khshatrapdva),</hi> appointed by the king for au indefinite time, and
                    responsible for a fixed tribute. The power of the satrap was checked by “royal
                    clerks,” who sent annual reports of the satrap and his actions to the king, by
                    retaining the old chiefs or kings of the province by the side of the satrap
                    wherever possible, and by sending members of the royal family to the satrapies.
                    Except in the border satrapies, the military power was intrusted to a separate
                    officer, and it was only in the border provinces, accordingly, that a revolt was
                    to be feared. It is said that the chief fortresses had each an independent
                    commander, while in Persia proper “royal judges” went on circuit. The satrap
                    represented the king, and had the power of life and death. The money tribute,
                    raised probably by a land-tax, amounted, according to Mr Grote’s calculation, to
                    £4,254,000,—7740 talents (£2,964,000) being paid in silver, and the rest in
                    gold. The Indian satrapy contributed by far the most, and Persia proper paid
                    nothing. Part of tho tribute was paid in kind, Babylonia and Assyria furnishing
                    one-third. There were, besides, water-rates, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n861/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0861-0826"/> taxes for the use of such crown property as
                    fisheries and the like, but the amount to be paid to the imperial treasury was
                    in all cases fixed. It was otherwise, however, with the exactions the satraps
                    were allowed to make on their own account, and which must have pressed heavily
                    on the people. The tribute enabled Darius to issue a coinage of extreme purity,
                    and his gold darics were worth about 22s. of our money. An incised bar was the
                    imperial stamp. The satrapies were connected with one another by highroads and
                    posting-stations, at which relays of horses were kept for the royal
                    messengers.</p>
                <p>After building a palace at Susa, the new capital of the empire, and founding the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cheld Minar</hi> at Persepolis, Darius overran the Punjaub,
                    and had the Indus navigated by a naval expedition under Scylax of Caryanda.
                    Under the guidance of Democedes, a physician of Crotona, the Greek seas were
                    also explored as far as Magna Graecia, and the northern frontier was
                    strengthened by a campaign against the Scythians. Ariamnes of Cappadocia first
                    examined the northern shores of the Black Sea, after which Darius, with 600
                    ships and the aid of the Asiatic Greeks, crossed the Bosphorus by a bridge
                    constructed by the Greek Mandrocles, conquered the Getae, and threw a bridge of
                    boats across the Danube. Leaving the defence of the bridge to the Greeks, he
                    pursued the Scythians as far as the 50th parallel, burning Gelonus (perhaps the
                    modern Voronej), and recrossed the bridge in safety, thanks to the fidelity of
                    Histiaeus of Miletus. Megabazus, or Megabyzus, next reduced Thrace and made
                    Amyntas of Macedon tributary (506). In the following year Otanes subjugated
                    Byzantium, Chalcedon, Antandros, Lemnos, and Imbros.</p>
                <p>In 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Ionic revolt broke out. The allies of
                    the Ionians from Athens and Eretria landed in Asia Minor and burnt Sardis, an
                    event which led the Greeks of the Hellespont, as well as the Carians and the
                    Cyprians, to join the insurrection. The revolt was crushed in 495 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> by the battle of Lade and the sack of Miletus; aud a
                    terrible punishment was taken upon the Greek cities on the coasts and islands of
                    the Aegean. Miltiades, the tyrant of the Chersonese, escaped with difficulty to
                    Athens, while Darius prepared to avenge the burning of Sardis. His son-in-law,
                    Mardonius, was accordingly sent against Athens and Eretria with a powerful
                    force. But after establishing democracies in the place of tyrants in various
                    Greek cities, and capturing Thasos and its gold mines, Mardonius lost 300 ships
                    and more thau 20,000 men in a storm off Mount Athos, and, being further
                    surprized by the Thracian Bryges, returned to Asia Minor. Two years afterwards
                    (490 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> Darius sent another expedition under Datis,
                    which destroyed Eretria, but was ingloriously defeated at Marathon by the
                    Athenians under Miltiades. Darius now made preparations for an attack upon a
                    scale which the Greeks would have found it hardly possible to withstand while an
                    able prince like Darius was at the head of the empire; but in the fourth year of
                    the preparations (487 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> just before everything
                    was ready, Egypt broke out into revolt. Before the revolt could be put down
                    Darius died, 486 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> in the sixty-third year of his
                    age according to Herodotus, or the seventy-second according to Ctesias, who,
                    however, curtails his reign by three years. Darius had already nominated Xerxes,
                    his son by Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, as his successor,—his eldest son,
                    Artobazanes, whose mother was a daughter of Gobryas, being set aside as born
                    before his father was king.</p>
                <p>Long before his death Darius had excavated a richlyornamented tomb with four
                    pillars and other sculptures out of the rocks of Naksh-i-Rustam, about four
                    miles from Persepolis. In an inscription on the facade of the tomb he enumerates
                    28 different countries or satrapies, including India and “the Scythians beyond
                    the sea,” over which he bore sway. His name D&amp;ryavush is rendered</p>
                <p>“worker” or “organizer,” by Herodotus; but the true meaning of the word is rather
                    “the maintainer,” from <hi rend="italic">darj</hi> (Sanskrit, <hi rend="italic"
                    >dhri,</hi> “conservare ”). <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. h. s.)</hi></p>
