                    transferred to the chair of dogmatics. A change in the direction of the seminary
                    caused him to leave for Paris, where in 1846 he was appointed almoner of the
                    college of Henry IV. and honorary canon of Notre Dame. The confidence thus shown
                    in him by Archbishop Afire was continued by Archbishop Sibour, who appointed him
                    editor of the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur Catholique.</hi> In November 1854

                <p>archbishop took Darboy with him to Rome and presented him to the Pope, who gave
                    him the rank of protonotary apostolic. In 1855 he became titular vicar-general
                    of Paris, and inspector of religious instruction in the various schools of the
                    diocese. He was appointed bishop of Nancy in 1859, and in January 1863 he was
                    raised to the archbishopric of Paris. The favour of the court was indicated by
                    his appointment to the post of grand almoner to the emperor in 1866, and to that
                    of grand officer to the Legion of Honour in 1868. The archbishop was a strenuous
                    upholder of episcopal independence in the Gallican sense, and involved himself
                    in a controversy with Rome by his endeavours to suppress the jurisdiction of the
                    Jesuits and other religious orders within his diocese. At the Vatican Council he
                    vigorously maintained the rights of the bishops, and offered a decided
                    opposition to the infallibility dogma, against which he voted as inopportune.
                    When the dogma had been finally adopted, however, he was one of the first to set
                    the example of submission. Immediately after his return to Paris the war with
                    Prussia broke out, and his conduct during the disastrous year that followed Xvas
                    marked by a devoted heroism which has secured for him an enduring fame. He was
                    active in organizing relief for the wounded at the commencement of the war,
                    remained bravely at his post during the seige, and refused to seek safety by
                    flight during the brief triumph of the commune. On the 4th April 1871 he was
                    arrested by the communists as a hostage, and confined in the prison at Mazas,
                    from which he was transferred to La Roquette on the advance of the army of
                    Versailles. On the 27th May he was shot within the prison along with several
                    other distinguished hostages. He died in the attitude of blessing and uttering
                    words of forgiveness. His body was recovered with difficulty, and having been
                    embalmed was buried with imposing ceremony at the public expense on the 7th
                    June. It is a noteworthy fact that Darboy was the third archbishop of Paris who
                    perished by violence in the period between 1848 and 1871. Darboy was the author
                    of a number of works, of which the most important are a <hi rend="italic">Vie de
                    St Thomas Becket</hi> (1859), a translation of the works of St Denis the
                    Areopagite, and a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Imitation of
                    Christ.</hi></p>
