                    manor-house of Chicksgrove. He was sent first to Winchester College, and
                    afterwards to New College, Oxford. In 1585 he became a commoner of Queen’s
                    College, Oxford, and in 1587 entered at the Middle Temple. Bereft of both his
                    parents at a very early age, he seems to have plunged into all the dissipations
                    that London could offer in those days to a rich young man of fashion. It is
                    amusing to find the future attorney-general of Ireland, and grave Christian
                    poet, connected, beyond all concealment, with one of the worst literary scandals
                    of the period. One would be very glad to know what circumstances led to the
                    publication of the notorious and now excessively rare little volume that bears
                    the title <hi rend="italic">All Ovid's Elegies,</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">Bookes,
                    by C. M. Epigrams by J. D. At Middleburgh,</hi> in which Marlowe had a share,
                    and which was condemned by the archbishop to be burned. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epigrams</hi> are far from edifying or promising, and we may, in the absence of
                    a date, be permitted to put the earliest possible, 1592 or 1593, on their
                    unseemly boisterousness. In 1593 was ready for the printer, though not, it would
                    seem, published till 1596, a far more worthy work, the charming and singular
                    fragment called <hi rend="italic">Orchestra,</hi> a little epic written in
                    praise of dancing, in fifteen consecutive days. The poet seeks to prove that
                    every harmonious movement of nature, every action of the elements, every motion
                    in the firmament, is a conscious and well-ordered dance; also that plants in
                    growing, men in all their familiar and noble exercises, the angels themselves,
                    and all the mysterious translunary world effect a solemn dancing in their
                    motion. <hi rend="italic">Orchestra</hi> was dedicated to the author’s “very
                    friend,” Master Richard Martin, a riotous youth whom, in the winter of 1597,
                    Davies, the friendshaving quarrelled, attacked with a cudgel in the hall of the
                    Middle Temple. For this offence he was expelled and degraded. Rusticating at
                    Oxford, he spent the first year after his expulsion in the composition of his
                    great philosophical poem, <hi rend="italic">Nosce Teipsum,</hi> which appeared
                    in 1599. It is on this work that his fame mainly rests. The style was entirely
                    novel in that age; and its force, eloquence, and ingenuity, no less than the
                    modern and polished tone of the periods, made it at once extremely popular. It
                    was to its own age all that Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> was to
                    the Georgian period. In the same year, 1599, there saw the light a little book
                    of exquisite lyrics from the same hand, <hi rend="italic">Hymns to A
                    strata,</hi> twenty-six acrostics on the words <hi rend="italic">Elisabetha
                    Regina,</hi> which all warble with the most delightful sweetness. In 1601 Davies
                    was restored to his position at the bar, without loss of seniority. About the
                    same time he sat in Elizabeth’s last Parliament, as member for C’orfe Castle. At
                    Elizabeth’s death he was instantly received with great favour by James I., and
                    sent to Ireland as solicitor-general in 1603. On December 18 of that year he was
                    knighted at Dublin. From this time forth he abandoned poetry in favour of the
                    most active statesmanship. His activities in Ireland were almost ubiquitous. In
                    1606 he was further promoted to be attorney-general for Ireland, and created
                    sergeant-at-arms. In the disordered condition of the country he was required to
                    be stirring at all times, and his abilities seem to have been as conspicuous as
                    his trustworthiness and uprightness. He married Eleanor, daughter of the earl of
                    Castlehaven, but she unfortunately became insane. In 1612 Davies published his
                    valuable prose work, <hi rend="italic">A Discourse of the True Reasons why
                    Ireland has never been entirely subdued.</hi> The same year he represented the
                    county of Fermanagh in the Irish Parliament, and was elected speaker. In 1614 he
                    represented Newcastle-under-Lyne in the English Parliament, and in 1619 he threw
                    up his appointments in Ireland. In 1622 he issued a collected edition of his
                    poetical works. In 1626 Davies was appointed lord chief justice of England, but
                    ere he could enter on the office, he was found dead in his bed (December 8), the
                    victim, it was supposed, of apoplexy.</p>
                <p>The prose writings of this remarkable man were mainly posthum ous, and no attempt
                    was made to collect them, until they were republished in four volumes by the
                    Rev. A. B. Grosart, in 1876, with a full and interesting biography. The poetical
                    works have often been reproduced since the author’s lifetime.</p>
                <p>Sir John Davies is not to be confounded with <hi rend="smallcaps">John
                    Davies</hi> of Hereford, a contemporary author of a great quantity of verse, of
                    which <hi rend="italic">The Holy Roode</hi> (1609), <hi rend="italic">The
                    Scourge of Folly</hi> (1611), and <hi rend="italic">The Muses' Sacrifice</hi>
                    (1612) are fair typical examples. Gifted with extraordinary volubility and
                    self-confidence, but with no delicacy or taste the writings of this John Davies
                    have survived more by reason of their bulk and their accidental interest of
                    reference or dedication than from any intrinsic merit.</p>
