                    which had ruled in Gallipoli, Andros, Riva, and other places in Greece; and his
                    uncle was patriarch of Grado. The story goes that he lost his sight from having
                    been subjected by Manuel, the emperor of Constantinople, to whom he had been
                    sent by Venice as ambassador, to the ancient punishment of “abbasination,”—to
                    adopt a foreign word for a thing which, happily, is nameless in our language.
                    This torture consisted in compelling the victim to gaze into a polished metal
                    <hi rend="italic">basin,</hi> which concentrated the rays of the sun till the
                    excess of light destroyed the eye. Some of the Venetian historians, however,
                    deny this story, and represent his blindness as having resulted from a wound
                    received in fight. When he was elected doge, at the age of seventy-two, Venice
                    was involved in a war with Pisa, which he brought in two naval battles to a
                    successful conclusion. But the events which have made his name a marked one in
                    history occurred yet nearer to the end of his long career. In 1201 the chivalry
                    of Christendom was about to embark in the 4th crusade,—by some historians
                    reckoned the 5th,—and a request was made to Venice to give the crusaders
                    passage, and furnish them with vessels for transport. Dandolo received the
                    messengers who came with those demands favourably. There is reason to think that
                    the Venetian was not moved by any great degree of crusading enthusiasm; but Zara
                    had thrown off the yoke of Venice; and, as Venetian writers add, the old doge
                    had not forgiven the infamous treatment he had received at the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0838-0803"/> hands of the Greeks. There does not, however,
                    seem to be any necessity for supposing that any personal considerations of such
                    a kind were needed to impel him to a policy which was doubtless animated by far
                    larger and wider views. The old doge made a hard bargain with the emissaries of
                    the crusaders for the use of the galleys of the republic; and when, at the
                    moment of departure, it turned out, as he had expected, that they had not money
                    enough to pay the stipulated price, he insisted that, in lieu of it, the
                    expedition should first reduce Zara. Dandolo himself, on this being with some
                    difficulty agreed to, took the cross and assumed the command of the fleet. Zara
                    was besieged, taken, pillaged, and restored to the domain of the republic. The
                    expedition then proceeded to the greater enterprize of attacking Constantinople,
                    in which, led by Dandolo, it was equally successful. But it was not till the
                    young Emperor Alexis had been murdered in a revolt of the Greeks of
                    Constantinople that Dandolo opened to the crusading expedition a proposal that
                    they should seize on the city and on the Greek empire. The counsel was accepted,
                    w^th a success due in a great measure to the conduct and valour of the blind
                    octogenarian doge. Constantinople was pillaged, and booty to an incredible
                    amount was divided among the Venetians and the French.<note anchored="true"

                    A more correct notion of the terrible details may be obtained by comparing the
                    Frenchman’s account with that of Nicetas Acominatus, the Greek
                    historian.</p></note> Dandolo might have been crowned emperor instead of Baldwin
                    of Flanders. Whether he declined in accordance with his own judgment, or whether
                    Venice would not permit a citizen of hers to become an emperor, is uncertain. At
                    all events the old doge showed himself once again as good at a bargain as at a
                    fight. He obtained for Venice a very full share of the plunder, both of
                    dominions and of movable property, as well as of useful privileges exacted, with
                    a shrewd and far-seeing eye, to future advantages. Among the booty secured for
                    Venice were the celebrated four horses, now once more, after their journey to
                    Paris, on the west front of the church of St Mark. Enrico Dandolo, first doge of
                    the name, died in 1205, one year after the establishment of the Latin empire at
                    Constantinople. (See Gibbon, <hi rend="italic">Decline and Fall,</hi> ch.
                    60).</p>
                <p>The eldest son of this Enrico, Fantino, was patriarch of Constantinople; and the
                    second, Rainieri, was procuratore di St Marco. He was killed in Candia in 1213.
                    Giberto, known in Venetian history as successful in naval warfare against the
                    Genoese in 1260, was the son of Rainieri, and his son Giovanni, elected doge in
                    1280, ruled the republic till 1289, and was the father of that Andrea Dandolo of
                    whom it is related, that having been unsuccessful in a naval fight against the
                    Genoese, and being prisoner on board one of the enemy’s galleys, he knocked his
                    brains out by beating his head against the mast.</p>
                <p>The Dandolo family gave two other doges to the republic. Francisco was elected in
                    1318, and died in 1339, and is known in history as Dandolo “Cane,” “Dog
                    Dandolo,” not from having humiliated himself before Clement V., when imploring
                    the pontiff to become reconciled to Venice, as Sismondi writes in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Biograpliie Universelie,</hi> but from “Cane” having been an old
                    family name. Andrea Dandolo was elected doge in 1342 at the exceptionally
                    youthful age of thirty-six, and ruled the republic till 1354. This Andrea was a
                    student and a man of letters, and an intimate friend of Petrarch, some of whose
                    letters to him are extant. He wrote two chronicles of Venice, one of which was
                    published in the 12th volume of the <hi rend="italic">Rerum Italicarum
                    Scriptores</hi> of Muratori, while the other is extant in MS. He is said to have
                    died of a broken heart, caused by the successes of Paganino Doria and the
                    Genoese fleet in the Adriatic.</p>
