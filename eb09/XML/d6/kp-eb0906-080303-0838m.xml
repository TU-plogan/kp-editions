                    controversy as to the origin and significance of this book has passed through so
                    many phases, and the collateral arguments are so apt to obscure those on which
                    the question really hinges, that a simpler mode of treatment than is customary
                    in theological works seems to be here desirable. Instead of beginning with the
                    second-part of Daniel (vii.-xii.), which professes to contain circumstantial
                    predictions, and is consequently difficult to treat without some reference to
                    “burning questions” <hi rend="italic">of</hi> theology, we shall first survey
                    the narrative-portion (l-vi.) from an historical point of view, and inquire how
                    far the names, ideas, customs, and historical allusions in it agree with the
                    facts known to us from other sources. Our chief guide will be a critical study
                    of the cuneiform inscriptions.</p>
                <p>(1.) As to the names. The writer of Daniel evidently supposes that Belteshazzar
                    is compounded with the name of Bel, or Merodach, the favourite god of
                    Nebuchadnezzar (see iv. 8). It appears, however, that the word has no connection
                    with Bel, and it is most probably a corruption of Balatsu-usur, “his life
                    protect.” Ashpenaz, Shadrach, and Meshach are quite out of keeping with
                    Babylonian scenery; they cannot be explained at all. Arioch, on the other hand,
                    may be from the primitive Accadian name En-akil (Lenormant), though the revival
                    of such a name is rather surprizing. Hamelsar (i. 11) may perhaps be a corrupt
                    form of a Babylonian name, as Abed-nego (from Abed-nebo) certainly is. The form
                    Nebuchadnezzar, for Nebuchadrezzar, is not peculiar to Daniel, and can hardly be
                    used in argument. (2.) Traces of Babylonian ideas have been most industriously
                    sought for by Mr Fuller, but they are too uncertain to be of any appreciable
                    value. Who can believe that that fine appellation, “the Ancient of days” (vii.
                    22), is derived from the eternally self-begotten Hea (the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n839/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0839-0804"/> god of the waters), when there is so obvious a
                    source for the phrase in the second part of Isaiah, or that “like a son of the
                    gods” (iii. 25) means, “like the divine fire-god Bar ?” Nor is M. Lenormant much
                    more fortunate in his supposed discovery of a reference to Nebuchadnezzar’s
                    equally supposed recognition of one supreme deity. The fact is that the greater
                    gods of Babylonia at this period were two in number, viz., Maruduk (Merodach)
                    and Nabu (Nebo), who are coupled, for instance, by Nebuchadnezzar in the great
                    inscription translated by M. Oppert. (3.) There are in Daniel three undoubted
                    points of agreement with Babylonian custom, viz., the punishment of burning
                    alive (iii. 6), the description of the dress of the courtiers (iii. 21), and the
                    mention of the presence of women at feasts (v. 2). On the other hand, there is
                    (a) a striking inaccuracy in the use of the term “Chaldeans” for “astrologers.”
                    This use is directly opposed by the cuneiform inscriptions, and it is useless
                    (in the face of Hebrew etymology) to meet this fact by an imaginary
                    correspondence of the three names for the wise men in the book of Daniel to the
                    three leading classes of magicians, &amp;c., mentioned in the inscriptions. (6)
                    There is also (as M. Lenormant has observed) an error in the use of the Assyrian
                    <hi rend="italic">salcnu</hi> (reproduced in the Aramaic of ii. 48), which
                    really means “a high civil officer,” but is used in Daniel in the sense of
                    arch-magician. (4.) The points of disagreement between the book of Daniel and
                    Babylonian history have probably been exaggerated. It is true the former tells
                    us many strange things of Nebuchadnezzar, who is only known in history as a
                    great warrior, a great builder, and a great patron of learning. His lycanthropy
                    is not mentioned in any historical documents as yet dis covered; to quote
                    Berosus (ap. Josephus, <hi rend="italic">contr. Ap.</hi> i. 20) is entirely
                    beside the mark, as Hilgenfeld and Mr Fuller have convincingly shown. The
                    statements respecting Belshazzar have been in part confirmed. Bilu-sarra-usur is
                    the name of the eldest son of Nabu-nahid or Nabonadius, and a dated tablet in
                    the British Museum, recently obtained from Babylon, proves that the last king of
                    Babylon was Maruduk-sarra-usur, which may be the same name as Belshazzar, since
                    Maruduk is identical with Bel-Merodach. Jt must be confessed, however, that
                    Belshazzar was not the son of Nebuchadnezzar, as appears to be stated in Dan. v.
                    2, 11, 18, 22. This has been met by the assertion that “son” in Dan. v. means
                    “grandson;” but that Belshazzar was even the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar is still
                    unproved, not to mention the strangeness of interpreting “thy father” in v. 11
                    as = “my father” (on the hypothesis that Belshazzar’s mother was daughter of
                    Nebuchadnezzar). The most puzzling discrepancy, however, relates to the name of
                    the Medo-Persian king, who “received” from God’s hands the “distributed”
                    Babylonian empire (v. 28, 31). The book of Daniel states (v. 31) that this was
                    Darius the Mede; profane history asserts that it was Cyrus the Persian. Many
                    attempts have been made to reconcile these opposing state ments. Some thi nk
                    that Darius the Mede was Astyages, but there is a chronological difficulty;
                    others, Cyaxares II., but we are not certain that such a king existed; while Des
                    Vignoles and M. Lenormant would make him a Median prince, rewarded by Cyrus for
                    his fidelity with the vassal kingship of Babylon. Unfortunately this Median
                    prince is at present even more shadowy than Cyaxares II. “The inscriptions,”
                    remarks Mr G. Smith, “have as yet afforded no information on this point.” But
                    this is not the only difficulty about Darius the Mede. In ix. 1 we are told that
                    he was the son of Ahasuerus, who on philological grounds must be identified with
                    Xerxes. This, when taken in conjunction with the facts concerning Belteshazzar,
                    suggests that the author or editor fell into three errors, by supposing (1) that
                    the conqueror of Babylon was not Cyrus but Darius I.; (2) that Darius I. came
                    after, instead of before, Xerxes; and (3) that he was son, whereas he was really
                    father, of that monarch. There are two “undesigned coincidences,” to be
                    mentioned presently, which appear to confirm this view.</p>
                <p>Thus far the evidence preponderates against the theory that the narratives in the
                    book of Daniel—or, to be quite safe, let us say the narratives in their present
                    form—were written by a resident in Babylon. Two other historical inaccuracies
                    ought not to be slurred over, though they are certainly unfavourable to the
                    authorship of Daniel. One is the chronological statement in i. 1. It may fairly
                    be urged (a) that, if the battle of Carchemish took place in the fourth year of
                    Jehoiakim (Jer. xlvi. 2), Jerusalem cannot have been captured in the third; and
                    (6) that, our one certainly contemporary authority, the prophet Jeremiah,
                    nowhere alludes to a captivity at this period. The other is the statement (vi.
                    1) that Darius the Mede appointed 120 satraps (so in the Hebrew), whereas Darius
                    Hystaspis only mentions 23 satrapies <hi rend="italic">{Records of the
                    Past,</hi> vii. 88). A similar apparent confusion between satrapies and inferior
                    governments appears in the Alexandrine translation of 1 Kings x. 15. This
                    translation was made in the Greek period; presumably, therefore, the book of
                    Daniel was written (or edited) in the Greek period. This, it should be added, is
                    one of the “undesigned coincidences” which confirm a view mentioned above
                    respecting “Darius the Mede.”</p>
                <p>We now go on to a class of arguments, which, even more obstinately than those
                    based upon history, refuse to lend themselves to theological prepossession. From
                    the Hebrew of the book of Daniel.no important inference as to its date can
                    safely be drawn. It is true, Aramaisms abound, but this feature is common to all
                    the later books of the Old Testament. Nor, in spite of the assertions of
                    controversial writers on both sides, can any argument be based on the fact
                    (strange as it seems) that the book of Daniel is written in two languages or
                    dialects, i. 1—ii. 4a and viii.-xii. being in Hebrew, and ii. 46—vii. 28 in
                    Aramaic (miscalled Chaldee). The philological data (which will be found
                    collected in Dr Pusey’s <hi rend="italic">Daniel the Prophet,</hi> pp. lxvii.
                    44-57) have been most variously interpreted. Hitzig inferred that the Aramaic of
                    Daniel was later than that of Ezra; Hengstenberg. Dr Pusey, and especially the
                    late Professor McGill, that Ezra’s was later than Daniel’s. But the truth seems
                    to be that the evidence is insufficient to determine the question. The
                    Massorites aimed at making the language of the Old Testament (Aramaic as well as
                    Hebrew) uniform, though they did not carry out their plan thoroughly, and
                    allowed not a few vestiges of older stages of the language to remain. It is
                    impossible therefore to decide <hi rend="italic">ex cathedra</hi> that the later
                    forms in Daniel or Ezra have not arisen from this levelling procedure of the
                    Jewish critics. A similar controversy has arisen as to the relation of the
                    Aramaic of the Old Testament to that of the Targums. Dr Pusey and others
                    maintain that they are separated by a wide interval of time; but recent
                    researches have shown that the official Targum, or Aramaic translation, of the
                    Pentateuch, the earlier historical books, and the prophets, was thrown into its
                    present form at Babylon on the basis of a work composed in Palestine. Now the
                    Aramaic of Babylon was different from that of Palestine; still, on the whole, as
                    Noldeke rightly says, the Aramaic of the official Targum is only a rather later
                    development of the Aramaic of Daniel and Ezra, which is therefore presumably
                    Palestinian. It does not, however, follow that the whole book was written in
                    Palestine. The correct translation of Dan. ii. 4 seems to be—“And the Chaldeans
                    spoke unto the king (Aramaic);” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> that which follows
                    from this point to the end of chap. vii. is extracted from an Aramaic document
                    Now, considering the careless treatment <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n840/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0840-0805"/> extended to the book of Daniel (see the
                    Septuagint version of it), it is quite possible, as M. Lenormant suggests, that
                    the original Hebrew of Dan. ii. 46-vii. 28 was lost, and its place supplied by
                    the Aramaic translation. There is an exact parallel (not mentioned by M.
                    Lenormant) in Jer. x. 11, which appears only to exist in an Aramaic version.</p>
                <p>The remaining linguistic evidence is supplied by certain Persian and Greek words
                    in the book of Daniel. This will retain its importance, even if we adopt M.
                    Lenormant’s theory of a substituted Aramaic translation, for a translator
                    writing in a kindred dialect, would be tolerably precise in reproducing
                    technical terms,—at any rate, would not succeed in expunging all traces of the
                    original. (1) The book contains (see Mr Fuller’s second excursus) at least nine
                    words which are referred, in most cases with certainty, to a Persian origin. It
                    must be remembered that no Persian words occur in Daniel’s supposed
                    contemporary— Ezekiel, nor even in Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. There are
                    some, it is true, in Ezra and in Esther, but those books were written long after
                    the beginning of the Persian rule. (2) The three Greek words in Daniel admitted
                    by Delitzsch are all names of musical instruments—/adapts, <hi rend="italic"
                    >^aXrript.ov, a-vp.&lt;l&gt;&lt;Dvia.</hi> The reproduction is (philologically)
                    so exact that they must have been taken from the lips of a Greek, and this,
                    according to M. Lenormant’s presentation of the facts, was impossible before the
                    age of the Seleucidae, since the commercial intercourse between Greece and
                    Babylonia was not “considerable nor consecutive enough” to admit of it at an
                    earlier period.</p>
                <p>The third class of facts to be reckoned with are the internal difficulties in the
                    admission of the authorship of Daniel. Putting aside those which raise questions
                    of theology, we may mention the two following as specimens :— (a) In ii. 25
                    Arioch speaks of Daniel as merely “one of the captives of Judah,” and as
                    personally unknown to the king. This seems inconsistent with chap, i., and
                    consequently unlikely to have been written by Daniel, <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi>
                    No subsequent mention is made of the offices to which Daniel and his three
                    friends, according to ii. 48, were promoted, not even in the narrative in chap.
                    iii. The former of these seems the more important. An exact parallel occurs in 1
                    Sam. xvii. 55-6, where Saul professes himself entirely unacquainted with David,
                    and this after the latter had been constantly playing the harp before him (chap.
                    xvi. 23). Now, critics of such opposite opinions as Thenius and Nagelsbach agree
                    that the solution of the difficulty in 1 Sam. is the reference of the respective
                    passages to different documents. It has been urged, therefore, that the same
                    theory will at once account for the inconsistencies in Daniel, and that the
                    narratives at any rate were most likely written at different times, possibly by
                    different authors, and certainly not by Daniel himself (as Mr Russell Martineau
                    has cogently shown). These various narratives would naturally be connected by an
                    editor, and to this editor we may be indebted for the second of the “undesigned
                    coincidences” referred to above as confirming the supposition of a mistake as to
                    the date and the acts of Darius the Mede; for the name of Cyrus only occurs in
                    three passages (L 21; vi. 28; x. 1), and may have been inserted by the editor
                    (who knew that Cyrus, not Darius, conquered Babylon) with the object of bringing
                    the book into somewhat closer accordance with profane history. It is gratifying
                    to state that the fundamental principle of this theory has been conceded by such
                    orthodox writers as Mr Fuller and M. Lenormant. “In its present form,” says the
                    former, “the book possesses peculiarities of an internal character which seem to
                    suggest a certain extraneous aid perfectly compatible with the recognition of
                    its unity and authority” <hi rend="italic">(Speaker's Commentary,</hi> vi. 229).
                    M. Lenormant’s view has already been mentioned; we need only add that he puts
                    down all the errors of the narrative chapters in Daniel to the copyists or
                    translators, and that he finds a truthfulness of Babylonian colouring piercing
                    through the injuries of time, which can only be accounted for by ascribing the
                    original work to the prophet Daniel Colder and more critical students will
                    naturally go further. They will not perhaps deny the unity of authorship. The
                    inconsistencies of the narratives are at most a proof of their separate origin;
                    and the 12th chapter of Enoch (an apocalyptic work like Daniel) supplies a
                    parallel which has been hitherto overlooked to the transition from the third
                    person to the first in Dan. vii. 1, 28. There is, further, a general similarity
                    of style between the Hebrew and the Aramaic portions, and (especially) a marked
                    parallelism of contents between chaps, vii. and ii., which is not favourable to
                    a diversity of authorship. But there is a growing feeling that the narratives in
                    the book before us could not have been the work of a resident in Babylon. There
                    may,it is allowed, be an element of historical tradition in them; but, if so, we
                    have not at present the means of detecting it. The narratives, however, have
                    quite sufficient merit regarded from the point of view of edification. If we
                    only place ourselves in the position of the later Jews, we shall perhaps faintly
                    realize the stirring effect they must have produced. We shall then no longer be
                    surprized at the improbability of many of the details, which has given rise to
                    so much unnecessary ridicule. Admiration will be our only feeling, when we
                    consider the author’s comparative success in reproducing a distant past. It is
                    possible, no doubt, that he derived some part of these narratives from Jewish or
                    Babylonian popular stories, for we find a Daniel already celebrated for his
                    wisdom in Ezekiel (xxviii. 3, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> xiv. 14, 20), and the
                    Babylonian Abydenus has a legend distantly resembling Dan. iv. But even if we
                    admit this conjecture, the historical setting, the moral purpose, and the skill
                    in presentation are all his own, and reflect dimly as it may be the spirit and
                    the power of the writers of the Pentateuchal histories.</p>
                <p>We may now proceed to the next stage in the argument, and inquire which is the
                    earliest period to which the narratives of Daniel can apply I The third chapter
                    of the book suggests an answer. There (see ver. 5) we meet with a Greek musical
                    instrument called symphonia (probably a kind of bag-pipe; A. V., wrongly
                    “dulcimer ”), which, as we learn from Polybius <hi rend="italic">(Athen.,</hi>
                    x. 52), was a special favourite of Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria, the
                    notorious persecutor of the Jews. If, therefore, the period of this king
                    (175-164 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> suits the remainder of the work, the
                    clue to the book of Daniel has been found. One reserve must, however, be made.
                    If any historical evidence should be forthcoming in favour of M. Lenormant’s
                    view stated above,—if, in a word, an earlier recension of the book of Daniel
                    should be discovered,—it will become necessary to revise or abandon the
                    foregoing argument.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of the second part of Daniel (viL-xii.) is greatly increased by
                    the necessity of making some assumptions with a view to its interpretation.
                    Those of one class of critics are based upon a tradition, reaching back as far
                    as the Christian era (see Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Antiq.,</hi> x. 11, 7),
                    that the statements of the book of Daniel are literally true; those of another
                    class upon the theory, resulting from the study of the undisputed prophecies on
                    the one hand and of the apocalyptic literature on the other, that the prominence
                    of minute circumstantial prediction, and the absence of a moral, hortatory
                    element, are the distinguishing marks of an artificial, apocalyptic imitation of
                    prophecy. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Apocalyptic Literature.)</hi> The latter
                    class of critics hold that the “analogy of prophecy” is an exegetical argument
                    equal in importance to that of the “analogy of faith” in dogmatics. The only
                    attempt to mediate between <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n841/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0841-0806"/> the two positions is that of Zockler, who, while
                    believing that the book as a whole is the work of Daniel, is of opinion that the
                    most circumstantial passage (xi. 5-39) has been in some parts interpolated by a
                    contemporary of Antiochus Epiphanes. He thus unintentionally supplements the
                    theory as to the narrative-chapters held by M. Lenormant. The second part of
                    Daniel is occupied with a series of visions and angelic communications, chiefly
                    descriptive of the stages through which the empire of the world had passed, or
                    was about to pass, between Nebuchadnezzar and the latter days. Of these visions,
                    the last (x.-xii.) is the most important. In the form of prediction, the angel
                    who discourses with Daniel communicates the history of the kingdoms to which
                    Palestine was attached from the time of Cyrus to that of Antiochus Epiphanes.
                    This is followed by a de cription of the deliverance and glorification of the
                    Israelites in the Messianic period (using the word in a wide sense), which is
                    here represented as immediately supervening on the Syrian persecution. The
                    second vision (chap, viii.) has an equally clear reference to Antiochus
                    Epiphanes (the “little horn”). What the writer can have meant by “2300
                    evening-mornings” is confessedly most obscure; and the statement that the
                    “shameless king” (Antiochus, ver. 23) should fall by a sudden divine
                    interposition (ver. 25,</p>
                <p>Job xxxiv. 20) is one of those inconsistencies with profane history which mark
                    the second as well as the first part of’ Daniel. To the second “beast” of the
                    second vision corresponds, by its description, the fourth beast of the first
                    (chap, vii.); consequently both signify the Greek empire of Alexander and his
                    successors. This is now becoming the prevalent view; it is that of Delitzsch and
                    Dr Westcott, no less than of Ewald and Bleek, but is opposed by the
                    “traditional” theory still upheld by Dr Pusey, which makes the fourth empire
                    that of Rome. Of the dream of the image in chap, ii., the inter pretation of
                    which depends on that of chap, vii., our lirnLs preclude us from speaking. The 9
                    th chapter is as instructive as it is difficult. At the very outset it suggests
                    a very late origin for the book by the way in which the prophets are looked back
                    upon (ver. 6, 10) <hi rend="italic">j</hi> and the minute study of the works of
                    the prophets described in ver. 2 seems to many to point to a time when prophetic
                    inspiration had ceased, and the prophetic writings (here called “the books ”)
                    were already collected. Meditating, like one of the later scribes, over the
                    letter of Scripture, Daniel (or the writer who assumed his name) came to the
                    conclusion that the seventy years appointed by Jeremiah for “the desolations of
                    Jerusalem” must have meant seventy weeks of years, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    490 years. The point from which and to which these “weeks”'are to be reckoned
                    is, however, keenly debated. Hengstenberg, following most of the fathers, takes
                    the <hi rend="italic">terminus a quo</hi> to be the 20th year of Artaxerxes (445
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">terminus ad
                    quern</hi> the public appearance of Christ. Dr Pusey prefers for the one the
                    return of Ezra to Jerusalem, in 457 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and for the
                    other the martyrdom of St Stephen, 33 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Dr Kuenen
                    reckons the seventy weeks from the date of Jeremiah’s prediction of the
                    rebuilding of Jerusalem (604 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) to the murder of
                    the high priest Onias III. (170 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). It is true that
                    this does not produce exactly the required number of years, but we ought not,
                    contends Dr Kuenen, to assume that the author was a perfect master of
                    chronology. We need not, however, dwell further on this “perplexed subject,” as
                    it is more than probable that the Hebrew text is unsound. Our view of the second
                    part of the book must be determined by the distinct, not by the obscure,
                    passages. These show that the real centre of the thoughts of the author is
                    Antiochus Epiphanes, and exonerate those critics from the charge of wilfulness,
                    who suppose the book to have been written in the reign of that king. For why,
                    these critics ask, should one of the Jewish exiles at Babylon single out the
                    episode of Antiochus in preference to the far more important crisis of the
                    struggle with Rome? And how is it that the revelation of future events ceases to
                    be in accordance with history precisely when we come to the passage (xi. 40-45)
                    which relates to the closing years of the Syrian king <hi rend="italic"
                    >1</hi></p>
                <p>It would be unjust, however, to writers of the school of Dr Kuenen to slur over
                    the fact that they can offer plausible historical proofs, unconnected with
                    exegesis, which appear to favour a late date for the book of Daniel. Just as in
                    reviewing the first part of the book we found philological evidence of a
                    post-BabyIonian origin, so in the second part there are (according to this
                    school) references to beliefs confessedly post-Babylonian. The doctrine of
                    angels in Daniel is developed to a degree which, it is said, implies a long
                    continuance of Persian influences. In Zechariah we see this doctrine in a less
                    advanced stage. Even the “accuser” angel in Zechariah is still an appellative
                    (“the Satan ”), whereas the book of Daniel not only contains a full system of
                    “first princes” or angels, to whom the government of the world is intrusted, but
                    gives names to two of them (Michael and Gabriel), which, as Dr Kohut has shown,
                    correspond to those of the two Persian archangels, Vohumand and Craosho. The
                    book of Daniel, too, contains the first distinct prediction of a resurrection of
                    the dead (See Cheyne’s <hi rend="italic">Book of Isaiah Chronologically
                    Arranged,</hi> p. 130, par. 5), and the researches of Windischmann, Haug, and
                    Spiegel appear to have shown that this is a genuine Zoroastrian doctrine, traces
                    of it being found in the earliest portions of the Avesta, Now, it is both
                    natural and right to look with suspicion on theories of the importation of
                    foreign ideas among the Old Testament writers, for experience shows that they
                    will rarely stand a critical examination. Still the evidence for a Persian
                    origin (or share in the origin) of the doctrine of the resurrection is so strong
                    as to unite the suffrages of the most opposite writers. Mr Fuller, it is true,
                    has tried to make Babylonian influences equally plausible in the development of
                    this doctrine. But his authority, M. Lenormant, candidly admits that the
                    Babylonian literature only contains the “first germ” of the doctrine which in
                    Daniel has attained an advanced degree of development (Za <hi rend="italic"
                    >Magie chez les Chaldeens,</hi> pp. 155-6).</p>
                <p>We have thus endeavoured to give the leading facts on which the criticism and
                    interpretation of this most interesting book depend. In the present phase of the
                    controversy, two positions only would appear to be philologically tenable. One
                    is that so confidently maintained by M. Lenormant, the eminent Assyriologue, for
                    the first part, and to some extent by Dr Zockler for the second part, which
                    consists in assuming that the original book of Daniel has been interpolated by
                    later hands. The other, that the work is still mainly in the form in which it
                    was written, that its date is in the Maccabean period, and that, as in the case
                    of Deuteronomy (according to most critics) in earlier times, and the apocalyptic
                    writings which preceded and followed the rise of Christianity, the author, in
                    the service of truth, assumed a name which would more than his ow n command the
                    respect of his countrymen. “Such a writer,” thought the late Professor Weir,
                    “however much we may disapprove his procedure, yet, regarding him in the light
                    of his age, we cannot so unhesitatingly condemn. It was not unnatural that the
                    cessation of the voices of the old prophets should have been followed by what
                    may be described as echoes waked up from time to time, and chiefly at critical
                    periods of the national history, in the breasts of sympathizing and enthusiastic
                    disciples” <hi rend="italic">(Academy,</hi> vol. L p. 70) From this point of
                    view, we may perhaps say that the bqok of Daniel is in part an attempted echo of
                    Jeremiah (see Dan. ix. 2).</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n842/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0842-0807"/>
                <p>Still if we accept this as the more natural alternative, we must not suppose that
                    every detail in the narratives of the first part was planned with reference to
                    the Syrian persecution,—Nebuchadnezzar is not a mere double of Antiochus. There
                    is a parallelism, it is true, between the circumstances of the persecuted Jews
                    and the pious friends at Babylon, but it must not be pressed too far. Nor need
                    we suppose that the book was circulated at once as a whole or among all classes
                    of the Jews. The two parts of the work are separable, and the former part
                    displays perhaps too much antiquarian research to be perfectly suitable for
                    general circulation. The “wise men,” who formerly sat “in the gate,” had
                    withdrawn since the time of the Captivity to the student’s chamber; and in the
                    author of Daniel we behold the prototype of the scholar-martyrs and confessors
                    of the Christian church.</p>
