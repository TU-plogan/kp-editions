                    in the English school, was born in the south of Ireland, November 16, 1793. His
                    father farmed a small property he owned near Wexford, and Francis began life in
                    the country, but the death of his father caused the family to remove to Dublin,
                    while he was still a schoolboy, and there his bias to art very quickly developed
                    itself, and superseded any other education. He began to practise drawing at the
                    Royal Dublin Society’s schools; and under a Mr O’Connor, an erratic youth of his
                    own age with national peculiarities, he began painting landscape. The capital of
                    Ireland has never shown very much interest in the arts, but there was a youth
                    then rising who afterwards made his mark in archaeology, if not in his
                    profession of landscape painting, George Petrie, with whom Danby formed an
                    acquaintance; and all three left for London together in 1813. This expedition,
                    undertaken with very inadequate funds, and no aid, quickly came to an end and
                    they had to get home again by walking all the way. At Bristol they made a pause,
                    and Danby finding he could get trifling sums for water-colour drawings, remained
                    there working diligently and sending to the London exhibitions pictures of
                    importance. There his large pictures in oil quickly attracted attention. They
                    were very powerful in effect and imaginative in invention; and, had his Upas
                    Tree and the Delivery of the Israelites from Egypt been produced before a
                    greater man, John Martin, had shown the way to express multitude, vastness, and
                    fabulous wonders in architecture, Danby would be properly considered one of the
                    great men in modern painting. The Upas Tree (1820), his most independent and
                    original picture, is, however, a very noble work, not only in invention but in
                    execution; the poison tree, surrounded by the remains of slaves who have been
                    sent to gather its gum, grows alone in a valley of rocks lit by a ghastly
                    moonlight, which is itself a triumph of art. The Delivery of the Israelites
                    (1825) is much more strictly a derivation from Martin. The Royal Academy,
                    however, elected him into their body on the strength of it, thinking by his
                    means to checkmate that master, who did not aspire to Academic honours. He now
                    left Bristol for London, and in 1828 exhibited his Opening of the Sixth Seal at
                    the British Institution, receiving from that body an honorary premium of 200
                    guineas; and this picture, which was admirably painted, was followed by two
                    others from the Apocalypse, both productions of surprising power, though
                    certainly indebted to the works of a similar species of invention appearing a
                    few years earlier. These were the last of his important and large pictures. He
                    suddenly left London, declaring that he would never live there again, and that
                    the Academy, instead of aiding him, had, somehow or other, used him badly. Some
                    insurmountable domestic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n833/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0833-0798"/> difficulty overtook him also, and for eleven or
                    twelve years he lived on the Lake of Geneva, a Bohemian with boat-building
                    fancies, painting only now and then. He returned to England in 1841, when his
                    sons James and Thomas, who have both followed the art with considerable
                    advantage, were growing up. The only additional pictures it is necessary to
                    mention are the Golden Age, and the Evening Gun, the first begun before he left
                    England, the second painted after his return, when he had taken up his abode at
                    Exmouth, where he died February 9, 1861, in his sixty-eigh th year. His Upas
                    Tree is now i n the South Kensington National Collection by the Townshend
                    bequest, and is held in general respect, but such of his other works as have
                    been lately seen have not maintained his reputation. They have the hot tone and
                    opacity of bronze, and reveal the secret that they have been produced in a
                    darkened studio, and irrespective of the facts and even of the sentiment of
                    living nature. Notwithstanding these drawbacks they must be always interesting
                    from their imaginative motives, and undoubtedly play a noticeable part in the
                    history of English landscape art.</p>
