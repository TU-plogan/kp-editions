                    (1731-1802), man of science and poet, was born at Elton, in Nottinghamshire, on
                    the 12th December 1731. Having studied at St John’s College, Cambridge, and at
                    Edinburgh, and taken the degree of M.D. at the latter university, he settled as
                    a physician at Lichfield, and gained a large practice. While here he is said to
                    have done much, both by his own example and by more direct effort, to diminish
                    drunkenness among the lower classes. In 1781 he removed to Derby, where he
                    remained till his death, which took place on the 1 Sth April 1802. The fame of
                    Erasmus Darwin as a poet rests upon his <hi rend="italic">Botanic Garden,</hi>

                    Garden</hi> (the second part of which— <hi rend="italic">The Loves of the
                    Plants—</hi> was published anonymously in 1789, and the whole of which appeared
                    in 1791) is a long poem in the decasyllabic rhymed couplet. Its merit lies in
                    the genuine scientific enthusiasm and interest in nature which pervade it; and
                    of any other poetic quality—except a certain, sometimes felicitous but oftener
                    ill-placed, elaborated pomp of words— it may without injustice be said to be
                    almost destitute. It was for the most part written laboriously, and polished
                    with unsparing care, line by line, often as be rode from one patient to another,
                    and it occupied the leisure hours of many years. The diction is artificial to a
                    degree which renders it in emotional passages stilted and even absurd, and which
                    makes Canning’s clever caricature— <hi rend="italic">The Loves of the
                    Triangles</hi> —often remarkably like the poem it satirizes; in some passages,
                    however, it is not without a stately appropriateness. Gnomes, sylphs, and
                    nereids are introduced on almost every page, and personification is carried to
                    an extraordinary excess. Thus he describes the <hi rend="italic">Loves of the
                    Plants</hi> according to the Linnsean system by means of a most ingenious but
                    misplaced and amusing personification of each plant, and often even of the parts
                    of the plant. It is significant that botanical notes are added to the poem, and
                    that its eulogies of scientific men are frequent. Darwin’s mind was in fact
                    rather that of a man of science than that of a poet. His most important
                    scientific work is his <hi rend="italic">Zoonomia</hi> (1794-6), which contains
                    a system of pathology, and a treatise on generation, in which Darwin, in the
                    words of his famous grandson, “anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of
                    opinions of Lamarck.” The essence of Darwin’s views is contained in the
                    following passage, which he follows up with the conclusion “that one and the
                    same kind of living filaments is and has been the cause of all organic life
                    —</p>
                <p>“Would it be too bold to imagine that, in the great length of time since the
                    earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the
                    history of mankind,—would it be too bold to imagine that all warm-blooded
                    animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great First Cause
                    endued, with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new
                    propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations,
                    and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent
                    activity, and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its
                    posterity, world without end!”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Observations on the Zoonomia</hi> were published by Thomas
                    Brown, the psychologist (Edinburgh, 1798). In 1799 Darwin published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Phytologia, or the Philosophy of Agriculture and Gardening</hi>
                    (1799), in which he states his opinion that plants have sensation and volition.
                    A paper on <hi rend="italic">Female Education in Boarding Schools</hi> (1797)
                    completes the list of his works. A slight account of Darwin’s life was published
                    by Anna Seward in 1804.</p>
