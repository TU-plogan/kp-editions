                    (1790—1845), an eminent chemist and physicist, was born in London on the 12th
                    March 1790. From his father, a barrister, he received an excellent classical
                    education; but having from his early years displayed a preference for natural
                    science, he entered a sugar refinery, where he soon effected important
                    improvements in the process. He studied chemistry under Professor Brande, in
                    conjunction with whom he started in 1816 the journal which, shortly after its
                    commencement, became favourably known to scientific men as the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Quarterly Journal of Science and Art.</hi> To this he contributed numerous
                    articles on chemistry and meteorology, including, under the latter head, an
                    interesting account of the ingenious and delicate dew-point hygrometer which is
                    known by his name. In 1823 he collected and published his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Meteorological Essays,</hi> which excited much interest as one of the first
                    attempts to explain the phenomena of the weather on the broad and sure basis of
                    physical science. In 1824 he published an <hi rend="italic">Essay on Artificial
                        Climate considered in its Applications to Horticulture,</hi> which was the
                    means of effecting a radical change in the treatment of tropical plants in
                    colder regions, by showing the necessity of a humid atmosphere in hothouses. As
                    managing director of the Continental Gas Company he interested himself in the
                    manufacture of gas for illuminating purposes, and invented a method of
                    extracting it from resin, which was in practical use for a time. He was one of
                    the founders of the Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge, for which he wrote a
                    treatise on chemistry. In 1831 he was appointed first professor of chemistry in
                    the newly founded King’s College, London. During the succeeding years he was
                    engaged in a series of investigations on heat and electricity, which were of
                    great value in their practical applications. For his register pyrometer, devised
                    to measure high temperatures, he was awarded in 1832 the Rumford medal of the
                    Royal Society. Soon afterwards he received the Copley medal for his invention of
                    the sulphate of copper or constant battery, which, as a substitute for
                    Wollaston’s, effected an immense improvement in the apparatus of voltaic
                    electricity. The Royal medal, the only other honour of the kind in the gift of
                    the society, was bestowed upon him in 1842. In 1839 appeared his <hi
                        rend="italic">Introduction to the Study of Chemical Philosophy,</hi> which
                    dealt very ably with the theory of molecular forces. Four years later the
                    honorary degree of D.C.L. was conferred upon him by the university of Oxford. He
                    had received in 1839 another honour of a different kind in being chosen foreign
                    secretary of the Royal Society. He died suddenly of apoplexy while attending a
                    meeting of the council of the society on the 13th March 1845.</p>
