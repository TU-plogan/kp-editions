                    years of age; and he had translated the <hi rend="italic">Crito of</hi> Plato
                    before he was eleven. His father, a Huguenot who had been one of the
                    conspirators of Amboise, strengthened his Protestant sympathies by showing him,
                    while they were passing through that town on their way to Paris, the heads of
                    the conspirators exposed upon the scaffold, and adjuring him not to spare his
                    own head in order to avenge their death. After a brief residence he was obliged
                    to flee from Paris to avoid persecution, but was captured and condemned to
                    death. Escaping through the intervention of a friend, he went to Montargis. In
                    his fourteenth year he was present at the siege of Orleans, at which his father
                    was killed. His guardian sent him to Geneva, where he studied for a considerable
                    time under the direction of Beza. In 1567 he made his escape from tutelage, and
                    attached himself to the Huguenot army under the prince of Condé Subsequently he
                    joined Henry of Navarre, to whom he rendered valuable service, both as a soldier
                    and as a counsellor, in the wars that issued in his elevation to the throne as
                    Henry IV. His career at camp and court, however, was a somewhat <pb break="no"

                    manner and the keenness of his criticisms, which made him many enemies, and
                    severely tried the king’s patience. In his tragedy <hi rend="italic">Circe,</hi>
                    which was played before the court, he did not hesitate to indulge in the most
                    outspoken sarcasm against the king and other members of the royal family. Though
                    he more than once found it expedient to retire into private life, he never
                    entirely lost the favour of Henry, who made him governor of Maillezais. After
                    the conversion of the king to Roman Catholicism, D’Aubigné remained true to the
                    Huguenot cause, and a fearless advocate of the Huguenot interests. The first two
                    volumes of the work by which he is best known, his <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    Universelle depuis</hi> 1550 <hi rend="italic">jusqu'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >à</hi><hi rend="italic">l an</hi> 1601, appeared in 1616 and 1618 respectively.
                    The third volume was published in 1619, and, being still more free and personal
                    in its satire than those which had preceded it, was immediately ordered to be
                    burned by the common hangman. The work is a lively chronicle of the incidents of
                    camp and court life, and forms a very valuable source for the history of France
                    during the period it embraces. In September 1620 its author was compelled to
                    take refuge in Geneva, where he found a secure retreat for the last ten years of
                    his life, though the hatred of the French court showed itself in procuring a
                    sentence of death to be recorded against him more than once. He devoted the
                    period of his exile to study, and the superintendence of works for the
                    fortifications of Bern and Basel, which were designed as a material defence of
                    the cause of Protestantism. He died at Geneva on the 29th April 1630. He had two
                    sons, one of whom, Constant D’Aubigné, was the father of Madame de
                    Maintenon.</p>
