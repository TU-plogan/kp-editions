                    (1759-1794), one of the most conspicuous actors in the decisive episodes of the
                    first French Revolution. He was born at Arcis-sur-Aube in 1759. His family was
                    of respectable quality, though of very moderate means. They contrived to give
                    him a good education, and he was launched in the career of an advocate at the
                    Paris bar. When the Revolution broke out, it found Danton following his
                    profession with apparent success, leading a cheerful domestic life, and
                    nourishing his intelligence on good books. He first appears in the revolutionary
                    story as president of the popular club or assembly of the district in which he
                    lived. This was the famous club of the Cordeliers, so called from the
                    circumstance that its meetings were held in the old convent of the order of the
                    Cordeliers, just as the Jacobins derived their name from the refectory of the
                    convent of the Jacobin brothers. It is an odd coincidence that the old rivalries
                    of Dominicans and Franciscans in the democratic movement inside the Catholic
                    Church should be recalled by the names of the two factions in the democratic
                    movement of a later century away from the church. The Cordeliers were from the
                    first the centre of the popular principle in the French Revolution carried to
                    its extreme point; they were the earliest to suspect the court of being
                    irreconcilably hostile to freedom; and it was they who most vehemently
                    proclaimed the need for root and branch measures. Danton’s robust, energetic,
                    and impetuous temperament made him the natural leader in such a quarter. We find
                    no traces of his activity in the two great insurrectionary events of 1789—the
                    fall of the Bastille, and the forcible removal of the court from Versailles to
                    the Tuileries. In the spring of 1790 we hear his voice urging the people to
                    prevent the arrest of Marat. In the autumn we find him chosen to be the
                    commander of the battalion of the national guard of his district. In the
                    beginning of 1791 he was elected to the post of administrator of the department
                    of Paris. This interval was for all France a barren period of doubt, fatigue,
                    partial reaction, and hoping against hope. It was not until 1792 that Danton
                    came into the prominence of a great revolutionary chief.</p>
                <p>In the spring of the previous year (1791) Mirabeau had died, and with him had
                    passed away the only man who <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0851-0816"/> was at all likely to prove a wise guide to the
                    court. In June of that year the king and qtieen made a disastrous attempt to
                    flee from their capital and their people. They were brought back once more to
                    the Tuileries, which from that time forth they rightly looked upon more as a
                    prison than a palace or a home. The popular exasperation was intense, and the
                    constitutional leaders, of whom the foremost was Lafayette, became alarmed and
                    lost their judgment. A bloody dispersion of a popular gathering, known
                    afterwards as the massacre of the Champ-de-Mars (July 1791), kindled a flame of
                    resentment against the court and the constitutional party which was never
                    extinguished. The Constituent Assembly completed its infertile labours in
                    September 1791. Then the elections took place to its successor, the short-lived
                    Legislative Assembly. Danton was not elected to it, and his party was at this
                    time only strong enough to procure for him a very subordinate post in the
                    government of the Parisian municipality. Events, however, rapidly prepared a
                    situation in which his influence became of supreme weight. Between January and
                    August 1792 the want of sympathy between the aims of the popular assembly and
                    the spirit of the king and the queen became daily more flagrant and beyond power
                    of disguise. In April, war was declared against Austria, and to the confusion
                    and distraction caused by the immense civil and political changes of the past
                    two years was now added the ferment and agitation of war with an enemy on the
                    frontier. The distrust felt by Paris for the court and its loyalty at length
                    broke out in insurrection. On the memorable morning of the 10th of August 1792,
                    the king and queen took refuge with the Legislative Assembly from the
                    apprehended violence of the popular forces who were marching on the Tuileries.
                    The share which Danton had in inspiring and directing this momentous rising is
                    very obscure. Some look upon him as the head and centre of it. Apart from
                    documents, support is given to this view by the fact that on the morrow of the
                    fall of the monarchy Danton is found in the important post of minister of
                    justice. This sudden rise from the subordinate office which he had held in the
                    commune is a proof of the impression that his character had made on the
                    insurrectionary party. To passionate fervour for the popular cause he added a
                    certain broad steadfastness and an energetic practical judgment which are not
                    always found in company with fervour. Even in those days, when so many men were
                    so astonishing in their eloquence, Danton stands out as a master of commanding
                    phrase. One of his fierce sayings has became a proverb. Against Brunswick and
                    the invaders, <hi rend="italic">“il nous faut de Vaudace,' ft encore de Vaudace,
                    et toujours de Vaudace,”-</hi> —we must dare, and again dare, and for ever dare.
                    The tones of his voice were loud and vibrant. As for his bodily presence, he
                    had, to use his own account of it, the athletic shape and the stern physiognomy
                    of the Liberty for which he was ready to die. Jove the Thunderer, the rebel
                    Satan, a Titan, Sardanapalus, were names that friends or enemies borrowed to
                    describe his mien and port. He was thought about as a coarser version of the
                    great tribune of the Constituent Assembly; he was called the Mirabeau of the
                    sans-culottes, and Mirabeau of the markets.</p>
                <p>In the executive Government that was formed, on the king’s dethronement, this
                    strong revolutionary figure found himself the colleague of the virtuous Roland
                    and others of the Girondins. Their strength was speedily put to a terrible test.
                    The alarming successes of the enemy on the frontier, and the surrender of two
                    important fortresses, had engendered a natural panic in the capital. But in the
                    breasts of some of the wild men whom the disorder of the time had brought to
                    prominent place in the Paris Commune this panic became murderously heated. Some
                    hundreds of captives were barbarously murdered in the prisons. There has always
                    been much dispute as to Danton’s share in this dreadful transaction. At the
                    time, it must be confessed, much odium on account of an imputed direction of the
                    massacres fell to him. On the whole, however, he cannot be fairly convicted of
                    any part in the plan. What he did was to make the best of the misdeed, with a
                    kind of sombre acquiescence. He deserves credit for insisting against his
                    colleagues that they should not flee from Paris, but should remain firm at their
                    posts, doing what they could to rule the fierce storm that was raging around
                    them.</p>
                <p>The elections to the National Convention took place in September, when the
                    Legislative Assembly surrendered its authority. The Convention ruled France
                    until October 1795. Danton was a member; resigning the ministry of justice, he
                    took a foremost part in the deliberations and proceedings of the Convention,
                    until his execution in April 1794. This short period of nineteen months was
                    practically the life of Danton, so far as the world is concerned with him.</p>
                <p>He took his seat in the high and remote benches which gave the name of the
                    Mountain to the thoroughgoing revolutionists who sat there. He found himself
                    side by side with Marat, whose exaggerations he never countenanced; with
                    Robespierre, whom he did not esteem very highly, but whose immediate aims were
                    in many respects his own; with Camille Desmoulins and Phelippeaux, who were his
                    close friends and constant partisans. The foes of the Mountain were the group of
                    the Girondins,— eloquent, dazzling, patriotic, but unable to apprehend the
                    fearful nature of the crisis, too full of vanity and exclusive party-spirit, and
                    too fastidious to strike hands with the vigorous and stormy Danton. The
                    Girondins dreaded the people who had sent Danton to the Convention; and they
                    insisted on seeing on his hands the blood of the prison massacres of September.
                    Yet in fact Danton saw much more clearly than they saw how urgent it was to
                    soothe the insurrectionary spirit, after it had done the work of abolition which
                    to him, as to them too, seemed necessary and indispensable. Danton discerned
                    what the Girondins lacked the political genius to see, that this control of
                    Paris could only be wisely effected by men who sympathized with the vehemence
                    and energy of Paris, and understood that this vehemence and energy made the only
                    force to which the Convention could look in resisting the Germans on the
                    north-east frontier, and the friends of reaction in the interior. “Paris,” he
                    said, “is the natural and constituted centre of free France. It is the centre of
                    light. When Paris shall perish, there will no longer be a republic.”</p>
                <p>Danton was among those who voted for the death of the king (January 1793). He had
                    a conspicuous share in the creation of the famous revolutionary tribunal, his
                    aim being to take the weapons away from that disorderly popular vengeance which
                    had done such terrible work in September. When all executive power was conferred
                    upon a Committee of Public Safety, Danton had been one of the nine members of
                    whom that body was originally composed. He was despatched on frequent missions
                    from the Convention to the republican armies in Belgium, and wherever he went he
                    infused new energy into the work of national liberation. He pressed forward the
                    erection of a system of national education, and he was one of the legislative
                    committee charged with the construction of a new system of government. He vainly
                    tried to compose ,the furious dissensions between Girondins and Jacobins. The
                    Girondins were irreconcilable, and made Danton the object of deadly attack. He
                    was far too robust in character to lose himself in merely personal enmities, but
                    by the middle of May (1793) he had made up his mind that the political
                    suppression of the Girondins had become indispensable. The position of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n852/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0852-0817"/> country was most alarming. Dumouriez, the victor
                    of Valmy and Jemmappes, had deserted. The French arms were suffering a series of
                    checks and reverses. A royalist rebellion was gaining formidable dimensions in
                    the west. Yet the Convention was wasting time and force in the vindictive
                    recriminations of faction. There is no positive evidence that Danton directly
                    instigated the insurrection of May 31 and June 2, which ended in the purge of
                    the Convention and the proscription of the Girondins. He afterwards spoke of
                    himself as in some sense the author of this revolution, because a little while
                    before, stung by some trait of factious perversity in the Girondins, he had
                    openly cried out in the midst of the Convention, that if he could only find a
                    hundred men, they would resist the oppressive authority of the Girondin
                    Commission of Twelve. At any rate, he certainly acquiesced in the violence of
                    the commune, and he publicly gloried in the expulsion of the men who stood
                    obstinately in the way of a vigorous and concentrated exertion of national
                    power. Danton, unlike the Girondins, accepted the fury of popular passion as ,an
                    inevitable incident in the work of deliverance. Unlike Billaud de Varennes, or
                    Hdbert, or any other of the Terrorist party, he had no wish to use this
                    frightful two-edged weapon more freely than was necessary. Danton, in short, had
                    the instinct of the statesman. His object was to reconcile France with herself;
                    to restore a society that, while emancipated and renewed in every part, should
                    yet be stable; and above all to secure the independence of his country, both by
                    a resolute defence against the invader, and by such a mixture of vigour with
                    humanity as should reconcile the offended opinion of the rest of Europe. This,
                    so far as we can make it out, was what was in his mind.</p>
                <p>The position of the Mountain had now undergone a compl ete change. In the
                    Constituent Assembly its members did not number more than 30 out of the 578 of
                    the Third Estate, (n the Legislative Assembly they had not been numerous, and
                    none of their chiefs had a seat. In the Convention for the first nine months
                    they had an incessant struggle for their very lives against the Girondins. They
                    were now (June 1793) for the first time in possession of absolute power. It was
                    not easy, however, for men who had for many months been nourished on the ideas
                    and stirred to the methods of opposition, all at once to develop the instincts
                    of government. Actual power was in the hands of the two committees—that of
                    Public Safety and of General Security. Both were chosen out of the body of the
                    Convention. The drama of the nine months between the expulsion of the Girondins
                    and the execution of Danton turns upon the struggle of the committee to retain
                    power—first, against the insurrectionary commune of Paris, and second, against
                    the Convention, from which the committees derived an authority that was
                    regularly renewed on the expiry of each short term.</p>
                <p>Danton, immediately after the fall of the Girondins, had thrown himself with
                    extraordinary energy into the work to be done. The first task in a great city so
                    agitated by anarchical ferment had been to set up a strong central authority. In
                    this genuinely political task Danton was prominent. He was not a member of the
                    Committee of Public Safety when that body was renewed in the shape that speedily
                    made its name so redoubtable all over the world. This was the result of a
                    self-denying ordinance which he imposed upon himself. It was he who proposed
                    that the powers of the committee should be those of a dictator, and that it
                    should have copious funds at its disposal. In order to keep himself clear of any
                    personal suspicion, he announced his resolution not to belong to the body which
                    he had thus done his best to make supreme in the state. His position during the
                    autumn of 1793 was that of a powerful supporter and inspirer, from without, of
                    the Government which he had been foremost in setting up. Danton was not a great
                    practical administrator and contriver, like Carnot, for instance. But he had the
                    gift of raising in all who heard him an heroic spirit of patriotism and fiery
                    devotion, and he had a clear eye and a cool judgment in the tempestuous
                    emergencies which arose in such appalling succession. His distinction was that
                    he accepted the insurrectionary forces, instead of blindly denouncing them as
                    the Girondins had done. After these forces had shaken down the throne, and then,
                    by driving away the Girondins, had made room for a vigorous Government, Danton
                    perceived the expediency of making all haste to an orderly state. Energetic
                    prosecution of the war, and gradual conciliation of civil hatreds, had been, as
                    we have said, the two marks of his policy ever since the fall of the monarchy.
                    The first of these objects was fulfilled abundantly, partly owing to the energy
                    with which he called for the arming of the whole nation against its enemies. His
                    whole mind was now given to the second of them. But the second of them, alas,
                    was desperate.</p>
                <p>It was to no purpose that, both in his own action and in the writings of Camille
                    Desmoulins (Ze <hi rend="italic">Vieux Cordelier),</hi> of whom he was now and
                    always the intimate and inspirer, he worked against the iniquities of the bad
                    men, like Carrier and Collot d’Herbois in the provinces, and against the
                    severity of the revolutionary tribunal in Paris. The black flood could not at a
                    word or in an hour subside from its storm-lashed fury. The commune of Paris was
                    now composed of men like Hdbert and Chaumette, to whom the restoration of any
                    sort of political order was for the time indifferent. They wished to push
                    destruction to limits which even the most ardent sympathizers with the
                    Revolution condemn now, and which Danton condemned then, as extravagant and
                    senseless. These men were not politicians, they were fanatics; and Danton, who
                    was every inch a politician, though of a vehement type, had as little in common
                    with them as John Calvin of Geneva had with John of Leyden and the Munster
                    Anabaptists. The committee-watched Hebert and his followers uneasily for many
                    weeks, less perhaps from disapproval of their excesses than from apprehensions
                    of their hostility to the committee’s own power. At length the party of the
                    commune proposed to revolt against the Convention and the committees. Then the
                    blow was struck, and the Hdbertists were swiftly flung into prison, and thence
                    under the knife of the guillotine (March 24, 1794). The execution of the
                    H(5bertists was the first victory of the revolutionary Government over the
                    extreme insurrectionary party. But the committees had no intention to concede
                    anything to their enemies on the other side. If they refused to follow the lead
                    of the anarchists of the commune, they were none the more inclined to give way
                    to the Dantonian policy of clemency. Indeed, such a course would have been their
                    own instant and utter ruin. The Terror was not a policy that could be easily
                    transformed. A new policy would have to be carried out by new men, and this
                    meant the resumption of power by the Convention, and the death of the
                    Terrorists. In Thermidor 1794 such a revolution did take place, with those very
                    results. But in Germinal, feeling was not ripe. The committees were still too
                    strong to be overthrown. And Danton seems to have shown a singular heedlessness.
                    Instead of striking by vigour in the Convention, he waited to be struck. In
                    these later days a certain discouragement seems to have come over his spirit.
                    His wife had died during his absence on one of his expeditions to the armies; he
                    had now married again, and the rumour went that he was allowing domestic
                    happiness to tempt him from the keen incessant vigilance proper to the
                    politician in such a crisis. He must have known that he had enemies. Vv hen <pb

                    Danton’s name would have been struck out as a moderate, if Robespierre had not
                    defended him. The committees had deliberated on his arrest soon afterwards, and
                    again it was Robespierre who resisted the proposal. Yet though he had been
                    warned of the lightning that was thus playing round his head, Danton did not
                    move. Either he felt himself powerless, or he rashly despised his enemies. At
                    last Billaud de Varennes, the most prominent spirit of the committee after
                    Robespierre, succeeded in gaining Robespierre over to his designs against
                    Danton. Robespierre was probably actuated by motives of selfish policy, which
                    soon proved the greatest blunder of his life. The Convention, aided by
                    Robespierre and the authority of the committee, assented with ignoble unanimity.
                    On March 30 Danton, Desmoulins, and others of the party were suddenly arrested.
                    Danton displayed such vehemence before the revolutionary tribunal, that his
                    enemies feared lest he should excite the crowd in his favour. The Convention, in
                    one of its worst fits of cowardice, assented to a proposal made by St Just that,
                    if a prisoner showed want of respect for justice, the tribunal might pronounce
                    sentence without further delay. Danton was at once condemned, and led, in
                    company with fourteen others, including Camille Desmoulins, to the guillotine
                    (April 5, 1794). “I leave it all in a frightful welter,” he said; <hi

                    Robespierre will follow me; he is dragged down by me. Ah, better be a poor
                    fisherman than meddle with the government of men !”</p>
                <p>Events went as Danton foresaw. The committees presently came to quarrel with the
                    pretensions of Robespierre. Three months after Danton, Robespierre fell. His
                    assent to the execution of Danton had deprived him of the single great force
                    that might have supported him against the committee. The man who had “saved
                    France from Brunswick” might perhaps have saved her from the White reaction of
                    1794. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">mo.)</hi></p>
