                    St Jean le Rond, Paris, where he was discovered by a commissary of police on the
                    17 th November. It afterwards became known that he was the illegitimate son of
                    the Chevalier Destouches and Madame de Tencin, a lady of somewhat questionable
                    reputation. Whether by secret arrangement with one or other of the parents, or
                    from regard to his exceedingly feeble state, the infant was not taken to the
                    foundling hospital, but intrusted to the wife of a glazier named Rousseau who
                    lived close by. He was called Jean le Rond from the, church near which he was
                    found; the surname D’Alembert was added by himself at a later period. His
                    foster-mother brought him up with a kindness that secured his life-long
                    attachment. When, after he was beginning to be famous, Madame Tencin sent for
                    him and acknowledged the relationship between them, he said that she was only a
                    step-mother, and that the glazier’s wife was his true mother. His father,
                    without disclosing himself, recognized his natural claims by settling upon him
                    while still an infant an annuity of 1200 francs. Furnished in this way with
                    enough to defray the expense of his education he was sent at four years of age
                    to a boarding school, where he had learned all the master could teach him ere he
                    was ten. In 1730 he entered the Mazarin College under the care of the
                    Jansenists, who soon perceived his exceptional talent, and, prompted perhaps by
                    a commentary on the epistle to the Romans which he produced in the first year of
                    his philosophical course, sought to direct it to theology. They checked his
                    devotion to poetry and mathematics, and in the science in which he was to
                    achieve his greatest distinction he received no instruction at college beyond a
                    few elementary lessons from Caron. His knowledge of the higher mathematics was
                    acquired by his own unaided efforts after he had left the college. This
                    naturally led to his crediting himself with the discovery of many truths which
                    he afterwards found had been already established, often by more direct and
                    elegant processes than his own.</p>
                <p>On leaving college he returned to the house of his fostermother, where he
                    continued to live for thirty years. On the advice of his friends he made two
                    successive efforts to add to his scanty income by qualifying himself for a
                    profession. He studied law, and was admitted as an advocate in 1738, but did not
                    enter upon practice. He next devoted himself to medicine, and in order to detach
                    himself effectually from his favourite subject, sent all his mathematical books
                    to a friend, who was to retain them until he had taken his doctor’s degree. His
                    natural inclination, however, proved too strong for him; within a year the books
                    had all been recovered, and he had resolved to content himself with his annuity
                    and give his whole time to mathematics. He led-a simple regular life in the
                    house of the glazier, whose circumstances he contrived somewhat to better out of
                    his limited means. His foster-mother continued to show a warm attachment to him,
                    though she took no interest in his pursuits, and professed something like
                    contempt for his fame. “You will never,” she said, “be anything but a
                    philosopher. And what is a philosopher 1 A fool who plagues himself during his
                    life that men may talk of him after his death.”</p>
                <p>In 1741 D’Alembert received his first public distinction in being admitted a
                    member of the Academy of Sciences, to which he had previously presented several
                    papers, including a <hi rend="italic">Memoire sur le calcul integral</hi>
                    (1739). In this he pointed out some errors in Reinau’s <hi rend="italic">11
                    Analyse demonstree,</hi> which was regarded as a work of high authority. In his
                    <hi rend="italic">Memoire sur la refraction des corps solides</hi> (1741) he was
                    the first to give a theoretical explanation of the familiar and curious
                    phenomenon which is witnessed when a body passes from one fluid to another more
                    dense, in a direction not perpendicular to the surface which separates the two
                    fluids. Two years after his election to a place in the Academy he published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Traite de Dynamique.</hi> The new principle developed in this
                    treatise, known as D’Alembert’s Principle, may be thus stated—“If from the
                    forces impressed on any system of bodies, connected in any manner, there be
                    subtracted the forces which, acting alone, would be capable of producing the
                    actual accelerations and retardations of the bodies, the remaining forces must
                    exactly balance each other.” The effect of this is greatly to simplify the
                    solution of complex dynamical problems by making them problems of statics.</p>
                <p>So early as the year 1744 D’Alembert had applied this principle to the theory of
                    the equilibrium and the motion of fluids; and all the problems before solved by
                    geometricians became in some measure its corollaries. The discovery of this new
                    principle was followed by that of a new calculus, the first trials of which were
                    published in his <hi rend="italic">Reflexions sur le cause generate des
                    Vents,</hi> to which the prize medal was adjudged by the Academy of Berlin in
                    the year 1746, and which was a new and brilliant addition to his fame. He
                    availed himself of the favourable circumstance of the king of Prussia having
                    just terminated a glorious campaign by an honourable peace, to dedicate his work
                    to that prince in the following Latin lines :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hax ego de ventis, dum ventorum ocyot alis Palantes agit
                    Austriacos Fredericas, et orbi, Insignis lawro, ramum preetendit
                    olivas.</hi></p>
                <p>Swifter than wind, while of the winds I write, The foes of conquering Frederick
                    speed their flight; While laurel o’er the hero’s temple bends, To the tir’d
                    world the olive branch he sends.</p>
                <p>This flattering dedication procured the philosopher a polite letter from
                    Frederick, and a place among his literary <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n810/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0810-0775"/> friends. The king made repeated attempts to
                    induce him to settle in Berlin without success. In 1754 he induced D’Alembert to
                    accept a pension of 1200 francs a year, and in 1763 the philosopher visited
                    Berlin, where he was received with great respect. He finally refused on that
                    occasion the office of president of the Academy of Berlin, which had been
                    already offered to him more than once. In 1747 D’Alembert applied his new
                    calculus of partial differences to the problem of vibrating chords, the solution
                    of which, as well as the theory of the oscillation of the air and the
                    propagation of sound, had been given but incompletely by the geometricians who
                    preceded him, and these his masters or his rivals. In 1749 he furnished a method
                    of applying his principles to the motion of any body of a given figure; and he
                    solved the problem of the precession of the equinoxes, determined its quantity,
                    and explained tho phenomenon of the nutation of the terrestrial axis, discovered
                    by Dr Bradley. In 1752 he published a treatise on the Resistance of Fluids, to
                    which he gave the modest title of an <hi rend="italic">Essay,</hi> but which
                    contains a large number of original ideas and new observations. Abput the same
                    time he published, in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of the Academy of
                    Berlin, “Researches concerning the Integral Calculus,” a branch of mathematical
                    science which is greatly indebted to him for the rapid progress it has made in
                    the present century. In his <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur differents points
                    importants du systeme du monde</hi> (1754-6) he perfected the solution of the
                    problem of the perturbations of the planets, which he had presented to the
                    Academy some years before.</p>
                <p>While the studies of D’Alembert were confined to geometry, he was little known or
                    celebrated in his native country. His connections were limited to a small
                    society of select friends; he had never seen any man in high office except the
                    Marquis d’Argenson. Satisfied with an income which furnished him with the
                    necessaries of life, he did not aspire after, opulence or honours; nor had they
                    been hitherto bestowed upon him, as it is easier to confer them on those who
                    solicit them than to look out for men who deserve them. His cheerful
                    conversation, his smart and lively sallies, a happy knack at telling a story, a
                    singular mixture of malice of speech with goodness of heart, and of delicacy of
                    wit with simplicity of manners, rendered him a pleasing and interesting
                    companion; and his company, consequently, was much sought after in the fashion
                    able circles. His reputation at length made its way to the throne, and rendered
                    him the object of royal attention and beneficence. He received also in 1756 a
                    pension from Government, which he owed to the friendship of M. d’Argenson.</p>
                <p><hi> D’Alembert’s</hi> association with Diderot in the preparation of the
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Encyclopedique</hi> led him to take a
                    somewhat wider range than that to which he had hitherto confined himself. He
                    wrote for that work the <hi rend="italic">Discours preliminaire</hi> on the
                    rise, progress, and affinities of the various sciences, which he read to the
                    French Academy on the day of his admission as a, member, the 19th December 1754.
                    Condorcet, in his <hi rend="italic">Eloge,</hi> characterizes it as one of those
                    works which only two or three men in a century could produce. Comprehensive in
                    its plan, and clear in its statement, it deserves this often quoted praise; but
                    it is open to the criticism that the fundamental principle, adopted from Bacon,
                    on which it classifies the sciences is untenable. D’Alembert distinguishes the
                    human faculties into memory, reason, and imagination, and following out that
                    distinction classifies all science under the three heads of history or the
                    science of memory, philosophy or the science of reason, and poetry or the
                    science of imagination. Now, it is obvious that even if these are in each case
                    the faculties primarily concerned, which is not beyond question, no science is
                    the product of any one faculty exclusively. D’Alembert wrote several literary
                    articles for the first two volumes of the Encyclopaedia, after which the work
                    was suppressed for a time. To the remaining volumes he contributed mathematical
                    articles chiefly. One of the few exceptions was the article on “Geneva,” which
                    involved him in a somewhat keen controversy in regard to Calvinism and the
                    suppression of theatrical performances within the town. During the time he was
                    engaged on the Encyclopaedia he wrote a number of literary and philosophical
                    works, which extended his reputation and also exposed him to criticism and
                    controversy, as in the case of his <hi rend="italic">Melanges de Philosophic, d’
                    Histoire, et de Litterature.</hi> His <hi rend="italic">Essai sur la societe des
                    gens de lettres avec les grands</hi> was a worthy vindication of the
                    independence of literary men, and a thorough exposure of the evils of the system
                    of patronage. He broke new ground and showed great skill as a translator in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Traduction de quelques morceaux choisis de Tacite.</hi> One of
                    hi3 most important works was the <hi rend="italic">Elements de Philosophic,</hi>
                    published in 1759, in which he discussed the principles and methods of the
                    different sciences. He maintained that the laws of motion were necessary, not
                    contingent. The work furnished occasion for a renewal of his correspondence with
                    Frederick the Great. A treatise <hi rend="italic">Sur la destruction des
                    Jesuites</hi> (1765) involved him in a fresh controversy, his own share in which
                    was rendered very easy by the violence and extravagance of his adversaries. The
                    list of his more noteworthy literary works is completed by the mention of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ilistoire des membres de i Academic fran^aise,</hi> containing
                    biographical notices of all the members of the Academy who died between 1700 and
                    1772, the year in which he himself became secretary. D’Alembert was much
                    interested in music both as a science and as an art, and wrote <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements de Musique theorique et pratique,</hi> which was based upon the system
                    of Rameau with important modifications and differences.</p>
                <p><hi> D’Alembert’s</hi> fame spread rapidly throughout Europe and procured for him
                    more than one opportunity of quitting the comparative retirement in which he
                    lived in Paris for more lucrative and prominent positions. The offer of
                    Frederick the Great has already been mentioned. In 1762 he was invited by
                    Catherine of Russia to become tutor to her son at a yearly salary of 100,000
                    francs. On his refusal, the offer was repeated with the additional inducement of
                    accommodation for as many of his friends as he chose to bring with him to the
                    Russian capital. D’Alembert persisted in his declinature, and the letter of
                    Catharine was ordered to be engrossed in the minutes of the French Academy. A
                    foreign honour of a different kind had previously been bestowed upon him. In
                    1755, on the recommendation of Pope Benedict XIV., he was admitted a member of
                    the Institute of Bologna. A legacy of £200 from David Hume showed the esteem in
                    which he was held by that philosopher.</p>
                <p><hi> D’Alembert</hi> continued to the end to lead the quiet and frugal life which
                    his limited means, as well as his simple tastes, dictated. He was abstemious in
                    his habits, and never tasted any alcoholic beverages. His later years were
                    saddened by circumstances connected with a romantic attachment he had formed for
                    Mademoiselle de l’Espinasse. He made the lady’s acquaintance at the house of
                    Madame du Deffand, a noted resort of literary men and savans. She nursed him
                    assiduously during an illness he had in 1765, and from that period till her
                    death in 1776 they lived in the same house without any scandal attaching to
                    their intimacy. On her part there seems to have been from first to last nothing
                    more than warm friendship, but his feelings towards her were of a stronger kind,
                    and her death deeply affected him. He never recovered his elasticity of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n811/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0811-0776"/> spirits, though he continued to occupy himself
                    with his favourite pursuits, and to frequent the society of his brother
                    philosophers. After the death of Voltaire (1778), whose friend and correspondent
                    he had been for more than thirty years, he was regarded as the leader of the
                    philosophical party in the Academy. He died on the 29th October 1783.</p>
                <p>The chief features of D’Alembert’s character were benevolence, simplicity, and
                    independence. Though his income was never large, and during the greater part of
                    his life was very meagre, he contrived to find means to support his
                    foster-mother in her old age, to educate the children of his first teacher, and
                    to help various deserving students during their college career. By his practice
                    as well as by the work above referred to <hi rend="italic">(Essai sur la societe
                    des gens de lettres,</hi> &lt;kc.) he did much to destroy the unworthy
                    subserviency of literary and scientific men to the socially great and the
                    politically powerful. If his manner was sometimes plain almost to the extent of
                    rudeness it probably set all the better an example of a much needed reform to
                    the class to which he belonged. The controversy as to the nature of his
                    religious opinions, arising as it did chiefly out of his connection with the
                    Encyclopaedia, has no longer any living interest now that the Encyclopaedists
                    generally have ceased to be regarded with unqualified suspicion by those who
                    count themselves orthodox. It is to be observed, moreover, that as D’Alembert
                    confined himself chiefly to mathematical articles, his work laid him less open
                    to charges of heresy and infidelity than that of some of his associates. The
                    fullest revelation of his religious convictions is given in his correspondence
                    with Voltaire, which was published along with that with Frederick the Great in
                    Bossange’s edition of his works.</p>
                <p>The scientific works of D’Alembert have never been published in a collected form.
                    The most important of them have been mentioned above, with the exception of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Opuscules mathematiques</hi> (1761-80, 8 vols. 4to). His
                    literary and philosophical works were collected and edited by Bastien (Paris,
                    1805, 18 vols. 8vo). A better edition by Bossange was published at Paris, in
