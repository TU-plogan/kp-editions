                    great administrator who was the last of the historic governors-general under the
                    East India Company, and may be ranked with his two most distinguished
                    predecessors, -Warren Hastings and the Marquis Wellesley. The family was founded
                    by Sir John Ramsay, who rescued James VI. in the Gowrie outrage; but there is
                    mention in 1140 of Simon de Ramsay as witness to the grant of Livingston Church
                    in West Lothian; and Sir Alexander Ramsay, whom David II. made sheriff of
                    Teviotdale, was starved to death by the Douglas. The grateful King James made
                    Sir John Lord Ramsay of Barns and Viscount Haddington, and his son obtained a
                    change of the title to Baron Ramsay of Dalhousie. His son was created earl of
                    Dalhousie. The ninth earl was a distinguished Waterloo officer, held high
                    command in Canada, was commander-in-chief in British India previous to 1832, and
                    was created a peer of the United Kingdom as Baron Dalhousie of Dalhousie. He
                    married Miss Broun, the heiress of Coalstoun near Haddington, a woman of
                    remarkable ability and force of character, which she transmitted to her
                    distinguished son, who closely resembled her in features also. He was their
                    third son, but the early death of his brothers, followed by that of their
                    father, made him the tenth earl while yet a youth. For his long and brilliant
                    services in India he received the thanks of Parliament, and the Crown made him
                    marquis, a dignity that passed away with him, his only issue being two
                    daughters, the Lady Susan, married to the Honourable R. Bourke, M.P., brother of
                    the sixth earl of Mayo, and the Lady Edith, first wife of Sir James
                    Fergusson.</p>
                <p>Born in 1812, the boy was educated at Harrow, and entered at Christ Church,
                    Oxford, where he gave bright promise of his future career. The two most
                    remarkable of his fellow-students were Lord Canning and Lord Elgin, who both
                    succeeded their college rival in the viceroy’s seat, and more than once in their
                    public career alluded to the friendship that had united the three. When Lord
                    Ramsay, he attempted, as a follower of Sir Robert Peel, to snatch the
                    representation of Edinburgh from Sir John (afterwards Lord Chancellor) Campbell,
                    and James Abercromby, afterwards Speaker and Lord Dunfermline. He was afterwards
                    elected for the county of Haddington, which he represented for a short time till
                    called to the House of Lords on his father’s death. The duke of Wellington was
                    soon attracted by the industry and ability of the young peer, in whom, moreover,
                    he felt an interest for his father’s sake. When the Whigs went out of office
                    under Lord Melbourne, Sir Robert Peel came into power with three colleagues who
                    were successively to be governor-general,—Lord Ellenborough as president of the
                    Board of Control, Sir H. Hardinge as secretary at war, and Lord Dalhousie as
                    vice-president of the Board of Trade under Mr Gladstone, and in 1844 as
                    president. It was in the Board of Trade that he sowed the seeds of that disease
                    which carried him off in the prime of life. The time was that of the corn-law
                    struggle and, still more to him, of the railway mania. Night and day the
                    president had to work. In 1845he organized that railway department of the Board
                    of Trade, through which in one year he passed, after detailed personal study,
                    .332 projects, involving a capital of £271,000,000, besides many foreign schemes
                    which appealed to the English money-market. At the last hour of November for
                    lodging applications no fewer than 600 schemes were deposited on his table. To
                    him, more than any other man, Great Britain owes its railway system, and if the
                    experienced warning of the over-worked president had been heeded, the disasters
                    of 1847-48 would never have taken place. At the same time the duty of leading
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n812/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0812-0777"/> the com-law debates in the House of Lords fell
                    upon the wearied official. The defeat of Sir Robert Peel at the end of June 1846
                    gave him no respite, for Lord John Russell asked him to remain in office, and
                    again the Whig premier offered the young Conservative peer the office of
                    governorgeneral of India, from which Lord Hardinge was returning alter the first
                    Sikh war.</p>
                <p>Never, since Clive, had any man so young been called to bear such vast
                    responsibilities, and yet, like Clive, he nearly doubled the empire, and adorned
                    his rule with the blessings of peaceful and material reform. Lord Dalhousie was
                    only thirty-five years of age when, on the 12 th January 1848, he assumed at
                    Calcutta that high office which he held for upwards of eight years, or almost as
                    long as the period during which Lord Hastings had been led by troublous times to
                    fill it. Had he remained a cabinet minister, it is not difficult to predict what
                    he might have become in the annals of British statesmanship, but he had even
                    higher work to do in India. Lord Hardinge, guided throughout his policy by the
                    good and great Henry Lawrence, had left the Punjab nominally at peace under a
                    Sikh regency, but really seething with discontent and confusion. To use Lord
                    Dalhousie’s own words in reviewing the situation, the spirit of the whole Sikh
                    people was influenced by the bitterest animosity against us, chief after chief
                    deserted our cause, nearly the whole army and council of regency were openly
                    arrayed against us, the Sikhs courted an Afghan alliance, and the question was
                    no longer one of policy but of national safety. Moolraj, at Mooltan had, in
                    April, murdered the British officers Vans Agnew and Anderson; Herbert Edwardes
                    had in June shown how disaster could be retrieved; by September General Whish
                    was before Mooltan with an avenging force; and on the 5th October the
                    governor-general announced, at a military ball at Barrackpore, a general war
                    against the Sikh Sirdars. Proceeding to the spot like another Clive he
                    conquered, annexed, and reorganized the Punjab in six months. The crowning
                    victory of Gujerat, on the 21st February 1849, followed by the fall of Mooltan,
                    avenged the drawn battle of Chillianwalla, and on the 29th March the Punjab
                    became a British province. Borrowing from administrative experiments on a small
                    scale in Tenasserim and Sind, the governor-general created that non-regulation
                    system, under which military officers and civilians combined have ever since
                    brought up to the ordinary level of our civilized administration the warlike
                    peoples of Northern and the more savage tribes of Central and Eastern India. In
                    the brothers Henry and John Lawrence, assisted by Sir Robert Montgomery and Sir
                    Donald Macleod, Lord Dalhousie found men to work out his plans with such success
                    as to convert the Punjab into the base from which, in 1857, Delhi was taken and
                    the empire was reconquered. He returned to the capital by Bombay, the Straits
                    Settlements, and Burmah, surveying the coast-line of the maguificent dependency
                    which he had thus carried up to its natural boundaries, to the Himalayas from
                    the sea. The experience he thus gained was soon to be used. The king of Upper
                    Burmah violated the treaty of Yandaboo by a gross outrage on certain British
                    traders in the port of Rangoon, and refused atonement. Quoting Lord Wellesley’s
                    maxim, that an insult offered to the British flag at the mouth of the Ganges
                    would be resented as promptly and as fully as at the mouth of the Thames, after
                    every peaceful effort had failed, the Government of India fought the second
                    Burmese war; and, as reparation was still scorned, took possession of the
                    kingdom of Pegu, thus uniting the territories of Arakan and Tenasserim taken in
                    the first war into what is now the compact and prosperous coast province of
                    British Burmah.</p>
                <p>From that time, in 1852, the completed empire has been at peace, save for the
                    Mutiny and little frontier campaigns. Its consolidation now became the great
                    work of the young and triumphant governor-general, who showed on as great a
                    scale as history can present, in a few years, that peace has greater victories
                    than those of war. While in the minute review of his 8| years’ administration
                    Lord Dalhousie devotes 177 paragraphs to these, he records in only 3 the
                    conquest of territories and populations as large as those of France. With the
                    foresight and caution that marked all his statesmanship he thus closes the
                    narrative of his wars “Experience—frequent, hard, and recent experience—has
                    taught us that war from without or rebellion from within may at any time be
                    raised against us, in quarters where they were the least to be expected, and by
                    the most feeble and unlikely instruments.” The rising of the tribe of Sonthals,
                    a non-Aryan race of simple and now half-Christianized savages in the Rajmahal
                    hills, due to the oppression of Hindu usurers and landlords, illustrated this.
                    But the mutiny, to which we shall afterwards allude, has still more light thrown
                    on it by this warning.</p>
                <p>Lord Dalhousie made additions to those portions of the empire under direct
                    British administration, however, not only by conquest but by annexing native
                    states which lapsed to the suzerain power on the failure of natural and even
                    adopted heirs, or, as in the case of Oudh, for outrageous and hopeless misrule.
                    No part of his policy has been more misrepresented than this. His own narrative
                    of it, written as simple history and long before it was attacked, bears the
                    stamp of the unflinching honesty which was the basis of his nature,—the sympathy
                    with the people and horror of oppression which influenced all his career, and
                    the strict regard for justice which made his Government the strongest India ever
                    had, before or since. He has been charged with the lack of imagination; but he
                    had that as Cromwell had it, where he cared for the many rather than for the
                    self-seeking and self-pleasing few. The question i.? twofold—Is it the duty or
                    the right of the paramount power (1) to escheat states the chiefs of which
                    persist in anarchy that not only ruins their own people but threatens their
                    neighbours, or (2) to allow states to lapse when the chiefs leave no natural
                    heirs and have refused to adopt a successor 1 The first was illustrated in the
                    case of the kingdom of Oudh, which for the crimes of its kings, committed in
                    spite of all warnings, was ordered to be annexed by the British Cabinet contrary
                    to the recommendation of Lord Dalhousie, who would have again tried the policy
                    that failed after the first Sikh war. The second is the real point at issue in
                    his case. Now the despatch of the 30th April 1860, in which Lord Canning urges
                    the concession to the 153 Hindu and Mahometan princes who actually govern their
                    estates of a distinct law of adoption and feudatory right, is based on the fact
                    that no such law or certain usage was in existence before. Lord Dalhousie acted
                    for the good of the natives and for the interests of the British Government,
                    solely as their trustee, when he annexed states according to what has been
                    called the doc trine of lapse. His regard for purely historic claims which could
                    not affect the happiness of the people for evil is shown by his refusal to carry
                    out the consent of the court of directors to extinguish the dynasty of Timur on
                    the death of the king of Delhi. He rather perpetuated the titular sovereignty by
                    recognizing the grandson of the king as heir-apparent, on the two conditions
                    that he should resido at the Kootub palace, outside Delhi, and “should as king
                    receive the governor-general at all times on terms of perfect equality.” To the
                    two kingdoms of the Punjab and Pegu, won by conquest, and to the kingdom of
                    Oudh, annexed for misrule worse than that of the Ottoman Turks, Lord Dalhousie
                    hence added the fourth of Nagpore, “in the absence of all legal heirs,” refusing
                    to bestow the territory in free gift upon a stranger. So also he added the
                    province <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n813/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0813-0778"/> of Berar, ceded by the Nizam for the permanent
                    maintenance of the Hyderabad contingent. In Nagpore and Berar, one day to be
                    united to Bombay, he gave Lancashire the finest cotton field under the British
                    Crown. So also the principality of Sattara and the chiefship of Jhansi reverted
                    to the Indian Government. Writing in 1856 he showed that these four kingdoms and
                    three provinces had raised the revenue of India from 26 to 30 millions sterling
                    a yeai. In the twenty years since, no revenue-paying addition has been made to
                    the empire as Dalhousie left it, for he reached the boundaries fixed by nature.
                    But the income of the 12 provinces of British India, with the 153 native states,
                    which cost the rest of India far more than the small tribute they pay and spend
                    nothing on the people, has risen to 52 millions sterling a year. It has doubled
                    since Lord Dalhousie landed at Calcutta. But, while caring for the people, he
                    was not indifferent to the welfare and good-will of their chiefs. Himself a
                    sincere Christian, while singularly reticent as to his personal faith, and
                    strictly neutral as the ruler of millions of alien and opposed creeds, he thus
                    wrote of the adoption of Christianity by Maharaja Dhuleep Singh, the last of the
                    rulers of the Punjab :—“The act was voluntary on the part of the boy, and, under
                    the guidance of God’s hands, was the result of his own uninfluenced convictions.
                    It is gratifying to be able to state that his life hitherto has been strictly
                    consistent with the injunctions of the faith he professes.” So he records the
                    baptism of the Queen’s ward, the princess of Coorg, at the desire of her father
                    the ex-raja. And in his time there was passed the Toleration Act,which,
                    completing the good work begun by Lord William Bentinck, removed from the
                    statute book the last traces of the persecution of converts to Christianity, who
                    had suffered the loss of all their goods as a penal consequence.</p>
                <p>The catalogue of Lord Dalhcusie’s reforms is as interesting as it is long, but we
                    must be content with a mere statement of those which remind us of Clive’s work
                    in his third visit to India. The Civil Service was opened to the competition of
                    all the natural-born subjects of the Crown, black and white, and at the same
                    time the civil and military services were reorganized in India itself to supply
                    the new territories. In Bengal, the boards which had acted as “screens” for
                    inefficiency were abolished or simplified, and personal government was
                    introduced in a way which made the force of the governor-general’s energy and
                    influence felt throughout the empire. The Public Works Department, separated
                    from the military administration, was organized in a style which has enabled it
                    to grapple with the vast needs of the whole Peninsula. A legislative council was
                    created which, far more effectually than the sham introduced by Lord Halifax
                    afterwards, promised to represent both British and native opinion. Bengal, with
                    its sixty millions, received a lieutenant-governor for itself. In a thousand
                    details life was substituted for apathy or obstructiveness, till among all
                    classes the genius and force of the “boy” governor-general were gratefully
                    eulogized as had never before happened in the history of India. There was not a
                    hostile critic. But these were small matters compared with the introduction of
                    the four potent forces of the railway and the telegraph, cheap postage and the
                    primary school. The triumph of physical and educational progress went hand in
                    hand. The quondam president of the Board of Trade felt himself at his old work,
                    but on a vaster scale, and with far more magnificent results. Every word he
                    spoke or wrote, every act that he ordered or sanctioned, told on the
                    civilization of the country. His it was, too, to push on and open the great
                    Ganges Canal which has since saved Hindustan from famine; his to make roads from
                    Delhi through the Punjab, from Simla and the frontier to Tibet, frum Assam to
                    Pegu. Trade and agriculture were ever before him as if he had no other work to
                    do; cotton and tea, iron and coal, salt and other resources were carefully
                    developed by him; and he created a forest department. When he did not think it
                    politically expedient to make female education a care of the state, any more
                    than even the early missionaries were prepared to attend to it, he supported the
                    Bethune school out of his own pocket. Suttee in native states, and thuggee or
                    strangling in our own, he kept down with an iron hand; female infanticide, and
                    meriah or human sacrifice, he vigilantly suppressed; slavery and the slave-trade
                    he made treaties from the Somalee coast of Africa to the Euphrates and the
                    Irawaddy to put down Finally, his care for the British soldier in a tropical
                    climate was matched only by the improvement which he caused in the physical
                    condition of the sepoys. No less a military than a civil administrator, his last
                    act was to send home a series of minutes pressing for a reorganization and an
                    increase of the army, in language not only unheeded, but deliberately repelled,
                    with consequences which the mutiny soon displayed.</p>
                <p>Such work as this, following the still greater strain of the Board of Trade
                    during the railway mania, began to show itself even before Lord Dalhousie had
                    completed the usual five years’ term of service. He recorded, at the time, the
                    bitter pang it was to him to be so ill as not to be able to accompany the first
                    railway train which he officially sent forth in its course Bombay-wards from
                    Howrah, the suburb opposite Calcutta. In 1855 the physicians solemnly warned him
                    to leave, but as Her Majesty’s Government laid on him the duty of annexing Oudh,
                    he deliberately accepted the responsibility. “The ministry have asked me to
                    stay, and I will do my duty,” he replied to all remonstrances. He had, too, lost
                    his wife, to whom he was devotedly attached—a daughter of the marquis of
                    Tweeddale, who had been governor of Madras—and was soothed by the arrival of his
                    eldest daughter. The hot season of 1855 he spent in the Neilgherry hills.<note

                    successor, of Lord Canning, his old college companion, gave him great pleasure;

                    passed on him when opening an extension of the railway to Rajmahal, he smiled
                    saying, “I always knew Canning was a gentleman.’</p></note> It was on the 6th
                    March 1858 that he left Calcutta, amid the tears of many, both natives and
                    Europeans, who accompanied the great proconsul, as he was lovingly called, to
                    the Ghaut. He knew he had no more health to look for. Sadly did he write, in his
                    formal reply to the citizens of Calcutta— “Nearly thirteen years have passed
                    away since first I entered the service of the Crown. Through all those years,
                    with but one short interval, public employment of the heaviest responsibility
                    and labour has been imposed upon me. I am wearied and worn, and have no other
                    thought or wish than to seek the retirement of which I stand in need, and which
                    is all I now am fit for.”</p>
                <p>Lord Dalhousie retired not only amid the regrets of the people he had ruled so
                    well, and of the services, civil and military, which he had attached to himself
                    at once by the splendour of his administrative genius and by the kingly
                    fascination of his personal character. He was honoured by Parliament and the
                    Crown, while the press exhausted the terms of eulogy in reviewing the career of
                    one who, like Clive, had proved equally great in peace and in war. The many
                    months spent in Malta before he could brave the rigours of his native climate he
                    devoted to a defence of his whole administration, which, unfortunately, is not
                    now to be found. For already the outburst of the Bengal mutiny had led
                    thoughtless or prejudiced and certainly ignorant persons to demand a victim, and
                    they sought it in the dying governor-general. He could not take his place in the
                    House of Lords and explain his acts and policy <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0814-0779"/> to unthinking and excited critics who personally
                    knew nothing of either. In India itself, where the facts were known and he was
                    known, he was defended as, on much less and lower grounds, Warren Hastings had
                    been. So, appealing from his contemporaries to posterity, and moved at the same
                    time by the unauthorized publication of other family papers, he dictated the
                    following addition to his will, which we are permitted to publish for the first
                    time:— “Secondly, It is my wish that on my decease the whole of the letters and
                    private papers of every description, wherever found, belonging to me, and not
                    being legal documents connected with the Dalhousie family, should be delivered
                    to my daughter Susan. 1 enjoin that at her decease, or sooner if she should
                    think fit, all documents, journals, and letters illustrating the history of the
                    Dalhousie family, or the career of those who have been successively its head,
                    shall be delivered to the holder of the title of Dalhousie. —And as it has been
                    the practice of my father and of myself to keep a full private journal during
                    our lives, and to preserve papers of personal interest, and as there prevails in
                    these days a mania for giving publicity to the correspondence of public men,
                    however slight may have been their real importance in the annals of the period,
                    or however, valueless may be their written remains, I desire if possible to
                    preserve these papers in privacy within the family to which they refer.—I
                    direct, therefore, that when these documents shall be delivered to him who shall
                    then be Lord Dalhousie, the delivery of them shall be accompanied by a request
                    from me (to which I am confident he will conform, as to a request issuing from
                    the grave) that no portion of the private papers of my father or of myself shall
                    be made public until at least fifty years shall have passed after my death.”</p>
                <p>The papers are carefully preserved in Coalstoun till the year 1910. Lord
                    Dalhousie retired to his old boy home, in Dalhousie Castle, to die,
                    affectionately tended by his daughter, and on the 19th December 1860 he passed
                    peacefully away. He was not forty-nine years old, an age when in England
                    statesmen only begin their career, yet in England and India he had done a life
                    work surpassed by none, if equalled by any of his contemporaries. His marble
                    statue, long opposite Wellesley’s in the hall of Government House, Calcutta, now
                    adorns the public institute in the public square, which both bear his name. His
                    portrait by Sir John Watson Gordon, at Coalstoun, recalls the fine head, the
                    brow of massive breadth and height, the large and lustrous eyes, the flexible
                    and sensitive lips, the commanding attitude which made his middle-size look like
                    the tallness of bigger men.</p>
                <p>The panic which sought to fasten on Lord Dalhousie responsibility for the mutiny
                    has long since been pronounced unreasonable. All the charges against the last of
                    the Company’s governors-general may be summed up in two, political and
                    military,—he conquered and annexed many states; he ignored or misunderstood the
                    condition of the sepoy army. As to the first, the despatch of Lord Canning,
                    already alluded to—and he is identified with the opposite, or nonannexation
                    policy, which Lord Dalhousie alone made possible for his successor—shows that
                    there was no law or regular usage on the subject. Lord Dalhousie had certainly
                    no passion for annexation, as the Oudh case proves, and each instance must be
                    dealt with on its own merits. It is difficult to obtain reliable evidence to
                    support any statement as to native opinion or feeling, even after the event, and
                    we have none for the assertion that the series of acquisitions of territory had
                    alarmed the native chiefs. But even if it had, we may maintain that it was the
                    governor-general’s duty to complete the empire, to care for the people, and to
                    do this at all fair risks. To all such assertions we may reply that it was
                    conquests like the Punjab that saved the empire when the crisis came, that it
                    was annexations like Nagpore and Sattara which removed centres of discontent.
                    Oudh, for which he was not responsible, and little Jhansi, which had a mad
                    ranee, were the only malcontents. All the other native chiefs were loyal,
                    actively or passively. The military argument is still less defensible, and has
                    been abandoned ever since Sir Charles Jackson exposed it. Lord Dalhousie foresaw
                    trouble in India as much as any man has ever done in a country where it is the
                    unforeseen that happens. We have already quoted an instance of this. But these
                    words in his farewell to India might, as has been said, have been written after
                    the mutiny. “We have learned by hard experience how a difference with a native
                    power, which seems at first to be but the little cloud no bigger than a man’s
                    hand, may rapidly darken and swell into a storm of war, involving the whole
                    empire in its gloom. We have lately seen how, in the very midst of us,
                    insurrection may rise like an exhalation from the earth, and how cruel violence,
                    worse than all the excesses of war, may be suddenly committed by men who, to the
                    very day in which they broke out in their frenzy of blood, have been regarded as
                    a simple, harmless, timid race, not by the Government alone but even by those
                    who knew them best, who were dwelling among them, and were their earliest
                    victims. Remembering these things, no prudent man will venture to give you
                    assurance of continued peace.”</p>
                <p>The first authority on the subject, Lord Lawrence, pronounced the cause of the
                    mutiny purely military, and found it in the greased cartridges. It was social,
                    not political,—an assault on caste, not on princes, though doubtless Mahometan
                    and other intriguers took advantage of the mutinous spirit. But the opportunity
                    for the mutiny was found in the reduction of the British garrison, already too
                    low, to a point of danger which had led to Lord Dalhousie’s alarmed but unheeded
                    protests. When he wanted more troops to meet the increase of territory he found
                    himself denuded of two cavalry and two infantry regiments for the Crimea. The
                    strength of the white garrison was thus reduced to 22 regiments. That reduction
                    completed what the Afghan policy of the home authorities had begun, by placing
                    success within the grasp of the native army. In 1854 Lord Dalhousie thus
                    wrote:—“We are perfectly secure so long as we are strong and are believed to be
                    so; but if European troops shall now be withdrawn from India to Europe, and if
                    further we should be called on to despatch an army to the Persian Gulf then,
                    indeed, I shall no longer feel, and can no longer express, the same confidence
                    as before that the security and stability of our position in the East will
                    remain unassailed.” That is prophetic enough. But it is nothing to the nine
                    minutes which, on the last day of his office, he laid before his council and
                    sent home, all of which were pigeon-holed, and two of which cannot be found in
                    the records. In spite of these admirable and earnest state papers, the two
                    infantry regiments sent to the Crimea were not replaced, and five or six of the
                    minimum of thirty-one on the India establishment were in the Persian war, as his
                    excellency had feared. He sought to raise the number to thirty-seven, and to
                    reduce the sepoy force by upwards of 14,000 men, but in vain. Had he been able
                    to carry out his own military policy as he did in the case of purely political
                    and administrative affairs, is it too much to say that there would have been no
                    mutiny! In spite of the passing away of the school of political and military
                    officers whom Lord Dalhousie created, represented now only by the venerable Lord
                    Lawrence, every year’s progress in the history of India reveals new reasons for
                    recalling with gratitude and admiration the eight or nine years’ administration
                    of the last of the governors-general.</p>
