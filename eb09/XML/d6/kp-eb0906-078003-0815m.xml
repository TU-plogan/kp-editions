                    (1801-1872). William Henry Lytton Earle Bulwer, better known during the chief
                    part of his long and brilliant career in diplomacy, politics, and literature as
                    Sir Henry Bulwer, was born in Baker Street, Portman Square, London, on Friday
                    the 13th February 1801. Upon both sides Lord Dalling’s lineage was illustrious;
                    his father’s house traced back their ancestry to the Vikings of the North, and
                    his mother’s claimed descent from the Tudors arid Plantagenets. General Bulwer,
                    when colonel of the 106th Regiment, had been married to Elizabeth Barbara
                    Lytton, who—as the only offspring of Richard Warburton Lytton, of Knebworth
                    Park, in the county of Hertford—was sole heiress of the family of
                    Norreys-Robinson-Lytton of Monacdhu in the island of Anglesea and of Guersylt in
                    Denbighshire. Her father, Warburton Lytton, was noteworthy in his generation. As
                    an Oriental linguist he became the intimate friend of Sir William Jones; he was
                    besides the favourite pupil of Dr Samuel Parr, who used to brag of him as
                    inferior only to himself and perhaps Porson in classical erudition. Three sons
                    were the fruit of General Bulwer’s marriage with the heiress of the Lyttons. The
                    second of those three sons, Henry, afterwards Lord Dalling, having been amply
                    provided for by his selection as heir to his maternal grandmother, while the
                    paternal estates in Norfolk went in due course, by right of primogeniture, to
                    his elder brother William, the maternal property in Herts passed into the
                    possession of the youngest of the three brothers, Edward, known first as Bulwer
                    the novelist and dramatist, and afterwards as the first Baron Lytton of
                    Knebworth.</p>
                <p>Lord Dalling’s father was so far notable in his military capacity that, as
                    brigadier-general of volunteers, he was one of the four commanding officers to
                    whom was intrusted the defence of England in 1804, when threatened with invasion
                    by the great Napoleon. Three years afterwards, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0816-0781"/> on. the 7th July 1807, General Bulwer died
                    prematurely at fifty-two at Heydon Hall. His young widow had then devolved upon
                    her not only the double charge of caring for the estates in Herts and Norfolk,
                    but the far weightier responsibility of superintending the education of her
                    three sons, then in their earliest boyhood. She at once devoted herself with
                    earnest solicitude to their instruction, and her qualifications for the duties
                    of home instructress were certainly exceptional. For, besides having great
                    natural gifts and instinctive refinement,she was awoman of cultured intellect
                    and rare accomplishments. Henry Bulwer’s first school was that of Dr Curtis in
                    Sunbury, Middlesex. Thence, while yet a stripling, he was removed to Harrow,
                    then presided over by Dr George Butler. His tutor there was the Rev. Mark Drury,
                    a younger brother of the previous head master. At eighteen, Henry Bulwer was
                    enrolled as an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge, removing thence soon
                    afterwards to Downing College, where his university career was completed. At
                    that turning-point in his history his maiden work was published. It was issued
                    from the press in 1822 as a tiny volume of verse, commence ing with an ode on
                    the death of Napoleon. It is chiefly interesting now for its fraternal
                    dedication to Edward Lytton Bulwer, then a youth of nineteen, an inscription
                    couched in terms of affectionate admiration.</p>
                <p>On leaving Cambridge in the autumn of 1824, Henry Bulwer signalized his entrance
                    into public life by an adventure. As emissary of the Greek Committee then
                    sitting in London, he started for the Morea, carrying with him no less a sum
                    than £80,000 sterling, which, immediately on his arrival at his destination, he
                    handed over to Prince Mavrocordato and his colleagues, as the responsible
                    leaders of the War of Independence. He was accompanied on this expedition by Mr
                    Hamilton Browne, who, a twelvemonth before, had been despatched by Lord Byron to
                    Cephalonia to treat with the insurgent Government. Shortly after his return to
                    England in 1826, Bulwer published a record of this romantic excursion, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">An Autumn in Greece.</hi> Meanwhile, bent for the
                    moment upon following in his father’s footsteps, he had on the 19th October
                    1825, been gazetted as a cornet in the Second Life Guards. Within less than
                    eight months, however, he had exchanged from cavalry to infantry, being enrolled
                    on the 2d June 1826 as an ensign in the 58tb Regiment. That ensigncy he retained
                    for little more than a month, obtaining another unattached, which he held until
                    the 1st January 1829, when he finally abandoned the army. The court, not the
                    camp, was to be the scene of his successes; and for thirty-eight years
                    altogether—from the August of 1827 to the August of 1865—he contrived, while
                    maturing from a young attach^ to an astute and veteran ambassador, to hold his
                    own with ease, and in the end was ranked amongst the subtlest intellects of his
                    time as a master of diplomacy. His first appointment in his new profession, at
                    the date just mentioned, was as an attach^ at Berlin. In the April of 1830 he
                    obtained his next step through his nomination as an attache at Vienna <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> Thence, exactly a year afterwards, he was employed
                    nearer home in the same capacity at the Hague.</p>
                <p>As yet, ostensibly, no more than a careless lounger in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >salons</hi> of the Continent, the young ex-cavalry officer veiled the keenest
                    observation under an air of indifference. His constitutional energy, which
                    throughout life was exceptionally intense and tenacious, wore from the first a
                    mask of languor. When in reality most cautious, he was seemingly most negligent.
                    No matter what he happened at the moment to take in hand, the art he applied to
                    it was always that highest art of all, the <hi rend="italic">ars celare
                    artem.</hi> His mastery of the lightest but most essential weapon in the armoury
                    of the diplomatist, tact, came to him as it seemed intuitively, and from the
                    outset was con summate. Talleyrand himself would have had no reason, even in
                    Henry Bulwer’s earliest years as an attach^, to write entreatingly, “<hi
                    rend="italic">Pas de zele,”</hi> to one who concealed so felicitously, even at
                    starting, a lynx-like vigilance under an aspect the most phlegmatic. Endowed
                    thus highly both in intellect and in temperament, he had hardly reached his new
                    post in the capital of the Netherlands when he found and immediately seized his
                    opportunity. The revolutionary explosion of July at Paris had been echoed on the
                    25th August 1830 at Brussels by an equally startling outburst of insurrection.
                    During the whole of September a succession of stormy events swept over Belgium,
                    until the popular rising reached its climax on the 4th October in the
                    declaration of Belgian independence by the Provisional Government. At the
                    beginning of the revolution, the young attach^ was despatched by the then
                    foreign secretary at Whitehall, Lord Aberdeen, to watch events as they arose and
                    report their character. When he reached Ghent in the midst of the civil
                    conflict, the commissionaire of his hotel was shot down at his elbow on the
                    Grande Place. In the execution of his special mission he traversed the country
                    in all directions amidst civil war, the issue of which was to the last degree
                    problematic. Under those apparently bewildering circumstances, he was enabled by
                    his sagacity and penetration to win his spurs as a diplomatist. Writing almost
                    haphazard in the midst of the conflict, he sent home from day to day a series of
                    despatches which threw a flood of light upon incidents that would otherwise have
                    appeared almost inexplicable. Scarcely a week had elapsed, during which his
                    predictions had been wonderfully verified, when he was summoned to London to
                    receive the congratulations of the Cabinet. He returned to Brussels no longer in
                    a merely temporary or informal capacity. As secretary of legation, and
                    afterwards as chargd d’affaires, he assisted in furthering the negotiations out
                    of which Belgium rose into a kingdom, and in so rising established for the first
                    time on the European continent the adjusted fabric of a moderate constitutional
                    sovereignty. Scarcely had this been accomplished when he wrote what may be
                    called the first chapter of the history of the newly created Belgian kingdom. It
                    appeared in 1831 as a brief but luminous paper in the January number of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Westminster Review.</hi> And as the events it recorded had helped
                    to inaugurate its writer’s career as a diplomatist, so did his narrative of
                    those occurrences in the pages of the Radical quarterly signalize in a
                    remarkable way the commencement of his long and consistent career as a Liberal
                    politician. Shortly before his appearance as a reviewer, and immediately prior
                    to the carrying of the first Reform Bill, Bulwer had won a seat in the House of
                    Commons as member for Wilton, afterwards in 1831 and 1832 sitting there as M.P.
                    for Coventry. Nearly two years having elapsed, during which he was absent from
                    the legislature, he was in 1834 returned to Westminster as the representative of
                    the metropolitan borough of Marylebone, which, as it happened, was his
                    birthplace. That position he retained during four sessions, winning considerable
                    distinction as a debater by his undoubted gifts of wit and oratory. Within the
                    very year in which he was chosen by the Marylebone electors, he brought out in
                    two volumes, entitled <hi rend="italic">France—Literary, Social, and
                    Political,</hi> the first half of a work which was only completed upon the
                    publication, two years afterwards, of a second series, also in two volumes,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Monarchy of the Middle Classes.</hi>
                    Through its pages he made good his claim to be regarded not merely as a
                    keen-witted observer, but as one of the most sagacious and genial delineators of
                    the generic Frenchman, above all of that supreme type of the race, with whom all
                    through his life he especially delighted to hold <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n817/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0817-0782"/> familiar intercourse, the true Parisian. Between
                    the issuing from the press of these two series, Henry Bulwer had prefixed an
                    intensely sympathetic <hi rend="italic">Life, of Lord Byron</hi> to the Paris
                    edition of the poet’s works published by Galignani,—a memoir republished sixteen
                    years afterwards. A political argument of a curiously daring and outspoken
                    character, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Lords, the Government, and the
                    Country,</hi> was given to the public in 1836 by Bulwer, in the form of an
                    elaborate letter to a constituent. At this point his literary labours, which
                    throughout life were with him purely labours by-the-way, ceased for a time, and
                    he disappeared during three decades from authorship and from the legislature. It
                    was within that interval of thirty years, however, that he succeeded in building
                    up what has ever since constituted the sum and substance of his reputation,
                    securing to him his eminent and now historical name as a diplomatist. During the
                    period of his holding the position of charg6 d’affaires at Brussels, Bulwer had
                    seized every opportunity of making lengthened sojourns at Paris, always for him
                    the choicest place of residence. It was in the midst of one of these <hi
                    rend="italic">dolce far niente</hi> loiterings on the Boulevards that, on the
                    14th August 1837, he received his nomination as secretary of embassy at
                    Constantinople. Although he held that position for little more than a year, he
                    contrived within that brief period to make his mark upon the Ottoman empire. He
                    did this by opening up single-handed its resources to Western Europe, through
                    the negotiation of a commercial treaty that has ever since proved of the
                    greatest importance, not to England alone, but in a more or less considerable
                    way to all Christendom. Until then the mercantile relations subsisting between
                    the Sublime Porte and the outer world were not merely unsatisfactory, they were
                    simply intolerable. Recognizing, immediately upon his advent, the exceptional
                    abilities of the new secretary, Lord Ponsonby, then ambassador at Stamboul,
                    devolved upon Bulwer the responsibility of discovering some solution for this
                    apparently insoluble problem. Dexterously overcoming difficulties which had
                    heretofore appeared insuperable, the young diplomatist succeeded within an
                    astonishingly brief interval in removing the barriers which hampered trade at
                    the Golden Horn. So triumphant in their result were his negotiations that Lord
                    Palmerston, in writing his congratulations to him from Windsor Castle, on the
                    13th September 1838, pronounced his treaty a <hi rend="italic">capo
                    d’opera,</hi> adding that without reserve it would be at once ratified. Shortly
                    after this achievement he was nominated secretary of embassy at St Petersburg.
                    Illness, however, compelled him to delay his northern journey—almost
                    opportunely, as it happened, for in the June of 1839 he was despatched, in the
                    same capacity, to the more congenial atmosphere of Paris. At that juncture the
                    affairs of the Levant were threatening to bring England and France into armed
                    collision. In 1839 and 1840, during the temporary absence of his chief, Lord
                    Granville, the secretary of embassy was gazetted <hi rend="italic">ad
                    interim</hi> charge d’affaires at the court of France. Opportunities were thus
                    afforded him, of which he availed nimself, for winning new distinction as a
                    diplomatist. The reward earned by his devotion to his profession came to him at
                    last towards the close of 1843. On the 14th November he was appointed ambassador
                    at the court of the young Spanish Queen Isabella II. Upon his arrival at Madrid
                    signal evidence was afforded of the estimation in which he was then held as a
                    diplomatist. He was chosen arbitrator between Spain and Morocco, then
                    confronting each other in deadly hostility. As the result of his mediation, a
                    treaty of peace was signed between the two powers in 1844, their antagonistic
                    interests having through his negotiations been adroitly reconciled. Two years
                    had hardly elapsed after Bulwer’s success in this way as a peacemaker when, in
                    1846, a much more formidable difficulty arose,—one which, after threatening war
                    between France and England, led at last to a diplomatic rupture between the
                    British and Spanish Governments. The dynastic intrigues of Louis Philippe were
                    the immediate cause of this estrangement, and those intrigues found their climax
                    in what has ever since been discreditably known in European annals as the
                    Spanish Marriages. The storm sown in the Spanish marriages was reaped in the
                    whirlwind of the February revolution. And the explosion which took place at
                    Paris was answered a month afterwards at Madrid by a similar outbreak. Marshal
                    Narvaez thereupon assumed the dictatorship, and wreaked upon the insurgents a
                    series of reprisals of the most pitiless character. These excessive severities
                    of the marshal-dictator the British ambassador did his utmost to mitigate. When
                    at last, however, Narvaez carried his rigour to the length of summarily
                    suppressing the constitutional guarantees, Bulwer sent in a formal protest in
                    the name of England against an act so entirely ruthless and unjustifiable. This
                    courageous proceeding at once drew down upon the British envoy a counter-stroke
                    as ill-judged as it was unprecedented. Narvaez, with matchless effrontery,
                    denounced the ambassador from England as an accomplice in the conspiracies of
                    the Progressistas; and despite his position as an envoy, and in insolent
                    defiance of the Palmerstonian boast, <hi rend="italic">Civis Britannicus,</hi>
                    Bulwer, on the 12th June, was summarily required to quit Madrid within
                    twenty-four hours. Two days afterwards M. Isturitz, the Spanish ambassador at
                    the court of St James’s, took his departure from London. Diplomatic relations
                    were not restored between the two countries until years had elapsed, nor even
                    then until after a formal apology, dictated by Lord Palmerston, had been signed
                    by the prime minister of Queen Isabella. Before his return the ambassador was
                    gazetted a Knight Companion of the Bath, being promoted to the Grand Cross some
                    three years afterwards. In addition to this mark of honour, he received the
                    formal approbation of the ministry, and with it the thanks of both Houses of
                    Parliament. Before the year of his return from the peninsula had run out Sir
                    Henry Bulwer was married to the Hon. Georgiana Charlotte Mary Wellesley,
                    youngest daughter of the first Baron Cowley, and niece to the duke of
                    Wellington. Early in the following year, on the 27th April 1849, he was
                    nominated ambassador at Washington. During his sojourn in the United States in
                    that capacity he acquired immense popularity. Though possessing few popular
                    qualifications as a speaker, he frequently roused American audiences to
                    enthusiasm by his generous sentiments and impressive address. His principal
                    success, as ambassador at Washington, was the compact known equally in the Old
                    World and in the New as the Bulwer-Clayton treaty, which was in the main the
                    fruit of his sustained labour as a diplomatist. This convention, ratified in May
                    1850, pledged the contracting Governments to respect the neutrality of the
                    meditated ship canal through Central America, bringing the waters of the
                    Atlantic and Pacific into direct communication. If it did no other good, it
                    unquestionably for the time being allayed the jealousies which so often before
                    then had sprung up between the two countries in regard to the British right of
                    protection on the Mosquito Coast and in the Bay of Honduras. After having been
                    accredited as ambassador to the United States for three years, Sir Henry Bulwer,
                    early in 1852, was despatched as minister plenipotentiary to the small but
                    stately court of the grand duke of Tuscany at Florence. Shortly after his
                    retirement from that post in the January of 1855, he was intrusted with various
                    diplomatic missions of an almost nomadic character, in one of which he was
                    empowered as commissioner under the 23d article of the Treaty of <pb break="no"

                    in the Danubian principalities, with a view to their definitive reorganization.
                    Finally, as the crowning incident in his diplomatic career, he was installed,
                    from May 1858 to August 1865, as the immediate successor, after the close of the
                    Crimean war, of the “Great Eltchi,” Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, as
                    ambassador extraordinary to the Ottoman Porte at Constantinople. In that
                    capacity he fully sustained the high reputation he had acquired as a
                    diplomatist.</p>
                <p>When in the winter of 1865 Sir Henry Bulwer returned home from the Bosphorus it
                    was to retire upon his pension to the lettered ease he had so well earned, and
                    to revive for a brief space in the evening of his life the recollection of his
                    earlier successes as an advanced liberal reformer in the House of Commons. He
                    was elected member for Tam worth on the 17th November 1868, and retained his
                    seat until gazetted as a peer of the realm on the 21st March 1871, under the
                    title of Baron Dalling and Bulwer of Wood Dalling in the county of Norfolk. Upon
                    the eve of his return to his old haunts as a debater and a politician he had
                    asserted his claim to literary distinction by giving to the world in two volumes
                    his four masterly sketches of typical men, entitled <hi rend="italic">Historical
                    Characters.</hi> This work, dedicated to his brother Edward, in testimony of the
                    writer’s fraternal affection and friendship, portrayed in luminous outline
                    Talleyrand the Politic Man, Cobbett the Contentious Man, Canning the Brilliant
                    Man, and Mackintosh the Man of Promise. Two other kindred sketches, those of Sir
                    Robert Peel and Viscount Melbourne, having been selected from among their
                    author’s papers, have since been published posthumously. Another work of ampler
                    outline and larger pretension was begun and partially issued from the press
                    during Lord Dalling’s lifetime. The luxury of completing it, however, was denied
                    to the hand of its author. This was the elaborately planned and vigorously
                    opened <hi rend="italic">Life of Viscount Palmerston.,</hi> the first two
                    volumes of which were published in 1870. A third volume appeared four years
                    afterwards. Even then it left the story of the English statesman broken off so
                    abruptly that the work remained at the last the merest fragment. Within little
                    more than one year from the date of his elevation to the peerage Lord Dalling,
                    on the 23d May 1872, breathed his last quite unexpectedly at Naples, whither he
                    had gone to all appearance on a mere holiday excursion. Although he had been for
                    some time a confirmed valetudinarian, his death occurred so suddenly that it
                    came at last almost as a surprise. Yet he had by that time entered upon his
                    seventy-second year, more than half his life having been passed in the service
                    of his country. In his public career he enjoyed a three-fold success—as
                    ambassador, as politician, and as man of letters. Winning his way in each
                    character with a seemingly careless ease, he still improved the gifts of nature
                    and fortune by personal effort, and bore his honours with an air of distinction
                    expressive half of fatigue, half of indifference. His popularity in society was
                    at all times remarkable, mainly no doubt from his mastery of all the subtler
                    arts of a skilled conversationalist. The apparent languor with which he related
                    an anecdote, flung off a <hi rend="italic">bon mot,</hi> or indulged in a
                    momentary stroke of irony imparted interest to the narrative, wings to the wit,
                    and point to the sarcasm in a manner peculiarly his own. If as envoy he helped
                    to mould the events of his time, he left among those who came within the range
                    of his social influence the memory of one of the most gifted and charming of
                    companions. (c. K.)</p>
