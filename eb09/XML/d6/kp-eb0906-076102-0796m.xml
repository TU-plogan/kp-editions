                    Petit-Brie-sur-Marne, near Paris. He was at first occupied as an inland revenue
                    officer, but soon betook himself to scene-painting for the opera, in which he
                    ere long surpassed his predecessors Bibiena and Munich, and his teacher Degoti,
                    more especially in his remarkable power of representing light and shade. Among
                    the most admired of his productions were the Chapel of Glenthorn, at the Ambigu,
                    and the Rising of the Sun in “Les Mexicains.” He assisted M. Prevost in the
                    execution of panoramic views of Rome, Naples, London, Jerusalem, and Athens, and
                    subsequently (July 11, 1822), in conjunction with Bouton, he opened at Paris the
                    Diorama (δίς, double; ῏ραμα <hi rend="italic">,</hi> view'), an exhibition of
                    pictorial views, the effect of which was heightened by changes in the light
                    thrown upon them. As an example of these may be instanced the Midnight Mass at
                    the Church of Saint-Étienne du Mont An establishment similar to that at Paris
                    was opened by Daguerre in the Regent’s Park, London. On the 3d March 1839 the
                    Diorama, together with the work on which Daguerre was then engaged, the Interior
                    of Sainte-Marie-Majeure, was destroyed by fire. This reverse of fortune was
                    soon, however, more than compensated for by the distinction he achieved as the
                    inventor of the daguerreotype photographic process. Nicéphore Niepce, who since
                    1814 had been seeking a means of obtaining permanent pictures by the action of
                    sunlight, learned in 1826 that Daguerre was similarly occupied. In the following
                    year he communicated to Daguerre particulars of his method of fixing the images
                    produced in the camera lucida by making use of metallic plates coated with a
                    composition of asphalt and oil of lavender; this where acted on by the light
                    remained undissolved when the plate was plunged into a mixture of petroleum and
                    oil of lavender, and the development of the image was effected by the action of
                    acids and other chemical reagents on the exposed surface of the plate. The two
                    investigators laboured together in the production of their “heliographic
                    pictures” from 1829 until the death of Niepce, July 3, 1833. Daguerre,
                    continuing his experiments, discovered eventually the process connected with his
                    name. This, as he described it, consists of five operations :—the polishing of
                    the silver plate; the coating of the plate with iodide of silver by submitting
                    it for about 20 minutes to the action of iodine vapour; the projection of the
                    image of the object upon the golden-coloured iodized surface; the development of
                    the latent image by means of the vapour of mercury; and, lastly, the fixing of
                    the picture by immersing the plate in a solution of sodium “hyposulphite”
                    (sodium thiosulphate). On January 9, 1839, at a meeting of the Academy of
                    Sciences, Arago dwelt on the importance of the discovery of the daguerreotype;
                    and, in consequence of the representations made by him and Gay Lussac to the
                    French Government, Daguerre was on the 15th of June appointed an officer of the
                    Legion of Honour. On the same day a bill was presented to the Chambers,
                    according to the provisions of which Daguerre and the heir of Niepce were to
                    receive annuities of 6000 and 4000 francs respectively, on the condition that
                    their process should be made known to the Academy. The bill having been approved
                    at the meetings of the two Chambers on the 9th of July and the 2d of August,
                    Daguerre’s process, together with his system of transparent and opaque painting,
                    was published by the Government, and soon became generally known. The first
                    great improvement upon it, due to Mr Towson of Devonport, was the use of
                    enlarged lenses, with which Mr Draper of New York was the first to secure
                    portraits from the life. Then followed Mr Goddard’s introduction, in 1840, of
                    bromine for increasing the sensitiveness of the plates, and Fizeau’s method of
                    strengthening the lights and shades by the application of chloride of gold in
                    the fixing operation. Previous to the time of Daguerre both Wedgwood and Sir H.
                    Davy had attempted, but in vain, to prevent the unshaded portions of pictures
                    taken by means of the solar rays from becoming coloured by exposure to diffused
                    light; this result Daguerre secured by the use of sodium thiosulphate, and thus
                    became the chief pioneer of the modern art of photography.</p>
