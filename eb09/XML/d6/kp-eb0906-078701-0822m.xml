                    primitive law something of the nature of the Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic"
                    >were-gild, or</hi> the iroii'77 of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> appears to
                    be universal.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The <hi

                    from the offender to the person he has offended, or to his family or kin. The
                    system relates to personal injuries. It marks out with great minuteness the
                    measure of the compensation appropriate to each particular case. And there is
                    sometimes a resemblance between the legal compensation, as it may be called, and
                    the compensation which an injured person, seeking his own remedy, would be
                    likely to exact for himself. In such a system the two entirely different objects
                    of personal satisfaction and criminal punishment are not clearly separated, and
                    even in modern law damages are still occasionally penal.</p>
                <p>The object of legal compensation should be to place the injured person as nearly
                    as possible in the situation in which he would have been but for the injury. In
                    the law of England the two historical systems of common law and equity viewed
                    this problem from two different points of view. The principle of the common law
                    was that the amount of every injury might be estimated by pecuniary valuation.
                    The object of equity was to place the injured party in the actual position to
                    which he was entitled. This difference comes out most clearly in cases of breach
                    of contract. The common law, with a few partial exceptions, would do no more
                    than compel the defaulters to make good the loss of the other party, by paying
                    him an ascertained sum of money as damages. Equity, recognizing the fact that
                    complete satisfaction was not in all cases to be obtained by mere money
                    payments, compelled the defaulter to <hi rend="italic">specifically perform</hi>
                    his contract. Again, in those injuries which do not fall under the head of
                    breach of contract, equity, on satisfactory proof that a wrong was contemplated,
                    would interfere to prevent it by injunction; while at common law no action could
                    be brought until the injury was accomplished, and then only pecuniary damages
                    could be obtained. Common law and equity are now so far fused by the Judicature
                    Act of 1873 that the appropriate remedy can be awarded in any of the divisions
                    of the High Court of Justice.</p>
                <p>The assessment of damages is peculiarly the business of the jury, and the court
                    will only interfere with their decision on strong cause being shown. Thus a
                    verdict may be set aside on the ground that damages are excessive, or that they
                    are palpably insufficient. And if it appear that the result was arrived at by
                    mere hazard, as, for instance, by each juryman naming a sum and an average being
                    struck, that would be an impropriety which would invalidate the verdict. There
                    are, moreover, certain principles according to which the damages must be
                    ascertained.</p>
                <p>To take, first, cases of breach of contract. Here, it is said, the motive of the
                    defendant is an irrelevant consideration. He has broken his contract, and all
                    that has to be done is to fix the amount of the loss occasioned thereby. So
                    wherever there has been a breach of contract, some damages, though they should
                    be merely nominal, are recoverable. And when the contract was for a payment of a
                    fixed sum of money, the damages recoverable for a breach thereof would be that
                    sum with interest. Where, in other cases, the parties themselves have fixed the
                    sum which should be due as damages in case of the contract not being fulfilled,
                    such sum will be the proper damages to be awarded by a jury On this point,
                    however, the cases run rather fine. When a contract provides that a fixed sum
                    shall be payable for breach, the law will ask whether it has been fixed as a <hi
                    rend="italic">penalty</hi> or as <hi rend="italic">liquidated (i.e.,</hi>
                    ascertained) <hi rend="italic">damages.</hi> In the former case it will not
                    allow the fixed sum to be awarded, but will require evidence to show what the
                    amount of loss actually was. In Kemble v.</p>

                <p>Farren (G Bingham, 141), a contract between a manager and an actor provided that
                    for a breach of any of the stipulations therein the sum of £1000 should be
                    payable by the defaulter, not as a penalty, but as liquidated and ascertained
                    damages. Yet even here, the court observing that under the stipulations of the
                    contract the sum of £1000, if it were taken to be liquidated damages, might
                    become payable for mere non-payment of a trifling sum, held that it was not
                    fixed as damages, but as a penalty only. On the other hand, when the damage
                    caused by a breach of contract is of its own nature uncertain, and the parties
                    have positively fixed a sum as liquidated damages, that sum will be the proper
                    damages. Where no such arrangement is made, the general rule for the assessment
                    of damages is that the aggrieved party is to be placed in the same position, so
                    far as money can do it, as if the contract had been performed. Thus, in a
                    contract for the sale of goods when the vendor makes default in delivery, the
                    proper measure of damages is the difference between the contract price and the
                    market price of the goods on the day when they ought to have been delivered; so
                    that if the price has not risen in the interval, the vendor can only get nominal
                    damages. If he has in the meantime resold the goods to a sub-vendor, he cannot
                    claim against his own vendor any damages which the sub-vendor may recover
                    against him for breach of contract, because he ought to have gone into the
                    market and purchased other goods. Again, if a buyer refuses to accept the goods
                    when tendered to him, the measure of damages will be the difference between the
                    contract price and the market price at the time of his refusal, if the latter is
                    lower than the former. But in such cases the trouble and expense of finding a
                    new purchaser or other goods may be taken account of in assessing the damages.
                    It has been held that in a breach of contract to replace stock lent, the measure
                    of damages will be the price of the stock on the day when it ought to have been
                    delivered or on the day of trial, at the plaintiff’s option. Where goods
                    inferior in quality to those contracted for are delivered, the difference
                    between the value at the time of delivery of the goods contracted for and the
                    value of those actually delivered will be the proper damages. The controlling
                    principle, in fact, is that compensation should be determined by the amount of
                    the actual loss. In an American case, where a person had agreed with a
                    boardinghouse keeper for a year, and quitted the house within the time, it was
                    held that the measure of damages was not the price stipulated to be paid, but
                    only the loss caused by the breach of contract. In contracts to marry, a special
                    class of considerations is recognized, and the jury in assessing damages will
                    take notice of the conduct of the parties. The social position and means of the
                    defendant may be given in evidence to show what the plaintiff has lost by the
                    breach of contract.</p>
                <p>It is not every loss caused by the act or default complained of which can be
                    taken in estimating the proper amount of damages. The remoteness of the
                    consequences is a bar to their being recognized in the assessment, and it is a
                    question of no little difficulty what damages are and what are not excluded for
                    remoteness. The leading English case on this point is Hadley <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> Baxendale (9 Exch., 341), in which damages were sought for the loss of
                    profits caused by a steam mill being kept idle, on account of the delay of the
                    defendants in sending a new shaft which they had contracted to make. The court
                    held the damage to be too remote, and stated the true rule to be that</p>
                <p>“Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages
                    which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract
                    should be either such as may fairly and substantially be considered as arising
                    naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of
                    contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in
                    contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract, as the
                    probable result of the breach of it”</p>
                <p>So also in cases of trust, the general rule is that the damages must be
                    restricted to the “legal and natural consequences of the wrongful act imputed to
                    the defendant.” In an action by the proprietor of a theatre, it was alleged that
                    the defendant had written a libel on one of the plaintiff’s singers, whereby she
                    was deterred from appearing on the stage, and the plaintiff lost his profits;
                    such loss was held to be too remote to be the ground of an action for damages.
                    The line of remoteness cannot probably be drawn with much greater precision than
                    in the rule in Hadley <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Baxendale quoted above, vague
                    and ambiguous as the language may seem to be. A subsequent case shows the
                    limitations of the rule on the other side. In Smeadv. Foord (1 Ellis and Ellis,
                    602), the defendant contracted to deliver a thrashing-machine to the plaintiff,
                    a farmer, knowing that it was needed to thrash the wheat in the field. Damages
                    were sought for injury done to the wheat by rain in consequence of the machine
                    not having been delivered in time, and also for a fall in the market before the
                    grain could be got ready. It was held that the first claim was good, as the
                    injury might have been anticipated, but that the second was bad. When, through
                    the negligence of a railway company in delivering bales of cotton, the
                    plaintiffs, having no cotton to work with, were obliged to keep their workmen
                    unemployed, it was held that the wages paid and the profits lost were too remote
                    for damages. On the other hand, the defendant having failed to keep funds on
                    hand to meet the drafts of the plaintiff, so that a draft was returned
                    dishonoured, and his business in consequence was for a time suspended and
                    injured, the plaintiff was held entitled to recover damage for such loss. The
                    great difficulty of framing a rule which shall meet all cases is acknowledged by
                    judges and legal writers. One judge declared that no rule could be made in the
                    matter. Another declared that the rule in the majority of cases could have no
                    application, because parties never contemplate the consequences of a breach of
                    contract. The cases probably do not go beyond this, that, when from facts known
                    to everybody, or from special facts proved to be known to the defendant, he
                    ought to have anticipated the consequences of the breach of contract, he will be
                    liable for them.</p>
                <p>The rule that the contract furnishes the measure of the damages does not prevail
                    in the case of unconscionable, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> unreasonable,
                    absurd, or impossible contracts. The old school-book juggle in geometrical
                    progression has more than once been before the courts as the ground of an
                    action. Thus, when a man agreed to pay for a horse a barley-corn per nail,
                    doubling it every nail, and the amount calculated as 32 nails was 500 quarters
                    of barley, the judge directed the jury to disregard the contract, and give as
                    damages the value of the horse. And when a defendant had agreed for £5 to give
                    the plaintiff two grains of rye on Monday, four on the next Monday,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Quolibet
                    alio die lunce,</hi> which was translated by some <hi rend="italic">every
                    Monday,</hi> and by others <hi rend="italic">every other Monday.</hi> The amount
                    in the latte.r case would have been 125 quarters, in the former 524,288,000
                    quarters.</p></note> and so on doubling it every Monday, it was contended that
                    the contract was impossible, as all the rye in the world would not suffice for
                    it; but one of the judges said that, though foolish, it would hold in law, and
                    the defendant ought to pay something for his folly. And when a man had promised
                    £1000 to the plaintiff if he should find his owl, the jury were directed to
                    mitigate the damages.</p>
                <p>Interest is recoverable as damages only when an agreement that it should be paid
                    can be proved or inferred (as in the case of bills of exchange), and under the
                    statute 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 42.</p>

                <p>In American law interest is in the discretion of the court, and is made to depend
                    on the equity of the case. In both England and America compound interest, or
                    interest on interest, appears to have been regarded with the horror that
                    formerly attached to usury. Lord Eldon would not recognize as valid an agreement
                    tt&gt; pay compound interest. And Chancellor Kent, aud American lawyers
                    generally, hold that compound interest cannot be taken except upon a special
                    agreement made after the simple interest has become due. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Interest.</hi></p>
                <p>In actions of tort the discretion of the jury is not so strictly limited as in
                    cases of breach of contract. The cases we have referred to show a general
                    tendency to make the amount of damages a matter of legal certainty, and the jury
                    can do little more than find the facts. If they travel beyond the contract the
                    court will revise their verdict. But in estimating the damages for a civil
                    injury, matter of aggravation may be taken into account. This position was
                    strongly asserted in the cases arising out of the celebrated “General Warrants”
                    in the time of Lord Camden, who is reported in one case to have said, “damages
                    are designed’ not only as a satisfaction to the injured person, but as a
                    punishment to the guilty, and as a proof of the detestation in which the
                    wrongful act is held by the jury.” In another case he mentioned the importance
                    of the question at issue, the attempt to exercise arbitrary power, as a reason
                    why the jury might give exemplary damages. Another judge, in another case, said,
                    “I remember a case when the jury gave £500 damages for knocking a man’s hat off;
                    and the court refused a new trial.” And he urged that exemplary damages for
                    personal insult would tend to prevent the practice of duelling. The right of the
                    jury to give exemplary or vindictive damages has been repeatedly confirmed in
                    recent cases, and the same doctrine prevails generally throughout the United
                    States. In Scotch law the distinction between compensation and punishment has
                    been more carefully maintained. In Baillie <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Bryson (1
                    Murray’s <hi rend="italic">Reports),</hi> Lord Chief Commissioner Adams said
                    that Lord Kenyon had “introduced into cases of this sort a principle as to
                    damages extremely dangerous in its consequences. He considered such questions
                    not merely as calculated to repair the injury done to the one party, but as a
                    punishment of the other, and as intended to correct the morals of the country.
                    The morals of the country have not been improved, and I am afraid its feeling
                    has been much impaired. A civil court in matters of civil injury is a bad
                    corrector of morals; it has only to do with the rights of parties.”</p>
                <p>When both parties are in fault, if the plaintiff’s conduct has contributed to the
                    injuries, his claim for damages will not be sustained. This has been carried so
                    far that it has been held that, when a person in one carriage receives injuries
                    from the management of another carriage, he cannot recover damages if any
                    negligence, either on his own part or on the part of the owner or managers of
                    the carriage in which he was, has contributed to the accident. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Negligence.)</hi> In the Court of Admiralty, where the question
                    constantly arises in cases of collision, a different rule has been adopted. When
                    both vessels are in fault the whole amount of loss is divided between them. And
                    by a section of the Judicature Act, 1873, the Admiralty rule in such cases is to
                    be adopted in all the courts.</p>

                    exemplary damages by the jury against a co-respondent. In this case, however,
                    the disposition of the sum awarded as damages is in the discretion of the judge,
                    who may apply it to the maintenance and education or otherwise to the benefit of
                    children of the marriage.</p>
                <p>Damages are said to be either <hi rend="italic">general</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >special.</hi> The former are given for loses implied by law as the necessary
                    consequences of the wrongful act. The latter are not implied by law, but are
                    compensation for such loss as may be proved to have been in fact caused by the
                    wrongful act. Thus, in an ordinary slander, special damage must be alleged and
                    proved to entitle the plaintiff to pecuniary compensation. But if a slander
                    touches a person in the way of his trade, the law will presume that it caused
                    loss to the plaintiff, without calling on him to show what the loss actually
                    was.</p>
                <p>When a person was injured by the negligence of another, and died, the benefit of
                    an action for damages did not survive to his representatives. But by the 9 and
                    10 Vict. c. 93 (commonly called Lord Campbell’s Act), it is enacted that
                    wherever the wrongful act is such as would have entitled the injured person to
                    recover damages (if death had not ensued), the person who in such case would
                    have been liable “shall be liable to an action for damages notwithstanding the
                    death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under
                    such circumstances as amount in law to felony.” Every such action shall be
                    brought for the benefit of the husband, wife, parent, and child of the deceased.
                    “Child” includes grandchild and step-child, but not illegitimate child.</p>
                <p>Loss caused by an act which is not wrongful <hi rend="italic">{damnum absque
                    injuria)</hi> cannot be the ground of an action for damages; <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> if A’s business is injured by his neighbour B starting the same
                    business, this is not an actionable loss.</p>
