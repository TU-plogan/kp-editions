                        von</hi></label> (1758-1841), one of the best German sculptors. He was born
                    at Stuttgart, where his father was employed in the stables of the duke of
                    Wurtemberg, 15th October 1758. The boy was entered in the military school at the
                    age of thirteen, and continued there two years, when, his bias and hi3 talent
                    having manifested themselves, he was allowed to take his own way, although there
                    had been some idea of making him a dancer. Once freed from his juvenile
                    difficulties his success was pretty secure, and we find him at once associating
                    with the young sculptors Scheffauer and Le Jeune, the painters Guibal and
                    Harper, and also with Schiller, and the much-admired musician Zumsteeg. His
                    busts of some of these are good; that of Schiller is well known. In his
                    eighteenth year he carried off the prize at the Concours with his model of Milo
                    of Crotona, the strong man who died by having his hand caught in the rent stump
                    of a tree, a favourite subject with young sculptors. On this the duke made him
                    sculptor to the palace (1780), and for some time he was employed on child-angels
                    and caryatides for the decoration of the reception rooms. This work did not
                    please him very much, and in 1783, in his twenty-fourth year, he left for Paris
                    with Scheffauer, and placed himself under Pajoufor a time. His Mars, a sitting
                    figure sent home to Stuttgart, marks this period; and we next find him, still
                    travelling with his friend, at Rome in 1785, where he settled down to work hard
                    for five years, during which his position in the future art history of his
                    native land was securely made. Goethe and Herder were then in Rome and became
                    his friends, as well as Canova, who was the hero of the day, and who had
                    undoubtedly a great authoritative influence on his style. His marble statues of
                    Ceres and Bacchus were done at this time. These are now to be seen in the
                    Residenz-schloss, at Stuttgart. While in Rome his study of the antique was very
                    careful and intelligent, although Canova was so much admired by him, and on his
                    return to Stuttgart, which he never afterwards quitted except for short trips to
                    Paris, Vienna, and Zurich, the double influence of these opposite forces is
                    apparent in his works. We may mention some of these. The first was a Girl
                    Lamenting her Dead Bird, which pretty light motive was much admired. Afterwards,
                    Sappho, in marble for the Lustschloss, and two Offering-bearers for the
                    Jagdschloss; Hector, now in the museum, not in marble; the Complaint of Ceres,
                    from Schiller’s poem; a statue of Christ, worthy of mention for its nobility,
                    which has been skilfully engraved by Amsler; Psyche; Kneeling Water Nymph; Love,
                    a favourite he had to repeat. These stock subjects with sculptors had freshness
                    of treatment; and the Ariadne, done a little later, especially had a charm of
                    novelty which has made it a European favourite in a reduced size. It is perhaps
                    the contrast between the delicacy of the female human form and the subdued rude
                    force of the panther she rides that attracts our admiration; but it is probable
                    that this group, like Canova’s Graces, will always retain its popularity. It was
                    repeated for the banker Von Bethman in Frankfort, where it now appears the
                    ornament of the Platz. Many of the illustrious men of the time were modelled by
                    him. The original marble of Schiller is now at Weimar; after the poet’s death it
                    was again modelled in colossal size. Lavater, Metternich, Countess Stephanie of
                    Baden, General Benkendorf, and others are much prized. Dannecker was director of
                    the Gallery of Stuttgart, and received many academic and other distinctions. So
                    far his life had been prosperous, but as the evening drew on his mind became
                    troubled and at last obscured. His health had suffered while working very
                    closely on a large monumental statue, and long before his final year he was
                    altogether prostrated. During this sad period he rallied, but his memory and
                    power of observation faded again, and his death was long expected. This took
                    place at last in 1841, in his eighty-third year.</p>
