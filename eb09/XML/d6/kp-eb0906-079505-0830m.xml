                    1652-c. 1712), an English navigator, was born at East Coker, Somersetshire,
                    about 1652. Having early become an orphan, he was removed from the Latin school,
                    and placed with the master of a ship at Weymouth, in which he made a voyage to
                    Newfoundland. On his return he engaged himself as a common sailor in a voyage to
                    the East Indies. He served in 1673 in the Dutch war under Sir Edward Sprague,
                    and was present at two engagements; but the declining state of his health
                    induced him to come on shore, and remove to the country, where he remained some
                    time. In the year following he became an under-manager of a Jamaica estate, but
                    continued only a short time in this situation. He afterwards engaged in the
                    coasting trade, and thus acquired an accurate knowledge of all the ports and
                    bays of the island. He made two voyages to the Bay of Campeachy, and remained
                    for some time with the logwood-cutters, as a common<pb break="no"

                    interesting account in the work noted below.</p>
                <p>Satisfied with the knowledge which he had obtained of the nature of the trade and
                    country, he returned to Jamaica, and thence proceeded to England, where he
                    arrived in 1678. About the beginning of the year following he went out to
                    Jamaica as a passenger, with the intention of revisiting the Bay of Campeachy;
                    but he was persuaded to join a party of buccaneers, with whom he crossed the
                    Isthmus of Darien, pent the year 1680 on the Peruvian coast, and was
                    occasionally successful in plundering the towns. After serving with another
                    privateering expedition in the Spanish Main, he engaged with a captain named
                    Cook for a privateering voyage against the Spaniards in the South Seas. They
                    sailed in the month of August 1683, touched at the coast of Guinea, and then
                    proceeded round Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean. Having fallen in with a ship
                    from London, which had sailed on a similar expedition, they joined company; and,
                    touching at the island of Juan Fernandez, they made the coast of South America,
                    cruising along Chili and Peru. They took some prizes; and with these they
                    proceeded to the Mexican coast, which they fell in with near Cape Blanco. While
                    they lay here Captain Cook died, and the command devolved on Captain Davis.
                    Having separated from the London ship, they were joined by another commanded by
                    Captain Swan. An attemptjto plunder the town of Guayaquil was unsuccessful, but
                    at the mouth of the river they took some vessels which had about 1000 slaves on
                    board. They next attacked a Spanish fleet which was laden with the treasure of
                    the Peruvian mines, but were unsuccesful, being ill supported by some French
                    ships which had joined them.</p>
                <p>The English ships, afterwards cruising along the coast of Mexico, landed, took
                    the town of Puebla Nova, and burnt two others. Dampier, leaving Davis, went on
                    board Swan’s ship, and proceeded with him along the northern parts of Mexico, as
                    far as the southern part of California. During this expedition they frequently
                    landed for the purpose of plunder; but the loss of fifty of the party during one
                    of these incursions so discouraged them that they relinquished all further
                    attempts on these coasts. Swan then proposed to run across the Pacific Ocean,
                    and return by the East Indies; and, in hopes of a successful cruise off the
                    Manillas, the crew were persuaded, with a very slender stock of provisions, to
                    risk this long passage. They started on the 31st March 1686. On reaching
                    Mindanao the majority mutinied, and Dampier, joining them, sailed with the ship,
                    leaving Swan and some others on the island. After cruising some time off
                    Manilla, and having careened their vessel at Pulo Condore, in 1687, they were
                    driven to the Chinese coast, made the circuit of Luzon and Mindanao, passed
                    through the group of Spice Islands, and reached the coast of Australia in the
                    beginning of 1688. In March they cruised along the west coast of Sumatra, and
                    touched at the Nicobar Islands, where Dampier, at his own request, and two other
                    Englishmen, a Portuguese, and some Malays, were set on shore. Dampier’s object
                    was to establish a trade in ambergris. He and his companions contrived to
                    navigate a canoe from Achin to Sumatra; but the fatigues and distress of the
                    voyage proved fatal to several of them, who were carried off by fever, while
                    Dampier himself had scarcely recovered at the end of a twelvemonth. After making
                    several voyages to different places of the East Indies, he acted for some time
                    as gunner to the English fort of Bencoolen. In 1691, wishing to revisit his
                    native country, he embarked on board a ship bound for England, where he arrived
                    in September.</p>
                <p>It appears that afterwards Dampier was engaged in the king’s service. He had the
                    command of the “Roebuck,” a sloop of 12 guns and 50 men. This vessel was
                    believed to have been fitted out for some voyage of discovery, for she had
                    twenty months’ provisions on board. He sailed from Britain in 1699, touched at
                    the coast of Brazil, and then ran across to the coast of Australia, arriving
                    there on. 1st August, somewhere about 26° lat. Proceeding northwards along the
                    coast, he explored the country in different places where he landed. To procure
                    provisions he found it necessary to direct his course towards Timor; and thence
                    he sailed to the coast of New Guinea, where he arrived December 3. By sailing
                    along to its easternmost extremity he discovered that it was terminated by an
                    island, which he circumnavigated, and named New Britain.</p>
                <p>Here it would appear from his own journal that be was prevented from prosecuting
                    his discoveries by the smallnumberof hismen, andtheir eagerdesire to return
                    home. In May he was again at Timor, and thence he proceeded homeward by Batavia
                    and the Cape of Good Hope. In February 1701 he arrived off the island of
                    Ascension, when the vessel sprung a leak and foundered; and it was with much
                    difficulty that the crew reached the island. They remained at Ascension till
                    they were taken away by an East Indiaman, and conveyed to England. This closes
                    the account of Dampier’s life and adventures as it is detailed by himself. It
                    appears, however, from the preface to the third volume, that he was preparing in
                    1703 for another voyage. It is mentioned also in Woodes Rogers’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Voyage Bound the World,</hi> that Dampier had the command of a
                    ship in the South Seas about the year 1705, along with Captain Stradling, whose
                    vessel foundered at sea. Eampier accompanied Woodes Rogers in his voyage round
                    the world in the years 1708-11 in the capacity of pilot. During this expedition
                    Guayaquil was taken, and Dampier had the command of the artillery. The place and
                    time of his death are unknown.</p>
                <p>The works of Dampier are well known, and have been often reprinted. They consist
                    of— <hi rend="italic">A Voyage round the World,</hi> 3 vols. 8vo (1847); <hi
                    rend="italic">A Supplement to it, describing the countries of Tonquin, Malacca,
                    dec.; Two Voyages to Campeachy; A Discourse of Tradewinds, Seasons, Tides, dec.,
                    in the Torrid Zone</hi> (1707); <hi rend="italic">and a Voyage to New
                    Holland</hi> (1709). His observations are curious and important, and are
                    conveyed in a plain manly style. His nautical remarks show a great deal of
                    professional knowledge. His knowledge of natural history, though not scientific,
                    appears to be accurate and worthy of trust as a record of facts.</p>
