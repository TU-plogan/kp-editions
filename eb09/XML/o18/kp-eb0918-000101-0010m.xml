                    France, about half of which formerly belonged to the province of Normandy and
                    the rest to the duchy of Alençon and to Perche, lies between 48° 10' and 48° 58'
                    N. lat., and between 1° E. and 0° 50' W. long., and is bounded N. by Calvados,
                    N.E. by Eure, S.E. by Eure-et-Loir, S. by Sarthe and Mayenne, and W. by Manche.
                    The greatest length from east to west is 87 miles, and the area 2635 square
                    miles. The population in 1881 numbered 376,126. Geologically there are two
                    distinct regions: to the west of the Orne and the railway from Argentan to
                    Alençon lie primitive rocks connected with those of Brittany; to the east begin
                    the Jurassic and Cretaceous formations of Normandy. The latter district is
                    agriculturally the richest part of the department; in the former the poverty of
                    the soil has led the inhabitants to seek their subsistence from industrial
                    pursuits. Between the northern portions, draining to the Channel, and the
                    southern portion, belonging to the basin of the Loire, stretch the hills of
                    Perche and Normandy, which generally have a height of from 800 to 1000 feet. The
                    highest point in the department, situated in the forest of Ecouves north of
                    Alençon, reaches 1378 feet. The department gives birth to three Seine
                    tributaries—the Eure, its affluent the Iton, and the Rille, which passes by
                    Laigle. The Touques, passing by Vimoutier, the Dives, and the Orne fall into the
                    English Channel,—- the last passing Sées and Argentan, and receiving the Noireau
                    with its tributary the Vere, which runs past Fiers. Towards the Loire flow the
                    Huisne, a feeder of the Sarthe passing by Mortagne, the Sarthe, which passes by
                    Alençon, and the Mayenne, some of whose affluents rise to the north of the
                    dividing range and make their way through it by the most picturesque defiles.
                    Nearly the whole department, indeed, with its beautiful forests containing oaks
                    several centuries old, its green meadows peopled with herds, its limpid streams,
                    its deep gorges, its stupendous rocks, is one of the most picturesque of all
                    France, though neither bathed by the sea nor possessing a truly mountainous
                    character. In the matter of climate Orne belongs to the Seine region. The mean
                    temperature is 50° Fahr.; the summer heat is never extreme; the west winds are
                    the most frequent; the rainfall, distributed over about a hundred days in the
                    year, amounts to nearly 3 feet, or half as much again as the average for
                    France.</p>
                <p>Arable land occupies seven-twelfths of the surface, woods one-eighth, and pasture
                    land almost as much. The live stock comprises 70,000 horses, 4000 asses, 122,000
                    sheep (35,500 high-bred), yielding in 1878 660,000 B⅛ of wool of the value of
                    nearly £25,000, 53,000 pigs, 2800 goats, 210,000 horned cattle, 30,000 dogs,
                    700,000 fowls, 53,000 geese, and 15,800 beehives, each producing on the average
                    2 lb of wax and 20 ft&gt; of honey. Horse-breeding is the most flourishing
                    business in the rural districts; there are three breeds—those of Perche, Le
                    Merlerault (a cross between Norman and English horses), and Brittany. The great
                    Government stud of Le Pin is situated between Le Merlerault and Argentan.
                    Several horsetraining establishments exist in the department. A large number of
                    lean cattle are bought in the neighbouring departments to be fattened; the farms
                    in the vicinity of Vimoutier, on the borders of Calvados, produce the famous
                    Camenbert cheese, and others excellent butter. In 1882 Orne produced 3,288,000
                    bushels of wheat, meslin 431,000, rye 315,700, barley 1,510,000, oats 3,410,000,
                    buckwheat 600,000, potatoes 654,000, beetroot 939,000 cwt., colza seed 5000
                    cwt., hemp 8300 cwt., besides fodder in great quantity and variety, pulse, flax,
                    fruits, &lt;fcc. The variety of production is due to the great natural diversity
                    of the soils. Small farms are the rule, and the fields in those cases are
                    surrounded by hedges relieved by pollard trees. Along the roads or in the
                    enclosures are planted numerous pear and apple trees (nearly 3,000,000),
                    yielding 58,000,000 gallons of cider and perry, part of which is manufactured
                    into brandy. Beech, oak, birch, and pine are the chief timber trees in the
                    extensive forests of the department, of which a third belongs to the state. Orne
                    contains iron ore of poor quality, granite quarries employing from 400 to 500
                    workmen, and a kind of smoky quartz known as Alençon diamond. Its most
                    celebrated mineral waters are those of the hot springs of Bagnoles, which
                    contain salt, sulphur, and arsenic, and are employed for tonic and restorative
                    purposes in cases of general debility. In the forest of Bellême is the
                    chalybeate spring of La Hesse, which was used by the Romans. The other mineral
                    springs of the department are chalybeate or <pb break="no"

                    staple industry of Orne, 51 establishments (123,000 spindles and 12,170 looms)
                    being devoted to cotton, 2 establishments (500 spindles) to wool, and 3
                    establishments (2400 spindles and 2800 looms) to linen. Fiers manufactures
                    ticking, table-linen, furniture satin, cotton cloth, and thread, employs 28,000
                    workmen, and produces to the annual value of «£1,520,000. La Ferté Macé employs
                    10,000 workmen in the hand-loom manufacture of cotton. Alençon and Vimoutier are
                    engaged in the production of linen and canvas, and have also dye-works and
                    bleacheries. About 2000 workmen are employed at Alençon in the making of the
                    lace which takes its name from the town. Foundries, wire-works, and one blast
                    furnace also exist in the department, and cutlery, boilers, and articles in
                    copper, zinc, and lead are manufactured. Tin wares, pins, and needles are
                    produced at Laigle. Glass-works give employment to 600 workmen, and turn out
                    glass to the value of more than £100,000. There are flourishing paper-mills,
                    tanneries (the waters of the Orne giving a special quality to the leather), and
                    glove-works. There are in all 133 establishments making use of steam (2128
                    horse-power). There are 848 miles of railway. The department consists of four
                    arrondissements (Alençon,’ Argentan, Domfront, and Mortagne), 36 cantons, and
                    511 communes, forms the diocese of Sees, depends on the Caen court of appeal,
                    and is included in the corps d’armée of Le Mans. The communes with more than
                    5000 inhabitants are Alençon (17,237), Fiers (12,304), La Ferté Macé (9396),
                    Argentan (6300), and Laigle (5303).</p>
