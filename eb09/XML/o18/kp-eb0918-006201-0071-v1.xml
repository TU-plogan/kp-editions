                    better known by report than the strange, majestic, and fleet-footed creature
                    that “scorneth the horse and his rider,” or one that from the earliest times to
                    the present has been oftener more or less fully described; and there must be few
                    persons in any civilized country unacquainted with the appearance of this, the
                    largest of living birds, whose size is not insignificant in comparison even with
                    the mightiest of the plumed giants that of old existed upon the earth, since an
                    adult male will stand nearly 8 feet in height, and weigh 300 B&gt;.</p>
                <p>As to the ways of the Ostrich in a state of nature, not much has been added of
                    late years to the knowledge acquired and imparted by former travellers and
                    naturalists, many of whom enjoyed opportunities that will never again occur of
                    discovering its peculiarities, for even the most favourably-placed of their
                    successors in recent years seem to content themselves with repeating the older
                    observations, and to want either leisure or patience to make additions thereto,
                    their personal acquaintance with the bird not amounting to more than such casual
                    meetings with it as must inevitably fall to the lot of those who traverse its
                    haunts. Thus there are still several dubious points in its natural history. On -
                    the other hand we unquestionably know far more than our predecessors respecting
                    its geographical distribution, which has been traced with great minuteness in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Vögel Ost-Afrikas</hi> of Drs Finsch and Hartlaub, who
                    have therein given (pp. 597-607) the most comprehensive account of the bird that
                    is to be found in the literature of ornithology.<note anchored="true"

                            Africa.</p></note> As with most birds, the Ostrich is disappearing
                    before the persecution of man, and this fact it is which gives the advantage to
                    older travellers, for there are many districts, some Qf wide extent, known to

                    towards the extremities of its African range— as on the borders of Egypt and the
                    Cape Colony—in which it no longer occurs, while in Asia there is evidence, more
                    or less trustworthy, of its former existence in most parts of the south-western
                    desert-tracts, in few of which it is now to be found. Xenophon’s notice of its
                    abundance in Assyria <hi rend="italic">(Anabasis,</hi> i. 5) is well known. It
                    is probable that it still lingers in the wastes of Kirwan in eastern Persia,
                    whence examples may occasionally stray northward to those of Turkestan,<note

                    Baloochistan or Sindh, though not incredible, seems to rest on testimony as yet
                    too slender for acceptance. Apparently the most northerly limit of the Ostrich’s
                    ordinary range at the present day cannot be further than that portion of the
                    Syrian Desert lying directly to the eastward of Damascus; and, within the limits
                    of what may be. called Palestine, Canon Tristram <hi rend="italic">(Fauna and
                        Flora of Palestine,</hi> p. 139) regards it as but a straggler from central
                    Arabia, though we have little information as to its appearance and distribution
                    in that country. Africa, however, is still, as in ancient days, the continent in
                    which the Ostrich most flourishes, and from the confines of Barbary to those of
                    the European settlements in the south it appears to inhabit every waste
                    sufficiently extensive to afford it the solitude it loves, and in many wide
                    districts, where the influence of the markets of civilization is feebly felt, to
                    be still almost as abundant as ever. Yet even there it has to contend with

                    neglected by most of its more recent historians we may do well by calling
                    attention thereto. Though sometimes assembling in troops of from thirty to
                    fifty, and then generally associating with zebras or with some of the larger
                    antelopes, Ostriches commonly, and especially in the breeding season, live in
                    companies of not more than four or five, one of which is a cock and the rest are
                    hens. All the latter lay their eggs in one and the same nest, a shallow pit
                    scraped out by their feet, with the earth heaped around to form a kind of wall
                    against which the outermost circle of eggs rest. As soon as ten or a dozen eggs
                    are laid, the cock begins to brood, always taking his place on them at nightfall
                    surrounded by his wives, while by day they relieve one another, more it would
                    seem to guard their common treasure from jackals and small beasts-of-prey than
                    directly to forward the process of hatching, for that is often left wholly to
                    the sun.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By those whose
                            experience is derived from the observation of captive Ostriches this
                            fact has been often disputed. But, to say nothing of the effects of the
                            enforced monogamy in which such birds live, the difference of
                            circumstances under which they find themselves, and in particular their
                            removal from the heat-retaining sands of the desert and its burning
                            sunshine, is quite enough to account for the change of habit. Von
                            Heuglin also (p. 933) is explicit on this point. That the female
                            Ostriches while on duty crouch down to avoid detection is only natural,
                            and this habit seems to have led hasty observers to suppose they were
                            really brooding.</p></note> Some thirty eggs are laid in the nest, and
                    round it are scattered perhaps as many more. These last are said to be broken by
                    the old birds to serve as nourishment for the newly-hatched chicks, whose
                    stomachs cannot bear the hard food on which their parents thrive. The greatest
                    care is taken by them not only to place the nest where it may not be discovered,
                    but to avoid being seen when going to or from it, and their solicitude for their
                    tender young is no less. Andersson in his <hi rend="italic">Lake N</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">gami</hi> (pp. 253-269)
                    has given a lively account of the pursuit by himself and Mr Francis Galton of a
                    brood of Ostriches, in the course of which the father of the family flung
                    himself on the ground and feigned being wounded to distract their attention from
                    his offspring. Though the Ostrich ordinarily inhabits the most arid districts,
                    it requires water to drink; more than that, it will frequently bathe, and
                    sometimes even, according to Von Heuglin, in the sea.</p>
                <p>The question whether to recognize more than one species of Ostrich, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Struthio camelus</hi> of Linnaeus, has been for some years
                    agitated without leading to a satisfactory solution. It has long been known
                    that, while eggs from North Africa present a perfectly smooth surface, those
                    from South Africa are pitted (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p.
                    775, note 1). It has also been observed that northern birds have the skin of the
                    parts not covered with feathers flesh-coloured, while this skin is bluish in
                    southern birds, and hence the latter have been thought to need specific
                    designation as <hi rend="italic">S. australis.</hi> Still more recently examples
                    from the Somali country have been described as forming a distinct species under
                    the name of N. <hi rend="italic">molybdophanes</hi> from the leaden colour of
                    their naked parts.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Struthio</hi> forms the type of one group of the
                    Subclass <hi rend="italic">Ratitae,</hi> which differs so widely from the rest,
                    in points that have been concisely set forth by Prof. Huxley <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1867, p. .419), as to justify us in regarding it
                    as an Order, to which the name <hi rend="italic">Struthiones</hi> may be applied
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ornithology,</hi> p. 44); but that term, as well as
                        <hi rend="italic">Struthionidae,</hi> has been often used in a more general
                    sense by systematists, even to signify the whole of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ratitae,</hi> and hence for the present caution must be exercised as to
                    whether certain fossil remains from the Sivalik formation, referred to <hi
                        rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Struthionidae,"</hi> be regarded as
                    true Ostriches or not. The most obvious distinctive character presented by the
                    Ostrich is the presence of two toes only, the third and fourth, on each foot,—a
                    character absolutely peculiar to the genus <hi rend="italic">Struthio.</hi></p>
                <p>The great mercantile value of Ostrich-feathers, and the increasing difficulty,
                    due to the causes already mentioned, of procuring them from wild birds, has led
                    to the formation in the Cape Colony and elsewhere of numerous “Ostrich-farms,”
                    on which these birds are kept in confinement, and at regular intervals of time
                    deprived of their plumes. In favourable localities and with judicious management
                    these establishments are understood to yield very considerable profit; while, as
                    the ancient taste for wearing Ostrich-feathers shews no sign of falling off, but
                    seems rather to be growing, it is probable that the practice will yet be largely
                    extended.</p>
