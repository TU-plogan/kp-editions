                <p><label type="entry">OXUS</label>. This river rises in the lofty table-lands which
                    are intercepted between the two great mountain ranges of central Asia, the Thiân
                    Shân and the Hindu Küsh, in the region where they approach each other most
                    closely. It flows westwards through a broad valley, receiving numerous affluents
                    from the mountain ranges on either side; then bending to the north-west it
                    traverses the arid deserts of western Turkestan on the borders of Bokhara,
                    descends into and fertilizes the rich oasis of Khiva, and finally disembogues at
                    the southern extremity of the Sea of Aral. Its course is roughly parallel to
                    that of its sister river the Jaxartes, which rises to the north of the Thiân
                    Shân water-parting, and disembogues at the northern extremity of the Sea of
                    Aral.</p>
                <p>The name Oxus is that by which the river is mentioned in the writings of the
                    ancient Greek historians. In the older traditions of the Parsi books it is named
                    the Veh-rιid, in some form of which originates the classical name which we find
                    it most convenient to use, and also it may be presumed the names of various
                    territories on the banks of its upper waters, such as Wakhan, Wakhsh, and
                    Washgird, which are no doubt identical in formation, if not in application, with
                    the classical Oxiani, Oxii, and Oxi-Petra. The classical names have long ceased
                    to be known to the inhabitants of the country. In early Mohammedan history the
                    river was usually styled Al-Nahr, whence the title Ma warâ Ί Nahr, or “beyond
                    the river,” which came to be bestowed on a province of Persia lying to the north
                    of the Oxus, and which in modern use has been rendered Transoxiana. In
                    subsequent Mohammedan writings Al-Nahr gives place to Jaihùn, corresponding to
                    the Gihon of the Mosaic garden of Eden. And now the river is known by Asiatics
                    as the Amù Daria, a name of which the origin is uncertain.<note anchored="true"

                    “mother” of rivers, in correlation with Abi-sân or “father of rivers,” a title

                    Indus.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the most remote ages to which written history carries us, the regions on both
                    sides of the Oxus were subject to the Persian monarchy. Of their populations
                    Herodotus mentions the Bactrians, Chorasmians, Sogdians, and Sacae as
                    contributing their contingents to the armies of the great King Darius. The Oxus
                    figures in Persian romantic history as the limit between Iran and Turan, but the
                    substratum of settled population to the north as well as the south was probably
                    of Iranian lineage. The valley is connected with many early Magian traditions,
                    according to which Zoroaster dwelt at Balkh, where, in the 7tlι</p>
                <p>century B.C., his proselytizing efforts first came into operation. Buddhism
                    eventually spread widely over the Oxus countries, and almost entirely displaced
                    the religion of Zoroaster in its very cradle. The Chinese traveller Hwen Tsang,
                    who passed through the country in 630-644 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> found
                    Termedh, Khùlm, Balkh, and above all Bamian, amply provided with monasteries,
                    stirpas, and colossal images, which are the striking characteristics of
                    prevalent Buddhism; even the Pamir highlands had their monasteries.</p>
                <p>Christianity penetrated to Khorâsân and Bactria at an early date; episcopal sees
                    are said to have existed at Merv and Samarkand in the 4th and 5th centuries, and
                    Cosmas (c. 545) testifies to the spread of Christianity among the Bactrians and
                    Huns.</p>
                <p>Bactria was long a province of the empire which Alexander the Great left to his
                    successors, but the Greek historians give very little information of the Oxus
                    basin and its inhabitants. About 250 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Theodotus,
                    the “governor of the thousand cities of Bactria,” declared himself king,
                    simultaneously with the revolt of Arsaces which laid the foundation of the
                    Parthian monarchy. The Graeco-Bactrian dominion was overwhelmed entirely about
                    126 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> by the Yuéchi, a numerous people of Tibet who
                    had been driven westwards from their settlements on the borders of China by the
                    Hiongnu, the Huns of Deguignes. From the Yuéchi arose, about the Christian era,
                    the great Indo-Scythian dominion which extended across the Hindi! Kιish
                    southwards, over Afghanistan and Sind. The history of the next five centuries is
                    a blank. In 571 the Haiâthalah of the Oxus, who are supposed to be descendants
                    of the Yuéchi, were shattered by an invasion of the Turkish khakan; and in the
                    following century the Chinese pilgrim Hwen Tsang found the former empire of the
                    Haiâthalah broken up into a great number of small states, all acknowledging the
                    supremacy of the Turkish khakan, and several having names identical with those
                    which still exist. The whole group of states he calls Tukhâra, by which name in
                    the form Tokhâristan, or by that of Haiâthalah, the country continued for
                    centuries to be known to the Mohammedans. At the time of his pilgrimage Chinese
                    influence had passed into Tokhâristan and Transoxiana. Yezdegird, the last of
                    the Sasanian kings of Bokhara, who diedin 651, when defeated and hard pressed by
                    the Saracens, invoked the aid of China; the Chinese emperor, Taitsung, issued an
                    edict organizing the whole country from Ferghana to the borders of Persia into
                    three Chinese administrative districts, with 126 military cantonments, an
                    organization which, however, probably only existed on paper.</p>
                <p>In 711-12 Mohammedan troops were conducted by Kotaiba, the governor of Khorâsân,
                    into the province of Khwârizm (Khiva), after subjugating which they advanced on
                    Bokhara and Samarkand, the ancient Sogdiana, and are said to have even reached
                    Ferghana and Kashgar, but no occuption then ensued. In 1016-25 the government of
                    Khwârizm was bestowed by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni upon Altιintash, one of his
                    most distinguished generals.</p>
                <p>Tokhâristan in general formed a part successively of the empires of the Sasanian
                    dynasty of Bokhara (terminated 999 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> of the
                    Ghaznavi dynasty, of the Seljukian princes of Persia and of Khorâsân, of the
                    Ghori or Shansabanya kings, and of the sultans of Khwârizm. The last dynasty
                    ended with Sultan Jalal-ud-din, during whose reign (1221-31) a division of the
                    Moghul army of Jenghiz Khan first invaded Khwârizm, while the khan himself was
                    besieging Bamian; Jalal-ud-din, deserted by most of his troops, retired to
                    Ghazni, where he was pursued by Jenghiz Khan, and again retreating towards
                    Hindustan was overtaken and driven across the Indus.</p>
                <p>The commencement of the 16th century was marked by the rise of the Uzbek rule in
                    Turkestan. The Uzbeks were no one race, but an aggregation of fragments from
                    Turks, Mongols, and all the great tribes constituting the hosts of Jenghiz and
                    Batu. They held Kι!ndιiz, Balkh, Khwârizm, and Khorâsân, and for a time
                    Badakhshan also; but Badakhshan was soon won by the emperor Baber, and in 152'9
                    was bestowed on his cousin Suliman, who by 1555 had established his rule over
                    much of the region between the Oxus and the Hindi! Kιish. The Moghul emperors of
                    India occasionally interfered in these provinces, notably Shah Jehan in 1646;
                    but, finding the difficulty of maintaining so distant a frontier, they abandoned
                    it to the Uzbek princes. About 1765 the wazir of Ahmed Shah Abdali of Cabul
                    invaded Badakhshân, and from that time until now the domination of the countries
                    on the south bank of the Oxus from Wakhan to Balkh has been a matter of frequent
                    struggles between Afghans and Uzbeks.</p>
                <p>The Uzbek rule in Turkestan has during the last twenty years been rapidly
                    dwindling before the growth of Russian power. In 1863 Russia invaded the Khokand
                    territory, taking in rapid succession the cities of Turkestan, Chemkend and
                    Tashkend. In 1866 Khojend was taken, the power of Khokand was completely
                    crushed, a portion was incorporated in the new Russian province of Turkestan,
                    while the remainder was left to be administered by a native chief almost as a
                    Russian feudatory; the same year the Bokharians were defeated at Irdjar. In 1867
                    an army assembled by the amir of Bokhara was attacked and dispersed by the
                    Russians, λvho in 1868 entered Samarkand, and became virtually rulers of
                    Bokhara. In 1873 Khiva was invaded, and as much of the khanate as lay on the
                    right bank of the Oxus was incorporated into the Russian empire, a portion being
                    afterwards made over to Bokhara. Russia acquired the right of the free
                    navigation of the Oxus throughout its entire course, on the borders of both
                    Khiva and Bokhara. The administration of the whole of the states on the right
                    bank of the Oxus, down to the Russian boundary line at Ichka <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n113/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0113-0102"/> Yar, is now in the hands of Bokhara, including
                    Karategin—which the Russians have transferred to it from Khokand—and Darwâz at
                    the entrance to the Pamir highlands. At the present time the states on the left
                    bank of the Oxus, from its sources in the Panjah river down to the town and
                    ferry of Khwaja Saleh, are mainly subject to Afghanistan; from Khwaja Saleh to
                    the frontiers of Khiva and Russia at Ichka Yar the left bank of the Oxus is
                    subject to Bokhara; from the same point the Afghan boundary is supposed to
                    stretch across the Dasht-i-chul plains of the Turkomans, above Maimana, to
                    Sarakhs, where it meets the Persian frontier.</p>
                <p>The regions in which the Oxus takes its birth, and through which it passes until
                    it becomes lost in the Sea of Aral, may be divided into upper, middle, and
                    lower: the upper is constituted by the highlands between the Thiân Shân and the
                    Hindù Küsh ranges, and the middle by the plains and uplands which are situated
                    in the broad valley between the western prolongations of the same ranges; the
                    lower lies in the plains of western Turkestan. Descriptions of the chief
                    provinces and states in the middle and lower regions will be found under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Afghan Turkestan</hi> (vol. i. p. 241), including the eastern
                    khanates of Kùndûz, Khülm, Balkh, and Akcha, and the Chahâr Wilâyat, or Four
                    Domains, viz., the western khanates of Sir-i-pül, Shibrghân, Andkhüi, and
                    Maimâna; also under <hi rend="smallcaps">Badakhshan, Karategin, Hissar,

                    already given of <hi rend="smallcaps">Bactria,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Balkh,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Bamian.</hi> Here we shall only treat of
                    the highland regions of the Oxus, and the river itself in its downward course to
                    the Sea of Aral, postponing all other matter to the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Turkestan</hi> (see also the map of Turkestan).</p>
                <p>For a right understanding of the highland region, notice must be taken of its
                    position relatively to the two great longitudinal systems of mountains, the
                    Thiân Shân and the Indian Caucasus, and their respective prolongations east and
                    west, which form such a prominent feature in the physical geography of the
                    continent of Asia. These mountain systems include between them a belt of
                    tablelands of varying breadth, and generally of considerable altitude. The
                    forces of nature by which both the mountains and the intermediate table-lands
                    were primarily evolved from the earth’s crust .appear to have acted concurrently
                    over the entire region, but with greatest elevating effect along the northern
                    edge of the Caucasus; for, though the highest peaks of the Hindù Küsh and the
                    Himalayan ranges are more frequently met with on spurs some distance to the
                    south than on the northern waterparting, the elevated masses are here of
                    greatest magnitude; here there are mountains whose peaks rise to great altitudes
                    above the sea-level, but which’ are comparatively insignificant differentially,
                    the visible height above the surrounding table-lands being rarely more than a
                    third, and often less than a tenth, of the height above the sea; and here there
                    are passes across great ranges of which the level is barely distinguishable from
                    that of the surrounding table-lands, so that the traveller may cross a great
                    waterparting without being aware of it, a tussock of grass deciding the course
                    of the waters, whether towards the frontiers of China or of Europe or towards
                    the Indian Ocean.</p>
                <p>The elevated mass which forms a bridge between the Thiân Shân and the Hindu
                    Caucasus, in the quarter where they approach each other most closely,
                    constitutes the governing geographical and political feature of these regions,
                    and gives birth to all the principal sources of the Oxus. A happy instinct has
                    led the inhabitants to call it the Bam-i-dünia, or Roof of the World; modern
                    European geographers have called it the “heart of Asia,” the “central boss of
                    Asia.” It is the Tsungling of Chinese writers, the northern Imaus of Ptolemy,
                    the Mountain Parnassus of Aristotle, “the greatest of all that exist toward the
                    winter sunrise.” The geographical indications of the Puranas, considered in any
                    but a fabulous light, point to it as Méru, the scene of the primeval Aryan
                    paradise. Old Parsi traditions point to it as the origin and nucleus of the
                    Aryan migrations. And it is here that the Mohammedan invaders are shown, by
                    their identification of the great rivers with the Gihon and Pison of the Mosaic
                    narrative, to have believed that the terrestrial paradise, the cradle of the
                    human race, was situated.</p>
                <p>Few regions can present claims to interest and just curiosity so strong and
                    various as this one. Its past history is interwoven with that of all the great
                    Asiatic conquerors, and its position on the rapidly narrowing borderland between
                    the British and the Russian dominions gives it additional interest at the
                    present time. But its geography is most intricate and complicated, and has long
                    been a fruitful subject of controversy. The region is intersected with mountain
                    ridges and depressed river beds which are alike difficult to cross; its altitude
                    is unfavourable for the growth of cereals, and it mostly lies buried in snow for
                    half the year; it is, moreover, sparsely inhabited, and does not produce
                    sufficient food for the requirements of the inhabitants. It interposes a
                    formidable barrier between eastern and western Turkestan across the ancient
                    highway from Europe to China; and, though this barrier has been repeatedly
                    crossed, the extant narratives of the journeys and descriptions of the routes
                    present only occasional glimmerings of truth amidst a mass of error and
                    confusion, and are at times barely available for sober inquiry; genuine facts of
                    observation have been so mixed up with erroneous information that it has become
                    impossible to reconcile conflicting statements or separate the true from the
                    false. Thus within the last quarter of a century maps have been published by
                    eminent geographers in Eflgland and Germany in which the great cities of eastern
                    Turkestan are placed 3° to 4°, or over 200 miles, too far to the west, and the
                    limits of the “heart of Asia” are materially narrowed.</p>
                <p>The interest attaching to the region has even led to the fabrication of spurious
                    documents which have darkened the mist already enveloping it, and have betrayed
                    eminent geographers into error and confusion.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus early in the present century certain
                    papers were lodged in the secret archives of the Russian Foreign Office which

                    obscure region, one by a German traveller, Georg Ludwig von , said to have been
                    an employé of the Anglo-Indian Government, the other by a Chinese traveller.
                    They were brought to light in 1861, and excited the curiosity of all who were
                    interested in the geography of this region. A few years afterwards it was
                    discovered that a parallel mass of papers, embodying much of the same peculiar
                    geography and nomenclature, but purporting to be the report of a Russian
                    expedition sent through Central Asia to the frontiers of India, existed in the
                    London Foreign Office. All three documents bear indubitable traces of having
                    been fabricated for sale to the British and the Russian Governments by an acute
                    geographer who, while availing himself of such genuine data as were actually
                    within his reach, did not scruple to draw on his own imagination for the filling
                    up of all blanks.</p></note></p>
                <p>While geography remained under the spell of these mischievous fictions, research
                    was impeded, and an insurmountable obstacle placed in the way of the true
                    delineation of the region; doubt was even thrown on the accuracy of the work of
                    genuine explorers. But within the last decade the mist in which the “Roof of the
                    World” had so long been enveloped has been largely dispelled by the labours of
                    Russian and British officers, and also by natives of India trained to
                    geographical exploration and employed in connexion with the operations of the
                    Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. In some parts there is still much doubt
                    and uncertainty, but enough is now known to furnish the geographical student
                    with a fairly accurate idea of the general course of the rivers and
                    configuration of the tablelands and mountains.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0114-0103"/> Oxus, one to the north rising in and around the
                    Alai plateau, the other to the south rising in the Pamir plateaus, of which
                    there are several. The two systems are divided by a great chain of mountains
                    known locally as the Kizil-yart range, but called by Fedchenko (looking from the
                    north) the Trans-Alai range, and by recent Russian surveyors the Peter the Great
                    range; it lies from east to west on the southern border of the Alai plateau, and
                    throws out spurs westwards to Darwâz; its medium height above the sea-level is
                    18,000 or 19,000 feet, with occasional peaks rising to 25,000 feet. Of the
                    Oxianian affluents to its north and west the principal are the Wâkhsh or
                    Siirkh-âb ( = the Kizil-su = the Red River), rising in the Alai, and the Mùksù
                    and Khing-ab rivers, which join the Wâkhsh in the district of Karategin.</p>
                <p>The system of southern affluents is, however, the most important of the two
                    politically as well as geographically, comprising as it does the water-partings
                    which define the boundaries between China, Afghanistan, and Bokhara, and all the
                    rivers of what is generally known as the Pamir region. The name Pamir is
                    suggested by Bournouf to have been derived from Ùpa-Mérü, meaning the lands
                    “beyond the mountain of Meru”; a later and more probable suggestion, by Major
                    Trotter, is that it is the Khirgiz equivalent of Bâm-i-dûnia. It means simply an
                    elevated steppe or plateau. By the people of the country it is not applied, as
                    European geographers apply it, to the entire region, which is one of mountains
                    as well as table-lands, but to each of the plateaus with the addition of a
                    distinctive designation. Thus there is the Pamir-Kalân (great), the Pamir-Khùrd
                    (little), the Pamir-Alichûr, the Pamir-Khargoshi (of the hare), the Pamir-Sarez
                    (of the water-parting), and the Pamir-Rangkùl, on which the Rangkιil lake is
                    situated. There is also another, the Pamir-i-Shiva, which, though only recently
                    brought prominently to the notice of European geographers, is of considerable
                    magnitude, elevation, and importance; it lies in that part of Badakhshân which
                    is enclosed to the north and east by the Panjah river, and to the south and west
                    by a spur from the Hindi! Küsh range. This spur is an offshoot from the vicinity
                    of the Tirich Mir peak (25,400 feet) north of Chitral; it lies between Faizabad
                    and Ishkâshim, sinks to 10,900 feet at the Zebak pass, and then again, ascending
                    to higher altitudes, trends to the north-west, and strikes the western spurs of
                    the Kizil-yart range in the Darwâz district; it forms the water-parting between
                    the Kokcha river of southern Badakhshân and the Panjah river. Though a spur from
                    the main range, it is of itself an important range, and has some claim to be
                    regarded as the western boundary of the Pamir table-lands, as it lies
                    immediately over the Shiva Pamir; if the claim be admitted, the breadth of the
                    elevated barrier between the plains of eastern and western Turkestan will be
                    found to be about 250 miles, whereas geographers have hitherto accorded to the
                    Pamir plateau a breadth of only 100 miles. The Panjah river flows downwards
                    through the region where the spurs of this western bounding range meet those of
                    the Kizil-yart range, passing between narrow and precipitous gorges which form a
                    natural gateway to the highlands, though one which in many parts is barely
                    accessible, or has to be quitted altogether for the easier mountain passes on
                    either hand.</p>
                <p>The most elevated portion of the highlands occurs on the north-east border, above
                    the plains of Kashgar and Yarkand. Here a chain of mountains, interwoven with
                    the Thiân Shân and the Kizil-yart ranges, trends to the east and south-east, and
                    throws up peaks of great height, culminating in Tagharma (25,500 feet); viewed
                    from the plains to the east, it seems to form part of a great chain— the Belût
                    Tâgh of Humboldt—which connects the Thiân Shân range with the Hindi! Kιish; but
                    it is broken through by rivers, and terminates over the plains of the Sarikoi
                    district. The line of water-parting which constitutes the real connexion between
                    the Thiân Shân and the Hindi! Kιish lies more to the west, in hills which,
                    emanating from the Kizil-yart range, pass between the Rangkιil Pamir and the
                    Kizil-yart plain, and then bending southwards strike an angle of the Hindi!
                    Kιish range on the borders of the Sarikoi and Kanjιit districts; they are
                    probably nowhere of any great altitude above the general level of the
                    table-lands; but they are of importance in that they may be regarded as the
                    natural boundary between the states of eastern Turkestan now subject to China,
                    and those of western Turkestan subject to Afghanistan and Bokhara.</p>
                <p>The best known river of the Pamir plateaus is the Panjah,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The name Panjah is conjectured to be derived
                    from a confluence of five rivers; but more probably it is taken from the
                    well-known fort of the same name, which is situated a little below the junction
                    of the two upper affluents of the river. The fort derives its name either from
                    the circumstance of its being built on five mounds, or from a sacred edifice in
                    the vicinity erected over a stone bearing the supposed impress of the palm and
                    fingers (panjah) of Hazrat Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammed; lower down the
                    river, in Shighna⅜ there is a fort built over a similar mark, and called the
                    Kila-Bar-Panjah (“the fort <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the panjah ”).</p></note>
                    which receives all the other rivers of this region before it enters the plains;
                    above Kila Panjah it has two important affluents, one from the east rising in
                    Kanjιit, and probably about 120 miles long, the other from the north-east rising
                    in the lake· of the Great Pamir (Wood’s Lake Victoria), and about 80 miles long.
                    From the point of junction to Kila-Bâr-Panjah is 140 miles; here the united
                    waters of the Sochân and Shâkhdara rivers from the east are received; 33 miles
                    lower down, near Kila Wâmar, the Bârtang river, also from the east, is received.
                    The upper source of the Bârtang is the Ak-su (white water) river, which rises in
                    the Oikιil or Gazkιil lake of Little Pamir, and, winding round the highlands,
                    passes through the Sarez Pamir, where its name changes to the Murghâbi (water
                    fowl), which lower down becomes Bârtang (narrow passage). The Aksù-Bârtang is
                    probably the longest of the Pamir rivers; its length exceeds 330 miles, while
                    that of the Panjah from the source of its longest affluent down to the Bârtang
                    junction is probably under 300 miles; thus it has been claimed as constituting,
                    rather than the Panjah, the proper boundary line between Afghanistan and
                    Bokhara. About 120 miles below Kila Wâmar the Panjah debouches into the plains
                    after receiving the Wanjâb river of Darwâz on its right bank, and the Kof
                    (Kufau) river coming from the Shiva Pamir on its left bank. Fifty miles farther
                    on it receives on its right bank the Yâkhsù river conveying the waters of a
                    system of valleys lying between the Panjah and the Wâkhsh rivers, the courses of
                    which are here nearly parallel; 18 miles onwards it receives (left bank) the
                    Kokcha river of southern Badakhshân, and at this point it loses its
                    individuality and becomes the Ami! river; 80 miles to the west the Ami! receives
                    the Wâkhsh or Sιirkh-ab river, when the whole of the waters of the Oxianian
                    highlands are brought together into one channel.</p>
                <p>Returning to the highlands, we briefly notice the principal lakes. Chief of all
                    is the Great Kârakùl—the Dragon Lake of Chinese writers; it stands in the
                    Khargoshi Pamir, has an area of about 120 square miles, and an altitude of
                    12,800 feet; it was long regarded as the source of the Oxus, but has recently
                    been found to have no outlet. The Little Kârakûl and the Bιilankιil lakes, areas
                    15 and 8 square miles, on the Kizil-yart plateau, are probably over 13,000 feet.
                    The Rangkùl lake, area 15 square miles, is 12,800 feet. Wood’s Victoria, the
                    lake of the Great Pamir, height 13,900 feet, has an area of 25 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n115/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0115-0104"/> square miles. The Yashil-Kûl, area 16 square
                    miles, height 12,550 feet, is in the Alichιir Pamir, where in 1759 the Chinese
                    troops surprised and defeated the Khwajas of Badakshân. The great Shiva-Kùl,
                    lately visited by Dr Regel, has, according to him, an area exceeding 100 square
                    miles, and an altitude of 11,800 feet, and Wood alludes to it as of considerable
                    magnitude. There are numerous small lakes, of which the most important is the
                    Oikul (13,100 feet), the source of the Ak-su river, in the Little Pamir.</p>
                <p>Hill ranges crop up out of the table-lands in various quarters; their general
                    direction is from north-east to south-west; they form the boundaries between the
                    several Pamirs and the principal water-partings between the valleys. The portion
                    of the Hindù Kùsh range which lies immediately to the south of this region is of
                    very varying altitude, sinking at the Baroghil pass to 12,000 feet, or only 1000
                    feet above the adjoining table-lands, but rising to heights of 22,600 to 25,400
                    in peaks to the west of that pass.</p>
                <p>In 1872 the Panjah river was adopted by the British and the Russian Governments
                    as the line of boundary between Bokhara and Afghanistan. But rivers which are
                    readily crossed, and pass through valleys both sides of which have much of life
                    in common, rarely serve as boundaries between the people residing on the
                    opposite banks. The Panjah river has been found to divide no less than four
                    states, Wâkhân, Shighnân, Roshân, and Darwâz, into two parts each; the first
                    three of these are claimed by Afghanistan and the fourth by Bokhara, by whom
                    they are administered—or at least are attempted to be administered—without
                    regard to the conventional boundary line of the Panjah; presumably, therefore,
                    this line will have to be abandoned for the lines of water-parting along the
                    hill ranges which form the natural boundaries of the several states.</p>
                <p>The Pamir plateaus are generally covered with a rich soil which affords very
                    sweet and nourishing grasses, though at too great an altitude for husbandry;
                    there is an unlimited extent of summer pasture lands for the Khirgiz and other
                    nomad tribes and the herdsmen of the surrounding districts. But for the
                    plentiful supply of food for cattle which these regions afford during several
                    months of the year, they could never have been crossed by the great armies and
                    hordes which are said to have passed over them. The culturable areas are small,
                    and are usually restricted to narrow ledges on the margins of the rivers, which,
                    however, when well cultivated and manured yield rich returns; food stuffs have
                    to be largely obtained from the plains below; mulberry trees thrive well and are
                    much prized, because their unripened berries are ground to flour and form a
                    serviceable article of food.</p>
                <p>Wâkhân contains some twenty-five scattered villages with about as many houses in
                    each, and a population estimated at 3000 souls. Shighnân and Roshân may at
                    present be regarded as one state, as they are governed by one ruler; the valleys
                    of Sochân-o-Gùnd and Shakhdara belong to the former, and that of Bârtang to the
                    latter (villages, 234; houses, 4477; souls, 22,000). Darwâz is famous for its
                    difficult roads, called “averings,” which are carried along the faces of
                    perpendicular precipices, on planks resting on iron bolts driven into the rock;
                    the roads are, however, said to be much improved since the state came under
                    Bokhara. Darwâz extends over the valley of the Khingâb river to the north as
                    well as over the valley of the lower Panjah. It has three amlakdarates on the
                    Khingâb—Upper Wakhia, Lower Wakhia, and Khulâs— and one, Sagridasht, on an
                    affluent of the Khingâb, containing 84 villages with 2458 habitations; it has
                    also three subdivisions on the Panjah—south-eastern or upper Darwâz terminating
                    at Kila Khüm, south-western Darwâz terminating at Zigor, and lower Darwâz—which
                    contain 31 villages with 896 habitations on the right bank, including those of
                    the Wanjab affluent, and 45 villages with 1379 habitations on the left bank,
                    including those of the Kufau river, which comes from the Shiva Pamir.</p>
                <p>Russian officers have found that at the point where the Panjah enters the plains
                    the level is about 1800 feet above the mean sea, or 12,100 feet below the
                    sources of the river in Lake Victoria; 50 miles lower down, at the junction with
                    the Kokcha, where the Panjah merges into the Amù Daria, the height is given as
                    1000 feet; at Kilif (214 miles) it is 730 feet; and at Chahârjùi (203 miles),
                    510 feet,—thence the length of the course of the river to the Sea of Aral is
                    somewhat over 500 miles. The Aral is 158 feet above the mean sea-level. Thus the
                    average slope of the Amù is about 14 inches in the mile above and 8 inches below
                    Chahârjùi. The river has been reported to be navigable for steamers up to the
                    junction with the Wâkhsh or Surkhâb; and in 1878 a Russian steamer ascended it
                    up to Khwâja Sâleh, at the junction of the boundaries of Bokhara and
                    Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>The testimony of antiquity is almost unanimous in representing the Oxus as having
                    once flowed into the Caspian Sea. Herodotus asserts that in his day the Jaxartes
                    also entered the Caspian, but this statement is so highly improbable that it
                    throws much doubt on his geographical accuracy as regards these regions. Greek
                    historians also mention a river Ochus to the south of the Oxus, flowing towards
                    the Caspian, into which it is supposed to have fallen either directly or after
                    joining a branch of the Oxus; Strabo says that both this river and the Oxus were
                    crossed by Alexander in marching from Samarkand to Merv. Maps recently published
                    by both English and Russian geographers show the supposed ancient beds of the
                    two rivers in the Turkoman! deserts, the Oxus flowing southwards from the
                    province of Khiva and joining the Caspian below the Balkhan Bay, the Ochus
                    flowing from east to west in a lower latitude, and possibly striking the Oxus
                    before it turns towards the Caspian. The first is called the old Oxus in English
                    and the Uzboi in Russian maps; the second is called the Ongùz in Russian and the
                    Chahârjùi in English maps, and is sometimes drawn as if it had been a
                    bifurcation from the Oxus at some point near Chahârjùi. But the recent
                    explorations of the Russian engineer Lessar have shown that what hitherto has
                    been taken for the dry bed of the Ochus is not the bed of a river, but merely a
                    natural furrow between sand-hills, that it cannot be the continuation either of
                    a river from the east bifurcating from the upper Oxus or of the Tejend river
                    from the south as has been supposed, and also that it does not join the Uzboi,
                    but ceases at a distance of fully 60 miles from the ancient bed of that river.
                    Thus the bed of the Ochus has still to be discovered.</p>
                <p>As regards the Oxus, some eminent geographers are of opinion that it has
                    disembogued into the Aral Sea from time immemorial as at this day; other
                    geographers of equal weight have asserted that the Aral has fluctuated at
                    different periods of history between the condition of a great inland sea and
                    that of a reedy marsh, according to the varying course of its two feeders the
                    Jaxartes and the Oxus. Now the position and height of the head of the delta of
                    the Oxus relatively to the Aral and the Caspian Seas are such that comparatively
                    slight changes in the relations of the river to its banks and bed would readily
                    divert its course from one sea to the other. Khwâja-ili, at the head of the
                    delta, is 217 feet above the mean sea; the Aral is 158 feet above and the
                    Caspian 85 feet below the mean sea. The length of channel from Khwâja-ili to the
                    Aral is 110 miles, with a fall of 59 feet, or about 6 inches <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n116/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0116-0105"/> in the mile; the length of channel from the town
                    of Urganj near Khwâja-ili to the Caspian is about 600 miles, with a fall of
                    (say) 300 feet, or also about 6 inches to the mile. Thus the degree of slope is
                    much the same in both directions, and consequently the blocking of the channel
                    towards one sea—either naturally as by an accidental deposit of silt, or
                    artificially by the construction of dams for the diversion of the river—would
                    most probably be soon followed by a flow of water towards the other sea. The
                    writings of Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolemy indicate that from 500 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the Oxus flowed
                    into the Caspian. About 605 a great change is said to have taken place, which
                    turned the full stream of the Oxus into the Aral. In subsequent years dams were
                    constructed for irrigation purposes which prevented the stream from reverting to
                    the Caspian. In 1221, during the siege of Urganj by the Turks, the dams were
                    purposely broken down, and the stream was allowed to find its way back to the
                    Uzboi, which had been deserted for several centuries. But by 1643 the Oxus is
                    said to have been again debouching into the Aral, as at the present time.</p>
