                    ancestors were settled at Eyndhoven, near the small village of Ostaden, from
                    which they took their name. Early in the 17th century Jan Hendricx, a weaver,
                    moved with his family from Eyndhoven to Haarlem, where he married and founded a
                    large family. The eldest and youngest of his sons became celebrated artists.</p>

                    Hendricx’s boys, was born at Haarlem shortly before the 10th December 1610, when

                    the 27th April, his burial on the 2d May 1685, at Haarlem. According to
                    Houbraken he was taught by Frans Hals, at that time master of Adrian Brouwer. At
                    twenty-six he joined a company of the civic guard at Haarlem; at twentyeight he
                    married his first wife, who lived till 1642. He speedily married again, but
                    again became a widower in 1666. Persons curious of matters connected with the
                    lives of famous men may visit the house in the Königsstraat at Haarlem where
                    Adrian Ostade lived in 1657, or that of the Ridderstraat which he occupied in
                    1670. He took the highest honours of his profession, the presidency of the
                    painters’ guild at Haarlem, in 1662. Amongst the treasures of the Louvre
                    collection, a striking picture represents the father of a large family sitting
                    in state with his wife at his side in a handsomely furnished room, surrounded by
                    his son and five daughters, and a young married couple. It is an old tradition
                    that Ostade here painted himself and his children in holiday attire; yet the
                    style is much too refined for the painter of boors, and pitiless records tell us
                    that Ostade had but one daughter. The number of Ostade’s pictures is given by
                    Smith at three hundred and eighty-five. It is probable that he painted many
                    more. At his death the stock of his unsold pieces was over two hundred. His
                    engraved plates were put up to auction, with the pictures, and fifty etched
                    plates—most of them dated 1647-48—were disposed of in 1686. At the present time
                    it is easy to trace two hundred and twenty pictures in public and private
                    collections, of which one hundred and four are signed and dated, seventeen are
                    signed with the name but not with the date, and the rest are accepted as genuine
                    by modern critics.</p>
                <p>Adrian Ostade is the contemporary of David Teniers and Adrian Brouwer. Like them
                    he spent his life in the delineation of the homeliest subjects—tavern scenes,
                    village fairs, and country quarters. Between Teniers and Ostade the contrast
                    lies in the different condition of the agricultural classes of Brabant and
                    Holland, and the atmosphere and dwellings that were peculiar to each region.
                    Brabant has more sun, more comfort, and a higher type of humanity; Teniers, in
                    consequence, is silvery and sparkling; the people he paints are fair specimens
                    of a well-built race. Holland, in the vicinity of Haarlem, seems to have
                    suffered much from war; the air is moist and hazy, and the people, as depicted
                    by Ostade are short, ill-favoured, and marked with the stamp of adversity on
                    their features and dress. Brouwer, who painted the Dutch boor in his frolics and
                    passion, imported more of the spirit of Frans Hals into his delineations than
                    his colleague; but the type is the same as Ostade’s, only more animated and
                    vicious. How was it that the disciples of Hals should have fallen into this
                    course, whilst Hals himself drew people of the gentle classes with such
                    distinction <hi rend="italic">1</hi> It was probably because of his superiority
                    and the monopoly which he and a few colleagues at Haarlem enjoyed that his
                    pupils were forced into a humbler walk, and into this walk Hals was able to lead
                    them, because he was equally able in depicting the strolling waif or fishwife,
                    or the more aristocratic patrician who strutted about in lace collar, with his
                    rapier at his side. But the practice of Hals in this form was confined to the
                    city, or to those wanderers from the country who visited towns. Brouwer and
                    Ostade went to the country itself and lived in the taverns and cottages of
                    peasants, where they got the models for their pictures. Neither of them followed
                    the habits of the artists of the Hague, who took sitters into their studios and
                    made compositions from them. Their sitters were people, unconscious that they
                    sat, taken on the spot and from life, and transferred with cunning art to
                    pictures.</p>
                <p>There is less of the style of Hals in Adrian Ostade than in Brouwer, but a great
                    likeness to Brouwer in Ostade’s early works. During the first years of his
                    career, Ostade displayed the same tendency to exaggeration and frolic as his
                    comrade. He had humour and boisterous spirits, but he is to be distinguished
                    from his rival by a more general use of the principles of light and shade, and
                    especially by a greater concentration of light on a small surface in contrast
                    with a broad expanse of 'gloom. The key of his harmonies remains for a time in
                    the scale of greys. But his treatment is dry and careful, and in this style he
                    shuns no difficulties of detail, representing cottages inside and out, with the
                    vine leaves covering the poorness of the outer side, and nothing inside to deck
                    the patch-work of rafters and thatch, or tumble-down chimneys and ladder
                    staircases, that make up the sordid interior of the Dutch rustic of those days.
                    His men and women, attuned to these needy surroundings, are invariably dressed
                    in the poorest clothes. The hard life and privations of the race are impressed
                    on their shapes and faces, their shoes and hats, worn at heel and battered to
                    softness, as if they had descended from generation to generation, so that the
                    boy of ten seems to wear the cast-off things of his sire and grandsire. It was
                    not easy to get poetry out of such materials. But the greatness of Ostade lies
                    in the fact that he often caught the poetic side of the life of the peasant
                    class, in spite of its ugliness and stunted form and misshapen features. He did
                    so by giving their vulgar sports, their quarrels, even their quieter moods of
                    enjoyment, the magic light of the sungleam, and by clothing the wreck of
                    cottages with gay vegetation.</p>
                <p>It was natural that, with the tendency to effect which marked Ostade from the
                    first, he should have been fired by emulation to rival the masterpieces of
                    Rembrandt. His early pictures are not so rare but that we can trace how he
                    glided out of one period into the other. Before the dispersion of tlιe Gsell
                    collection at Vienna in 1872, it was easy to study the steel-grey harmonies and
                    exaggerated caricature of his early works in the period intervening between 1632
                    and 1638. There is a picture of Rustics, dated 1632, in the Kosloff collection
                    at St Petersburg; a Countryman having his Tooth Drawn, in the Belvedere of
                    Vienna, of a similar date though unsigned; a Bagpiper of 1635 in the
                    Lichtenstein gallery at Vienna; Cottage Scenes of 1635 and 1636, in the museums
                    of Carlsruhe, Darmstadt, and Dresden; Smokers in the House of Count Berchem at
                    Munich; and Card Players of 1637 in the Lichtenstein palace at Vienna, which
                    make up for the loss of the Gsell collection. The same style marks most of those
                    pieces. About 1638 or 1640 the influence of Rembrandt suddenly changed his
                    style, and he painted the Annunciation of the Brunswick museum, where the angels
                    appearing in the sky to Dutch boors half asleep amidst their cattle, sheep, and
                    dogs, in front of a cottage, at once recall the similar subject by Rembrandt,
                    and his effective mode of lighting the principal groups by rays propelled to the
                    earth out of a murky sky. But Ostade was not successful in this effort to
                    vulgarize Scripture. He might have been pardoned had he given dramatic force and
                    expression to his picture; but his shepherds were only boors without much
                    emotion, passion, or surprise. His picture was a mere effect of light, as such
                    masterly, in its sketchy rubbings, of dark brown tone relieved by strongly
                    impasted lights, but without the very qualities w hich made his usual subjects
                    attractive. When, in 1642, he painted the beautiful interior at the Louvre, in
                    which a mother tends her child in a cradle at the side of a great chimney near
                    which her husband is sitting, the darkness of a country loft is dimly illumined
                    by a beam from the sun that shines on the casement; and one might think the
                    painter intended to depict the Nativity, but that there is nothing holy in all
                    the surroundings, nothing attractive indeed except the wonderful Rembrandtesque
                    transparency, the brown tone, and the admirable keeping of the minutest parts.
                    The sparkle of Brouwer is not there; nor as yet the concentrated evenness of
                    such pictures of Rembrandt as the Meditative Philosopher at the Louvre. Yet
                    there is perhaps more conscientiousness of detail. Ostade was more at home in a
                    similar effect applied to the commonplace incident of the Slaughtering of a Pig,
                    one of the masterpieces of 1643, once in the Gsell collection at Vienna. In this
                    and similar subjects of previous and succeeding years, he returned to the homely
                    subjects in which his power and wonderful observation made him a master. He
                    never seems to have gone back to gospel illustrations till 1667, when he
                    produced the admirable Nativity of Mr Walter of Bearwood, which is onlysurpassed
                    as regards <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n68/mode/1up"

                    Carpenter’s Family at the Louvre, or the Woodcutter and Children in the gallery
                    of Cassel. Innumerable almost are the more familiar themes to which he devoted
                    his pencil during this interval, from small single figures, representing smokers
                    or drinkers, to vulgarized allegories of the five senses (Hermitage and
                    Brunswick galleries), half-lengths of fishmongers and bakers, and cottage
                    brawls, or scenes of gambling, or itinerant players and quacks, and nine-pin
                    players in the open air. The humour in some of these pieces is contagious, as in
                    the Tavern Scene of the Lacaze collection (Louvre, 1653), where a boor squeezes
                    the empty beer-pot in his hands to show that the last drop has been sucked out
                    of it. It would be tedious to enumerate the masterpieces of this kind. But those
                    who have no other opportunities may study with pleasure and advantage the large
                    series of dated pieces which adorn every European capital, from St Petersburg to
                    London. Buckingham Palace has a large store, and many and many a good specimen
                    lies hid in the private collections of England. But if we should select a few as
                    peculiarly worthy of attention, we might point to the Rustics in a Tavern of
                    1662 at the Hague, the Village School of the same year at the Louvre, the Tavern
                    Court-yard of 1670 at Cassel, the Sportsmen’s Rest of 1671 at Amsterdam, and the
                    Fiddler and his Audience of 1673 at the Hague. At Amsterdam we have the likeness
                    of a painter, in a red bonnet and violet coat, sitting with his back to the
                    spectator, at his easel. The colour-grinder is at work in a corner, a pupil
                    prepares a palette, and a black dog sleeps on the ground. The same picture, with
                    the date of 1666, is in the Dresden gallery. Both specimens are supposed to
                    represent Ostade himself. But unfortunately we see the artist’s back and not his
                    face. Ostade painted with equal vigour at all times. Two of his latest dated
                    works, the Village Street and Skittle Players in the Ashburton and Ellesmere
                    collections, were executed in 1676 without any sign of declining powers. The
                    prices which he received are not known, but those of the present day are telling
                    when compared with those of the close of last century. Early pictures, which may
                    have been sold by the painter for a few shillings, now fetch £200. Later ones,
                    which were worth £40 in 1750, are now worth £1000, and Earl Dudley gave £4120
                    for a cottage interior in 1876. The signatures of Ostade vary at different
                    periods. But the first two letters are generally interlaced. Up to 1635 Ostade
                    writes himself Ostaden.— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the Bagpiper of 1635 in
                    the Lichtenstein collection at Vienna. Later on he uses the long <hi
                        rend="italic">s</hi> (f), and occasionally he signs in capital letters
                    (Strauss collection, Vienna, 1647; and Hague museum, 1673). His pupils are his
                    own brother Isaac, Cornells Bega, Cornells Dusart, and Richard Brakenburg.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Isaac Ostade</hi> (1621-1649) was christened on the 2d
                    of June 1621, at Haarlem. He began his studies under Adrian, with whom he
                    remained till 1641, when he started on his own account. At an early period he
                    felt the influence of Rembrandt, and this is apparent in a Slaughtered Pig of
                    1639, in the gallery of Augsburg. But he soon reverted to a style more suited to
                    his pencil. He produced pictures in 1641-42 on the lines of his brother,—
                    amongst these, the Five Senses, which Adrian afterwards represented by a Man
                    Reading a Paper, a Peasant Tasting Beer, a Rustic Smearing his Sores with
                    Ointment, and a Countryman Sniffing at a Snuff-box. The contract for these
                    pieces was made before 1643, when Leendert, a dealer, summoned him for a breach
                    of his agreement before the burgomaster of Haarlem. The matter was referred to
                    the guild, and evidence was adduced to prove that Isaac had promised in 1641 to
                    deliver six pictures and seven rounds, including the Five Senses, for 27
                    florins. Isaac, in his defence, urged that he had finished two of the pictures
                    and two of the rounds, which Leendert had seen, but neglected to fetch; that he
                    had begun the remainder of the series, but that in the meanwhile the value of
                    his works had risen, so that he thought that on that ground alone he was freed
                    from the obligations he had assumed. The guild decided that Isaac was bound to
                    furnish the pictures before Easter 1643. But they reduced the number of the
                    rounds to five, and assessed the price of the whole at 50 florins. A specimen of
                    Isaac’s work at this period may be seen in the Laughing Boor with a Pot of Beer,
                    in the museum of Amsterdam; the cottage interior, with two peasants and three
                    children near a fire, in the Berlin museum; a Concert, with people listening to
                    singers accompanied by a piper and flute player, and a Boor Stealing a Kiss from
                    a Woman, in the Lacaze collection at the Louvre. The interior at Berlin is
                    lighted from a casement in the same Rembrandtesque style as Adrian’s interior of
                    1643 at the Louvre. The value of these panels, which we saw estimated in 1643 at
                    two florins apiece, was greatly enhanced in the following century, when the
                    Laughing Boor at Amsterdam was sold for 56 florins. But the low price fixed by
                    the guild of Haarlem must have induced Isaac to give up the practice, in which
                    he could only hope to remain a satellite in the orbit of Adrian, and accordingly
                    we find him gradually abandoning the cottage subjects of his brother for
                    landscapes in the fashion of Esaias Van de Velde and Salomon Ruisdael. Once
                    only, in 1645, he seems to have fallen into the old groove, when he produced the
                    Slaughtered Pig, with the boy puffing out a bladder, in the museum of Lille. But
                    this was a mere accident. Isaac’s progress in the new path which he had cut out
                    for himself was greatly facilitated by his previous experience as a figure
                    painter; and, although he now selected his subjects either from village high
                    streets or frozen canals, he was enabled to give fresh life and animation to the
                    scenes he depicted by groups of people full of movement and animation, which he
                    relieved in their coarse humours and sordid appearance by a refined and
                    searching study of picturesque contrasts. Unfortunately he did not live long
                    enough to bring his art to the highest perfection. He died at twenty-eight, on
                    the 16th October 1649.</p>
                <p>The first manifestation of Isaac’s surrender of Adrian’s style is apparent in
                    1644 when the skating and sledging scenes were executed which we see in the
                    Lacaze collection and the galleries of the Hermitage, Antwerp, and Lille. Three
                    of these examples bear the artist’s name, spelt Isack van Ostade, and the dates
                    of 1644 and 1645. The road-side inns, with halts of travellers, form a compact
                    series from 1646 to 1649. In this, the last form of his art, Isaac has very
                    distinct peculiarities. The air which pervades his composition is warm and
                    sunny, yet mellow and hazy, as if the sky were veiled with a vapour coloured by
                    moor smoke. The trees are rubbings of umber, in which the prominent foliage is
                    tipped with touches hardened in a liquid state by amber varnish mediums. The
                    same principle applied to details such as glazed bricks or rents in the mud
                    lining of cottages gives an unreal and conventional stamp to those particular
                    parts. But these blemishes are forgotten when one looks at the broad contrasts
                    of light and shade and the masterly figures of steeds and riders, and travellers
                    and rustics, or quarrelling children and dogs, poultry, and cattle, amongst
                    which a favourite place is always given to the white horse, who seems as
                    invariable an accompaniment as the grey in the skirmishes and fairs of
                    Wouvermans. But it is in winter scenes that Isaac displays the best qualities.
