                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which, in a general scientific sense, excites our
                    interest chiefly by its almost universal diffusion throughout the vegetable
                    kingdom. Traces of oxalates are contained in the juices of, probably, all plants
                    at certain stages of their growth; but so are lime-salts, which, in solutions,
                    can coexist with the former only in the presence of free acid. Hence the
                    frequent occurrence in plant-cells of those crystals of oxalates of lime with
                    which all microscopists are familiar. In certain algae, if they grow on
                    calcareous soils, this salt, according to Bracannot, may form as much as
                    one-half of the total dry solids. Of phanerogamic tissues, the roots of the
                    officinal kinds of rhubarb may be named as being peculiarly rich in oxalate of
                    limecrystals. It is perhaps as well to add that the juicy stems of the garden
                    rhubarb, although not free of oxalic, owe their sourness chiefly to malic acid.
                    The strongly sour juices of certain species of Jfømrøand <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acetosella,</hi> on the other hand, are exceptionally rich in acid oxalates.
                    The juice of <hi rend="italic">0xalis Acetosella,</hi> when concentrated by
                    evaporation, deposits on cooling a large crop of crystals of binoxalate of
                    potash. This salt, as an educt from the plant juice named, has been known for
                    some three centuries as “sal acetosellae” or <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> salt
                    of sorrel.” Oxalic acid and all soluble oxalates are dangerous poisons, which
                    almost implies that they cannot occur, under normal conditions, in the juices of
                    the higher animals. Yet human urine always contains traces of oxalate of lime,
                    which, when the urine is or becomes alkaline, forms on standing a
                    microcrystalline deposit. In certain diseased conditions of the system the
                    oxalate is formed more largely, and may be deposited within the bladder in
                    crystals or even develop into calculi.</p>
                <p>The discovery of oxalic acid must be credited to Scheele, who obtained it in 1776
                    by the oxidation of sugar with nitric acid, and called it saccharic acid. In
                    1784 he proved its identity with the acid of sal acetosellae. Our knowledge of
                    the elementary composition of oxalic acid is the result of the independent
                    labours of Berzelius, Döbereiner, and Dulong (1814-21).</p>
                <p>Its artificial synthesis can be effected in various ways. Thus, for instance, (1)
                    cyanogen, when dissolved in aqueous hydrochloric acid, gradually assimilates 4H

                <p>Sugar, starch, and many other organic bodies of the “fatty” series, when boiled
                    with nitric acid, yield oxalic acid as a penultimate product of oxidation In

                    by any means obsolete, is almost superseded by a new process which we owe to Mr
                    Dale of Manchester.</p>
                <p>Mr Dale’s process is founded upon the old observation of Gay-Lussac’s that
                    cellulose, by fusion with caustic potash, is oxidized into oxalate with
                    evolution of (impure) hydrogen. In Mr Dale’s works (at Warrington) sawdust and
                    WOod-shavings do service as cellulose, while a mixed caustic alkali lye of 1 *34
                    to 1 ’ 35 specific gravity, containing 1KHO for every 3NaH0, serves as a
                    reagent. Unmixed caustic soda gives no or little oxalate. The wood-shavings are
                    soaked in a quantity of lye equal to 30 to 40 per cent, of their weight of dry
                    alkali, and the mixture is evaporated down on iron plates at about 200° C. with
                    constant agitation, until it is converted into a homogeneous brown mass
                    completely soluble in water. This mass (which is as yet very poor in oxalate) is
                    then dried up fully at a somewhat lower temperature, and thus converted into a
                    crude oxalate equivalent to 28 to 30 per cent, of its weight of oxalic-acid
                    crystals. Messrs Roberts, Dale, &amp; Co. have come, latterly, to substitute for
                    the iron plates an iron pipe passing slantingly through a heated chamber and
                    provided inside with a revolving screw, which draws in the mixture of wood and
                    alkali below, and conveys it along at such a rate that it comes out above as
                    finished product. The crude oxalate is lixiviated with cold water, when the bulk
                    of the oxalic acid remains as soda salt, while the rest of the alkali passes
                    into solution as, substantially, carbonate. The oxalate, after having been
                    washed with the least sufficient quantity of water, is boiled with a dilute milk
                    of lime and thus converted into a precipitate of oxalate of lime, while caustic
                    soda passes in to solution, which is added to the liquors produced in the
                    separation of the oxalate of soda from the surplus alkali. The oxalate of lime
                    is washed and then decomposed by boiling it with three times the calculated
                    amount of dilute sulphuric acid, the sulphate of lime filtered off, and the
                    solution evaporated to crystallization. The yield as oxalic acid crystals
                    amounts to 50 to 60 per cent, of the weight of the -wood-shavings. The united
                    alkali-liquors are causticized with lime, and thus (apart from the unavoidable
                    losses) the originally employed caustic alkali is recovered in its entirety.</p>
                <p>Commercial (oxalic) acid is contaminated chiefly with sulphuric acid and alkali,
                    of which the latter cannot be removed by recrystallization from water, but,
                    according to Stolba, easily and exhaustively by recrystallization from 10 to 15
                    per cent, hydrochloric acid.</p>

                    readily at 165° C , without previous fusion, in needles. At higher temperatures
                    it breaks up, more or less completely, into CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> +
                    formic acid, C ’ H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    (or CO + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O). The crystallized acid dissolves in
                    10 ’ 5 parts of water of 14°'5, also in alcohol. The solution readily
                    neutralizes basic hydrates and carbonates; in the case of the alkalies and
                    alkaline earths, the point of neutrality to litmus corresponds to the normal
                    salt, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to the ratio CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>

                    salts rather sparingly; of the rest of oxalates, as far as they are normal
                    salts, the majority are insoluble or difficultly soluble in water, and therefore
                    most conveniently produced, by double decomposition, as precipitates.</p>
