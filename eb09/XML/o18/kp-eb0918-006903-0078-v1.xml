                    rounded. Tail a little more than half the length of the body and head together,
                    very broad and strong at the base, and gradually tapering to the end, somewhat
                    flattened horizontally. The fur is of very fine quality, consisting of a short
                    soft under fur of a whitish grey colour, brown at the tips, interspersed with
                    longer, stiffer, and thicker hairs, very shining, greyish at the base, bright
                    rich brown at the points, especially on the upper parts and outer surface of the
                    legs; the throat, cheeks, under parts and inner surface of the legs brownish
                    grey throughout. Individual otters vary much in size. The total length from the
                    nose to the end of the tail averages about 3⅜ feet, of which the tail occupies 1
                    foot 3 or 4 inches. The weight of a full size male is from 18 to 24 B⅛, that of
                    a female about 4 8&gt; less.</p>
                <p>As the otter lives almost exclusively on fish, it is rarely met with far from
                    water, and usually frequents the shores of brooks, rivers, lakes, and, in some
                    localities, the sea itself. It is a most expert swimmer and diver, easily
                    overtaking and seizing fish in the water, but when it has captured its prey it
                    brings it to shore to devour it. When lying upon the bank it holds the fish
                    between its fore-paws, commences at the head and then eats gradually towards the
                    tail, which it is said always to leave. The female produces three to five young
                    ones at a time, in the month of March or April, and brings them up in a nest
                    formed of grass or other herbage, usually placed in a hollow place in the bank
                    of a river, or under the shelter of the roots of some overhanging tree. The
                    Common Otter is found in localities suitable to its habits throughout Great
                    Britain and Ireland, though far less abundantly than formerly, for, being very
                    destructive to fish, and thus coming into keen competition with those who pursue
                    the occupation of fishing either for sport or for gain, it is rarely allowed to
                    live in peace when once its haunts are discovered. Otter hunting with packs of
                    hounds of a special breed, and trained for the purpose, was formerly a common
                    pastime in the country. When hunted down and brought to bay by the dogs, the
                    otter is finally despatched by long spears carried for the purpose by the
                    huntsmen.</p>
                <p>The Common Otter ranges throughout the greater part of Europe and Asia. A closely
                    allied but larger species, <hi rend="italic">L. canadensis,</hi> is extensively
                    distributed throughout North America, where it is systematically pursued by
                    professional trappers for the value of its fur. An Indian species, <hi
                        rend="italic">L. nair,</hi> is regularly trained by the natives of some
                    parts of Bengal to assist them in fishing, by driving the fish into the nets. In
                    China also otters are taught to catch fish, being let into the water for the
                    purpose attached to a long cord.</p>
                <p>Otters are widely distributed over the earth, and, as they are much alike in size
                    and coloration, their specific distinctions are by no means well defined.
                    Besides those mentioned above, the following have been described, <hi
                        rend="italic">L. californica,</hi> North America; <hi rend="italic">L.
                        felina,</hi> Central America, Peru, and Chili; <hi rend="italic">L.
                        brasiliensis,</hi> Brazil; <hi rend="italic">L. maculicollis,</hi> South
                    Africa; <hi rend="italic">L. whiteleyi,</hi> Japan; <hi rend="italic">L.
                        chinensis,</hi> China and Formosa, and other doubtful species. A very large
                    species from Demerara and Surinam, with a prominent flange-like ridge along each
                    lateral margin of the tail, <hi rend="italic">L. sandbachii,</hi> constitutes
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Pteronura</hi> of Gray. Others, with the feet only
                    slightly webbed, and the claws exceedinglysmall or altogether wanting on some of
                    the toes, and also ∖vith some difference in dental characters, are with better
                    reason separated into a distinct genus called <hi rend="italic">Aonyx.</hi>
                    These are <hi rend="italic">A. inunguis</hi> from South Africa and <hi
                        rend="italic">A. leptonyx</hi> from Java and Sumatra.</p>
                <p>More distinct still is the Sea-Otter <hi rend="italic">(Enhydra</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">lutris).</hi> It differs from all other known <hi
                        rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> in having but two incisors on each side of the
                    lower jaw, the one corresponding to the first (very small in the true otters)
                    being constantly absent. Though the molar teeth resemble those of <hi
                        rend="italic">Lutra</hi> in their proportions, they differ very much in the
                    exceeding roundness and massiveness of their crowns and bluntness of their
                    cusps. The fore feet are very small, with five short webbed toes, and naked
                    palms; the hind feet are altogether unlike those of the true otters, but
                    approaching those of the seals, being large, flat, palmated, and furry on both
                    sides. The outer toe is the largest and stoutest, the rest gradually diminishing
                    in size to the first. The tail is about one-fourth of the length of the head and
                    body, cylindrical and obtuse. The entire length of the animal from nose to end
                    of tail is about 4 feet, so that the body is considerably larger and more
                    massive than that of the English otter. The skin is peculiarly loose, and
                    stretches when removed from the animal so as to give the idea of a still larger
                    creature than it really is. The fur is remarkable for the preponderance of the
                    beautifully soft woolly under fur, the longer stiffer hairs being very scanty.
                    The general colour is a deep liver-brown, everywhere silvered or frosted with
                    the hoary tips of the longer stiff <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n79/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0079-0070"/> hairs. These are, however, removed when the
                    skin is dressed for commercial purposes.</p>
                <p>Sea-otters are only found upon the rocky shores of certain parts of the North
                    Pacific Ocean, especially the Aleutian Islands and Alaska, extending as far
                    south on the American coast as Oregon; but, owing to the unremitting persecution
                    to which they are subjected for the sake of their skins, which rank among the
                    most valuable known to the furrier, their numbers are greatly diminishing, and,
                    unless some restriction can be placed upon their destruction, such as that which
                    protects the fur seals of the Pribyloff Islands, the species is threatened with
                    extermination, or, at all events, excessive scarcity. When this occurs, the
                    occupation of five thousand of the half-civilized natives of Alaska, who are
                    dependent upon sea-otter hunting as a means for obtaining their living, will be
                    gone. The principal hunting grounds at present are the little rocky islets and
                    reefs around the island of Saanach and the Chernobours, where they are captured
                    by spearing, clubbing, or nets, and recently by the more destructive rifle
                    bullet. They do not feed on fish, like the true otters, but on clams, mussels,
                    sea-urchins, and crabs, and the female brings forth but a single young one at a
                    time, apparently at no particular season of the year. They are excessively shy
                    and wary, and all attempts to rear the young ones in captivity have hitherto
                    failed.</p>
