                    chief-commissionership. Lying between 25° 34' and 28° 42' N. lat. and between
                    79° 44' and 83° 9' E. long., it is bounded on the N.E. by Nepâl, on the N.W. by
                    the Rohilkhand division, on the S.W. by the Ganges river, on the E. and S.E. by
                    the Benares division. The administrative headquarters of the province are at
                    Lucknow.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Aspects.—</hi> Oudh forms the central portion of the
                    great Gangetic plain, sloping downwards from the Nepal Himalayas in the
                    north-east to the Ganges on the south-west. For 60 miles along the northern
                    border of Gonda and Bahrâich districts the boundary extends close up to the
                    lower slopes of the Himàlayas, embracing the damp and unhealthy sub-montane
                    region known as the <hi rend="italic">tardi.</hi> To the westward of this, the
                    northern boundary recedes a little from the mountain tract, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">tardi</hi> in this portion of the range has been for the most part
                    ceded to Nepâl. With the exception of a belt of Government forest along the
                    northern frontier, the rest of the province consists of a fertile and densely
                    peopled monotonous plain. The greatest elevation (600 feet) is attained in the
                    jungleclad plateau of Khairigarh in Kheri district, while the extreme south-east
                    frontier is only 230 feet above sealevel. Four great rivers traverse or skirt
                    the plain of Oudh in converging courses—the Ganges, the Gumti, the Gogra, and
                    the Râptï. Numerous smaller channels seam the whole face of the country,
                    carrying off the surplus drainage in the rains, but drying up in the hot season.
                    All the larger rivers, except the Gumti, as well as most of the smaller streams,
                    have beds hardly sunk below the general level; and in time of floods they burst
                    through their confining banks and carve out new channels for themselves.
                    Numerous shallow ponds or <hi rend="italic">jhils</hi> mark the former beds of
                    the shifting rivers. These <hi rend="italic">jhils</hi> have great value, not
                    only as preservatives against inundation, but also as reservoirs for irrigation.
                    The soil of Oudh consists of a rich alluvial deposit, the detritus of the
                    Himalayan system, washed down into the Ganges valley by ages of fluvial action.
                    Usually a light loam, it passes here and there into pure clay, or degenerates
                    occasionally into barren sand. The uncul livable land consists chiefly of
                    extensive <hi rend="italic">usar</hi> plains, found in the southern and western
                    districts, and covered by the deleterious saline efflorescence known as <hi
                    rend="italic">reh.</hi> Oudh possesses no valuable minerals. Salt was
                    extensively manufactured during native rule, but the British Government has
                    prohibited this industry for fiscal reasons. Nodular limestone <hi rend="italic"
                    >(kankar')</hi> occurs in considerable deposits, and is used as road metal.</p>
                <p>The general aspect of the province is that of a rich expanse of waving and very
                    varied crops, interspersed by numerous ponds or lakes. The villages lie thickly
                    scattered, consisting of low thatched cottages, and surrounded by patches of
                    garden land, or groves of banyan, <hi rend="italic">pipal,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">pdkar</hi> trees. The dense foliage of the mango marks the site of
                    almost every little homestead,—no less an area than 1000 square miles being
                    covered by these valuable fruit-trees. Tamarinds overhang the huts of the poorer
                    classes, while the neighbourhood of a wealthy family may be recognized by the
                    graceful clumps of bamboo. Plantains, guavas, jack-fruit, limes, and oranges add
                    further beauty to the village plots. The flora of the Government reserved
                    forests is rich and varied. The <hi rend="italic">sdl</hi> tree yields the most
                    important timber; the finest logs are cut in the Khairigarh jungles and floated
                    down the Gogra to Bahramghât, where they are sawn. The hard wood of the <hi
                    rend="italic">shisham</hi> is also valuable; and several other timber-trees
                    afford materials for furniture or roofing shingle. Among the scattered jungles
                    in various parts of the province, the <hi rend="italic">mahud</hi> tree is
                    prized alike for its edible flowers, its fruits, and its timber. The <hi
                    rend="italic">jhils</hi> supply the villages with wild rice, the roots and seeds
                    of the lotus, and the <hi rend="italic">singhdra</hi> water-nut. The fauna
                    comprises most of the animals and birds common to the Gangetic plain; but many
                    species, formerly common, have now almost, if not entirely, disappeared. The
                    wild elephant is now practically unknown, except when a stray specimen loses its
                    way at the foot of the hills. Tigers are now only found in any numbers in the
                    wilds of Khairigarh. Leopards still haunt the cane-brakes and thickets along the
                    banks of the rivers; and <hi rend="italic">nilgdi</hi> and antelopes abound.
                    Game birds consist of teal and wild duck, snipe, jungle fowl, and peacock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of Oudh is less damp than that of
                    Lower Bengal, and has greater varieties of temperature. The year falls naturally
                    into three seasons—the rainy, from the middle of June to the beginning of
                    October; the cold weather, from October to February or March; and the <pb

                    temperature at Lucknow for the thirteen years ending 1880 was 78°; in 1881 it
                    was the same, the maximum temperature on any one day during the year being 111°,
                    and the minimum 35°. The heat proves most oppressive in the rainy season. The
                    heaviest downpours occur in July and September, but are extremely capricious.
                    The average annual rainfall at Lucknow for the fourteen years ending 1881
                    amounted to <hi rend="italic">37'57</hi> inches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population. —</hi> Oudh is probably more densely peopled than
                    any other equal rural area in the world. The census of 1881 returned the
                    population at 11,387,741 (5,851,655 males and 5,536,086 females), distributed
                    over an area of 24,245 square miles. The following table exhibits the areas and

                <p>Divided according to religion, the population consisted of 9,942,411 Hindus,
                    1,433,443 Mohammedans, 1154 Sikhs, 9060 Christians, and 1673 others. The
                    Mohammedans are subdivided into the four classes of Sayyids, Shaikhs, Pathâns,
                    and Mughals, but they have lost greatly in social prestige since the downfall of
                    the royal line. In the higher rank they still number seventy-eight <hi
                    rend="italic">tdlukddrs.</hi> Some of these, as the rajas of Utraula and
                    Nanpara, trace their descent from local Mohammedan chieftains. Others belong to
                    ancient Hindu families. The Mohammedans still furnish the ablest public servants
                    in the province, and supply almost entirely the native bar. The lower orders
                    make industrious cultivators and weavers. Among the Hindu population, the
                    Brahmans preponderate, numbering 1,364,783, about one-eighth of the entire
                    population. They include, however, only six <hi rend="italic">tdlukddrs</hi> in
                    the whole province, and two of these acquired their wéalth during the later days
                    of Mohammedan rule. Large numbers of them follow agriculture, but they make
                    undesirable tenants,—most of them refusing to hold the plough, and cultivating
                    their fields by hired labour. They supply good soldiers, however, and many are
                    employed in trade. The Kshattriyas, or Rajputs, form the great landholding
                    class,’ but the majority are now in decayed circumstances. The Mohammedans,
                    Brahmans, and Kshattriyas compose the higher social stratum of society, and
                    number altogether about a fourth of the entire population. Amongst the lower
                    Hindus, the Kâyasths, or clerk and scrivener class, number 147,432. The Sudras
                    or lowest class of Hindus include 1,185,512 Ahirs, cattle graziers and
                    cultivators. The best tenantry and most industrious cultivators are to be found
                    amongst the Kurmis, who number nearly 800,000. Of the aboriginal or
                    semi-Hinduized tribes some, such as the Pasis, who number 718,906, make good
                    soldiers, and furnish the greater part of the rural police. Others, like the
                    Bhars and Thârus, live in small isolated groups on the outskirts of the jungle
                    or the hill country, and hold no communication with the outer world. The Nats
                    and Kanjars wander like gipsies over the country, with their small movable
                    villages or wigwams of matting and leaf-screens. The Koris and Chamârs, weavers
                    and leather-cutters, reach the lowest depth of all. In the northern districts
                    many still practically occupy the position of serfs, bound to the soil, having
                    seldom spirit enough to avail themselves of the remedy afforded by the courts of
                    law. They hold the plough for the Brahman or Kshattriya master, and dwell with
                    the pigs in a separate quarter of the village, apart from their purer
                    neighbours.</p>
                <p>Fifteen towns in the province have a population exceeding 10,000 persons,
                    according to the census of 1881, namely—Lucknow, 239,773; Faizâbâd, 38,828;
                    Lucknow Cantonment, 21,530; Bahrâich, 19,439; Shâhâbâd, 18,510; Tânda, 16,594;
                    Sandila, 14,865; Khairâbâd, 14,217; Nawabganj, 13,933; Ajudhia, 11,643; Rudauli,
                    11,394; Bilgrâm, 11,067; Mallawan, 10,970; Lahârpur, 10,437; Hardoi, 10,026.
                    Thirty-six other towns have a population exceeding 5000. The general population
                    is essentially rural, spread over the surface of the country in small
                    cultivating communities. Over 90 per cent, of the population belong to the rural
                    class.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> There are three harvests, reaped
                    respectively in September, December, and March, while sugar-cane comes to
                    maturity in February, cotton in May, and <hi rend="italic">sdnwdn</hi> in almost
                    any month of the year. The principal September crops are rice, Indian corn, and
                    millets. Fine nce, transplanted in August from nurseries near the village sites,
                    forms the most valuable item of the December harvest, the other staples being
                    mustard-seed and pulses. Wheat forms the main spring crop. Sugar-cane occupies
                    the land for an entire year; it requires much labour and several waterings, but
                    the result in ordinary years amply repays the outlay.</p>
                <p>At the date of the annexation of Oudh in 1856, 23,500 villages, or about
                    two-thirds of the entire area of the province, were in the possession of the
                    great <hi rend="italic">tdlukddrs,</hi> heads of powerful clans and
                    representatives of ancient families, a feudal aristocracy, based upon rights in
                    the soil, which went back to traditional times, and which were heartily
                    acknowledged by the subordinate holders. The new settlement paid no regard to
                    their claims, and many landholders were stripped of almost their entire
                    possessions. The mutiny of 1857 suddenly put a stop to this work of
                    disinheritance, and it is hardly to be wondered at that throughout Oudh, the
                    whole <hi rend="italic">tdlukddri,</hi> with a very few isolated exceptions,
                    joined the sepoys. On the restoration of order the principle adopted was to
                    restore to the <hi rend="italic">tdlukddrs</hi> all that they had formerly
                    possessed, but in such a manner that their rights should depend upon the
                    immediate grant of the British Government. About two-thirds of the number
                    accepted an invitation to come to Lucknow, and there concluded political
                    arrangements with the Government. On the one hand, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tdlukddrs</hi> bound themselves to level all forts, give up arms, and act
                    loyally, to pay punctually the revenue assessed upon them and the wages of the
                    village officials, and to assist the police in keeping order. On the other hand,
                    the British Government conferred a right of property unknown alike to ⅛indu and
                    to Mohammedan law, comprising full power of alienation by will, and succession
                    according to primogeniture in case of intestacy. The land revenue demand was
                    fixed at one-half the gross rental; subordinate tenureholders were confirmed in
                    their ancient privileges; and a clause was introduced to protect the actual
                    cultivators from extortion. Such were the main features of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sanads</hi> issued by Sir C. Wingfield in October 1859, which constitute the
                    land system of Oudh to the present day, subject to a few minor modifications.
                    The detailed operations for giving effect to this settlement were carried out by
                    a revenue survey, conducted both by fields and villages, begun in 1860, and
                    finished in 1871. The total assessed area in 1881-82 was 14,877,020 acres, the
                    total assessment as land revenue being £1,449,147, or an average of Is. ll⅛d∙
                    per acre. The total cultivated area is 8,274,560 acres; cultivable and grazing
                    lands are set down at 4,035,351 acres; and uncultivable waste at 2,567,109
                    acres.</p>
                <p>The estates on the revenue roll are divided into three classes :— (1) those held
                    under the <hi rend="italic">tdlukddri</hi> rules described above; (2) those held
                    by ordinary <hi rend="italic">zaminddri</hi> tenure; and (3) those held in
                    fee-simple. There are altogether about 400 <hi rend="italic">tdlukddrs</hi> in
                    the province, of whom about two-thirds, with an area of about 2⅜ million acres,
                    hold their estates under the rule of primogeniture. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >zaminddri</hi> estates, locally known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >mufrdd,</hi> may be the undivided property of a single owner; but far more
                    commonly they are owned by a coparcenary community who regard themselves as
                    descendants of a common ancestor. The fee-simple estates, which are very few in
                    number, consist of land sold under the Waste Land Rules. The sub-tenures under
                    the above estates are—(1) sub-settled villages comprised within <hi
                    rend="italic">tdlukddri</hi> estates; (2) lands known as <hi rend="italic">sir,
                    daswant, ndnkdn,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dihddri,</hi> held by proprietors
                    who have been unable to prove their right to the sub-settlement of a whole
                    village; (3) groves held by cultivators, who, according to immemorial custom,
                    give the landlord a certain share of the produce; (4) lands granted, either by
                    sale or as gifts, for religious endowments; and (5) lands held rent-free by
                    village servants and officials.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce and Manufactures.—</hi> Under native rule the only
                    exports were salt and saltpetre, while the imports were confined to articles of
                    luxury required for the Lucknow court. Since the introduction of British
                    authority, although Lucknow has declined, countless small centres of traffic
                    have sprung up throughout the country. The staple exports consist of wheat and
                    other food grains, and oil-seeds; the main imports are cotton piece goods,
                    cotton twist, and salt. Cawnpur, though lying on the southern bank of the Ganges
                    within the North-Western Provinces, is, in fact, the emporium for the whole
                    trade of Oudh, by rail, road, and river. The enormous exports of wheat and
                    oil-seeds from Cawnpur represent to a great extent the surplus harvest of the
                    Oudh cultivator. A brisk trade is also carried on with Nepal, along the three
                    frontier districts of Kheri, Bahrâich, and Gonda. The policy of the Nepal court
                    is to compel this traffic to be transacted at marts within its own dominions. At
                    all of these a considerable number of Oudh merchants are permanently settled,
                    whereas Nepâlis rarely cross the frontier to trade except for the purchase of
                    petty necessaries. The principal exports from Oudh into Nepal are Indian and
                    European piece goods, salt, sugar, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n82/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0082-0073"/> tobacco, spices, and chemicals. The imports from
                    Nepal, which considerably exceed the exports in value, consist chiefly of rice,
                    oil-seeds, <hi rend="italic">ghi</hi> or clarified butter, metal-wares, timber,
                    spices, drugs, and cattle.</p>
                <p>No province of India is more destitute of wholesale manufactures than Oudh.
                    Almost all manufactured articles of any nicety require to be imported. The only
                    specialties are gold and silver lace-work, silver chasing, and rich embroidery,
                    all confined to Lucknow, and the weaving of a peculiar class of cotton goods,
                    which still flourishes at Tanda.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway forms the
                    great trunk of communications. A branch runs from Lucknow through Unao to
                    Cawnpur; and . another diverges at Bara Banki for Bahramghât on the Gogra. The
                    whole railway forms a loopline between the East Indian and the Sind, Punjab, and
                    Delhi systems. Good roads connect all the principal towns, and much traffic
                    passes along the rivers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The administration belongs to the
                    non-regulation system, under which a single officer discharges both fiscal and
                    judicial functions. The province contains twelve districts, each under a
                    deputy-commissioner. The chief-commissionership is now amalgamated with the
                    governorship of the North-Western Provinces. The high court, presided over by
                    the judicial commissioner, forms the ultimate court of appeal. The principal
                    items of revenue consist of the land revenue, which stands at about £1,400,000;
                    stamps, £116,770; excise, £100,411; forests, £31,114; and cesses over £101,000.
                    In 1881 the total police force numbered 7634 officers and men, maintained at a
                    cost of £95,815.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History. —</hi> At the dawn of history Oudh appears as a
                    flourishing kingdom, ruled over from Srâvasti by a powerful sovereign. In its
                    capital Sakya Muni (Buddha) began his labours, and the city long remained a seat
                    of learning for Buddhist disciples. For six centuries Srâvasti maintained a high
                    position among the states of northern India, but in the 1st century of our era
                    the Buddhist monarch of Kashmir was defeated by the Brâhmanical king of Ujjain,
                    who restored the fanes and holy places of Ajodhya, the Hindu sacred city, which
                    had fallen into decay. A long struggle between Buddhism and Brahmanism followed,
                    and when the Chinese pilgrim Fa Hian (c. 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi>
                    visited Srâvasti, as one of the most famous historical places of his religion,
                    he found the once populous city still marked by lofty walls, enclosing the ruins
                    of numerous temples and palaces, but inhabited only by a few destitute monks and
                    devotees. In the 7th century the desolation was complete. According to local
                    tradition, about the 8th or 9th century the Thârus, an aboriginal tribe,
                    descended from the hills and began to clear the jungle which had overgrown the
                    deserted kingdom, as far as the sacred city of Ajodhya. To the present day these
                    aborigines are the only people who can withstand the influence of malaria, and
                    so become the pioneers of civilization in the 1‘ungle tracts. About a century
                    later, a family of Sombansi ineage, from the north-west, subjected the wild
                    settlers to their sway. The new dynasty belonged to the Jain faith, and still
                    ruled at or near the ruins of Srâvasti at the time of the invasion of Mahmud’s
                    famous general, Sayyid Sâlâr. Towards the close of the 11th century Oudh was
                    added to the kingdom of Kanauj by conquest. After its downfall Shahab-ud-din
                    Ghori, or his lieutenant, overran Oudh in 1194. Mohammed Bakhtiyâr Khilji was
                    the first Mohammedan to organize the administration, and establish in Oudh a
                    base for his military operations, which extended to the banks of the
                    Brahmaputra. On the death of Kutb-ud-din he refused allegiance to Altamsh as a
                    slave, and his son Ghiyâs-ud-din established an hereditary governorship of
                    Bengal. Oudh, however, was wrested from the Bengal dynasty, and remained an
                    outlying province of Delhi. Although nominally ruled in the name of the Delhi
                    empire by great Mohammedan vassals from Bahraich or Mânikpur, Oudh continued to
                    be a congeries of Rajput principalities and baronies, which made war, collected
                    revenues, and administered justice within their territories at their own
                    pleasure. During the early days of Mohammedan supremacy the Hindu chiefs of
                    southern Oudh were engaged in a desultory warfare with the receding Bhars, an
                    aboriginal tribe who had obtained a temporary ascendency after the first Moslem
                    invasions. Upon their subjection the Mohammedan kingdom of Jaunpur arose in the
                    valley of the Ganges. Ibrahim Shah Sharki, the ablest of the Jaunpur rulers,
                    turned his attention to the fruitful province -which lay in the direct path
                    between his capital and Delhi. He attempted thoroughly to reduce Oudh to the
                    condition of a Moslem country, and, as long as he lived, the people sullenly
                    acquiesced. But on his death the national spirit successfully reasserted itself
                    under the leadership of Raja Tilok Chand, probably a descendant of the Kanauj
                    sovereigns; and for a hundred years the land had peace.</p>
                <p>During the troubled times which followed the death of Babar, the first Mughal
                    emperor of Delhi, Oudh became a focus of disaffection against the reigning
                    house. After the final defeat of the Afghan dynasty at Panipat, and the firm
                    establishment of Akbar’s rule, the province settled down into one of the most
                    important among the imperial viceroyalties. Under the Mughal dynasty in its
                    flourishing days, the Hindu chieftains accepted their position without
                    difficulty. But when the rise of the Mahrattâ power broke down the decaying
                    empire of Aurangzeb, the chieftains of Oudh again acquired an almost complete
                    independence. About 1732 Saâdat Ali Khan, a Persian merchant, received the
                    appointment of governor of Oudh, and founded the Mohammedan dynasty which ruled
                    over Oudh down to our own days. Before his death, in 1743, Oudh had become
                    practically an independent kingdom, the rulers retaining the title of nawâb
                    wazir, or chief minister of the empire. Saâdat Khan was succeeded by his
                    brother-in-law, Safdar Jang, under whose wise rule the country enjoyed internal
                    prosperity, although exposed to constant attacks from the Rohillâs on one side
                    and the Mahrattas on the other. The next nawâb, Shujâ-ud-daulâ, who succeeded
                    his father Safdar Jang in 1753, attempted to take advantage of the war in Bengal
                    between the British and Mir Kasim to acquire for himself the rich province of
                    Behar. He therefore advanced upon Patna, taking with him the fugitive emperor
                    Shah Alam and the exiled nawâb of Bengal. The enterprise proved a failure, and
                    Shuja-ud-daula retired to Baxar, where, in October 1764, Major Munro won a
                    decisive victory, which laid the whole of upper India at the feet of the
                    Company. The nawâb fled to Bareli (Bareilly), while the unfortunate emperor
                    joined the British camp.</p>
                <p>By the treaty of 1765 Korah and Allahabad, which had hitherto formed part of the
                    Oudh viceroyalty, were made over to the emperor for the support of his dignity
                    and expenses, all the remaining territories being restored to Shujâ-ud-daulâ,
                    who had thrown himself upon the generosity of the British. A few years later, in
                    1771, the titular Mughal emperor, Shâh Alam, was a virtual prisoner in the hands
                    of the Mahrattâs, who extorted from him the cession of Korah and Allahâbâd. This
                    was considered to be contrary to the terms of the treaty of 1765, and, as the
                    emperor had abandoned possession of them, the British sold them to the Oudh
                    nawâb. Saâdat Ali Khan, threatened by Sindhia on the advance of Zamân Shâh to
                    the Indus, concluded a new treaty with the British in 1801, by which he gave up
                    half his territories in return for increased means of protection. Rohilkhand
                    thus passed under British rule, and the nawâb became still more absolute within
                    his restricted dominions. Saâdat’s son, Ghâzi-ud-din Haidar (1814), was the
                    first to obtain the title of king. In 1847 Wajid Ali Shâh, the last king,
                    ascended the throne. The condition of the province had long attracted the
                    attention of the British Government. The king’s army, receiving insufficient
                    pay, recouped itself by constant depredations upon the people. The Hindu chiefs,
                    each isolated in his petty fort, had turned the surrounding country into a
                    jungle as a means of resisting the demands of the court and its soldiery. Before
                    1855 the chronic anarchy and oppression had reduced the people of Oudh to
                    extreme misery.</p>
                <p>A treaty was proposed to the king in 1856, which provided that the sole civil and
                    military government of Oudh should be vested in the British Government for ever,
                    and that the title of king of Oudh should be continued to him and his heirs
                    male, with certain privileges and allowances. He refused to sign the treaty, and
                    on the 18th February 1856 the British Government assumed the administration of
                    the province, Oudh thus becoming an integral part of the British empire. A
                    provision of 12 lâkhs a year was made to the king, who resides in a palace at
                    Garden Reach, a few miles south of Calcutta. Wajid Ali Shâh has been allowed to
                    retain the title of king of Oudh, but on his death the title will cease
                    absolutely, and the allowance will not be continued on its present scale.</p>
                <p>Immediately after annexation in 1856, Oudh was constituted into a
                    chief-commissionership, and organized on the ordinary British model. In March
                    1857 Sir Henry Lawrence assumed the administration at Lucknow; and on the 30th
                    of May five of the native regiments broke into mutiny. The remainder of the
                    events connected with the siege and recovery of the capital have been narrated
                    in the article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Lucknow.</hi> Since 1858 the province has
                    been administered without further vicissitudes. On the 17th of January 1877 Oudh
                    was partially amalgamated with the NorthWestern Provinces by the unification of
                    the two offices of chiefcommissioner and lieutenant-governor.</p>
