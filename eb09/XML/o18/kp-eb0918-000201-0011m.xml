                    commonly Englished a discourse. The earliest known use of the word Ornithology
                    seems to be in the third edition of Blount’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glossographia</hi> (1670), where it is noted as being ‘ ‘ the title of a late
                    Book.” See Prof. Skcat ’ s <hi rend="italic">Etymological Dictionary of the
                    English Language.</hi></p></note> in its proper sense is the methodical study
                    and consequent knowledge of Birds with all that relates to them; but the
                    difficulty of assigning a limit to the commencement of such study and knowledge
                    gives the word a very vague meaning, and practically procures its application to
                    much that does not enter the domain of Science. This elastic application renders
                    it impossible in the following sketch of the history of Ornithology to draw any
                    sharp distinction between works that are emphatically ornithological and those
                    to which that title can only be attached by courtesy; for, since Birds have
                    always attracted far greater attention than any other group of animals with
                    which in number or in importance they can be compared, there has grown up
                    concerning them a literature of corresponding magnitude and of the widest range,
                    extending from the recondite and laborious investigations of the morphologist
                    and anatomist to the casual observations of the sportsman or the schoolboy. The
                    chief cause of the disproportionate amount of attention which Birds have
                    received plainly arises from the way in which so many of them familiarly present
                    themselves to us, or even (it may be said) force themselves upqn our notice.
                    Trusting to the freedom from danger conferred by the power of flight, most Birds
                    have no need to lurk hidden in dens, or to slink from place to place under
                    shelter of the inequalities of the ground or of the vegetation which clothes it,
                    as is the case with so many other animals of similar size. Besides this, a great
                    number of the Birds which thus display themselves freely to our gaze are
                    conspicuous for the beauty of their plumage; and there are very few that are not
                    remarkable for the grace of their form. Some Birds again enchant us with their
                    voice, and others administer to our luxuries and wants, while there is scarcely
                    a species which has not idiosyncrasies that are found to be of engaging interest
                    the more we know of them. Moreover, it is clear that the art of the fowler is
                    one that must have been practised from the very earliest times, and to follow
                    that art with success no inconsiderable amount of acquaintance with the haunts
                    and habits of Birds is a necessity. Owing to one or another of these causes, or
                    to the combination of more than-one, it is not surprising that the observation
                    of Birds has been from a very remote period a favourite pursuit among nearly all
                    nations, and this observation has by degrees led to a study more or less framed
                    on methodical principles, finally reaching the dignity of a science, and a study
                    that has its votaries in almost all classes of the population of every civilized
                    country. In the ages during which intelligence dawned on the world’s total
                    ignorance, and even now in those districts that have not yet emerged from the
                    twilight of a knowledge still more imperfect than is .our own at present,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of the imperfection of our
                    present knowledge more must be said presently.</p></note> an additional and
                    perhaps a stronger reason for paying attention to the ways of Birds existed, or
                    exists, in their association with the cherished beliefs handed down from
                    generation to generation among many races of men, and not unfrequently
                    interwoven in their mythology.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    numerous to be here named.</p></note></p>
                <p>Moreover, though Birds make a not unimportant appearance in the earliest written
                    records of the human race, the painter’s brush has preserved their counterfeit
                    presentment for a still longer period. What is asserted—and that, so far as the
                    writer is aware, without contradiction—by Egyptologists of the highest repute to
                    be the oldest picture in the world is a fragmentary fresco taken from a tomb at
                    Maydoom, and happily deposited, though in a decaying condition, in the Museum at
                    Boolak. This picture is said to date from the time of the third or fourth
                    dynasty, some three thousand years before the Christian era. In it are depicted
                    with a marvellous fidelity, and thorough appreciation of form and colouring
                    (despite a certain conventional treatment), the figures of six Geese. Four of
                    these figures can be unhesitatingly referred to two species <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anser</hi><hi rend="italic">albifrons</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A.
                    ruficollis)</hi> well known at the present day; and if the two remaining
                    figures, belonging to a third species, were re-examined by an expert they would
                    very possibly be capable of determination with no less certainty.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The portion of the picture
                    containing the figures of the Geese has been figured by Mr <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    writer owes to that gentleman’s kindness the opportunity of examining a copy
                    made on the spot by an accomplished artist, as well as the information that it
                    is No. 988 of Mariette’s <hi rend="italic">Catalogue.</hi> See art. <hi

                    later ages the representations of Birds of one sort or another in Egyptian
                    paintings and sculptures become countless, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bassi-rilievi</hi> of Assyrian monuments, though mostly belonging of course to
                    a subsequent period, are not without them. No figures of Birds, however, seem
                    yet to have been found on the incised stones, bones, or ivories of the
                    prehistoric races of Europe.</p>
                <p>It is of course necessary to name <hi rend="smallcaps">Aristotle</hi> (born <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 385, died <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 322) as the
                    first serious author on Ornithology with whose writings we are acquainted, but
                    even he had, <pb break="no"

                    that portion of his works on animals which has come down to us, one finds that,
                    though more than 170 sorts of Birds are mentioned,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is Sunde vall’s estimate; Drs Aubert and
                    Wimmer in their excellent edition of the <hi rend="italic">'lστoρlaι πepl
                    ζιpωv</hi> (Leipzig: 1868) limit the number to 126.</p></note> yet what is said
                    of them amounts on the whole to very little, and this consists more of desultory
                    observations in illustration of his general remarks (which are to a considerable
                    extent physiological or bearing on the subject of reproduction) than of an
                    attempt at a connected account of Birds. Some of these observations are so
                    meagre as to have given plenty of occupation to his many commentators, who with
                    varying success have for more than three hundred years been endeavouring to
                    determine what were the Birds of which he wrote; and the admittedly corrupt
                    state of the text adds to their difficulties. One of the most recent of these
                    commentators, the late Prof. Sundevall—equally proficient in classical as in
                    ornithological knowledge—was, in 1863, compelled to leave more than a score of
                    the Birds unrecognized. Yet it is not to be supposed that in what survives of
                    the great philosopher’s writings we have more than a fragment of the knowledge
                    possessed by him, though the hope of recovering his Ζωικά or his ’Ανατομικά, in
                    which he seems to have given fuller descriptions of the animals he knew, can be
                    hardly now entertained. A Latin translation by Gaza of Aristotle’s existing
                    zoological work was printed at Venice in 1503. Another version, by Scaliger, was
                    subsequently published. Two wretched English translations have appeared.</p>
                <p>Next in order of date, though at a long interval, comes <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gaius</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Plinius Secundus,</hi> commonly known as <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pliny</hi> the Elder, who died <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    79, author of a general and very discursive <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    Naturalis</hi> in thirty-seven books, of which Book X. is devoted to Birds. A
                    considerable portion of Pliny’s work may be traced to his great predecessor, of
                    whose information he freely and avowedly availed himself, while the additions
                    thereto made cannot be said to be, on the whole, improvements. Neither of these
                    authors attempted to classify the Birds known to them beyond a very rough and
                    for the most part obvious grouping. Aristotle seems to recognize eight principal
                    groups :—(1) <hi rend="italic">Gampsonyches,</hi> approximately equivalent to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Accipitres</hi> of Linnaeus; (2) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scolecophaga,</hi> containing most of what would now be called <hi
                    rend="italic">Oscines,</hi> excepting indeed the (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acanthophaga,</hi> composed of the Goldfinch, Siskin, and a few others; (4) <hi
                    rend="italic">Scnipophaga,</hi> the Woodpeckers; (5) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peristeroide,</hi> or Pigeons; (6) <hi rend="italic">Schizopoda,</hi> (7) <hi
                    rend="italic">Steganopoda,</hi> and (8) <hi rend="italic">Barea,</hi> nearly the
                    same respectively as the Linnaean <hi rend="italic">Grallae,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Anseres,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gallinae.</hi> Pliny, relying
                    wholly on characters taken from the feet, limits himself to three groups—without
                    assigning names to them—those which have “hooked talions, as Hawkes; or round
                    long clawes, as Hennes <hi rend="italic">; or</hi> else they be broad, flat, and
                    whole-footed, as Geese and all the sort in manner of water-foule ”—to use the
                    words of Philemon Holland, who, in 1601, published a quaint and, though
                    condensed, yet fairly faithful English translation of Pliny’s work.</p>
                <p>About a century later came <hi rend="smallcaps">Aelian,</hi> who died about <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 140, and compiled in Greek (though he was an Italian
                    by birth) a number of miscellaneous observations on the peculiarities of
                    animals. His work is a kind of commonplace book kept without scientific
                    discrimination. A considerable number of Birds are mentioned, and something said
                    of almost each of them; but that something is too often nonsense—according to
                    modern ideas—though occasionally a fact of interest may therein be found. It
                    contains numerous references to former or contemporary writers whose works have
                    perished, but there is nothing to shew that they were wiser than Aelian
                    himself.</p>
                <p>The twenty-six books <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Animalibus</hi>
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">Albertus Magnus (Groot),</hi> who died <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1282, were printed in 1478; but were apparently
                    already well known from manuscript copies. They are founded on the works of
                    Aristotle, many of whose statements are almost literally repeated, and often
                    without acknowledgment. Occasionally Avicenna, or some other less-known author,
                    is quoted; but it is hardly too much to say that the additional information is
                    almost worthless. The twenty-third of these books is <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Avibus,</hi> and therein a great number of Birds’
                    names make their earliest appearance, few of which are without interest from a
                    philologist’s if not an ornithologist’s point of view, but there is much
                    difficulty in recognizing the species to which many of them belong. In 1485 was
                    printed the first dated copy of the volume known as the <hi rend="italic">Ortus
                    Sanitatis,</hi> to the popularity of which many editions testify. Though said by

                    whose travels in the Levant was printed at Mentz in 1486—it is really a medical
                    treatise, and its zoological portion is mainly an abbreviation of the writings
                    of Albertus Magnus, with a few interpolations from Isidorus of Seville (who
                    flourished in the beginning of the seventh century, and was the author of many
                    works highly esteemed in the Middle Ages) and a work known as <hi

                    in which figures of Birds are introduced it merits notice, though most of the
                    illustrations, which are rude woodcuts, fail, even in the coloured copies, to
                    give any precise indication of the species intended to be represented. The
                    scientific degeneracy of this work is manifested as much by its title <hi

                    compilation from Aristotle and Pliny, with references to other classical writers
                    who have more or less incidentally mentioned Birds and other animals. The author

                    bear upon his subject; and, making due allowance for the times in which he
                    wrote, his judgment must in most respects be deemed excellent. In his work,
                    however, there is little that can be called systematic treatment. Like nearly
                    all his predecessors since Aelian, he adopted an alphabetical arrangement,<note

                    which would really deserve the epithet scientific.</p></note> though this was
                    not too pedantically preserved, and did not hinder him from placing together the
                    kinds of Birds which he supposed (and generally supposed rightly) to have the
                    most resemblance to that one whose name, being best known, was chosen for the
                    headpiece (as it were) of his particular theme, thus recognizing to some extent
                    the principle of classification.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For instance, under the title of “Accipiter” we have to
                    look, not only for the Sparrow-Hawk and Gos-Hawk, but for many other Birds of

                    modern ornithologists.</p></note> Belon, with perhaps less book-learning than
                    his contemporary, was evidently no mean scholar, and undoubtedly had more
                    practical knowledge of Birds—their internal as well as external structure. Hence
                    his work, written in French, contains a far greater amount of original matter;
                    and his personal observations made in many countries, from England to Egypt,
                    enabled him to avoid most of the puerilities which disfigure other works of his
                    own or of a preceding age. Besides this, Belon disposed the Birds known to him
                    according to a definite system, which (rude as we now know it to be) formed a
                    foundation on which several of his successors were content to build, and even to
                    this day traces of its influence may still be discerned in the arrangement
                    followed by writers who have faintly appreciated the principles on which modern
                    taxonomers rest the outline of their schemes. Both his work and that of Gesner
                    were illustrated with woodcuts, many of which display much spirit and regard to
                    accuracy.</p>
                <p>Belon, as has just been said, had a knowledge of the anatomy of Birds, and he
                    seems to have been the first to institute a direct comparison of their skeleton
                    with that of Man; but in this respect he only anticipated by a few years the
                    more precise researches of <hi rend="smallcaps">Volcher Coiter,</hi> a Frisian,
                    who in 1573 and 1575 published at Nuremberg two treatises, in one of which the
                    internal structure of Birds in general is very creditably described, while in
                    the other the osteology and myology of certain forms is given in considerable
                    detail, and illustrated by carefully-drawn figures. The first is entitled <hi

                    rend="italic">Tabulas,</hi> &amp;c., while the second, which is the most

                    medical, the author’s labours were wholly overlooked by the mere
                    natural-historians who followed, though Coiter introduced a table, “<hi

                    known to him, and this as nearly the first attempt of the kind deserves notice

                <p>Contemporary with these three men was <hi rend="smallcaps">Ulysses

                    after his death in 1605; but those on Birds appeared between 1599 and 1603. The
                    work is almost wholly a compilation, and that not of the most discriminative
                    kind, while a peculiar jealousy of Gesner is continuously displayed, though his
                    statements are very constantly quoted—nearly always as those of “Ornithologue,”
                    his name appearing but few times in the text, and not at all in the list of
                    authors cited. With certain modifications in principle not very important, but
                    characterized by much more elaborate detail, Aldrovandus adopted Belon’s method
                    of arrangement, but in a few respects there is a manifest retrogression. The
                    work of Aldrovandus was illustrated by copper-plates, but none of his figures
                    approach those of his immediate predecessors in character or accuracy.
                    Nevertheless the book was eagerly sought, and several editions of it

                    labours of his predecessors, as his list of over one hundred of them testifies.
                    Most of the Birds he describes are characterized with accuracy sufficient to
                    enable them to be identified, and his observations upon them have still some
                    interest; but he was innocent of any methodical system, and was not exempt from

                    (born 1628, died 1705), for it is impossible to separate their share of work in
                    Natural History more than to say that, while the former more especially devoted
                    himself to zoology, botany was the favourite pursuit of the latter. Together
                    they studied, together they travelled, and together they collected. Willughby,
                    the younger of the two, and at first the other’s pupil, seems to have gradually
                    become the master; but, he dying before the promise of his life was fulfilled,
                    his writings were given to the world by his friend Ray, who, adding to them from
                    his own stores, published the <hi rend="italic">Omithologia</hi> in Latin in
                    1676, and in English with many emendations in 1678. In this work Birds generally
                    were grouped in two great divisions—“Land-Fowl” and “Water-Fowl,”—the former
                    being subdivided into those which have a crooked beak and talons and those which
                    have a straighter bill and claws, while the latter was separated into those
                    which frequent waters and watery places and those that swim in the water—each
                    subdivision being further broken up into many sections, to the whole of which a
                    key was given. Thus it became possible for almost any diligent reader without

                <p>Two years after Ray’s death, <hi rend="smallcaps">Linnaeus,</hi> the great
                    reformer of Natural History, was born, and in 1735 appeared the first edition of

                    Successive editions of this work were produced under its author’s supervision in
                    1740, 1748, 1758, and 1766. Impressed by the belief that verbosity was the bane
                    of science, he carried terseness to an extreme which frequently created
                    obscurity, and this in no branch of zoology more than in that which relates to
                    Birds. Still-the practice introduced by him of assigning to each species a
                    diagnosis by which it ought in theory to be distinguishable from any other known
                    species, and of naming it by two words—the first being the generic and the
                    second the specific term, was so manifest an improvement upon any thing which
                    had previously obtained that the Linnaean method of differentiation and
                    nomenclature established itself before long in spite of all opposition, and in
                    principle became almost universally adopted. The opposition came of course from
                    those who were habituated to the older state of things, and saw no evil in the
                    cumbrous, half-descriptive half-designative titles which had to be employed
                    whenever a species was to be spoken of or written about. The supporters of the
                    new method were the rising generation of naturalists, many of whose names have
                    since become famous, but among them were some whose admiration of their chief
                    carried them to a pitch of enthusiasm which now seems absurd. Careful as
                    Linnaeus was in drawing up his definitions of groups, it was immediately seen
                    that they occasionally were made to comprehend creatures whose characteristics
                    contradicted the prescribed diagnosis. His chief glory lies in his having
                    reduced, at least for a time, a chaos into order, and in his shewing both by
                    precept and practice that a name was not a definition. In his classification of
                    Birds he for the most part followed Ray, and where he departed from his model he
                    seldom improved upon it.</p>

                    for as a descriptive ornithologist the author stands even now unsurpassed; but
                    it must be said that his knowledge, according to internal evidence, was confined
                    to books and to the external parts of Birds’ skins. It was enough for him to
                    give a scrupulously exact description of such specimens as came under his eye,
                    distinguishing these by prefixing two asterisks to their name, using a single
                    asterisk where he had only seen a part of the Bird, and leaving unmarked those
                    that he described from other authors. He also added information as to the Museum
                    (generally Réaumur’s, of which he had been in charge) containing the specimen he
                    described, acting on a principle which would have been advantageously adopted by
                    many of his contemporaries and successors. His attempt at classification was
                    certainly better than that of Linnaeus; and it is rather curious that the
                    researches of the latest ornithologists point to results in some degree
                    comparable with Brisson’s systematic arrangement, for they refuse to keep the
                    Birds-of-Prey at the head of the Class <hi rend="italic">Aves,</hi> and they
                    require the establishment of a much larger number of “Orders” than for a long
                    while has been thought advisable. Of such “Orders” Brisson had twenty-six, and
                    he gave Pigeons and Poultry precedence of the Birds which are plunderers and
                    scavengers. But greater value lies in his generic or sub-generic divisions,
                    which, taken as a whole, are far more natural than those of Linnaeus, and
                    consequently capable of better diagnosis. More than this, he seems to be the
                    earliest ornithologist, perhaps the earliest zoologist, to conceive the idea of
                    each genus possessing what is now called a “type ”—though such a term does not
                    occur in his work; and, in like manner, without declaring it in so many words,
                    he indicated unmistakably the existence of subgenera— all this being effected by
                    the skilful use of names. Unfortunately he was too soon in the field to avail
                    himself, even had he been so minded, of the convenient mode of nomenclature
                    brought into use by Linnaeus. Immediately on the completion of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Règne Animale</hi> in 1756, Brisson set about his <hi
                    rend="italic">Ornithologie,</hi> and it is only in the last two volumes of the
                    latter that any reference is made to the tenth edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae,</hi> in which the binomial method <pb

                    volumes were written if not printed before that method was promulgated, and when
                    the fame of Linnaeus as a zoologist rested on little more than the very meagre
                    sixth edition of the <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Natures</hi> and the first edition of his <hi rend="italic">Fauna Suecica.</hi>
                    Brisson has been charged with jealousy of if not hostility to the great Swede,
                    and it is true that in the preface to his <hi rend="italic">Ornithologie</hi> he
                    complains of the insufficiency of the Linnaean characters, but, when one
                    considers how much better acquainted with Birds the Frenchman was, such
                    criticism must be allowed to be pardonable if not wholly just. Brisson’s work
                    was in French, with a parallel translation in Latin, which last was reprinted
                    separately at Leyden two years afterwards.</p>
                <p>In 1767 there was issued at Paris a book entitled <hi rend="italic">L</hi><hi

                    are utterly devoid of artistic merit, they display the species they are intended
                    to depict with sufficient approach to fidelity to ensure recognition in most
                    cases without fear of error, which in the absence of any text is no small

                    in the work, which, though sometimes attributed to him, is that of certain

                    volume of that grand undertaking relating to Birds, which, for the first time
                    since the days of Aristotle, became the theme of one who possessed real literary
                    capacity. It is not too much to say that Buffon’s florid fancy revelled in such
                    a subject as was now that on which he exercised his brilliant pen; but it would
                    be unjust to examine too closely what to many of his contemporaries seemed sound
                    philosophical reasoning under the light that has since burst upon us. Strictly
                    orthodox though he professed to be, there were those, both among his own
                    countrymen and foreigners, who could not read his speculative indictments of the
                    workings of Nature without a shudder; and it is easy for any one in these days
                    to frame a reply, pointed with ridicule, to such a chapter as he wrote on the
                    wretched fate of the Woodpecker. In the nine volumes devoted to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux</hi> there are passages which will
                    for ever live in the memory of those that carefully read them, however much
                    occasional expressions, or even the general tone of the author, may grate upon
                    their feelings. He too was the first man who formed any theory that may be
                    called reasonable of the Geographical Distribution of Animals, though this
                    theory was scarcely touched in the ornithological portion of his work, and has
                    since proved to be not in accordance with facts. He proclaimed the variability
                    of species in opposition to the views of Linnaeus as to their fixity, and
                    moreover supposed that this variability arose in part by degradation.<note

                    be a doubt that he enormously enlarged the purview of naturalists, and, even if
                    limited to Birds, that, on the completion of his work upon them in 1783,
                    Ornithology stood in a very different position from that which it had before
                    occupied. Because he opposed the system of Linnaeus he has been said to be
                    opposed to systems in general; but that is scarcely correct, for he had a system
                    of his own; and, as we now see it, it appears neither much better nor much worse
                    than the systems which had been hitherto invented, or perhaps than any which was
                    for many years to come propounded. It is certain that he despised any kind of
                    scientific phraseology —a crime in the eyes of those who consider precise
                    nomenclature to be the end of science; but those who deem it merely a means
                    whereby knowledge can be securely stored will take a different view—and have
                    done so.</p>
                <p>Great as were the services of Buffon to Ornithology in one direction, those of a
                    wholly different kind rendered by our countryman <hi rend="smallcaps">John
                    Latham</hi> must not be overlooked. In 1781 he began a work the practical
                    utility of which was immediately recognized. This was his <hi rend="italic"
                    >General Synopsis of Birds,</hi> and, though formed generally on the model of
                    Linnaeus, greatly diverged in some respects therefrom. The classification was
                    modified, chiefly on the old lines of Willughby and Ray, and certainly for the
                    better; but no scientific nomenclature was adopted, which, as the author
                    subsequently found, was a change for the worse. His scope was co-extensive with
                    that of Brisson, but Latham did not possess the inborn faculty of picking out
                    the character wherein one species differs from another. His opportunities of
                    becoming acquainted with Birds were hardly inferior to Brisson’s, for during
                    Latham’s long lifetime there poured in upon him countless new discoveries from
                    all parts of the world, but especially from the newly-explored shores of
                    Australia and the islands of the Pacific Ocean. The British Museum had been
                    formed, and he had access to everything it contained in addition to the abundant
                    materials afforded him by the private Museum of Sir Ashton Lever.<note

                    remain of it found its way to Vienna. Of the specimens in the British Museum
                    described by Latham it is to be feared that scarcely any exist. They were

                    number of cases in which he erred as to the determination of his species must be
                    very great, and not unfrequently the same species is described more than once.

                <p>The practice of Brisson, Buffon, Latham, and others of neglecting to name after
                    the Linnaean fashion the species they described gave great encouragement to
                    compilation, and led to what has proved to be of some inconvenience to modern
                    ornithologists. In 1773 P. L. S. <hi rend="smallcaps">Müller</hi> brought out at

                    >Gmelin,</hi> who in 1788 commenced what he called the Thirteenth Edition of the
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae,</hi> which
                    obtained so wide a circulation that, in the comparative rarity of the original,
                    the additions of this editor have been very frequently quoted, even by expert
                    naturalists, as though they were the work of the author himself. Gmelin availed
                    himself of every publication he could, but he perhaps found his richest booty in
                    the labours of Latham, neatly condensing his English descriptions into Latin
                    diagnoses, and bestowing on them binomial names. Hence it is that Gmelin appears
                    as the authority for so much of the nomenclature now in use. He tock many
                    liberties with the details of Linnaeus’s work, but left the classification, at
                    least of the Birds, as it was—a few new genera excepted.<note anchored="true"

                    of Linnaeus, at that time predominant, it is now easy to see in how many
                    ways—want of sufficient material being no doubt one of the chief—Cuvier failed
                    to produce a really natural arrangement. His principles, however, are those
                    which must still guide taxonomers, notwithstanding that they have in so great a
                    degree overthrown the entire scheme which he propounded. Confining our attention
                    here, as of course it ought to be confined, to Ornithology, Cuvier’s arrangement
                    of the Class <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> is now seen to be not very much better
                    than any which it superseded. But this view is gained by following the methods
                    which Cuvier taught. In the work just mentioned few details are given; but even
                    the more elaborate classification of Birds contained in his <hi rend="italic"

                    >Règne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal</hi> of 1817, when he was in his fullest
                    vigour, afforded not the least evidence that he had ever dissected a couple even
                    of Birds<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So little
                    regard did he pay to the Osteology of Birds that, according to De Blainville <hi

                    Fowl to which was attached the head of a Hornbill was for a long time, exhibited
                    in the Museum of Comparative Anatomy at Paris! ’ Yet, in order to determine the
                    difference of structure in their organs of voice, Cuvier, as he says in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Leçons</hi> (iv. p. 464), dissected more than one hundred and
                    fifty species of Birds. Unfortunately for him, as will appear in the sequel, it
                    seems not to have occurred to him to use any of the results he obtained as the
                    basis of a classification.</p></note> with the object of determining their
                    relative position in his system, which then, as before, depended wholly on the
                    configuration of bills, wings, and feet. But, though apparently without such a
                    knowledge of the anatomy of Birds as would enable him to apply it to the
                    formation of that natural system which he was fully aware had yet to be sought,
                    he seems to have been an excellent judge of the characters afforded by the bill
                    and limbs, and the use he made of them, coupled with the extraordinary
                    reputation he acquired on other grounds, procured for his system the adhesion
                    for many years of the majority of ornithologists, and its influence though
                    waning is still strong. Regret must always be felt by them that his great genius
                    was never applied in earnest to their branch of study, especially when we
                    consider that had it been so the perversion of energy in regard to the
                    classification. of Birds witnessed in England for nearly twenty years, and
                    presently to be mentioned, would most likely have been prevented.<note

                    the highest interest to students of Palaearctic or Nearctic Ornithology. Nearly
                    the whole of their results, it may here be said, were summed up in the important
                    <hi rend="italic">Zoographia Rosso-</hi><hi rend="italic">Asiatica</hi> of the
                    first-named naturalist, which saw the light in 1811,— the year of its author’s
                    death,—but, owing to circumstances over which he had no control, was not
                    generally accessible till twenty years later. Of still wider interest are the
                    accounts of Cook’s three famous voyages, though unhappily much of the
                    information gained by the naturalistswho accompanied him on one or more of them
                    seems to be irretrievably lost: the original observations of the elder <hi

                    collection of zoological drawings made by the younger <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    ought not to be overlooked by any Australian ornithologist. The only information
                    at this period on the Ornithology of South America is contained in the two works
                    on Chili by <hi rend="smallcaps">Molina,</hi> published at Bologna in

                    properly of this work, for several of the species described in it are certainly
                    not, and never were in his time, inhabitants of that country, though he
                    sometimes gives a long account of the circumstances under which he observed

                    nearest approach to his lost specimens that he could obtain. This explanation,
                    poor as it is, fails, however, in regard to some species.</p></note></p>
                <p>From travellers who employ themselves in collecting the animals of any distant

                    Both may well be named “Faunists,” and of the latter there were not a few who
                    having turned their attention more or less to Ornithology should here be
                    mentioned, and first among them <hi rend="smallcaps">Rzaczynski,</hi> who in

                    not occupy the whole attention of German ornithologists, for in 1791 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bechstein</hi> reached the second volume of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Gemeinnützige Naturgeschichte Deutschlands,</hi> treating of the
                    Birds of that country, which ended with the fourth in 1795. Of this an abridged
                    edition by the name of <hi rend="italic">Ornithologisches Taschenbuch</hi>
                    appeared in 1802 and 1803, with a supplement in 1812; while between 1805 and
                    1809 a fuller edition of the original was issued. Moreover in 1795 J. A. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Naumann</hi> humbly began at Cothen a treatise on the Birds of
                    the principality of Anhalt, which on its completion in 1804 was found to have
                    swollen into an Ornithology of Northern Germany and the neighbouring countries.
                    Eight supplements were successively published between 1805 and 1817, and in 1822
                    a new edition was required. This <hi rend="italic">Naturgeschichte der Vögel
                    Deutschlands,</hi> being almost wholly rewritten by his son J. F. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Naumann,</hi> is by far the best thing of the kind as yet
                    produced in any country. The fulness and accuracy of the text, combined with the
                    neat beauty of its coloured plates, have gone far to promote the study of
                    Ornithology in Germany, and while essentially a popular work, since it is suited
                    to the comprehension of all readers, it is throughout written with a simple
                    dignity that commends it to the serious and scientific. Its twelfth and last
                    volume was published in 1844—by no means too long a period for so arduous and
                    honest a performance, and a supplement was begun in 1847; but, the editor—or
                    author as he may be fairly called—dying in 1857, this continuation was finished
                    in 1860 by the joint efforts of J. H. <hi rend="smallcaps">Blasius</hi> and Dr
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Baldamus.</hi> In 1800 <hi rend="smallcaps">Borkhausen</hi>

                <p>Other countries on the Continent, though not quite so prolific as Germany, bore
                    some ornithological fruit at this period; but in all Southern Europe only four

                    part devoted to Pigeons and Poultry. More appeared in the North, for in 1770

                    Scandinavia most of all was done. In 1746 the great <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Linnaeus</hi> had produced a <hi rend="italic">Fauna Svecica,</hi> of which a

                    intended to be limited to North America, but circumstances induced him to
                    include all the species of Northern Europe and Northern Asia, and though not
                    free from errors it is a praiseworthy performance. A second edition appeared in
                    1792. The Ornithology of Britain naturally demands greater attention. The

                    well-illustrated folio, of which a second edition in octavo was published in 17
                    68, and considerable additions (forming the nominally third edition) in 1770,
                    while in 1777 there were two issues, one in octavo the other in quarto, each
                    called the fourth edition. In 1812, long after the author’s death, another
                    edition was printed, of which his son-in-law Hanmer was the reputed editor, but
                    he received much assistance from Latham, and through carelessness many of the
                    additions herein made have often been ascribed to Pennant. In 1769 <hi

                <p>All the foregoing publications yield in importance to two that remain to be
                    mentioned, a notice of which will fitly conclude this part of our subject. In
                    1767 Pennant, several of whose works have already been named, entered into
                    correspondence with <hi rend="smallcaps">Gilbert White,</hi> receiving from him
                    much information, almost wholly drawn from his own observation, for the
                    succeeding editions of the <hi rend="italic">British Zoology.</hi> In 1769 White
                    began exchanging letters of a similar character with Barrington. The epistolary
                    intercourse with the former continued until 1780 and with the latter until 1787.
                    In 1789 White’s share of the correspondence, together with some miscellaneous

                    principal though by no means the whole theme of this book, which may be safely
                    said to have done more to promote a love of Ornithology in this country than any
                    other work that has been written, nay more than all the other works (except one
                    next to be mentioned) put together. It has passed through a far greater number
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n19/mode/1up"

                    in the whole world, and has become emphatically an English classic—the graceful
                    simplicity of its style, the elevating tone of its spirit, and the sympathetic
                    chords it strikes recommending it to every lover of Nature, while the severely
                    scientific reader can scarcely find an error in any statement it contains,
                    whether of matter of fact or opinion. It is almost certain that more than half
                    the zoologists of the British Islands for the past seventy years or more have
                    been infected with their love of the study by Gilbert White; and it can hardly
                    be supposed that his influence will cease.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    published in 1837, which was reissued in 1875 by Mr Harting, was long deemed the
                    best; but it must give place to that of Bell, which appeared in 1877, and
                    contains much additional information of great interest. But the editions of
                    Markwick, Herbert, Blyth, and Jardine all possess features of merit. An
                    elaborately prepared edition, issued of late years under the managementof one

                    vulgarity.</p></note></p>
                <p>The other work to the importance of which on Ornithology in this country allusion
                    has been made is <hi rend="smallcaps">Bewick’s</hi><hi rend="italic">History of
                    British Birds.</hi> The first volume of this, containing the Land-Birds,
                    appeared in 1797<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There
                    were two issues—virtually two editions—of this with the same date on the
                    title-page, though one of them is said not to have been published till the
                    following year. Among several other <hi rend="italic">indicia</hi> this may be
                    recognized by the woodcut of the “Sea Eagle” at page 11 bearing at its base the
                    inscription “Wycliffe, 1791,” and by the additional misprint on page 145 of <hi

                    Water-Birds, in 1804. The woodcuts illustrating this work are generally of
                    surpassing excellence, and it takes rank in the category of artistic
                    publications. Fully admitting the extraordinary execution of the engravings,
                    every ornithologist may perceive that as portraits of the Birds they are of very
                    unequal merit. Some of the figures were drawn from stuffed specimens, and
                    accordingly perpetuate all the imperfections of the original; others represent
                    species with the appearance of which the artist was not familiar, and these are
                    either wanting in expression or are caricatures;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is especially observable in the figures
                    of the Birds-of-Prey.</p></note> but those that were drawn from live Birds, or
                    represent species which he knew in life, are worthy of all praise. It is well
                    known that the earlier editions of this work, especially if they be upon large
                    paper, command extravagant prices; but in reality the copies on smaller paper
                    are now the rarer, for the stock of them has been consumed in nurseries and
                    schoolrooms, where they have been torn up or worn out with incessant use.
                    Moreover, whatever the lovers of the fine arts may say, it is nearly certain
                    that the “Bewick Collector” is mistaken in attaching so high a value to these
                    old editions, for owing to the want of skill in printing—indifferent ink being
                    especially assigned as one cause—many of the earlier issues fail to shew the
                    most delicate touches ,of the engraver, which the increased care bestowed upon
                    the edition of 1847 (published under the supervision of Mr John Hancock) has
                    revealed,— though it must be admitted that certain blocks have suffered from
                    wear of the press so as to be incapable of any more producing the effect
                    intended. Of the text it may be said that it is respectable, but no more. It has
                    given satisfaction to thousands of readers in time past, and will, it may be
                    hoped, give satisfaction to thousands in time to come.</p>
                <p>The existence of these two works explains the widely-spread taste for Ornithology
                    in this country, which is to foreigners so puzzling, and the zeal—not always
                    according to knowledge, but occasionally reaching to serious study— with which
                    that taste is pursued.</p>
                <p>Having thus noticed, and it is to be hoped pretty thoroughly, the chief
                    ornithological works begun if not completed prior to the commencement of the
                    present cen tury, together with their immediate sequels, those which follow will
                    require a very different mode of treatment, for their number is so great that it
                    would be impossible for want of space to deal with them in the same extended
                    fashion, though the attempt will finally be made to enter into details in the
                    case of works constituting the foundation upon which apparently the
                    superstructure of the future science has to be built. It ought not to need
                    stating that much of what was, comparatively speaking, only a few years ago
                    regarded as scientific labour is now no longer to be so considered. The mere
                    fact that the principle of Evolution, and all its admission carries with it, has
                    been accepted in some form or other by almost all naturalists, has rendered
                    obsolete nearly every theory that had hitherto been broached, and in scarcely
                    any branch of zoological research was theory more rife than in Ornithology. One
                    of these theories must presently be noticed at some length on account of the
                    historical importance which attaches to its malefic effects in impeding the
                    progress of true Ornithology in Britain; but charity enjoins us to consign all
                    the rest as much as possible to oblivion.</p>
                <p>On reviewing the progress of Ornithology since the end of the last century, the
                    first thing that will strike us is the fact that general works, though still
                    undertaken, have become proportionally fewer, and such as exist are apt to
                    consist of mere explanations of systematic methods that had already been more or
                    less fully propounded, while special works, whether relating to the ornithic
                    portion of the Fauna of any particular country, or limited to certain groups of
                    Birds—works to which of late years the name of “Monograph” has become wholly
                    restricted—have become far more numerous. But this seems to be the natural law
                    in all sciences, and its cause is not far to seek. As the knowledge of any
                    branch of study extends, it outgrows the opportunities and capabilities of most
                    men to follow it as a whole; and, since the true naturalist, by reason of the
                    irresistible impulse which drives him to work, cannot be idle, he is compelled
                    to confine his energies to narrower fields of investigation. That in a general
                    way this is for some reason to be regretted is true; but, like all natural
                    operations, it carries with it some recompense, and the excellent work done by
                    so-called “specialists” has over and over again proved of the greatest use to
                    advancement in different departments of science, and in none more than in
                    Ornithology.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The truth
                    of the preceding remarks may be so obvious to most men who have acquaintance
                    with the subject that their introduction here may seem unnecessary; but it is
                    certain that the facts they state have been very little appreciated by many
                    writers who profess to give an account of the progress of Natural History during
                    the present century.</p></note></p>
                <p>Another change has come over the condition of Ornithology, as of kindred
                    sciences, induced by the multiplication of learned societies which issue
                    publications as well as of periodicals of greater or less scientific pretension
                    —the latter often enjoying a circulation far wider than the former. Both kinds
                    increase yearly, and the desponding mind may fear the possibility of its
                    favourite study expiring through being smothered by its own literature. Without
                    anticipating such a future disaster, and looking merely to what has gone before,
                    it is necessary here to premise that, in the observations which immediately
                    follow, treatises which have appeared in the publications of learned bodies or
                    in other scientific periodicals must, except they be of prime importance, be
                    hereinafter passed unnoticed; but their omission will be the less felt because
                    the more recent of those of a “faunal” character have generally been mentioned
                    in a former dissertation <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii. pp.
                    737-764) under the different Regions or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n20/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0020-0011"/> countries with which they deal, while reference
                    to the older of these treatises is usually given by the writers of the newer.
                    Still it seems advisable here to furnish some connected account of the progress
                    made in the ornithological knowledge of those countries in which the readers of
                    the present volume may be supposed to take the most lively interest —for
                    example, the British Islands and those parts of the European continent which lie
                    nearest to them or are most commonly sought by travellers, the Dominion of
                    Canada and the United States of America, South Africa, India, together with
                    Australia and New Zealand. The more important Monographs, again, will usually be
                    found cited in the series of special articles on Birds contained in this work,
                    though, as will be immediately perceived, there are some so-styled Monographs,
                    which by reason of the changed views of classification that at present obtain
                    have lost their restricted character, and for all practical purposes have now to
                    be regarded as general works.</p>
                <p>It will perhaps be most convenient to begin by mentioning some of these last, and
                    in particular a number of them which appeared at Paris very early in this
                    century. First in order of them is the <hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle

                    by <hi rend="smallcaps">Le Vaillant.</hi> This is devoted to the very distinct
                    and not nearly-allied groups of Hornbills and of birds which for want of a
                    better name we must call “Chatterers,” and is illustrated, like those works of
                    which a notice immediately follows, by coloured plates, done in what was then
                    considered to be the highest style of art and by the best draughtsmen
                    procurable. The first volume of a <hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle des
                    Perroquets,</hi> a companion work by the same author, appeared in the same year,
                    and is truly a Monograph, since the Parrots constitute a Family of birds so
                    naturally severed from all others that there has rarely been anything else
                    confounded with them. The second volume came out in 1805, and a third was issued
                    in 1837-38 long after the death of its predecessor’s author, by <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bourjot St-Hilaire.</hi> Between 1803 and 1806 Le Vaillant also
                    published in just the same style two volumes with the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire Naturelle, des Oiseaux de Paradis et des Rolliers, suivie de celle des
                    Toucans et des Barbus,</hi> an assemblage of forms, which, miscellaneous as it
                    is, was surpassed in incongruity by a fourth work on the same scale, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle des</hi><hi rend="italic">Promerops</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et des Guêpiers, des Couroucous et des Touracos,</hi> for herein
                    are found Jays, Waxwings, the Cock-of-the-Rock <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Rupicold),</hi> and what not besides. The plates in this last are by
                    Barraband, for many years regarded as the perfection of ornithological artists,
                    and indeed the figures, when they happen to have been drawn from the life, are
                    not bad; but his skill was quite unable to vivify the preserved specimens
                    contained in Museums, and when he had only these as subjects he simply copied
                    the distortions of the “bird-stuff er.” The following year, 1808, being aided by
                    Temminck of Amsterdam, of whose son we shall presently hear more, Le Vaillant
                    brought out the sixth volume of his <hi rend="italic">Oiseaux d’Afrique,</hi>
                    already mentioned. Four more volutnes of this work were promised; but the means
                    of executing them were denied to him, and, though he lived until 1824, his
                    publications ceased.</p>
                <p>A similar series of works was projected and begun about the same time as that of
                    Le Vaillant by <hi rend="smallcaps">Audebert</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Vieillot,</hi> though the former, who was by profession a painter and
                    illustrated the work, was already dead more than a year before the appearance of
                    the two volumes, bearing date 1802, and entitled <hi rend="italic">Oiseaux dorés
                    ou</hi><hi rend="italic">a reflets</hi><hi rend="italic">métalliques,</hi> the
                    effect of the plates in which he sought to heighten by the lavish use of
                    gilding. The first volume contains the “Colibris, Oiseaux-mouches, Jacamars et
                    Promerops,” the second the “Grimpereaux” and “Oiseaux de Paradis”—associations
                    which set all the laws of systematic method at defiance. His colleague,
                    Vieillot, brought out in 1805 a <hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des plus beaux</hi><hi rend="italic">Chanteurs de la Zone
                    Torride</hi> with figures by Langlois of tropical Finches, Grosbeaks, Buntings,
                    and other hard-billed birds; and in 1807 two volumes of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux de l’Amérique Septentrionale,</hi> without,
                    however, paying much attention to the limits commonly assigned by geographers to
                    that part of the world. In 1805 <hi rend="smallcaps">Anselme</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Desmarest</hi> published a <hi rend="italic">Histoire

                    the same category as all the former, differs from them in its more scientific
                    treatment of the subjects to which it refers; and, in 1808, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Temminck,</hi> whose father’s aid to Le Vaillant has already been noticed,

                <p>Since we have begun by considering these large illustrated works in which the
                    text is made subservient to the coloured plates, it may be convenient to
                    continue our notice of such others of similar character as it may be expedient
                    to mention here, though thereby we shall be led somewhat far afield. Most of
                    them are but luxuries, and there is some degree of truth in the remark of
                    Andreas Wagner in his <hi rend="italic">Report on the Progress of Zoology
                    for</hi> 1843, drawn up for the Ray Society (p. 60), that they “are not adapted
                    for the extension and promotion of science, but must inevitably, on account of
                    their unnecessary costliness, constantly tend to reduce the number of
                    naturalists who are able to avail themselves of them, and they thus enrich
                    ornithology only to its ultimate injury.” Earliest in date as it is greatest in

                    It does not seem to have been the author’s original intention to publish any

                    Audubon has been greatly extolled as an ornithological artist; but he was far
                    too much addicted to representing his subjects in violent action and in postures
                    that outrage nature, while his drawing is very frequently defective.<note

                    extreme fidelity to nature and the great artistic skill with which the figures
                    were executed.</p>
                <p>This same year (1832) saw the beginning of the marvellous series of illustrated

                    is likely to be always remembered. <hi rend="italic">A Century of Birds from the
                    Himalaya Mountains</hi> was followed by <hi rend="italic">The Birds of
                    Europe</hi> in five volumes, published between 1832 and 1837, while in the
                    interim (1834) appeared <hi rend="italic">A Monograph of the</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ramphastidae,</hi> of which a second edition was some years later

                    New South Wales, on his return in 1840 he at once commenced the greatest of all
                    his works, <hi rend="italic">The Birds of Australia,</hi> which was finished in
                    1848 in seven volumes, to which several supplementary parts, forming another

                    the last completed by Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Sharpe</hi> (1850-83); <hi
                    rend="italic">The Birds of Great Britain,</hi> in five volumes (1862-73); and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Birds of New Guinea,</hi> begun in 1875, and, after the
                    author’s death in 1881, undertaken by Mr Sharpe, make up the wonderful tale
                    consisting of more than forty folio volumes, and containing more than three
                    thousand coloured plates. The earlier of these works were illustrated by Mrs
                    Gould, and the figures in them are fairly good; but those in the later, except
                    when (as he occasionally did) he secured the services of Mr <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Wolf,</hi> are not so much to be commended. There is, it is true, a smoothness
                    and finish about them not often seen elsewhere; but, as though to avoid the
                    exaggerations qf Audubon, Gould usually adopted the tamest of attitudes in which
                    to represent his subjects, whereby expression as well as vivacity is wanting.
                    Moreover, both in drawing and in colouring there is frequently much that is
                    untrue to nature, so that it. has not uncommonly happened for them to fail in
                    the chief object of all zoological plates, that of affording sure means of
                    recognizing specimens on comparison. In estimating the letterpress, which was
                    avowedly held to be of secondary importance to the plates, we must bear in mind
                    that, to ensure the success of his works, it had to be written to suit a very
                    peculiarly composed body of subscribers. Nevertheless a scientific character was
                    so adroitly assumed that scientific men—some of them even ornithologists—have
                    thence been led to believe the text had a scientific value, and that of a high
                    mass. However it must also be remembered that, throughout the whole of his
                    career, Gould consulted the convenience of working ornithologists by almost
                    invariably refraining from including in his folio works the technical
                    description of any new species without first publishing it in some journal of
                    comparatively easy access.</p>
                <p>An ambitious attempt to produce in England a general series of coloured plates on
                    a large scale was Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Fraser’s</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoologia</hi><hi rend="italic">Typica,</hi> the first part of which bears date
                    1841 - 42. Others appeared at irregular intervals until 1849, when the work,
                    which seems never to have received the support it deserved, was discontinued.
                    The seventy plates (forty-six of which represent birds) composing, with some
                    explanatory letterpress, the volume are by C. Consens and H. N. Turner,—the
                    latter (as his publications prove) a zoologist of much promise who in 1851 died,
                    a victim to his own zeal for investigation, of a wound received in dissecting.
                    The chief object of the author, who had been naturalist to the Niger Expedition,
                    and curator to the Museum of the Zoological Society of London, was to figure the
                    animals contained in its gardens or described in its <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proceedings,</hi> which until the year 1848 were not illustrated.</p>
                <p>The publication of the <hi rend="italic">Zoological Sketches</hi> of Mr <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Wolf,</hi> from animals in the gardens of the Zoological
                    Society, was begun about 1855, with a brief text by <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mitchell,</hi> at that time the Society’s secretary, in illustration of them.
                    After his death in 1859, the explanatory letterpress was rewritten by Mr <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sclater,</hi> his successor in that office, and a volume was
                    completed in 1861. Upon this a second series was commenced, and brought to an
                    end in 1868. Though a comparatively small number of species of Birds are figured
                    in this magnificent work (seventeen only in the first series, and twenty-two in
                    the second), it must be mentioned here, for their likenesses are so admirably
                    executed as to place it in regard to ornithological portraiture at the head of
                    all others. There is not a single plate that is unworthy of the greatest of all
                    animal painters.</p>
                <p>Proceeding to illustrated works generally of less pretentious size but of greater
                    ornithological utility than the books last mentioned, which are fitter for the
                    drawing-room than the study, we next have to consider some in which the text is
                    not wholly subordinated to the plates, though the latter still form a
                    conspicuous feature of the publication. First of these in point of time as well
                    as in importance is the <hi rend="italic">Nouveau</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Recueil</hi><hi rend="italic">des Planches</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Coloriées</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">0iseaux</hi> of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Temminck</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Laugier,</hi> intended
                    as a sequel to the <hi rend="italic">Planches</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Enluminées</hi> of D’Aubenton before noticed (page 6), and like that work
                    issued both in folio and quarto size. The first portion of this was published at
                    Paris in 1820, and of its one hundred and two <hi rend="italic">livraisons,</hi>
                    which appeared with great irregularity <hi rend="italic">{Ibis,</hi> 1868, p.
                    500), the last was issued in 1839, containing the titles of the five volumes
                    that the whole forms, together with a “Tableau Méthodique” which but
                    indifferently serves the purpose of an index. There are six hundred plates, but
                    the exact number of species figured (which has been computed at six hundred and
                    sixty-one) is not so easily ascertained. Generally the subject of each plate has
                    letterpress to correspond, but in some cases this is wanting, while on the other
                    hand descriptions of species not figured are occasionally introduced, and
                    usually observations on the distribution and construction of each genus or group
                    are added. The plates, which shew no improvement in execution on those of
                    Martinet, are after drawings by Huet and Prêtre, the former being perhaps the
                    less bad draughtsman of the two, for he seems to have had an idea of what a bird
                    when alive looks like, though he was not able to give his figures any vitality,
                    while the latter simply delineated the stiff and dishevelled specimens from
                    museum shelves. Still the colouring is pretty well done, and experience has
                    proved that generally speaking there is not much difficulty in recognizing the
                    species represented. The letterpress is commonly limited to technical details,
                    and is not always accurate; but it is of its kind useful, for in general
                    knowledge of the outside of Birds Temminck probably surpassed any of his
                    contemporaries. The “Tableau Méthodique” offers a convenient concordance of the
                    old <hi rend="italic">Planches</hi><hi rend="italic">Enluminées</hi> and its
                    successor, and is arranged after the system set forth by Temminck in the first
                    volume of the second edition of his <hi rend="italic">Manuel d'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ornithologie,</hi> of which something must presently be said.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Galérie des Oiseaux,</hi> a rival work, with plates by <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Oudart,</hi> seems to have been begun immediately after the
                    former. The original project was apparently to give a figure and description of
                    every species of Bird; but that was soon found to be impossible; and, when six
                    parts had <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n22/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0022-0013"/> been issued, with text by some unnamed author,
                    the scheme was brought within practicable limits, and the writing of the
                    letterpress was entrusted to <hi rend="smallcaps">Vieillot,</hi> who, proceeding
                    on a systematic plan, performed his task very creditably, completing the work,
                    which forms two quarto volumes, in 1825, the original text and fifty-seven
                    plates being relegated to the end of the second volume as a supplement. His
                    portion is illustrated by two hundred and ninety-nine coloured plates that,
                    wretched as they are, have been continually reproduced in various text-books—a
                    fact possibly due to their subjects having been judiciously selected. It is a
                    tradition that, this work not being favourably regarded by the authorities of
                    the Paris Museum, its draughtsman and author were refused closer access to the
                    specimens required, and had to draw and describe them through the glass as they
                    stood on the shelves of the cases.</p>
                <p>In 1825 <hi rend="smallcaps">Jardine</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Selby</hi>
                    began a series of <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of Ornithology,</hi> the
                    several parts of which appeared at long and irregular intervals, so that it was
                    not until 1839 that three volumes containing one hundred and fifty plates were
                    completed. Then they set about a Second Series, which, forming a single volume
                    with fifty-three plates, was finished in 1843. These authors, being zealous
                    amateur artists, were their own draughtsmen to the extent even of lithographing
                    the figures. In 1828 <hi rend="smallcaps">James Wilson</hi> (author of the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Ornithology</hi> in the 7th and 8th editions of the
                    present work) began, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of
                    Zoology,</hi> the publication of a series of his own drawings (which he did not,
                    however, himself engrave) with corresponding letterpress. Of the thirty-six
                    plates illustrating this volume, a small folio, twenty are devoted to
                    Ornithology, and contain figures, which, it must be allowed, are not very
                    successful, of several species rare at the time.</p>
                <p>Though the three works last mentioned fairly come under the same category as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Planches</hi><hi rend="italic">Enluminées</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Planches</hi><hi rend="italic">Coloriées,</hi> no one of them can
                    be properly deemed their rightful heirs. The claim to that succession was made
                    in 1845 by <hi rend="smallcaps">Des Murs</hi> for his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iconographie Ornithologique,</hi> which, containing seventy-two plates by
                    Prévôt and Oudart<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the
                    title page credit is given to the latter alone, but only two-thirds of the
                    plates (from pl. 25 to the end) bear his name.</p></note> (the latter of whom
                    had marvellously improved in his drawings since he worked with Vieillot), was
                    completed in 1849. Simultaneously with this Du Bus began a work on a plan
                    precisely similar, the <hi rend="italic">Esquisses</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithologiques,</hi> illustrated by Severeyns, which, however, stopped short
                    in 1849 with its thirty-seventh plate, while the letterpress unfortunately does
                    not go beyond that belonging to the twentieth. In 1866 the succession was again
                    taken up by the <hi rend="italic">Exotic Ornithology</hi> of Messrs <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sclater</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Salvin,</hi> containing
                    one hundred plates, representing one hundred and four species, all from Central
                    or South America, which are neatly executed by Mr Smit. The accompanying
                    letterpress is in some places copious, and useful lists of the species of
                    various genera are occasionally subjoined, adding to the definite value of the

                <p>Lastly here must be mentioned <hi rend="smallcaps">Rowley’s</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithological Miscellany</hi> in three quarto volumes, profusely illustrated,
                    which appeared between 1875 and 1878. The contents are as varied as the
                    authorship, and, most of the leading English ornithologists having contributed
                    to the work, some of the papers are extremely good, while in the plates, which
                    are in Mr Keulemans’s best manner, many rare species of Birds are figured, some
                    of them for the first time.</p>
                <p>All the works lately named have been purposely treated at some length, since
                    being very costly they are not easily accessible. The few next to be mentioned,
                    being of smaller size (octavo), may be within reach of more persons, and
                    therefore can be passed over in a briefer fashion without detriment. In many
                    ways, however, they are nearly as important. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Swainson’s</hi><hi rend="italic">Zoological Illustrations</hi> in three
                    volumes, containing one hundred and eighty-two plates, whereof seventy represent
                    Birds, appeared between 1820 and 1821, and in 1829 a Second Series of the same
                    was begun by him, which, extending to another three volumes, contained
                    forty-eight more plates of Birds out of one hundred and thirty six, and was
                    completed in 1833. All the figures were drawn by the author, who as an
                    ornithological artist had no rival in his time. Every plate is not beyond
                    criticism, but his worst drawings shew more knowledge of bird-life than do the
                    best of his English or French contemporaries. A work of somewhat similar
                    character, but one in which the letterpress is of greater value, is the <hi

                    single volume that, though bearing the date 1830 on its title page, is believed

                    received the benefit of Isidore Geoffroy St-Hilaire’s assistance.
                    Notwithstanding its name it only contains eighty plates, but of them forty-two,
                    all by Prêtre and in his usual stiff style, represent Birds. Concurrently with
                    this volume appeared Lesson’s <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Ornithologie,</hi> which is dated 1831, and may
                    perhaps be here most conveniently mentioned. Its professedly systematic form
                    strictly relegates it to another group of works, but the presence of an “Atlas”
                    (also in octavo) of one hundred and nineteen plates to some extent justifies its
                    notice in this place. Between 1831 and 1834 the same author brought out, in
                    continuation of his <hi rend="italic">Centurie,</hi> his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Illustrations de</hi><hi rend="italic">Zoologie</hi> with sixty plates, twenty

                    about 1855, and are commonly known collectively as his <hi rend="italic"

                    1815. Why it was not at once accepted is not told, but the entry respecting it,
                    which must be of much later date, in the “Register of Papers” is “Published
                    already.” It is due to Vieillot to mention these facts, as he has been accused
                    of publishing his method in haste to anticipate some of Cuvier’s views, but he
                    might well complain of the delay in London. Some reparation has been made to his

                    quoted on account of the number of new genera which the peculiar views he had
                    embraced compelled him to invent. These views he shared more or less with Vigors
                    and Swainson, and to them attention will be immediately especially invited,

                    published in 1840. This, having been closely, though by no means in a hostile

                    >(Ann. Nat. History,</hi> vi. p. 410; vii. pp. 26 and 159), was followed by a
                    Second Edition in 1841, in which nearly all the corrections of the reviewer were
                    adopted, and in 1844 began the publication of <hi rend="italic">The Genera of
                    Birds,</hi> beautifully illustrated—first by <hi rend="smallcaps">Mitchell</hi>
                    and afterwards by Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Wolf</hi> —which will always keep
                    Gray’s name in remembrance. The enormous labour required for this work seems
                    scarcely to have been appreciated, though it remains to this day one of the most
                    useful books in an ornithologist’s library. Yet it must be confessed that its
                    author was hardly an ornithologist but for the accident of his calling. He was a
                    thoroughly conscientious clerk, devoted to his duty and unsparing of trouble.
                    However, to have conceived the idea of executing a work on so grand a scale as
                    this—it forms three folio volumes, and contains one hundred and eighty-five
                    coloured and one hundred and forty-eight uncoloured plates, with references to
                    upwards of two thousand four hundred generic names— was in itself a mark of
                    genius, and it was brought to a successful conclusion in 1849. Costly as it
                    necessarily was, it has been of great service to working ornithologists. In 1855
                    Gray brought out, as one of the Museum publications, <hi rend="italic">A
                    Catalogue of the Genera and Subgenera of Birds,</hi> a handy little volume,
                    naturally founded on the larger works. Its chief drawback is that it does not
                    give any more reference to the authority for a generic term than the name of its
                    inventor and the year of its application, though of course more precise
                    information would have at least doubled the size of the book. The same
                    deficiency became still more apparent when, between 1869 and 1871, he published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Hand-List of Genera and Species of Birds</hi> in three
                    octavo volumes (or parts, as they are called). Never was a book better named,
                    for the working ornithologist must almost live with it in his hand, and though
                    he has constantly to deplore its shortcomings, one of which especially is the
                    wrong principle on which its index is constructed, he should be thankful that
                    such a work exists. Many of its defects are, or perhaps it were better said
                    ought to be, supplied by <hi rend="smallcaps">Giebel’s</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    the author’s carelessness or the printer’s fault, or a combination of both, is
                    lamentably disappointing. Again and again it will afford the enquirer who
                    consults it valuable hints, but he must be mindful never to trust a single
                    reference in it until it has been verified. It remains to warn the reader also
                    that, useful as are both this work and those of Gray, their utility is almost
                    solely confined to experts.</p>

                    group the various species of Birds, as one after another they were made known.
                    But this was not always to be, and now a few words must be said respecting a
                    theory which was promulgated with great zeal by its upholders during the end of
                    the first and early part of the second quarter of the present century, and for
                    some years seemed likely to carry all before it. The success it gained was
                    doubtless due in some degree to the difficulty which most men had in
                    comprehending it, for it was enwrapped in alluring mystery, but more to the
                    confidence with which it was announced as being the long looked-for key to the
                    wonders of creation, since its promoters did not hesitate to term it the
                    discovery of <hi rend="italic">“the</hi> Natural System,” though they
                    condescended, by way of explanation to less exalted intellects than their own,
                    to allow it the more moderate appellation of the Circular or Quinary System.</p>
                <p>A comparison of the relation of created beings to a number of intersecting
                    circles is as old as the days of <hi rend="smallcaps">Nieremberg,</hi> who in
                    1635 wrote <hi rend="italic">{Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae,</hi> lib.
                    iii. cap. 3)—“Nullus hiatus est, nulla fractio, nulla dispersio formarum,
                    invicem connexa sunt velut annulus annulo”; but it is almost clear that he was
                    thinking only of a chain. In 1806 <hi rend="smallcaps">Fischer de Waldheim,</hi>
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Tableaux</hi><hi rend="italic">Synoptiques</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de zoognosie</hi> (p. 181), quoting Nieremberg, extended his
                    figure of speech, and, while justly deprecating the notion that the series of
                    forms belonging to any particular group of creatures— the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammalia</hi> was that whence he took his instance—could be placed in a
                    straight line, imagined the various genera to be arrayed in a series of
                    contiguous circles around Man as a centre. Though there is nothing to shew that
                    Fischer intended, by what is here said, to do anything else than illustrate more
                    fully the marvellous interconnexion of different animals, or that he attached
                    any realistic meaning to his metaphor, his words were eagerly caught up by the
                    prophet of the new faith. This was <hi rend="smallcaps">William Sharpe
                    Macleay,</hi> a man of education and real genius, who in 1819 and 1821 brought
                    out a work under the title of <hi rend="italic">Horae Entomologicae,</hi> which
                    was soon after hailed by <hi rend="smallcaps">Vigors</hi> as containing a new
                    revelation, and applied by him to Ornithology in some “Observations on the
                    Natural Affinities that connect the Orders and Families of Birds,” read before
                    the Linnean Society of London in 1823, and afterwards published in its <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions</hi> (xiv. pp. 395-517). In the following year Vigors
                    returned to the subject in some papers published in the recently established <hi
                    rend="italic">Zoological Journal,</hi> and found an energetic condisciple and
                    coadjutor in <hi rend="smallcaps">Swainson,</hi> who, for more than a dozen
                    years—to the end, in fact, of his career as an ornithological writer—was instant
                    in season and out of season in pressing on all his readers the views he had,
                    through Vigors, adopted from Macleay, though not without some modification of
                    detail if not of principle. What these views were it would be manifestly
                    improper for a sceptic to state except in the terms of a believer. Their
                    enunciation must therefore be given in Swainson’s own words, though it must be
                    admitted that space cannot be found here for the diagrams, which it was alleged
                    λvere necessary for the right understanding of the theory. This theory, as
                    originally propounded by Macleay, was said by Swainson in 1835 <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Geogr. and</hi><hi rend="italic">Classifie,</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                    Animals,</hi> p. 202) to have consisted of the following propositions ι<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We prefer giving them here in
                    Swainson’s version, because he seems to have set them forth more clearly and
                    concisely than Macleay ever did, and, moreover, Swainson’s application of them
                    to Ornithology —a branch of science that lay outside of Macleay’s proper
                    studies— appears to be more suitable to the present occasion.</p></note> —</p>
                <p>“1. That the series of natural animals is continuous, forming, as it were, a
                    circle; so that, upon commencing at any one given poir ⅛ and thence tracing all
                    the modifications of structure, we shall be imperceptibly led, after passing
                    through numerous forms, again to the point from which we started.</p>
                <p>“2. That no groups are natural which do not exhibit, or show an evident tendency
                    to exhibit, such a circular series.</p>
                <p>“3. That the primary divisions of every large group are ten, five of which are
                    composed of comparatively large circles, and five of smaller: these latter being
                    termed osculant, and being intermediate between the former, which they serve to
                    connect.</p>
                <p>“4. That there is a tendency in such groups as are placed at the opposite points
                    of a circle of affinity ‘ to meet each other. ’</p>
                <p>“5. That <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the five larger groups into which every
                    natural circle is divided ‘ bears a resemblance to all the rest, or, more
                    strictly speaking, consists of types which represent those of each of the four
                    other groups, together with a type peculiar to itself.’”</p>
                <p>As subsequently modified by Swainson <hi rend="italic">{tom. cit.</hi> pp. 224,
                    225), the foregoing propositions take the following form :—</p>
                <p>“I. That every natural series of beings, in its progress from a given point,
                    either aetually returns, or evinces a tendency to return, again to that point,
                    thereby forming a circle.</p>
                <p>“II. The primary circular divisions of every group are three actually, or five
                    apparently.</p>
                <p>“III. The contents of such a circular group are symbolically (or analogically)
                    represented by the contents of all other circles in the animal kingdom.</p>
                <p>“IV. That these primary divisions of every group are characterized by definite
                    peculiarities of form, structure, and economy, which, under diversified
                    modifications, are uniform throughout the animal kingdom, and are therefore to
                    be regarded as the <hi rend="smallcaps">primary</hi> TYPES OF NATURE.</p>
                <p>“V. That the different ranks or degrees of circular groups exhibited in the
                    animal kingdom are <hi rend="smallcaps">nine</hi> in number, each being involved
                    λvithin the other.”</p>
                <p>Though, as above stated, the theory here promulgated owed its temporary success
                    chiefly to the extraordinary assurance and pertinacity with which it was urged
                    upon a public generally incapable of understanding what it meant, that it
                    received some support from men of science must be admitted. A “circular system”
                    was advocated by the eminent botanist <hi rend="smallcaps">Fries,</hi> and the
                    views of Macleay met with the partial approbation of the celebrated entomologist
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Kirby,</hi> while at least as much may be said of the
                    imaginative <hi rend="smallcaps">0ken,</hi> whose mysticism far surpassed that
                    of the Quinarians. But it is obvious to every one who nowadays indulges in the
                    profitless pastime of studying their writings that, as a whole, they failed in
                    grasping the essential difference between <hi rend="italic">homology</hi> (or
                    “affinity,” as they generally termed it) and <hi rend="italic">analogy</hi>
                    (which is only a learned name for an uncertain kind of resemblance)— though this
                    difference had been fully understood and set forth by Aristotle himself—and,
                    moreover, that in seeking for analogies on which to base their foregone
                    conclusions they were often put to hard shifts. Another singular fact is that
                    they often seemed to be totally unaware of the tendency if not the meaning of
                    some of their own expressions: thus Macleay could write, and doubtless in
                    perfect good faith <hi rend="italic">{Trans. Linn. Society,</hi> xvi. p. 9,
                    note), “Naturalists have nothing to do with mysticism, and but little with <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> reasoning.” Yet his followers, if not he himself,
                    were ever making use of language in the highest degree metaphorical, and were
                    always explaining facts in accordance with preconceived opinions. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fleming,</hi> already the author of a harmless and extremely
                    orthodox <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Zoology,</hi> pointed out in 1829 in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> (xli. pp. 302-327) some of the
                    fallacies of Macleay’s method, and in return provoked from him a reply, in the
                    form of a letter addressed to Vigors <hi rend="italic">On the Dying Struggle of
                    the Dichotomous System,</hi> couched in language the force of which no one even
                    at the present day can deny, though to the modern naturalist its invective power
                    contrasts ludicrously with the strength of its ratiocination. But, confining
                    ourselves to what is here our special business, it is to be remarked that
                    perhaps the heaviest blow dealt at these strange doctrines was that delivered by
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Rennie,</hi> who, in an edition of Montagu’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Ornithological Dictionary {pp.</hi> xxxiii-lv), published in 1831
                    and again issued in 1833, attacked the Quinary System, and especially its
                    application to Ornithology by Vigors and Swainson, in a way that might perhaps
                    have demolished it, had not the author mingled with his undoubtedly sound
                    reasoning much that is foreign to any question with which a naturalist, as such,
                    ought to deal—though that herein he was only following the example of one of his
                    opponents, who had constantly treated the subject in like manner, is to be
                    allowed. This did not hinder Swainson, who had succeeded in getting the
                    ornithological portion of the first zoological work ever published at the
                    expense of the British Government (namely, the <hi rend="italic">Fauna
                    Boreali-Americana)</hi> executed in accordance with his own opinions, from
                    maintaining them more strongly than ever in several of the volumes treating of
                    Natural History which he contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Cabinet
                    Cyclopaedia—</hi> among others that from which we have just given some
                    extracts—and in what may be deemed the culmination in England of the Quinary
                    System, the volume of the “Naturalist’s Library” on <hi rend="italic">The
                    Natural Arrangement and History of Flycatchers,</hi> published in 1838, of which
                    unhappy performance mention has already been made in this present work (vol. ix.
                    p. 350, note). This seems to have been his last attempt; for, two years later,
                    his <hi rend="italic">Bibliography of Zoology</hi> shows little trace of his
                    favourite theory, though nothing he had uttered in its support was retracted.
                    Appearing almost simultaneously with this work, an article by <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Strickland</hi><hi rend="italic">{Mag. Nat. History,</hi> ser.
                    2, iv. pp. 219-226) entitled <hi rend="italic">Observations upon the Affinities
                    and Analogies of Organized Beings</hi> administered to the theory a shock from
                    which it never recovered, though attempts were now and then made by its
                    adherents to revive it; and, even ten years or more later, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Kauf,</hi> one of the few foreign ornithologists who had embraced Quinary
                    principles, was by mistaken kindness allowed to publish Monographs of the

                    for (as has been already stated) the extraordinary views of its adherents found
                    little favour on the continent of Europe. The purely artificial character of the
                    System of Linnaeus and his successors had been perceived, and men were at a loss
                    to find a substitute for it. The new doctrine, loudly proclaiming the discovery
                    of a “Natural” System, led away many from the steady practice which should have
                    followed the teaching of Cuvier (though he in Ornithology had not been able to
                    act up to the principles he had lain down) and from the extended study of
                    Comparative Anatomy. Moreover, it veiled the honest attempts that were making
                    both in France and Germany to find real grounds for establishing an improved
                    state of things, and consequently the labours of <hi rend="smallcaps">De</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Blainville,</hi> É <hi rend="smallcaps">tienne,
                    Geoffroy</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">St-</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Hilaire,</hi> and

                    Muller,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Nitzsch</hi> —to say nothing of
                    others—were almost wholly unknown on this side of the Channel, and even the
                    value of the investigations of British omithotomists of high merit, such as <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Macartney</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Macgillivray,</hi> was
                    almost completely overlooked. True it is that there were not wanting other men
                    in these islands whose common sense refused to accept the metaphorical doctrine
                    and the mystical jargon of the Quinarians, but so strenuously and persistently
                    had the latter asserted their infallibility, and so vigorously had they assailed
                    any who ventured to doubt it, that most peaceable ornithologists found it
                    be-&gt;t to bend to the furious blast, and in some sort to acquiesce at least in
                    the phraseology of the self-styled interpreters of Creative Wilt But, while thus
                    lamenting this unfortunate perversion into a mistaken channel of ornithological
                    energy, we must not over-blame those who caused it. Maeleay indeed never
                    pretended to a high position in this branch of science, his tastes lying in the
                    direction of Entomology; but few of their countrymen knew more of Birds than did
                    Swainson and Vigors; and, while the latter, as editor for many years of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zoological Journal,</hi> and the first Secretary of the Zoological
                    Society, has especial claims to the regard of all zoologists, so the former’s
                    indefatigable pursuit of Natural History, and conscientious labour in its
                    behalf—among other ways by means of his graceful pencil— deserve to be
                    remembered as a set-off against the injury he unwittingly caused.</p>
                <p>It is now incumbent upon us to take a rapid survey of the ornithological works
                    which come more or less under the designation of “Faunae”;<note anchored="true"

                    are so numerous that it will be necessary to limit this survey, as before
                    indicated, to those countries alone which form the homes of English people, or
                    are commonly visited by them in ordinary travel.</p>
                <p>Beginning with our Antipodes, it is hardly needful to go further back than Mr

                    with coloured plates by Mr Keulemans, since the publication of which the same

                    in 1876. A considerable number of valuable papers on the Ornithology of the
                    country by Drs Hector and Von Haast, Prof. Hutton, Mr Potts, and others are to
                    be found in the <hi rend="italic">Trans</hi><hi rend="italic">actions and

                <p>Passing to Australia, we have the first good description of some of its Birds in
                    the several old voyages and in Latham’s works before mentioned (pages 6 and 8).

                    has been already name&lt;l, and he subsequently reproduced with some additions

                    >Australia</hi> (2 vols. 8vo, 1865). In 1866 Mr Diggles commenced a similar

                    rend="italic">Australia,</hi> but the coloured plates, though fairly drawn, are
                    not comparable to those of his predecessor. This is still incomplete, though the
                    parts that have appeared have been collected to form two volumes and issued with
                    title-pages. Some notices of Australian Birds by Mr Ramsay and others are to be

                <p>Coming to our Indian possessions, and beginning with Ceylon, we have Kelaart’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Prodromus</hi><hi rend="italic">Faunae Zeylanicae</hi> (8vo,
                    1852), and the admirable <hi rend="italic">Birds of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ceylon</hi> by Capt. Legge (4to, 1878-80), with coloured plates by Mr Keulemans
                    of all the peculiar species. It is hardly possible to name any book that has
                    been more conscientiously executed than this. In regard to continental India
                    many of the more important publications have been named in a former article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> id. pp. 762, 763), and since that was written the
                    chief work that has appeared is Blyth’s <hi rend="italic">Mammals and Birds of
                    Burma</hi> (8vo, 1875).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society,</hi> but, since it was
                    separately issued, it is entitled to notice here.</p></note> Jordon’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Birds of India</hi> (8vo, 1862-64; reprinted 1877) still reigns
                    supreme as the sole comprehensive work on the Ornithology of the Peninsula. A
                    very fairly execute&lt;l compilation on the subject by an anonymous writer is to
                    be found in a late edition of the <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia of India</hi>
                    published at Madras. It is needless to observe that <hi rend="italic">Stray
                    Feathers,</hi> an ornithological journal for India and its dependencies, and
                    maintained with much spirit by Mr A. O. Hume, contains many interesting and some
                    valuable papers.</p>
                <p>In regard to South Africa, besides the well-known work of Le Vaillant already
                    mentioned, there is the second volume of Sir Andrew Smith’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa</hi> (4to, 1838-42), which is
                    devoted to birds. This is an important but cannot be called a satisfactory work.
                    Its one hundred and fourteen plates by Ford truthfully represent one hundred and
                    twenty-two of the mounted specimens obtained by the author in his explorations
                    into the interior. Mr Layard’s handy <hi rend="italic">Birds of South
                    Africa</hi> (8vo, 1867), though by ho means free from faults, has much to
                    recommend it. A so-called new edition of it by Mr Sharpe, has since appeared
                    (1875-84), but is executed on a plan so wholly different that it must be
                    regarded as a distinct work. Andersson’s <hi rend="italic">Noles on the Birds of
                    Damaτa Land</hi> (8vo, 1872) has been carefully edited by Mr Gurney, whose
                    knowledge of SouthAfrican ornithology is perhaps greater than that of any one
                    else. It is much to be regretted that of the numerous sporting books that treat
                    of this part of the world so few give any important information respecting the
                    Birds.</p>
                <p>Of special works relating to the British West Indies, Waterton’s well-known <hi
                    rend="italic">Wanderings</hi> has passed through several editions since its
                    first appearance in 1825, and must be mentioned here, though, strictly speaking,
                    much of the country be traversed was not British territory. To Dr Cabanis we are
                    indebted for the ornithological result⅝of Richard Schomburgh’s researches given
                    in the third volume (pp. 662-765) of the latter’s <hi rend="italic">Reisen im
                    Britisch-</hi><hi rend="italic">Guiana</hi> (8vo, 1848), and then in Léotaud’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Oiseaux</hi><hi rend="italic">de Tile de la Trinidad</hi>
                    (8vo, 1866). Of the Antilles there is only to be named Mr Gosse’s excellent <hi
                    rend="italic">Birds of Jamaica</hi> (12mo, 1847), together withits <hi
                    rend="italic">Illustrations</hi> (sm. fol., 1849) beautifully executed by him. A
                    nominal list, with references, of the Birds of the island is contained in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Handbook of Jamaica</hi> for 1881 (pp. 103-117).</p>
                <p>So admirable a “List of Faunal Publications relating to North American
                    Ornithology” up to the year 1878 has been given by Dr Cones as an appendix to
                    his <hi rend="italic">Birds of the Colorado Valley</hi> (pp. 567- 784) that
                    nothing more of the kind is wanted except to notice the chief separate works
                    which have since appeared. These may be said to be Mr Stearns’s <hi
                    rend="italic">New England Bird Life</hi> (2 vols. 8vo, 1881-83), revised by Dr
                    Cones, and the several editions of his own <hi rend="italic">Check List of North
                    American Birds</hi> (8vo, 1882), and <hi rend="italic">Key to North American
                    Birds</hi> (1884); while it maybe added that the concluding volumes of the <hi
                    rend="italic">North American Birds</hi> of Prof. Baird, the late Dr Brewer, and
                    Mr Ridgway (the first three of which were published in 1874) are expected to be
                    issued about the time that these lines will meet the reader’s eye. Yet some of
                    the older works are still of sufficient importance to be especially mentioned
                    here, and especially that of Alexander Wilson, whose <hi rend="italic">American
                    Ornithology,</hi> originally published between 1808 and 1814, has gone through
                    more editions than there is room to specify, though mention should be made of
                    those issued in Great Britain, by Jameson (4 vols. 16mo, 1831), and Jardine (3
                    vols. 8vo, 1832). The former of these has the entire text, but no plates; the
                    latter reproduces the plates, but the text is in places much condensed, and
                    excellent notes are added. A continuation of Wilson’s work, under the same title
                    and on the same plan, was issued by Bonaparte between 1825 and 1833, and most of
                    the later editions include the work of both authors. The works of Audubon, with
                    their continuations by Cassin and Mr Elliot, and the <hi rend="italic">Fauna
                    Boreali-Americana</hi> of Richardson and Swainson have already been noticed
                    (pages 11 and 15); but they need naming here, as also does Nuttall’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Manual of the Ornithology of the United States ami of Canada</hi>
                    (2 vols., 1832-34; 2d ed., 1840); the <hi rend="italic">Birds of Long
                    Island</hi> (8vo, 1844) by Giraud, remarkable for its excellent account of the
                    habits of shore birds; and of course the <hi rend="italic">Birds of North
                    America</hi> (4to, 1858) by Prof. Baird, with the cooperation of Cassin and Mr
                    Lawrence, which originally formed a volume (ix.) of what are known as the
                    “Pacific Railroad Reports.” Apart from these special works the scientific
                    journals cf Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington contain innumerable
                    papers on the Ornithology of the country, while in 1876 the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club</hi> began to appear and continued
                    until 1884, when it was superseded by <hi rend="italic">The Auk,</hi>
                    established solely for the promotion of Ornithology in America, and <pb

                    American ornithologist of repute, its editors being Messrs Allen, Coues,

                <p>Returning to the Old World, among the countries whose Ornithology will most
                    interest British readers we have first Iceland, the fullest—indeed the only
                    full—account of the Birds of which is Faber’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prodromus</hi><hi rend="italic">der isländischen Ornithologie</hi> (8vo, 1822),
                    though the island has since been visited by several good ornithologists,—
                    Proctor, Krüner, and Wolley among them. A list of its Birds, with some notes,
                    bibliographical and biological, has been given as an Appendix to Mr
                    Baring-Gould’s <hi rend="italic">Iceland, its Scenes and Sagas</hi> (8vo, 1862);
                    and Mr Shepherd’s <hi rend="italic">North-west Peninsula of Iceland</hi> (8vo,
                    1867) recounts a somewhat profitless expedition made thither expressly for
                    ornithological objects. For the Birds of the Faeroes there is Herr H. C.
                    Muller’s <hi rend="italic">Faerôerncs</hi><hi rend="italic">Fuglefauna</hi>
                    (8vo, 1862), of which a German translation has appeared.<note anchored="true"

                    Norway has been treated in a great many papers by Herr Collett, some of which
                    may be said to have been separately published as <hi rend="italic">Norges
                    Fugle</hi> (8vo, 1868; with a supplement, 1871), and <hi rend="italic">The

                    Kjaeibôlling; but the ornithological portion of Nilsson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Skandinavisk Fauna, Foglarna</hi> (3d ed., 2 vols. 8vo, 1858) is of great
                    merit; while the text of SundevalΓs <hi rend="italic">Svenska Foglarna</hi>
                    (obi. fol., 1856-73), unfortunately unfinished at his death, and Herr Holmgren’s

                    1866-75) deserve naming.</p>
                <p>Works on the Birds of Germany are far too numerous to be recounted. That of the
                    two Naumanns, already mentioned, and yet again to be spoken of, stands at the
                    head of all, and perhaps at the head of the “Faunal” works of all countries. For
                    want of space it must here suffice simply to name some of the ornithologists who
                    in this century have elaborated, to an extent elsewhere unknown, the science as
                    regards their own country :—Altum, Baldamus, Bcchstein, Blasius (father and two
                    sons), Bolle, Borggreve, whose <hi rend="italic">Vogel-Fauna von

                    index to the subject, Brehm (father and sons), Von Droste, Gätke, Gloger, Hintz,
                    Alexander and Eugen von Homeyer, Jäckel, Koch, König-Warthausen, Krfiper,
                    Kutter, Landbeck, Landois, Leisler, Von Maltzan, Bernard Meyer, Von der Mühle,

                    would be nearly doubled; but that would overpass our proposed limits, though

                <p>Returning northwards, we have of the Birds of the whole of France nothing of real

                    Vieillot’s <hi rend="italic">Faune Française</hi> (8vo, 1822-29); but there is a
                    great number of local publications of which Mr Saunders has furnished <hi
                    rend="italic">{Zoologist,</hi> 1878, pp. 95-99) a catalogue. Some of these seem
                    only to have appeared in journals, but many have certainly been issued
                    separately. Those of most interest to English ornithologists naturally refer to
                    Britanny, Normandy, and Picardy, and are by Bâillon, Benoist, Blandin, Bureau,
                    Canivet, Chesnon, Degland, Demarle, De Norguet, Gentil, Hardy, Lemetteil,
                    Lemonnicier, Lesauvage, Maignon, Marcotte, Nourry, and Taslé, while perhaps the

                    Selys-Longeliamps (8vo, 1842), old as it is, remains the classical work, though

                    Oiseaux</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Belgique</hi> of Μ. Dubois (8vo, 1851-60) is
                    so much later in date. In regard to Holland we have Schlegel’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Vogels van Nederland</hi> (3 vols. 8vo, 1854-58; 2d ed., 2 vols., 1878),
                    besides his <hi rend="italic">De Dieren van Nederland: Vogels</hi> (8vo,

                <p>Before considering the ornithological works relating solely to the British
                    Islands, it may be well to cast a glance on a few of those that refer to Europe
                    in general, the more so since most of them are of Continental origin. First we
                    have the already-mentioned <hi rend="italic">Manuel d’Omithologie</hi> of
                    Temminck, which originally appeared as a single volume in 1815;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Conics are said to exist
                    bearing the date 1814.</p></note> ® but that was speedily superseded by the
                    second edition of 1820, in two volumes. Two supplementary parts were issued in
                    1835 and 1840 respectively, and the work for many years deservedly maintained
                    the highest position as the authority on European Ornithology—indeed in England
                    it may almost without exaggeration be said to have been nearly the only foreign
                    ornithological work known; but, as could only be expected, grave defects are now
                    to be discovered in it. Some of them were already manifest when one of its
                    author’s colleagues, Schlegel (who had been employed to write the text for
                    SusemihΓs plates, originally intended to illustrate Temminck’s work), brought
                    out his bilingual <hi rend="italic">Revue critique des</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Oiseaux</hi><hi rend="italic">d'Europe</hi> (8vo, 1844), a very remarkable
                    volume, since it correlated and consolidated the labours of French and German,
                    to say nothing of Russian, ornithologists. Of Gould’s <hi rend="italic">Birds of
                    Europe</hi> (5 vols, fol., 1832-37) nothing need be added to what has been
                    already said. The year 1849 saw the publication of Degland’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithologie Européenne</hi> (2 vols. 8vo), a work fully intended to take the
                    place of Temminck’s; but of which Bonaparte, in a caustic but by no means
                    ill-deserved <hi rend="italic">Revue Critique</hi> (12mo, 1850), said that the
                    author had performed a miracle since he had worked without a collection of
                    specimens and without a library. A second edition, revised by Μ. Gerbe (2 vols.
                    8vo, 1867), strove to remedy, and to some extent did remedy, the grosser errors
                    of the first, but enough still remain to make few statements in the work
                    trustworthy unless corroborated by other evidence. Meanwhile in England Dr Bree
                    had in 1858 begun the publication of <hi rend="italic">The Birds of Europe not
                    observed in the British Isles</hi> (4 vols. 8vo), which was completed in 1863,
                    and in 1875 reached a second and improved edition (5 vols.). In 1862 Μ. Dubois
                    brought out a similar work on the “Espèces non observées en Belgique,” being
                    supplementary to that of his above named. In 1870 Dr Fritsch completed his <hi
                    rend="italic">Naturgeschichte der Vögel Europas</hi> (8vo, with atlas in folio);
                    andin 1871 Messrs Sharpe and Dresser began the publication of their <hi
                    rend="italic">Birds of Europe,</hi> which was completed by the latter in 1879 (8
                    vols. 4to), and is unquestionably the most complete work of its kind, both for
                    fulness of information and beauty of illustration— the coloured plates being
                    nearly all by Mr Keulemans, or when not by him from the hardly inferior hand of
                    Mr Neale. In so huge an undertaking mistakes and omissions are of course to be
                    found if any one likes the invidious task of seeking for them; but many of the
                    errors imputed to this work prove on investigation to refer to matters of
                    opinion and not to matters of fact, while many more are explicable if we
                    remember that while the work was in progress Ornithology was being prosecuted
                    with unprecedented activity, and thus statements which were in accordance with
                    the best information at the beginning of the period were found to need
                    modification before it was ended. As a whole European ornithologists are all but
                    unanimously grateful to Mr Dresser for the way in which he performed the
                    enormous labour he had undertaken.</p>
                <p>Coming now to works on British Birds only, the first of the present century that
                    requires remark is Montagu’s <hi rend="italic">Ornithological Dictionary</hi> (2
                    vols. 8vo, 1802; supplement 1813), the merits of which have been so long and so
                    fully acknowledged both abroad and at home that no further comment is here
                    wanted. In 1831 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n27/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0027-0018"/> Rennie brought out a modified edition of it
                    (reissued in 1833), and Newman another in 1866 (reissued in 1883); but those who
                    wish to know the author’s views had better consult the original. Next in order
                    come the very inferior <hi rend="italic">British Ornithology</hi> of Graves (3
                    vols. 8vo, 1811-21), and a work with the same title by Hunt (3 vols. 8vo,
                    1815-22), published at Norwich, but never finished. Then we have Selby’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Illustrations of - British Ornithology,</hi> two folio volumes of
                    coloured plates engraved by himself, between 1821 and 1833, with letterpress
                    also in two volumes (8vo, 1825-33), a second edition of the first volume being
                    also issued (1833), for the author, having yielded to the pressure of the
                    “Quinarian” doctrines then in vogue, thought it necessary to adjust his
                    classification accordingly, and it must be admitted that for information the
                    second edition is best. In 1828 Fleming brought out his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of British Animals</hi> (8vo), in which the Birds are treated at
                    considerable length (pp. 41-146), though not with great success. In 1835 Mr
                    Jenyns (now Biomefield) produced an excellent <hi rend="italic">Manual of
                    British Vertebrate. Animals,</hi> a volume (8vo) executed with great scientific
                    skill, the Birds again receiving due attention (pp. 49-286), and the
                    descriptions of the various species being as accurate as they are terse. In the
                    same year began the <hi rend="italic">Coloured Illustrations of British Birds
                    and their Eggs</hi> of H. L. Meyer (4tδ), which was completed in 1843, whereof a
                    second edition (7 vols. 8vo, 1842-50) was brought out, and subsequently
                    (1852-57) a reissue of the latter. In 1836 appeared Eyton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the rarer British Birds,</hi> intended as a sequel to Bewick’s
                    well-known volumes, to which no important additions had been made since the
                    issue of 1821. The year 1837 saw the beginning of two remarkable works by
                    Macgillivray and Yarrell respectively, and each entituled <hi rend="italic">A
                    History of British Birds.</hi> Of the first, undoubtedly the more original and
                    in many respects the more minutely accurate, mention will again have to be made
                    (page 24), and, save to state that its five volumes were not completed till
                    1852, nothing more needs now to be added. The second has unquestionably become
                    the standard work on British Ornithology, a fact due in part to its numerous
                    illustrations, many of them indeed ill drawn, though all carefully engraved, but
                    much more to the breadth of the author’s views and the judgment with which they
                    were set forth. In practical acquaintance with the internal structure of Birds,
                    and in the perception of its importance in classification, he was certainly not
                    behind his rival; but he well knew that the British public in a Book of Birds
                    not only did not want a series of anatomical treatises, but would even resent
                    their introduction. He had the art to conceal his art, and his λvork was
                    therefore a success, while the other was unhappily a failure. Yet with all his
                    knowledge he was deficient in some of the qualities which a great naturalist
                    ought to possess. His conception of what his work should be seems to have been
                    perfect, his execution was not equal to the conception. However, he was not the
                    first nor will he be the last to fall short in this respect. For him it. must be
                    said that, whatever may have been done by the generation of British
                    ornithologists now becoming advanced in life, he educated them to do it; nay,
                    his influence even extends to a younger generation still, though they may hardly
                    be aware of it. Of YarrelΓs work in three volumes, a second edition was
                    published in 1845, a third in 1856, and a fourth, begun in 1871, and almost
                    wholly rewritten, is still unfinished. Of the compilations based upon this work,
                    without which they could not have been composed, there is no need to speak. One
                    of the few appearing since, with the same scope, that are not borrowed is
                    Jardine’s <hi rend="italic">Birds of Great Britain and Ireland</hi> (4 vols.
                    8vo, 1838-43), forming part of his <hi rend="italic">Naturalist's Library</hi>;
                    and Gould’s <hi rend="italic">Birds of Great Britain</hi> has been already
                    mentioned.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Though
                    contravening our plan, we must for its great merits notice here Mr More’s series

                    Birds in Great Britain during the Nesting Season.”</p></note></p>
                <p>A considerable number of local works deserving of notice have also to be named.
                    The first three volumes of Thompson’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History of
                    Ireland</hi> (8vo, 1849-51) contain an excellent account of the Birds of that
                    island, and Mr Watters’s <hi rend="italic">Birds of Ireland</hi> (8vo, 1853) has
                    also to be mentioned. For North Britain there is Mr Robert Gray’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Birds of the West of Scotland</hi> (8vo, 1871), which virtually is
                    an account of those of almost the whole of that part of the kingdom. To these
                    may be added Dunn’s <hi rend="italic">Ornithologist's Guide to Orkney and
                    Shetland</hi> (8vo, 1837), the unfinished <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi

                <p>The good effects of “Faunal” works such as those named in the foregoing rapid
                    survey none can doubt. “Every kingdom, every province, should have its own
                    monographer,” wrote Gilbert White more than one hundred years ago, and
                    experience has proved the truth of his assertion. In a former article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> iii. pp. 736-764) the attempt has been made to
                    shew how the labours of monographers of this kind, but on a more extended scale,
                    can be brought together, and the valuable results that thence follow. Important
                    as they are, they do not of themselves constitute Ornithology as a science; and
                    an enquiry, no less wide and far more recondite, still remains. By whatever term
                    we choose to call it—Classification, Arrangement, Systematizing, or
                    Taxonomy—that enquiry which has for its object the discovery of the natural
                    groups into which Birds fall, and the mutual relations of those groups, has
                    always been one of the deepest interest, and to it we must now recur.</p>
                <p>But nearly all the authors above named, it will have been seen, trod the same
                    ancient paths, and in the works of scarcely one of them had any new spark of
                    intelligence been struck out to enlighten the gloom which surrounded the
                    investigator. It is now for us to trace the rise of the present more advanced
                    school of ornithologists whose 'ab□urs, preliminary as we must still regard them
                    to be, yet give signs of far greater promise. It would probably be unsafe to
                    place its origin further back than a few scattered hints contained in the
                    “Pterographische Fragmente” of <hi rend="smallcaps">Christian Ludwig
                    N^itzsch,</hi> published in the <hi rend="italic">Magazin für den neuesten
                    Zustand der Naturkunde</hi> (edited by Voigt) for May 1806 (xi. pp. 393-417),
                    and even these might be left to pass unnoticed, were it not that we recognize in
                    them the germ of the great work which the same admirable zoologist subsequently
                    accomplished. In these “Fragments,” apparently his earliest productions, we find
                    him engaged on the subject with which his name will always be especially
                    identified, the structure and arrangement of the feathers that form the
                    proverbial characteristic of Birds. But, though the observations set forth in
                    this essay were sufficiently novel, there is not much in them that at the time
                    would have attracted attention, for perhaps no one—not even the author
                    himself—could have then foreseen to what important end they would, in
                    conjunction with other investigations, lead future naturalists; but they are
                    marked by the same close and patient determination that eminently distinguishes
                    all the work of their author; and, since it will be necessary for us to return
                    to this part of the subject later, there is here no need to say more of them. Tn
                    the following year another set of hints— of a kind so different that probably no
                    one then living would have thought it possible that they should ever be brought

                    “annexes” on each side to which the ribs are articulated—all, however, finally
                    uniting to form the single “breast-bone.” Further on (pp. 101, 102) we find
                    observations as to the number of ribs which are attached to each of the
                    “annexes” —there being sometimes<pb break="no"

                    the posterior, and in certain forms no ribs belonging to one, all being applied
                    to the other. Moreover, the author goes on to remark that in adult birds trace
                    of the origin of the sternum from five centres of ossification is always more or
                    less indicated by sutures, and that, though these sutures had been generally
                    regarded as ridges for the attachment of the sternal muscles, they indeed. mark
                    the extreme points of the five primary bony pieces of the sternum.</p>

                    >Tiedemann’s</hi> carefully-wrought <hi rend="italic">Anatomie und

                    which Cuvier did in 1805, and in some respects is superior to his later
                    production of 1817. It is, however, only noticed here on account of the numerous
                    references made to it by succeeding writers, for neither in this nor in the
                    author’s second volume (not published until 1814) did he propound any systematic
                    arrangement of the Class. More germane to our present subject are the <hi

                    detached essays on some peculiarities of the skeleton or portions of the
                    skeleton of certain Birds—one of the most remarkable of which is that on the
                    component parts of the foot (pp. 101-105) pointing out the aberration from the
                    ordinary structure exhibited by the Goatsucker <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Caprimulgus)</hi> and the Swift <hi rend="italic">(Cypselus}</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> an aberration which, if rightly understood, would have
                    conveyed a warning to those ornithological systematists who put their trust in
                    Birds’ toes for characters on which to erect a classification, that there was in
                    them much more of importance, hidden in the integument, than had hitherto been
                    suspected; but the warning was of little avail, if any, till many years had
                    elapsed. However, Nitzsch had not as yet seen his way to proposing any
                    methodical arrangement of the various groups of Birds, and it was not until some
                    eighteen months later that a scheme of classification in the main anatomical was
                    attempted.</p>
                <p>This scheme was the work of <hi rend="smallcaps">Blasius Merrem,</hi> who, in a
                    communication to the Academy of Sciences of Berlin on the 10th December 1812,
                    which was published in its <hi rend="italic">Abhandlungen</hi> for the following
                    year (pp. 237-259), set forth a <hi rend="italic">Tentamen Systematis
                    naturalis</hi><hi rend="italic">Avium,</hi> no less modestly entitled than
                    modestly executed. The attempt of Merrem must be regarded as the virtual
                    starting-point of the latest efforts in Systematic Ornithology, and in that view
                    its proposals deserve to be stated at length. Without pledging ourselves to the
                    acceptance of all its details—some of which, as is only natural, cannot be
                    sustained with our present knowledge, resulting from the information accumulated
                    by various investigators throughout more than seventy years—it is certainly not
                    too much to say that Merrem’s merits are almost incomparably superior to those
                    of any of his predecessors as well as to those of the majority of his successors
                    for a long time to come; while the neglect of his treatise by many (perhaps it
                    would not be erroneous to say by most) of those who have since written on the
                    subject seems inexcusable save on the score of inadvertence. Premising then that
                    the chief characters assigned by this ill-appreciated systematist to his several
                    groups are drawn from almost all parts of the structure of Birds, and are
                    supplemented by some others of their more prominent peculiarities, we present

                    value as peculiar to the Carinate Division, the first of which is that the

                    barbs, including those of the wing-quills, cling closely together; while among

                    absence of any hooks whereby they might cohere; the non-existence of the
                    furcula, and the coalescence of the coracoids with the scapulae (or, as he

                <p>As for Merrem’s partitioning of the inferior groups there is less to be said in
                    its praise as a λvhole, though credit must be given to his anatomical knowledge
                    for leading him to the perception of several affinities, as well as differences,
                    that had never before been suggested by superficial systematists. But it must be

                    overlooked many points, both of alliance and the opposite, which since his time
                    have gradually come to be admitted. For instance, he seems not to have been

                    but it must be borne in mind that in his time a great many Birds were referred
                    to that genus which (according to modern ideas) certainly do not belong to it,
                    and it may well have been that he never had the opportunity of examining a
                    specimen of the genus as nowadays restricted.</p></note><hi rend="italic

                    greatly in advance of his age; but on the other hand he most righteously judged
                    that some species hitherto referred to the genera <hi rend="italic">Certhia</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Upupa</hi> required removal to other positions, and it is
                    much to be regretted that the very concise terms in which his decisions were
                    given to the world make it impossible to determine with any degree of certainty
                    the extent of the changes in this respect which he would have introduced. Had
                    Merrem published his scheme on an enlarged scale, it seems likely that he would
                    have obtained for it far more attention, and possibly some portion of
                    acceptance. He had deservedly attained no little reputation as a descriptive
                    anatomist, and his claims to be regarded as a systematic reformer would probably
                    have been admitted in his lifetime. As it was his scheme apparently fell flat,
                    and not until many years had elapsed were its merits at all generally
                    recognized.</p>
                <p>Notice has next to be taken of a Memoir on the Employment of Sternal Characters
                    in establishing Natural Families among Birds, which was read by <hi

                    1816, p. 110). This is a very disappointing performance, since the author
                    observes that, notwithstanding his new classification of Birds is based on a
                    study of the form of the sternal apparatus, yet, because that lies wholly within
                    the body, he is compelled to have recourse to such outward characters as are
                    afforded by the proportion of the limbs and the disposition of the toes—even as
                    had been the practice of most ornithologists before him! It is evident that the
                    features of the sternum on which De Blainville chiefly relied were those drawn
                    from its posterior margin, which no very extensive experience of specimens is
                    needed to show are of comparatively slight value; for the number of “<hi

                    sometimes been called in English—when they exist, goes but a very short way as a

                    <hi rend="italic">“faux</hi>” and the “<hi rend="italic">vrais</hi> ’’; but,
                    while the latter were very correctly defined, the former were most arbitrarily
                    separated from the <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Grimpeurs."</hi> He
                    also split his <hi rend="italic">Grallatores</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Natatores</hi> (practically identical with the <hi rend="italic">Grallae</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Anseres</hi> of Linnaeus) each into four sections; but he
                    failed to see—as on his own principles he ought to have seen— that each of these
                    sections was at least equivalent to almost any one of his other <hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Ordres."</hi> He had, however, the courage
                    to act up to his own professions in collocating the Rollers (Corαααβ) with the
                    Bee-eaters <hi rend="italic">(Merops),</hi> and had the sagacity to surmise that
                    <hi rend="italic">Menura</hi> was not a Gallinaceous Bird. The greatest benefit
                    conferred by this memoir is probably that it stimulated the efforts, presently
                    to be mentioned, of one of his pupils, and that it brought more distinctly into
                    sight that other factor, originally discovered by Merrem, of which it now
                    clearly became the duty of systematizers to take cognizance.</p>
                <p>Following the chronological order we are here adopting, we next have to recur to
                    the labours of <hi rend="smallcaps">Nitzsch,</hi> who, in 1820, in a treatise on
                    the Nasal Glands of Birds—a subject that had already attracted the attention of

                    rend="italic">Bull. Soc. Philomath, de Paris,</hi> iii. pp. 267-269)—first put

                    were based on a comparative examination of those bodies in various forms. It
                    seems unnecessary here to occupy space by giving an abstract of his plan,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This plan, having been
                    repeated by Schöpss in 1829 <hi rend="italic">{op. cit.,</hi> xii. p. 73),
                    became known to Sir R. Owen in 1835, who then drew to it the attention of Kirby
                    <hi rend="italic">(Seventh Bridgewater Treatise,</hi> ii. pp. 444, 445), and in
                    the next year referred to it in his own article “Aves” in Todd’s <hi

                    no excuse for not being aware of one of Nitzsch’s labours, though his more
                    advanced work of 1829, presently to be mentioned, was not referred to by Sir R.
                    Owen.</p></note> which hardly includes any but European species, because it was
                    subsequently-elaborated with no inconsiderable modifications in a way that must
                    presently be mentioned at greater length. But the scheme, crude as it was,
                    possesses some interest. It is not only a key to much of his later work—to
                    nearly all indeed that was published in his lifetime—but in it are founded
                    several definite groups (for example, <hi rend="italic">Passerinse</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Picariae)</hi> that subsequent experience has shewn to be more or
                    less natural; and it further serves as additional evidence of the breadth of his
                    views, and his trust in the teachings of anatomy; for it is clear that, if
                    organs so apparently insignificant as these nasal glands were found λvorthy of
                    being taken into account, and capable of forming a base of operations, in
                    drawing up a system, it would almost follow that there can be no part of a
                    Bird’s organization that by proper study would not help to supply some means of
                    solving the great question of its affinities. This seems to the present writer
                    to be one of the most certain general truths in Zoology, and is probably
                    admitted in theory to be so by most zoologists, but their practice is opposed to
                    it; for, whatever group of animals be studied, it is found that one set or
                    another of characters is the chief favourite of the authors consulted—each
                    generally taking a separate set, and that to the exclusion of all others,
                    instead of effecting a combination of all the sets and taking the
                    aggregate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A very
                    remarkable instance of this may be seen in the <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi

                    tongue as his chief guide, and found it indeed an unruly member.</p></note></p>
                <p>That Nitzsch took this extended view is abundantly proved by the valuable series
                    of ornithotomical observations which he must have been for some time
                    accumulating, <pb break="no"

                    contribute to the younger Naumann’s excellent A’ <hi rend="italic">atur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">geschickte der Vögel Deutschlands,</hi> already noticed above
                    (page 9). Besides a concise general treatise on the Organization of Birds to be
                    found in the Introduction to this work (i. pp. 23-52), a brief description from
                    Nitzsch’s pen of the peculiarities of the internal structure of nearly every
                    genus is incorporated with the author’s prefatory remarks, as each passed under
                    consideration, and these descriptions being almost without exception so drawn up
                    as to be comparative are accordingly of great utility to the student of
                    classification, though they have been so greatly neglected. Upon these
                    descriptions he was still engaged till death, in 1837, put an end to his
                    labours, when his place as Naumann’s assistant for the remainder of the work was
                    taken by Rudolph Wagner; but, from time to time, a few more, which he had
                    already completed, made their posthumous appearance in it, and, even in recent
                    years, some selections from his unpublished papers have through the care of
                    Giebel been presented to the public. Throughout the whole of this series the
                    same marvellous industry and scrupulous accuracy are manifested, and attentive
                    study of it will shew how many times Nitzsch anticipated the conclusions at
                    whi·ch it has taken some modern taxonomers fifty years to arrive. Yet over and
                    over again his determination of the affinities of several groups even of
                    European Birds was disregarded; and his labours, being contained in a bulky and
                    costly work, were hardly known at all outside of his own country, and within it
                    by no means appreciated so much as they deserved<note anchored="true"

                    publication, and was doubtless in some degree influenced by them, utterly failed
                    to perceive the importance of the characters offered by the song-muscles of
                    certain groups, though their peculiarities were all duly described and recorded
                    by his coadjutor, as some indeed had been long before by Cuvier in his famous

                    applicable to many another and inferior author, while Temminck, terming
                    Naumann’s work an “<hi rend="italic">ouvrage</hi><hi rend="italic">de

                    published,—effectually shut it out from the realms of science. In Britain it

                    completion by a catalogue-compiler on account of some peculiarities of

                <p>Now we must return to France, where, in 1827, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >L’Herminier,</hi> a creole of Guadaloupe and a pupil of De Blainville’s,
                    contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Actes</hi> of the Linnaean Society of Paris
                    for that year (vi. pp. 3-93) the “Recherches sur l’appareil sternal des
                    Oiseaux,” which the precept and example of his master had prompted him to
                    undertake, and Cuvier had found for him the means of executing. A second and
                    considerably enlarged edition of this very remarkable treatise was published as
                    a separate work in the following year. We have already seen that De Blainville,
                    though fully persuaded of the great value of sternal features as a method of
                    classification, had been compelled to fall back upon the old pedal characters so
                    often employed before; but now the scholar had learnt to excel his teacher, and
                    not only to form an at least provi sional arrangement of the various members of
                    the Class, based on sternal characters, but to describe these characters at some
                    length, and so give a reason for the faith that was in him. There is no
                    evidence, so far as we can see, of his having been aware of Merrem’s views; but
                    like that anatomist he without hesitation divided the Class into two great <hi
                    rend="italic">“coupes,"</hi> to which he gave, however, no other names than “<hi
                    rend="italic">Oiseaux Normaux"</hi> and <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Oiseaux Anomaux,"</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> exactly
                    corresponding with his predecessor’s <hi rend="italic">Carinatae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ratitae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> and, moreover, he had a great
                    advantage in founding these groups, since he had discovered, apparently from his
                    own investigations, that the mode of ossification in each was distinct; for
                    hitherto the statement of there being five centres of ossification in every
                    Bird’s sternum seems to have been accepted as a general truth, without
                    contradiction, whereas in the Ostrich and the Rhea, at any rate, L’Herminier
                    found that there were but two such primitive points,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This fact in the Ostrich appears to have been

                    that the same would be the case with the Cassowary and the Emeu, which, with the

                    which composed the Family previously termed <hi rend="italic">Cursores</hi> by
                    De Blainville; but L’Herminier was able to distinguish no fewer than thirty-four
                    Families of <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Oiseaux Normaux,"</hi> and
                    the judgment with which their separation and definition were effected must be
                    deemed on the whole to be most creditable to him. It is to be remarked, however,
                    that the wealth of the Paris Museum, which he enjoyed to the full, placed him in
                    a situation incomparably more favourable for arriving at results than that which
                    was occupied by Merrem, to whom many of the most remarkable forms were wholly
                    unknown, while L’Herminier had at his disposal examples of nearly every type
                    then known to exist. But the latter used this privilege wisely and well—not,
                    after the manner of De Blainville and others subsequent to him, relying solely
                    or even chiefly on the character afforded by the posterior portion of the
                    sternum, but taking also into consideration those of the anterior, as well as of
                    the in some cases still more important characters presented by the pre-sternal
                    bones, such as the furcula, coracoids, and scapulae. L’Herminier thus separated
                    the Families of “Normal Birds”:—-</p>

                <p>The preceding list is given to shew the very marked agreement of L’Herminier’s
                    results compared with those obtained fifty years later by another investigator,
                    who approached the subject from an entirely different, though still
                    osteological, basis. The sequence of the Families adopted is of course open to
                    much criticism; but that would be wasted upon it at the present day; and the
                    cautious naturalist will remember that it is generally difficult and in most
                    cases absolutely impossible to deploy even a small section of the Animal Kingdom
                    into line. So far as a linear arrangement will permit, the above list is very
                    creditable, and will not only pass muster, but cannot easily be surpassed for
                    excellence even at this moment. Experience has shewn that a few of the Families
                    are composite, and therefore require further splitting; but examples of actually
                    false grouping cannot be said to occur. The most serious fault perhaps to be
                    found is the intercalation of the Ducks (No. 30) between the Pelicans and the
                    Grebes—but every systematist must recognize the difficulty there is in finding a
                    place for the Ducks in any arrangement we can at present contrive that shall be
                    regarded as satisfactory. Many of the excellencies of L’Herminier’s method could
                    not be pointed out without too great a sacrifice of space, because of the
                    details into which it would be necessary to enter; but the trenchant way in
                    which he showed that the “Passereaux”—a group of which Cuvier had said “Son
                    caractère semble d’abord purement négatif,” and had then failed to define the
                    limits—differed so completely from every other assemblage, while maintaining
                    among its own innumerable members an almost perfect essential homogeneity, is
                    very striking, and shews how admirably he could grasp his subject. Not less
                    conspicuous are his merits in disposing of the groups of what are ordinarily
                    known as Water-birds, his indicating the affinity of the Rails (No. 22) to the
                    Cranes (No. 23), and the severing of the latter from the Herons (No. 24). · His
                    union of the Snipes, Sandpipers, and Plovers into one group (No. 26) and the
                    alliance, especially dwelt upon, of that group with the Gulls (No. 27) are steps
                    which, though indicated by Merrem, are here for the first time clearly laid
                    down; and the separation of the Gulls from the Petrels (No. 28)—a step in
                    advance already taken, it is true, by liliger—is here placed on indefeasible
                    ground. With all this, perhaps on account of all· this, L’Herminier’s efforts
                    did not find favour with his scientific superiors, and for the time things
                    remained as though his investigations had never been carried on.<note

                <p>Two years later Nitzsch, who was indefatigable in his endeavour to discover the
                    Natural Families of Birds, and had been pursuing a series of researches into
                    their vascular system, published the result, at Halle in Saxony, in his <hi

                    rend="italic">arteria carotide communi,</hi> in which is included
                    a-classification drawn up in accordance with the variation of structure which
                    that important vessel presented in· the several groups that he had opportunities
                    of examining. By this time he had visited several of the principal museums on
                    the Continent, among others Leyden (where Temminck resided) and Paris (where he
                    had frequent intercourse with'-Cuvier), thus becoming acquainted with a
                    considerable number of exotic forms that had hitherto been inaccessible to him.
                    Consequently his labours had attained to a certain degree of completeness in
                    this direction, and it may therefore be expedient here to name the different
                    groups which he thus thought himself entitled to consider established. They are

                <p>To enable the reader to compare the several groups of Nitzsch with the Families
                    of L’Herminier, the numbers applied by the latter to his Families are suffixed
                    in square brackets to the names of the forme ’; and, disregarding the order of
                    sequence, which is here immaterial, the essential correspondence of the two
                    systems is worthy of all attention, for it obviously means that these two
                    investigators, starting from different points, must have been on the right
                    track, when they so often coincided as to the limits of what they considered to
                    be, and what we are now almost justified in calling, Natural Groups.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Whether Nitzsch was cognizant
                    of L’Herminier’s views is in no way apparent. The latter’s name seems not to be
                    even mentioned by him, but Nitzsch was in Paris in the summer of 1827, and it is
                    almost impossible that he should not have heard of L’Herminier’s labours, unless
                    the relations between the followers of Cuvier, to whom Nitzsch attached himself,
                    and those of De Blainville, whose pupil L’Herminier was, were such as to forbid
                    any communication between the rival schools. Yet we have L’Herminier’s evidence
                    that Cuvier gave him every assistance. Nitzsch’s silence, both on this occasion
                    and afterwards, is very curious; but he cannot be accused of plagiarism, for the
                    scheme given above is only an amplification of that foreshadowed by him (as
                    already mentioned) in 1820—a scheme which seems to have been equally unknown to
                    L’Herminier, perhaps through linguistic difficulty.</p></note> But it must be
                    observed that the classification of Nitzsch, just given, rests much more on
                    characters furnished by the general structure than on those furnished by the
                    carotid artery only. Among all the species (188, he tells us, in number) of
                    which he examined specimens, he found only <hi rend="italic">four</hi>
                    variations in the structure of that vessel, namely</p>
                <p>1. That in which both a right carotid artery and a left are present. This is the
                    most usual fashion among the various groups of Birds, including all the “aerial”
                    forms excepting <hi rend="italic">Passerinae,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Macrochires,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Picinae.</hi></p>
                <p>2. That in which there is but a single carotid artery, springing from both right
                    and left trunk, but the branches soon coalescing, to take a midway course, and
                    again dividing near the head. This form Nitzsch was only able to find in the
                    Bittern <hi rend="italic">(Ardea stellaris').</hi></p>
                <p>3. That in which the right carotid artery alone is present, of which, according
                    to our author’s experience, the Flamingo <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phoenicopterus)</hi><hi rend="italic">was,</hi> the sole example.</p>
                <p>4. That in which the left carotid artery alone exists, as found in all other
                    Birds examined by Nitzsch, and therefore as regards species and individuals much
                    the most common—since into this category come the countless thousands of the
                    Passerine Birds—a group which outnumbers all the rest put together.</p>
                <p>Considering the enormous stride in advance made by L’Herminier, it is very
                    disappointing for the historian to have to record that the next inquirer into
                    the osteology of Birds achieved a disastrous failure in his attempt to throw
                    light on their arrangement by means of a comparison of their sternum. This was
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Berthold,</hi> who devoted a long chapter of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Beiträge zur Anatomie,</hi> published at Göttingen in 1831, to a
                    consideration of the subject. So far as his introduc-torv chapter went—the
                    development of the sternum—he was, for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n32/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0032-0023"/> his time, right enough and somewhat instructive.
                    It was only when, after a close examination of the sternal apparatus of one
                    hundred and thirty species, which he carefully described, that he arrived (pp.
                    177-183) at the conclusion—astonishing to us who know of L’Herminier’s previous
                    results—that the sternum of Birds cannot be used as a help to their
                    classification on account of the egregious anomalies that would follow the
                    proceeding—such anomalies, for instance, as the separation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cypselus</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Hirundo</hi> and its alliance with <hi
                    rend="italic">Trochilus,</hi> and the grouping of <hi rend="italic">Hirundo</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Fringilla</hi> together. He seems to have been persuaded
                    that the method of Linnaeus and his disciples was indisputably right, and that
                    any method which contradicted it must therefore be wrong. Moreover, he appears
                    to have regarded the sternal structure as a mere function of the Bird’s habit,
                    especially in regard to its power of flight, and to have wholly overlooked the
                    converse position that this power of flight must depend entirely on the
                    structure. Good descriptive anatomist as he certainly was, he was false to the
                    anatomist’s creed; but it is plain, from reading his careful descriptions of
                    sternums, that he could not grasp the essential characters he had before him,
                    and, attracted only by the more salient and obvious features, had not capacity
                    to interpret the meaning of the whole. Yet he did not amiss by giving many
                    figures of sternums hitherto unrepresented. We pass from him to a more lively
                    theme.</p>
                <p>At the very beginning of the year 1832 Cuvier laid before the Academy of Sciences
                    of Paris a memoir on the progress of ossification in the sternum of Birds, of
                    which memoir an abstract will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Sciences</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturelles</hi> (xxv. pp.
                    260-272). Herein he treated of several subjects with which we are not
                    particularly concerned at present, and his remarks throughout were chiefly
                    directed against certain theories which Étienne Geoffroy St-Hilaire had
                    propounded in his <hi rend="italic">Philosophie Anatomique,</hi> published a
                    good many years before, and need not trouble us here; but what does signify to
                    us now is that Cuvier traced in detail, illustrating his statements by the
                    preparations he exhibited, the progress of ossification in the sternum of the
                    Fowl and of the Duck, pointing out how it differed in each, and giving his
                    interpretation of the differences. It had hitherto been generally believed that
                    the mode of ossification in the Fowl was that which obtained in all Birds—the
                    Ostrich and its allies (as L’Herminier, we have seen, had already shewn)
                    excepted. But it was now made to appear that the Struthious Birds in this
                    respect resembled, not only the Duck, but a great many other groups—Waders,
                    Birds-of-Prey, Pigeons, Passerines, and perhaps all Birds not Gallinaceous,—so
                    that, according to Cuvier’s view, the five points of ossification observed in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gallinae,</hi> instead of exhibiting the normal process,
                    exhibited one quite exceptional, and that in all other Birds, so far as he had
                    been enabled to investigate the matter, ossification of the sternum began at two
                    points only, situated near the anterior upper margin of the side of the sternum,
                    and gradually crept towards the keel, into which it presently extended; and,
                    though he allowed the appearance of detached portions of calcareous matter at
                    the base of the still cartilaginous keel in Ducks at a certain age, he seemed to
                    consider this an individual peculiarity. This fact was fastened upon by Geoffroy
                    in his reply, which was a week later presented to the 'Academy, but was not
                    published in full until the following year, when it appeared in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annales du Muséum</hi> (ser. 3, ii. pp. 1-22). Geoffroy here
                    maintained that the five centres of ossification existed in the Duck just as in
                    the Fowl, and that the real difference of the process lay in the period at which
                    they made their appearance, a circumstance, which, though virtually proved by
                    the preparations Cuvier had used, had been by him overlooked or misinterpreted.
                    The Fowl possesses all five ossifications at birth, and for a long while the
                    middle piece forming the keel is by far the largest. They all grow slowly, and
                    it is not until the animal is about six months old that they are united into one
                    firm bone. The Duck on the othèr hand, when newly hatched, and for nearly a
                    month after, has the sternum wholly cartilaginous.</p>
                <p>Then, it is true, two lateral points of ossification appear at the margin, but
                    subsequently the remaining three are developed, and when once formed they grow
                    with much greater rapidity than in the Fowl, so that by the time the young Duck
                    is quite independent of its parents, and can shift for itself, the whole sternum
                    is completely bony. Nor, argued Geoffroy, was it true to say, as Cuvier had
                    said, that the like occurred in the Pigeons and true Passerines. In their case
                    the sternum begins to ossify from three very distinct points—one of which is the
                    centre of ossification of the keel. As regards the Struthious Birds, they could
                    not be likened to the Duck, for in them at no age was there any indication of a
                    single median centre of ossification, as Geoffroy had satisfied himself by his
                    own observations made in Egypt many years before. Cuvier seems to have
                    acquiesced in the corrections of his views made by Geoffroy, and attempted no
                    rejoinder; but the attentive and impartial student of the discussion will see
                    that a good deal was really wanting to make the latter’s reply effective,
                    though, as events have shewn, the former was hasty in the conclusions at which
                    he arrived, having trusted too much to the first appearance of centres of
                    ossification, for, had his observations in regard to other Birds been carried on
                    with the same attention to detail as in regard to the Fowl, he would certainly
                    have reached some very different results.</p>
                <p>In 1834 <hi rend="smallcaps">Gloger</hi> brought out at Breslau the first (and
                    unfortunately the only) part of a <hi rend="italic">Vollständiges Handbuch der
                    Naturgeschichte der Vögel</hi><hi rend="italic">Europa</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">s,</hi> treating of the Land-birds. In the
                    Introduction to this book (p. xxxviii., note) he expressed his regret at not
                    being able to use as fully as he could wish the excellent researches of Nitzsch
                    which were then appearing (as has been above said) in the successive parts of
                    Naumann’s great work. Notwithstanding this, to Gloger seems to belong the credit
                    of being the first author to avail himself in a book intended for practical
                    ornithologists of the new light that had already been shed on Systematic
                    Ornithology; and accordingly we have the second Order of his arrangement, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi><hi rend="italic">Passerinae,</hi> divided into two
                    Suborders :— Singing Passerines <hi rend="italic">(melodusae),</hi> and
                    Passerines without an apparatus of Song-muscles <hi rend="italic"
                    >(anomalae)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the latter including what some later
                    writers called <hi rend="italic">Picariae.</hi> For the rest his classification
                    demands no particular remark; but that in a work of this kind he had the courage
                    to recognize, for instance, such a fact as the essential difference between
                    Swallows and Swifts lifts him considerably above the crowd of other
                    ornithological writers of his time.</p>
                <p>An improvement on the old method of classification by purely external characters
                    was introduced to the Academy of Sciences of Stockholm by <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Sundevall</hi> in 1835, and was published the following year in its <hi
                    rend="italic">Handlingar</hi> (pp. 43-130). This was the foundation of a more
                    extensive work of which, from the influence it still exerts, it will be
                    necessary to treat later at some length, and there will be no need now to enter
                    much into details respecting the earlier performance. It is sufficient here to
                    remark that the author, even then a man of great erudition, must have been aware
                    of the turn which taxonomy was taking; but, not being able to divest himself of
                    the older notion that external characters were superior to those furnished by
                    the study of internal structure, and that Comparative Anatomy, instead of being
                    a part of Zoology, was something distinct from it, he seems to have endeavoured
                    to form a scheme which, while not running wholly counter to the teachings of
                    Comparative Anatomists, should yet rest ostensibly on external characters. With
                    this view he studied the latter most laboriously, and in some measure certainly
                    not without success, for he brought into prominence several points that had
                    hitherto escaped the notice of his predecessors. He also admitted among his
                    characteristics a physiological consideration (apparently derived from Oken<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He says from Oken’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Naturgeschichte für Schulen,</hi> published in 1821, but the
                    division is to be found in that author’s earlier <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch der
                    Zoologie</hi> (ii. p. 371), which appeared in 1816.</p></note>) dividing the
                    class <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> into two sections <hi rend="italic"
                    >Altrices</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Praecoces,</hi> according as the young were
                    fed by their parents or, from the first, fed themselves. But at this time he was
                    encumbered with the hazy doctrine of analogies, which, if it did not act to his
                    detriment, was assuredly of no service to him. He prefixed an “Idea Systematis”
                    to his “Expositio”; and the former, which appears to represent his real opinion,
                    differs in arrangement very considerably from the latter. Like Gloger, Sundevall
                    in his ideal system separated the true Passerines from all other Birds, calling
                    them <hi rend="italic">Volucres</hi>; but he took a step further, for he
                    assigned to them the highest rank, wherein <pb break="no"

                    out of them, however, he chose the Thrushes and Warblers to stand first as his
                    ideal “Centrum”—a selection which, though in the opinion of the present writer
                    erroneous, is still largely followed.</p>
                <p>The points at issue between Cuvier and Étienne Geoffroy St-Hilaire before
                    mentioned naturally attracted the atten · tion of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >L’Herminier,</hi> who in 1836 presented to the French Academy the results of
                    his researches into the mode of growth of that bone which in the adult Bird he
                    had already studied to such good purpose. Unfortunately the full account of his
                    diligent investigations was never published. We can best judge of his labours
                    from an abstract printed in the <hi rend="italic">Comptes Rendus</hi> (iii. pp.
                    12-20) and reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Sciences</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturelles</hi> (ser. 2, vi. pp. 107-115), and
                    from the report upon them by <hi rend="smallcaps">Isidore</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Geoffroy</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">St-Hilaire,</hi> to whom with
                    others they were referred. This report is contained in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comptes Rendus</hi> for the following year (iv. pp. 565-574), and is very
                    critical in its character. It were useless to conjecture why the whole memoir
                    never appeared, as the reporter recommended that it should; but, whether, as he
                    suggested, the author’s observations failed to establish the theories he
                    advanced or not, the loss of his observations in an extended form is greatly to
                    be regretted, for no one seems to have continued the investigations he began and
                    to some extent carried out; while, from his residence in Guadeloupe, he had
                    peculiar advantages in studying certain types of Birds not generally available,
                    his remarks on them could not fail to be valuable, quite irrespective of the
                    interpretation he was led to put upon them. L’Herminier arrived at the
                    conclusion that, so far from there being only two or three different modes by
                    which the process of ossification in the sternum is carried out, the number of
                    different modes is very considerable— almost each natural group of Birds having
                    its own. The principal theory which he hence conceived himself justified in
                    propounding was that instead of <hi rend="italic">five</hi> being (as had been
                    stated) the maximum number of centres of ossification in the sternum, there are
                    no fewer than <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> entering into the composition of the
                    perfect sternum of Birds in general, though in every species some of these nine
                    are wanting, whatever be the condition of development at the time of
                    examination. These nine theoretical centres or “pieces” L’Herminier deemed to be
                    disposed in <hi rend="italic">three</hi> transverse series <hi rend="italic"
                    >(rangées),</hi> namely the anterior or “prosternai,” the middle or
                    “mesosternal,” and the posterior or “metasternal” —each series consisting of <hi
                    rend="italic">three</hi> portions, one median piece and two side-pieces. At the
                    same time he seems, according to the abstract of his memoir, to have made the
                    somewhat contradictory assertion that sometimes there are more than three pieces
                    in each series, and in certain groups of Birds as many as six.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We shall perhaps be justified
                    in assuming that this apparent inconsistency, and others which present
                    themselves, would be explicable if the whole memoir with the necessary
                    illustrations had been published.</p></note> It would occupy more space than can
                    here be allowed to give even the briefest abstract of the numerous observations
                    which follow the statement of his theory and on which it professedly rests. They
                    extend to more than a score of natural groups of Birds, and nearly each of them
                    presents some peculiar characters. Thus of the first series of pieces he says
                    that when all exist they may be developed simultaneously, or that the two
                    side-pieces may precede the median, or again that the median may precede the
                    side-pieces—according to the group of Birds, but that the second mode is much
                    the commonest. The same variations are observable in the second or middle
                    series, but its side-pieces are said to exist in all groups of Birds without
                    exception. As to the third or posterior series, when it is complete the three
                    constituent pieces are developed almost simultaneously; but its median piece is
                    said often to originate in two, which soon unite, especially when the
                    side-pieces are wanting. By way of examples of L’Herminier’s observations, what
                    he says of the two groups that had been the subject of Cuvier’s and the elder
                    Geoffroy’s contest may be mentioned. In the <hi rend="italic">Gallinse</hi> the
                    five well-known pieces or centres of ossification are said to consist of the two
                    side-pieces of the second or middle series, and the three of the posterior. On
                    two occasions, however, there was found in addition, what may be taken for a
                    representation of the first series, a little <hi rend="italic">“noyau</hi>”
                    situated between the coracoids—forming the only instance of all three series
                    being present in the same Bird. As regards the Ducks, L’Herminier agreed with
                    Cuvier that there are commonly only two centres of ossification—the side-pieces
                    of the middle series; but as these grow to meet one another a distinct median
                    “<hi rend="italic">noyau,”</hi> also of the same series, sometimes appears,
                    which soon forms a connexion with each of them. In the Ostrich and its allies no
                    trace of this median centre of ossification ever occurs; but with these
                    exceptions its existence is invariable in all other Birds. Here the matter must
                    be left; but it is undoubtedly a subject which demands further investigation,
                    and naturally any future investigator of it should consult the abstract of
                    L’Herminier’s memoir and the criticisms upon it of the younger Geoffroy.</p>
                <p>Hitherto it will have been seen that our present business has lain wholly in
                    Germany and France, for, as is elsewhere explained, the chief ornithologists of
                    Britain were occupying themselves at this time in a very useless way—not but
                    that there were several distinguished men in this country who were paying due
                    heed at this time to the internal structure of Birds, and some excellent
                    descriptive memoirs on special forms had appeared from their pens, to say
                    nothing of more than one general treatise on ornithic anatomy.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir Richard Owen’s celebrated
                    article “Aves,” in Todd’s <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia, of Anatomy and
                    Physiology</hi> (i. pp. 265-358), appeared in 1836, and, as giving a general
                    view of the structure of Birds, needs no praise here; but its object was not to
                    establish a classification, or throw light especially on systematic arrangement.
                    So far from that being the case, its distinguished author was content to adopt,
                    as he tells us, the arrangement proposed by Kirby in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seventh Bridgewater Treatise</hi> (ii. pp. 445-474), being that, it is true, of
                    an estimable zoologist, but of one who had no special knowledge of Ornithology.
                    Indeed it is, as the latter says, that of Linnaeus, improved by Cuvier, with an
                    additional modification of liliger’s—all these three authors having totally
                    ignored any but external characters. Yet it was regarded “as being the one which
                    facilitates the expression of the leading anatomical differences which obtain in
                    the class of Birds, and which therefore may be considered as the most
                    natural.”</p></note> Yet no one in Britain seems to have attempted to found any
                    scientific arrangement of Birds on other than external characters until, in
                    1837, <hi rend="smallcaps">William Macgillivray</hi> issued the first volume of
                    his <hi rend="italic">History oj British Birds,</hi> wherein, though professing
                    (p. 19) “not to add a new system to the many already in partial use, or that
                    have passed away like their authors,” he propounded (pp. 16-18) a scheme for
                    classifying the Birds of Europe at least founded on a “consideration of the
                    digestive organs, which merit special attention, on account, not so much of
                    their great importance in the economy of birds, as the nervous, vascular, and
                    other systems are not behind them in this respect; but because, exhibiting great
                    diversity of form and structure, in accordance with the nature of the food, they
                    are more obviously qualified to afford a basis for the classification of the
                    numerous species of birds” (p. 52). Experience has again and again exposed the
                    fallacy of this last conclusion, but it is no disparag-ment of its author,
                    writing nearly fifty years ago, to say that in this passage, as well as in
                    others that might be quoted, he was greater as an anatomist than as a
                    logician.</p>

                    save one (who did not live long enough to make his powers widely known) that

                    though undoubtedly the digestive organs of Birds have a claim to the fullest
                    consideration, yet Macgillivray himself subsequently became aware of the fact
                    that there were several other parts of their structure as important from the
                    point of view of classification. He it was, apparently, who first detected the
                    essential difference of the organs of voice presented by some of the New-World
                    Passerines (subsequently known as <hi rend="italic">Clamatores),</hi> and the
                    earliest intimation of this seems to be given in his anatomical description of
                    the Arkansas Flycatcher, <hi rend="italic">Tyrannus verticalis,</hi> which was
                    published in 1838 <hi rend="italic">(Ornithol. Biography,</hi> iv. p. 425),
                    though it must be admitted that he did not—because he then could not—perceive
                    the bearing of their difference, which was reserved to be shown by the
                    investigation of a still greater anatomist, and of one who had fuller facilities
                    for research, and thereby almost revolutionized, as will presently be mentioned,
                    the views of systematists as to this Order of Birds. There is only space here to
                    say that the second volume of Macgillivray’s work was published in 1839, and the
                    third in 1840; but it was not until 1852 that the author, in broken health,
                    found an opportunity of issuing the fourth and fifth. His scheme of
                    classification, being as before stated partial, need not be given in detail. Its
                    great merit is that it proved the necessity of combining another and hitherto
                    much-neglected factor in any natural arrangement, though vitiated as so many
                    other schemes have been by being based wholly on one class of characters.</p>
                <p>But a bolder attempt at classification was that made in 1838 by <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Blyth</hi> in the New Series (Mr Charlesworth’s) of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Magazine of Natural History</hi> (ii. pp. 256-268, 314- 319,
                    351-361, 420-426, 589-601; iii. pp. 76-84). It was limited, however, to what he
                    called <hi rend="italic">Insessores,</hi> being the group upon which that name
                    had been conferred by Vigors <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Linn. Society,</hi> xiv.
                    p. 405) in 1823 (see above, p. 15), with the addition, however, of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Raptores,</hi> and it will be unnecessary to enter into
                    particulars concerning it, though it is as equally remarkable for the insight
                    shewn by the author into the structure of Birds as for the philosophical breadth
                    of his view, which comprehends almost every kind of character that had been at
                    that time brought forward. It is plain that Blyth saw, and perhaps he was the
                    first to see it, that Geographical Distribution was not unimportant in
                    suggesting the affinities and differences of natural groups (pp. 258, 259); and,
                    undeterred by the precepts and practice of the hitherto dominant English school
                    of Ornithologists, he declared that “anatomy, when aided by every character
                    which the manner of propagation, the progressive changes, and other
                    physiological data supply, is the only sure basis of classification.” He was
                    quite aware of the taxonomic value of the vocal organs of some groups of Birds,
                    presently to be especially mentioned, and he had himself ascertained the
                    presence and absence of <hi rend="italic">caeca</hi> in a not inconsiderable
                    number of groups, drawing thence very justifiable inferences. He knew at least
                    the earlier investigations of</p>
                <p>L’Herminier, and, though the work of Nitzsch, even if he had ever heard of it,
                    must (through ignorance of the language in which it was written) have been to
                    him a sealed book, he had followed out and extended the hints already given by
                    Temminck as to the differences which various groups of Birds display in their
                    moult. With all this it is not surprising to find, though the fact has been
                    generally overlooked, that Blyth’s proposed arrangement in many points
                    anticipated conclusions that were subsequently reached, and were then regarded
                    as fresh discoveries. It is proper to add that at this time the greater part of
                    his work was carried on in conjunction with Mr <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bartlett,</hi> the present Superintendent of the Zoological Society’s Gardens,
                    and that, without his assistance, Blyth’s opportunities, slender as they were
                    compared with those which others have enjoyed, must have been still smaller.
                    Considering the extent of their materials, which was limited to the bodies of
                    such animals as they could obtain from dealers and the several menageries that
                    then existed in or near London, the progress made in what has since proved to be
                    the right direction is very wonderful. It is obvious that both these
                    investigators had the genius for recognizing and interpreting the value of
                    characters; but their labours do not seem to have met with much encouragement;
                    and a general arrangement of the Class laid by Blyth before the Zoological
                    Society at this time<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An

                    not appear in its publications, possibly through his neglect to reduce his
                    scheme to writing and deliver it within the prescribed period. But even if this
                    were not the case, no one need be surprised at the result. The scheme could
                    hardly fail to be a crude performance—a fact which nobody would know better than
                    its author; but it must have presented much that was objectionable to the
                    opinions then generally prevalent. Its line to some extent may be partly made
                    out—very clearly, for the matter of that, so far as its details have been
                    published in the series of papers to which reference has been given— and some
                    traces of its features are probably preserved in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalogue</hi> of the specimens of Birds in the Museum of the Asiatic Society
                    of Bengal, which, after several years of severe labour, made its appearance at
                    Calcutta in 1849; but, from the time of his arrival in India, the onerous duties
                    imposed upon Blyth, together with the want of sufficient books of reference,
                    seem to have hindered him from seriously continuing his former researches,
                    which, interrupted as they were, and born out of due time, had no appreciable
                    effect on the views of systematizers generally.</p>
                <p>Next must be noticed a series of short treatises communicated by <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Johann Friedrich Brandt,</hi> between the years 1836 and 1839,
                    to the Academy of Sciences of St Petersburg, and published in its <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires.</hi> In the year last mentioned the greater part of
                    these was separately issued under the title of <hi rend="italic">Beiträge
                    zur</hi><hi rend="italic">Kenntniss</hi><hi rend="italic">der Naturgeschichte
                    der Vögel.</hi> Herein the author first assigned anatomical reasons for
                    rearranging the Order <hi rend="italic">Anseres</hi> of Linnaeus and <hi
                    rend="italic">Natatores</hi> of liliger, who, so long before as 1811, had
                    proposed a new distribution of it into six Families, the definitions of which,
                    as was his wont, he had drawn from external characters only. Brandt now retained
                    very nearly the same arrangement as his predecessor; but, notwithstanding that
                    he could trust to the firmer foundation of internal framework, he took at least
                    two retrograde steps. First he failed to see the great structural diffeιence
                    between the Penguins (which liliger had placed as a group, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Impennes,</hi> of equal rank to his other Families) and the Auks, Divers, and
                    Grebes, <hi rend="italic">Pygopodes—</hi> combining all of them to form a
                    “Typus” (to use his term) <hi rend="italic">Urinatores</hi>; and secondly he
                    admitted among the <hi rend="italic">Natatores,</hi> though as a distinct
                    “Typus” <hi rend="italic">Podoidae,</hi> the genera <hi rend="italic">Podoa</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Fulica,</hi> which are now known to belong to the <hi

                    from the <hi rend="smallcaps">Moor-hen</hi> (vol. xvi. p. 808). At the same time
                    he corrected the error made by liliger in associating the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ph alaropes</hi> (σ.v.) with these forms, rightly declaring their <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n35/mode/1up"

                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sandpiper),</hi> a point of order which other
                    systematists were long in admitting. On the whole Brandt’s labours were of no
                    small service in asserting the principle that consideration must be paid to
                    osteology; for his position was such as to gain more attention to his views than
                    some of his less favourably placed brethren had succeeded in doing.</p>
                <p>In the same year (1839) another slight advance was made in the classification of
                    the true Passerines. <hi rend="smallcaps">Keyserling</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Blasius</hi> briefly pointed out in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archiv für Naturgeschichte</hi> (v. pp. 332-334) that, while all the other
                    Birds provided with perfect song-muscles had the “planta” or hind part of the
                    “tarsus” covered with two long and undivided horny plates, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Larks</hi> (vol. xiv. p. 316) had this part divided by many
                    transverse sutures, so as to be scutellated behind as well as in front; just as
                    is the case in many of the Passerines which have not the singing-apparatus, and
                    also in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Hoopoe</hi> (vol. xii. p. 154). The importance
                    of this singular but superficial departure from the normal structure has been so
                    needlessly exaggerated as a character that at the present time its value is apt
                    to be unduly depreciated. In so large and so homogeneous a group as that of the
                    true Passerines, a constant character of this kind is not to be despised as a
                    practical mode of separating the Birds which possess it; and, more than this, it
                    would appear that the discovery thus announced was the immediate means of
                    leading to a series of investigations of a much more important and lasting
                    nature—those of Johannes Müller to be presently mentioned.</p>
                <p>Again we must recur to that indefatigable and most original investigator <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nitzsch,</hi> who, having never intermitted his study of the
                    particular subject of his first contribution to science, long ago noticed, in
                    1833 brought out at Halle, where he was Professor of Zoology, an essay with the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Pterylographiae,</hi><hi rend="italic">Avium Pars
                    prior.</hi> It seems that this was issued as much with the object of inviting
                    assistance from others in view of future labours, since the materials at his
                    disposal were comparatively scanty, as with that of making known the results to
                    which his researches had already led him. Indeed he only communicated copies of
                    this essay to a few friends, and examples of it are comparatively scarce.
                    Moreover, he stated subsequently that he thereby hoped to excite other
                    naturalists to share with him the investigations he was making on a subject
                    which had hitherto escaped notice or had been wholly neglected, since he
                    considered that he had proved the disposition of the feathered tracts in the
                    plumage of Birds to be the means of furnishing characters for the discrimination
                    of the various natural groups as significant and important as they were new and
                    unexpected.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is still
                    a prevalent belief among nearly all persons but well-informed ornithologists,
                    that feathers grow almost uniformly over the whoL· surface of a Bird’s body;
                    some indeed are longer and some are shorter, but that is about all the
                    difference perceptible to most people. It is the easiest thing for anybody to
                    satisfy himself that this, except in a few cases, is altogether an erroneous
                    supposition. In all but a small number of forms the feathers are produced in
                    very definite clumps or tracts, called by Nitzsch <hi rend="italic"
                    >pterylae</hi><hi rend="italic">{πτeρ6v, penna, υKr</hi><hi rend="italic">,
                    sylva),</hi> a rather fanciful term it is true, but one to which no objection
                    can be taken. Between these <hi rend="italic">pterylae</hi> are spaces bare of
                    feathers, which he named <hi rend="italic">apteria.</hi> Before Nitzsch’s time
                    the only men who seem to have noticed this fact were the great John Hunter and
                    the accurate Macartney. But the observations of the former on the subject were
                    not given to the world until 1836, when Sir R. Owen introduced them into his <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> of the Museum of the College of Surgeons in London
                    (vol. iii. pt. ii. p. 311), and therein is no indication of the fact having a
                    taxonomical bearing. The same may be said of Macartney’s remarks, which, though
                    subsequent in point of time, were published earlier, namely, in 1819 (Rees’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyclopaedia,</hi> xiv., art. “Feathers”). Ignorance of this simple
                    fact has led astray many celebrated painters, among them Sir Edwin Landseer,
                    whose pictures of Birds nearly always shew an unnatural representation of the
                    plumage that at once betrays itself to the trained eye, though of course it is
                    not perceived by spectators generally, who regard only the correctness of
                    attitude and force of expression, which in that artist’s work commonly leave
                    little to be desired. Every draughtsman of Birds to be successful should study
                    the plan on which their feathers are disposed.</p></note> There was no need for
                    us here to quote this essay in its chronological place, since it dealt only with
                    the generalities of the subject, and did not enter upon any systematic details.
                    These the author reserved for a second treatise which he was destined never to
                    complete. He kept on diligently collecting materials, and as he did so was
                    constrained to modify some of the statements he had published. He consequently
                    fell into a state of doubt, and before he could make up his mind on some
                    questions which he deemed important he was overtaken by death.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Though not relating exactly
                    to our present theme, it would be improper to dismiss Nitzsch’s name without
                    reference to his extraordinarylabours in investigating the insect and other
                    external parasites of Birds, a subject which as regards British species was
                    subsequently elaborated by <hi rend="smallcaps">Denny</hi> in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Monographia Anoplurorum Britannia?</hi> (1842) and in his list of
                    the specimens of British <hi rend="italic">Anoplura</hi> in the collection of
                    the British Museum.</p></note> Then his papers were handed over to his friend
                    and successor Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps">Burmeister,</hi> now and for many years
                    past of Buenos Aires, who, with much skill elaborated from them the excellent
                    work known as Nitzsch’s <hi rend="italic">Pterylographie,</hi> which was
                    published at Halle in 1840. There can be no doubt that Prof. Burmeister
                    (fortunately yet spared to us) discharged his editorial duty with the most
                    conscientious scrupulosity; but, from what has been just said, it is certain
                    that there were important points on which Nitzsch was as yet undecided—some of
                    them perhaps of which no trace appeared in his manuscripts, and therefore as in
                    every case of works posthumously published, unless (as rarely happens) they have
                    received their author’s <hi rend="italic">“imprimatur,"</hi> they cannot be
                    implicitly trusted as the expression of his final views. It would consequently
                    be unsafe to ascribe positively all that appears in this volume to the result of
                    Nitzsch’s mature consideration. Moreover, as Prof. Burmeister states in his
                    preface, Nitzsch by no means regarded the natural sequence of groups as the
                    highest problem of the systematist, but rather their correct limitation. Again
                    the arrangement followed in the <hi rend="italic">Pterylographie</hi> was of
                    course based on pterylographical considerations, and we have its author’s own
                    word for it that he was persuaded that the limitation of natural groups could
                    only be attained by the most assiduous research into the species of which they
                    are composed from every point of view. The combination of these three facts will
                    of itself explain some defects, or even retrogressions, observable in Nitzsch’s
                    later systematic work when compared with that which he had formerly done. On the

                    details into which he enters in his <hi rend="italic">Pterylographie</hi> render
                    it far more instructive and valuable than the older performance. As an abstract
                    of that has already been given, it may be sufficient here to point out the chief
                    changes made in his newer arrangement. To begin with, the three great sections
                    of Aerial, Terrestrial, and Aquatic Birds are abolished. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">Accipitres</hi>” are divided into two groups, Diurnal
                    and Nocturnal; but the first of these divisions is separated into three
                    sections:—(1) the Vultures of the New World, (2) those of the Old World, and (3)
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Falco</hi> of Linnaeus. The “<hi rend="italic"

                    he had obtained an intimation to that effect on one of his Continental journeys.

                    the greatest blot on the whole scheme. Instead of recognizing, as before, a

                    notwithstanding this he did not figure the pterylosis of any one of them, and
                    the thought suggests itself that, though his editor assures us he had convinced

                    >(eingeschoben</hi> is the word used), the intrusion is rather due to the
                    necessity which Nitzsch, in common with most men of his time (the Quinarians
                    excepted), felt for deploying the whole series of Birds into line, in which case
                    the proceeding may be defensible on the score of convenience. The extraordinary
                    merits of this book, and the admirable fidelity to his principles which Prof.
                    Burmeister shewed in the difficult task of editing it, were unfortunately
                    overlooked for many years, and perhaps are not sufficiently recognized now. Even
                    in Germany, the author’s own country, there were few to notice seriously what is
                    certainly one of the most remarkable works ever published on the science, much
                    less to pursue the investigations that had been so laboriously begun.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some excuse is to be made for
                    this neglect. Nitzsch had of course exhausted all the forms of Birds commonly to
                    be obtained, and specimens of the less common forms were too valuable from the
                    curator’s or collector’s point of view to be subjected to a treatment that might
                    end in their destruction. Yet it is said, on good authority, that Nitzsch had
                    the patience so to manipulate the skins of many rare species that he was able to
                    ascertain the characters of their pterylosis by the inspection of their inside
                    only, without in any way damaging them for the ordinary purpose of a museum. Nor
                    is this surprising when we consider the marvellous skill of Continental and
                    especially German taxidermists, many of whom have elevated their profession to a
                    height of art inconceivable to most Englishmen, who are only acquainted with the

                    Nitzsch’s results and classification, was more sparing of his praise, and
                    prefaced his remarks by asserting that he could not refrain from laughter when
                    he looked at the plates in Nitzsch’s work, since they reminded him of the
                    plucked fowls hanging in a poulterer’s shop—it might as well be urged as an
                    objection to the plates in many an anatomical book that they called to mind a
                    butcher’s—and goes on to say that, as the author always had the luck to engage
                    in researches of which nobody thought, so had he the luck to print them where

                    useful at times in indicatiug that alliances generally admitted are unnatural;
                    and this is the case here, for, following Cuvier’s method, the author’s

                    furnishing—almost unconsciously, however—additional evidence for overthrowing

                    series of descriptions of some parts of the anatomy of American Birds, from
                    subjects supplied to him by that enthusiastic naturalist, whose zeal and
                    prescience, it may be called, in this respect merits all praise. Thus he
                    (prompted very likely by Macgillivray) wrote :—“I believe the time to be
                    approaching when much of the results obtained from the inspection of the
                    exterior alone will be laid aside; λvhen museums filled with stuffed skins will
                    be considered insufficient to afford a knowledge of birds; and when the student
                    will go forth, not only to observe the habits and haunts of animals, but to
                    preserve specimens of them to be carefully dissected” <hi rend="italic">(Ornith.

                    this series of anatomical descriptions appeared in the fourth volume of his
                    work, published in 1838, but they were continued until its completion with the

                    truth, when he said that the general structure, but especially the muscular
                    appendages, of the lower larynx was “similarly formed in all other birds of this
                    family” described in Audubon’s work. Macgillivray did not, however, assign to
                    this essential difference any systematic value. Indeed he was so much
                    prepossessed in favour of a classification based on the structure of the
                    digestive organs that he could not bring himself to consider vocal muscles to be
                    of much taxonomic use, and it was reserved to <hi rend="smallcaps">Johannes
                    Müller</hi> to point out that the contrary was the fact. This the great German
                    comparative anatomist did in two communications to the Academy of Sciences of
                    Berlin, one on the 26th June 1845 and the other on the 14tlι May 1846, which,
                    having been first briefly published in the Academy’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monatsbericht,</hi> were afterwards printed in full, and illustrated by
                    numerous figures, in its <hi rend="italic">Abhandlungen,</hi> though in this
                    latter and complete form they did not appear in public until 1847. This very
                    remarkable treatise forms the groundwork of almost all later or recent
                    researches in the comparative anatomy and consequent arrangement of the <hi

                    imperfections, many of them, it must be said, arise from want of material,
                    notwithstanding that its author had command of a much more abundant supply than
                    was at the disposal of Nitzsch. Carrying on the work from the anatomical point
                    at which he had left it, correcting his errors, and utilizing to the fullest
                    extent the observations of Keyserling and Blasius, to which reference has
                    already been made, Müller, though hampered by mistaken notions of which he seems
                    to have been unable to rid himself, propounded a scheme for the classification
                    of this group, the general truth of which has been admitted by all his
                    successors, based, as the title of his treatise expressed, on the hitherto
                    unknown different types of the vocal organs in the Passerines. He freely
                    recognized the prior discoveries of, as he thought, Audubon, though really, as
                    has since been ascertained, of Macgillivray; but Müller was able to perceive
                    their systematic value, which Macgillivray did not, and taught others to know
                    it. At the same time Müller shewed himself, his power of discrimination
                    notwithstanding, to fall behind Nitzsch in one very crucial point, for he
                    refused to the latter’s <hi rend="italic">Picariae</hi> the rank that had been
                    claimed for them, and imagined that the groups associated under that name formed
                    but a third “Tribe ”— <hi rend="italic">Picarii</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> of
                    a great Order <hi rend="italic">Insessores,</hi> the others being (1) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oscines</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Polymyodi</hi> —the Singing
                    Birds by emphasis, whose inferior larynx was endowed with the full number of
                    five pairs of songmuscles, and (2) the <hi rend="italic">Tracheophones,</hi>
                    composed of some South-American Families. Looking on Müller’s labours as we now
                    can, we see that such errors as he committed are chiefly due to his want of
                    special knowledge of Ornithology, combined with the absence in several instances
                    of sufficient materials for investigation. Nothing whatever is to be said
                    against the composition of his first and second “Tribes”; but the third is an
                    assemblage still more heterogeneous than that which Nitzsch brought together
                    under a name so like that of Müller—for the fact must never be allowed to go out
                    of sight that the extent of the <hi rend="italic">Picarii</hi> of the latter is
                    not at all that of the <hi rend="italic">Picariae</hi> of the former.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is not needless to point
                    out this fine distinction, for more than one modern author would seem to have
                    overlooked it.</p></note> For instance, Müller places in his third ‘ Tribe the
                    group which he called <hi rend="italic">Ampelidx,</hi> meaning thereby the
                    peculiar forms of South America that are now considered to be more properly
                    named <hi rend="italic">Cotingidae,</hi> and herein he was clearly right, while
                    Nitzsch, who (misled by their supposed affinity to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ampelis</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> peculiar to the Northern Hemisphere, and a
                    purely Passerine form) had kept them among his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passerines,</hi> was as clearly wrong. But again Müller made his third “Tribe”
                    <hi rend="italic">Picarii</hi> also to contain the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tyrannidse,</hi> of which mention has just been made, though it is so obvious
                    as now to be generally admitted that they have no very intimate relationship to
                    the other Families with which they are there associated. There is no need here
                    to criticize more minutely his projected arrangement, and it must be said that,
                    notwithstanding his researches, he seems to have had some misgivings that, after
                    all, the separation of the <hi rend="italic">Insessores</hi> into those “Tribes”
                    might not be justifiable. At any rate he wavered in his estimate of their
                    taxonomic value, for he gave an alternative proposal, arranging all the genera
                    in a single series, a proceeding in those days thought not only defensible and
                    possible, but desirable or even requisite, though now utterly abandoned. Just as
                    Nitzsch had laboured under the disadvantage of never having any example of the
                    abnormal <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> of the New World to dissect, and
                    therefore was wholly ignorant of their abnormality, so Müller never succeeded in
                    getting hold of an example of the genus <hi rend="italic">Pitta</hi> for the
                    same purpose, and yet, acting on the clew furnished by Keyserling and Blasius,
                    he did not hesitate to predict that it would be found to fill one of the gaps he
                    had to leave, and this to some extent it has been since proved to do.</p>
                <p>The result of all this is that the <hi rend="italic">Oscines</hi> or true <hi
                    rend="italic">Passeres</hi> are found to be a group in which the vocal organs
                    not only attain the greatest perfection, but are nearly if not quite as uniform
                    in their structure as is the sternal apparatus; while at the same time each set
                    of characters is wholly unlike that which exists in any other group of Birds. In
                    nearly all Birds the inferior larynx, or syrinx, which is, as proved long ago by
                    the experiments of Cuvier, the seat of their vocal powers, is at the bottom of
                    the trachea or windpipe, and is formed by the more or less firm union of several
                    of the bony rings of which that tube is composed. In the <hi rend="italic"

                    rapidly contracts to enter the lung on its own side. The halves of the pipe thus
                    formed are the <hi rend="italic">bronchi,</hi> tubes whose inner side is

                    entire hoops of the upper part of the trachea. The whole of this apparatus is
                    extremely flexible, and is controlled by muscles, the real vocal muscles of
                    which mention has previously been so frequently made. These vary in number in
                    different groups of Birds, and reach their maximum in the <hi rend="italic"

                    two pairs have a common origin about the middle of the trachea, and, descending
                    on its outside, divide at a short distance above the lower end of the tube; one

                    from the place of separation downward and forward, is inserted below the extreme

                    of each of these pairs of muscles, a third slender muscle—the <hi rend="italic"

                    arising near the middle of the lower end of the trachea, has its fibres inserted
                    on the extremity of the first of the incomplete rings of the bronchi. The fifth
                    pair, the <hi rend="italic">tensores anteriores,</hi> originates like the last
                    from the middle of the trachea, but is somewhat larger and thicker, appearing as
                    though made up of several small muscles in close contact, and by some
                    ornithotomists is believed to be of a composite nature. Its direction is
                    obliquely downward and forward, and, attached by a broad base to the last ring
                    of the trachea and cartilage immediately below, reaches the first or second of
                    the halfrings of the bronchi—in the normal <hi rend="italic">Oscines</hi> at
                    their extremity; but, in another section of that group, which it will be
                    necessary to mention later, it is found to be attached to their middle. There is
                    no question of its being by the action of the syringeal muscles just described
                    that the expansion of the bronchi, both as to length and diameter, is
                    controlled, and, as thereby the sounds uttered by the Bird are modified, they
                    are properly called the Song-muscles.</p>
                <p>It must not be supposed that the muscles just defined were first discovered by
                    Müller; on the contrary they had been described long before, and by many writers
                    on the anatomy of Birds. To say nothing of foreigners, or the authors of general
                    works on the subject, an excellent account of them had been given to the Linnean
                    Society by <hi rend="smallcaps">Yarrell</hi> in 1829, and published with
                    elaborate figures in its <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> (xvi. pp. 305-321,
                    pls. 17, 18), an abstract of which was subsequently given in the article “Raven”
                    in his <hi rend="italic">History of British Birds,</hi> and Macgillivray also
                    described and figured them with the greatest accuracy ten years later in his
                    work with the same title (ii. pp. 21-37, pls. x.-xii.), while Blyth and Nitzsch
                    had (as already mentioned) seen some of their value in classification. But
                    Muller has the merit of clearly outstriding his predecessors, and with his
                    accustomed perspicuity made the way even plainer for his successors to see than
                    he himself was able to see it. What remains to add is that the extraordinary
                    celebrity of its author actually procured for the first portion of his
                    researches notice in England <hi rend="italic">(Ann. Nat. History,</hi> xvii. p.
                    499), though it must be confessed not then to any practical purpose; but more
                    than thirty years after there appeared an English translation of his treatise by
                    Prof. Jeffrey Bell, with an appendix by Garrod containing a summary of the
                    latter’s own continuation of the same line of research, and thus once more Mr
                    Sclater, for it was at his instigation that the work was undertaken, had the
                    satisfaction of rendering proper tribute to one who by his investigations had so
                    materially advanced the study of Ornithology.<note anchored="true"

                <p>It is now necessary to revert to the year 1842, in which Dr <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Corn ay</hi> of Rochefort communicated to the French Academy of Sciences a
                    memoir on a new Classification of Birds, of which, however, nothing but a notice
                    has been preserved <hi rend="italic">(Comptes Rendus,</hi> xiv. p. 164). Two
                    years later this was followed by a second contribution from him on the same
                    subject, and of this only an extract appeared in the official organ of the
                    Academy <hi rend="italic">(ut supra,</hi> xvi. pp. 94, 95), though an abstract
                    was inserted in one scientific journal <hi rend="italic">(L'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Institut,</hi> xii. p. 21), and its first portion in another <hi
                    rend="italic">(Journal des</hi><hi rend="italic">Découvertes,</hi> i. p. 250).
                    The <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi><hi rend="italic">Zoologique</hi> for 1847 (pp.
                    360-369) contained the whole, and enabled naturalists to consider the merits of
                    the author’s project, λvhich was to found a new Classification of Birds on the
                    form of the anterior palatal bones, which he declared to be subjected more
                    evidently than any other to certain fixed laws. These laws, as formulated by
                    him, are that (1) there is a coincidence of form of the anterior palatal and of
                    the cranium in Birds of the same Order; (2) there is a likeness between the
                    anterior palatal bones in Birds of the same Order; (3) there are relations of
                    likeness between the anterior palatal bones in groups of Birds which are near to
                    one another. These laws, he added, exist in regard to all parts that offer
                    characters fit for the methodical arrangement of Birds, but it is in regard to
                    the anterior palatal bone that they unquestionably offer the most evidence. In
                    the evolution of these laws Dr Cornay had most laudably studied, as his
                    observations prove, a vast number of different types, and the upshot of his
                    whole labours, though not very clearly stated, was such as to wholly subvert the
                    classification at that time generally adopted by French ornithologists. He of
                    course knew the investigations of L’Herminier and De Blainville on sternal
                    formation, and he also seems to have been aware of some pterylological
                    differences exhibited by Birds— whether those of Nitzsch or those of Jacquemin
                    is not stated. True it is the latter were never published in full, but it is
                    quite conceivable that Dr Cornay may have known their drift. Be that as it may,
                    he declares that characters drawn from the sternum or the pelvis—hitherto deemed
                    to be, next to the bones of the head, the most important portions of the Bird’s
                    framework—are scarcely worth more, from a classificatory point of view, than
                    characters drawn from the bill or the legs; while pterylological considerations,
                    together with many others to which some systematists had attached more or less
                    importance, can only assist, and apparently must never be taken to control, the
                    force of evidence furnished by this bone of all bones—the anterior palatal.</p>
                <p>That Dr Cornay was on the brink of making a discovery of considerable merit will
                    by and by appear; but, with every disposition to regard his investigations
                    favourably, it cannot be said that he accomplished it. No account need be taken
                    of the criticism which denominated his attempt “unphilosophical and one-sided,”
                    nor does it signify that his proposals either attracted no attention or were
                    generally received with indifference. Such is commonly the fate of any
                    deep-seated reform of classification proposed by a comparatively unknown man,
                    unless it happen to possess some extraordinarily taking qualities, or be
                    explained with an abundance of pictorial illustration. This was not the case
                    here. Whatever proofs Dr Cornay may have had to satisfy himself of his being on
                    the right track, these proofs were not adduced in sufficient number nor arranged
                    with sufficient skill to persuade a somewhat stiff-necked generation of the
                    truth of his views—for it was a generation whose leaders, in France at any rate,
                    looked with suspicion upon any one who professed to go beyond the bounds which
                    the genius of Cuvier had been unable to overpass, and regarded the notion of
                    upsetting any of the positions maintained by him as verging almost upon
                    profanity. Moreover, Dr Cornay <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> s scheme was not
                    given to the world with any of those adjuncts that not merely please the eye but
                    are in many cases necessary, for, though on a subject which required for its
                    proper comprehension a series of plates, it made even its final appearance
                    unadorned by a single explanatory figure, and in ajournai, respectable and
                    well-known indeed, but one not of the highest scientific rank. Add to all this
                    that its author, in his summary of the practical results of his investigations,
                    committed a grave sin in the eyes of rigid systematists by ostentatiously
                    arranging the names of the forty types which he selected to prove his case
                    wholly without order, and without any intimation of the greater or less affinity
                    any one of them might bear to the rest. That success should attend a scheme so
                    inconclusively elaborated could not be expected.</p>
                <p>The same year which saw the promulgation of the crude scheme just described, as
                    well as the publication of the final researches of Müller, witnessed also
                    another attempt at the classification of Birds, much more limited indeed in
                    scope, but, so far as it went, regarded by most ornithologists of the time as
                    almost final in its operation. Under the vague title of “Ornithologische
                    Notizen” Γrof. Cabanis of Berlin contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Archiv für
                    Naturgeschichte</hi> (xiii. 1, pp. 186-256, 308-352) an essay in two parts,
                    wherein, following the researches of Müller<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    shewn to exist between the whole or divided condition of <hi rend="italic"
                    >planta</hi> or hind part of the “tarsus,” first noticed, as has been said, by
                    Keyserling and Blasius, and the presence or absence of the perfect
                    song-apparatus, the younger author found an agreement which seemed almost
                    invariable in this respect, and he also pointed out that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >planta</hi> of the different groups of Birds in which it is divided is divided
                    in different modes, the mode of division being generally characteristic of the
                    group. Such a coincidence of the internal and external features of Birds was
                    naturally deemed a discovery of the greatest value by those ornithologists who
                    thought most highly of the latter, and it was unquestionably of no little
                    practical utility. Further examination also revealed the fact<note

                    the Variation to which the number of primaries was subject had not escaped the
                    observation of Nitzsch, but he had scarcely used it as a classificatory

                    quill-feathers growing from the <hi rend="italic">mantes</hi> or distal segment
                    of the wing, formed another characteristic easy of observation. 1 n the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oscines</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Polymyodi</hi> of Miiller the
                    number was either nine or ten—and if the latter the outermost of them was
                    generally very small. In two of the other groups of which Prof. Cabanis
                    especially treated—groups which had been hitherto more or less confounded with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Oscines—</hi> the number of primaries was invariably ten,
                    and the outermost of them was comparatively large. This observation was also
                    hailed as the discovery of a fact of extraordinary importance; and, from the
                    results of these investigations, taken altogether, Ornithology was declared by
                    Sundevall, undoubtedly a man who had a right to speak with authority, to have
                    made greater progress than had been achieved since the days of Cuvier. The final
                    disposition of the “Subclass <hi rend="italic">Insessores</hi> ”—all the
                    perching Birds, that is to say, which are neither Birds-of-Prey nor
                    Pigeons—proposed by Prof. Cabanis, was into four “Orders,” as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Oscines,</hi> equal to Muller’s group of the same name;</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Clamatores,</hi> being a majority of that division of the
                    <hi rend="italic">P-icariae</hi> of Nitzsch, so called by Andreas Wagner, in
                    1841,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Archiv für Naturgeschichte,</hi> vii. 2, pp. 93, 94. The division seems to have
                    been instituted by this author a couple of years earlier in the second edition
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der Naturgeschichte</hi> (a work not seen by
                    the present writer), but not then to have received a scientific name. It
                    included all <hi rend="italic">Picariae</hi> which had not “zygodactylous” feet,
                    that is to say, toes placed in pairs, two before and two behind.</p></note>
                    which have their feet normally constructed;</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Strisores,</hi> a group now separated from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Clamatores</hi> of Wagner, and containing those forms which have
                    their feet abnormally constructed; and</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Scansores,</hi> being the <hi rend="italic">Grimpeurs</hi>
                    of Cuvier, the <hi rend="italic">Zygodactyli</hi> of several other
                    systematists.</p>
                <p>The first of these four “Orders” had been already indefeasibly established as one
                    perfectly natural, but respecting its details more must presently be said. The
                    remaining three are now seen to be obviously artificial associations, and the
                    second of them, <hi rend="italic">Clamatores,</hi> in particular, containing a
                    very heterogeneous assemblage of forms; but it must be borne in mind that the
                    internal structure of some of them was at that time still more imperfectly known
                    than now. Yet even then enough had been ascertained to have saved what are now
                    recognized as the Families <hi rend="italic">Todidse</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tyrannidae</hi> from being placed as “Subfamilies” in the same “Family <hi
                    rend="italic">Colopteridae</hi> and several other instances of unharmonious
                    combination in this “Order” might be adduced were it worth while to
                    particularize them. More than that, it would not be difficult to shew, only the
                    present is not exactly the place for it, that some groups or Families which in
                    reality are not far distant from one another are distributed, owing to the
                    dissimilarity of their external characters, throughout these three Orders. Thus
                    the <hi rend="italic">Podarginae</hi> are associated with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coraciidse</hi> under the head <hi rend="italic">Clamatores,</hi> while the <hi
                    rend="italic">Caprimulgidae,</hi> to which they are clearly most allied, if they
                    do not form part of that Family <hi rend="smallcaps">(Goatsucker,</hi> vol. x.
                    p. 711), are placed with the <hi rend="italic">Strisores</hi>; and again the <hi
                    rend="italic">Musophagidae</hi> also stand as <hi rend="italic">Strisores,</hi>
                    while the <hi rend="italic">Cuculidae,</hi> which modern systematists think to
                    be their nearest relations, are considered to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scansores.</hi></p>
                <p>But to return to the <hi rend="italic">Oscines,</hi> the arrangement of which in
                    the classification now under review has been deemed its greatest merit, and
                    consequently has been very generally followed. That by virtue of the perfection
                    of their vocal organs, and certain other properties—though some of these last
                    have perhaps never yet been made clear enough —they should stand at the head of
                    the whole Class, may here be freely admitted, but the respective rank assigned
                    to the various component Families of the group is certainly open to question,
                    and to the present writer seems, in the methods of several systematists, to be
                    based upon a fallacy. This respective rank of the different Families appears to
                    have been assigned on the principle that, since by reason of one character
                    (namely, the more complicated structure of their syrinx) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oscines</hi> form a higher group than the <hi rend="italic">Clamatores,</hi>
                    therefore all the concomitant features which the former possess and the latter
                    do not must be equally indicative of superiority. Now one of the features in
                    which most of the <hi rend="italic">Oscines</hi> differ from the lower “Order”
                    is the having a more or less undivided <hi rend="italic">planta,</hi> and
                    accordingly it has been assumed that the Family of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oscines</hi> in which this modification of the <hi rend="italic">planta</hi> is
                    carried to its extreme point must be the highest of that “Order.” Since,
                    therefore, this extreme modification of the <hi rend="italic">planta</hi> is
                    exhibited by the Thrushes and their allies, it is alleged that they must be
                    placed first, and indeed at the head of all Birds. The groundlessness of this
                    reasoning ought to be apparent to everybody. In the present state of anatomy at
                    any rate, it is impossible to prove that there is more than a coincidence in the
                    facts just stated, and in the association of two characters—one deeply seated
                    and affecting the whole life of the Bird, the other superficially, and so far as
                    we can perceive without effect upon its organism. Because the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clamatores,</hi> having no songmuscles, have a divided <hi rend="italic"
                    >planta,</hi> it cannot be logical to assume that among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oscines,</hi> which possess song-muscles, such of them as have an undivided <hi
                    rend="italic">planta</hi> must be higher than those that have it divided. The
                    argument, if it can be called an argument, is hardly one of analogy; and yet no
                    stronger ground has been occupied by those who invest the Thrushes, as do the
                    majority of modern systematists, with the most dignified position in the whole
                    Class. But passing from general to particular considerations, so soon as a
                    practical application of the principle is made its inefficacy is manifest. The
                    test of perfection of the vocal organs must be the perfection of the notes they
                    enable their possessor to utter. There cannot be a question that, sing admirably
                    as do some of the Birds included among the Thrushes,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prof. Cabanis would have strengthened his
                    position had he included in the same Family with the Thrushes, which he called
                    <hi rend="italic">Rha-</hi><hi rend="italic">cnemidae,</hi> the Birds commonly
                    known as Warblers, <hi rend="italic">Sylviidtε,</hi> which the more advanced of
                    recent systematists are inclined with much reason to unite with the Thrushes,
                    <hi rend="italic">Turdidse</hi>; but instead of that he, trusting to the plantar
                    character, segregated the Warblers, including of course the Nightingale, and did
                    not even allow them the second place in his method, putting them below the
                    Family called by him <hi rend="italic">Sylvicolidx,</hi> consisting chiefly of
                    the American forms now known as <hi rend="italic">Mniotiltidae,</hi> none of

                    Family, infinitely surpass them. Yet the Larks form the very group which, as has
                    been already shewn <hi rend="smallcaps">(Lark,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 314), have the
                    <hi rend="italic">planta</hi> more divided than any other among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oscines.</hi> It seems hardly possible to adduce anything that
                    would more conclusively demonstrate the independent nature of each of these
                    characters—the complicated structure of the syrinx and the asserted inferior
                    formation of the <hi rend="italic">planta—</hi> which are in the <hi

                    Prof. Cabanis (p. 313) to exist. Some of them it is now easy to explain,
                    inasmuch as in a few cases the apparently aberrant genera have elsewhere found a
                    more natural position, a contingency to which he himself was fully awake. But as

                <p>Thia will perhaps be the most convenient place to mention another kind of
                    classification of Birds, which, based on a principle wholly different from those
                    that have just been explained, requires a few words, though it has hot been
                    productive, nor is likely, from all that appears, to be productive of any great
                    effect. So long ago as 1831, <hi rend="smallcaps">Bonaparte,</hi> in his <hi

                    two Subclasses, to which he applied the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insessores</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Grallatores</hi> (hitherto used by their
                    inventors Vigors and liliger in a different sense), in the latter work relying
                    chiefly for this division on characters which had not before been used by any
                    systematist, namely, that in the former group Monogamy generally prevailed and
                    the helpless nestlings were fed by their parents, while the latter group were
                    mostly Polygamous, and the chicks at birth were active and capable of feeding
                    themselves. This method, which in process of time was dignified by the title of
                    a Physiological Arrangement, was insisted upon with more or less pertinacity by
                    the author throughout a long series of publications, some of them separate
                    books, some of them contributed to the memoirs issued by many scientific bodies
                    of various European countries, ceasing only at his death, which in July 1857
                    found him occupied upon a <hi rend="italic">Conspectus Generum Avium,</hi> that
                    in consequence remains unfinished (see p. 14). In the course of this series,
                    however, he saw fit to alter the name of his two Subclasses, since those which
                    he at first adopted were open to a variety of meanings, and in a communication
                    to the French Academy of Sciences in 1853 <hi rend="italic">{Comptes

                    >Insessores</hi> was changed to <hi rend="italic">Altrices,</hi> and <hi

                    now preferred by him being taken from SundevalΓs treatise of 1835 already
                    mentioned. The views of Bonaparte were, it appears, also shared by an
                    ornithological amateur of some distinction, <hi rend="smallcaps">Hogg,</hi> who
                    propounded a scheme which, as he subsequently stated <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Zoologist,</hi> 1850, p. 2797), was founded strictly in accordance with them;
                    but it would seem that, allowing his convictions to be warped by other
                    considerations, he abandoned the original “physiological” basis of his system,
                    so that this, when published in 1846 <hi rend="italic">{Edinb. N.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Philosoph.</hi><hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> xli. pp. 50-71),
                    was found tobe established on a single character of the feet only; though he was
                    careful to point out, immediately after formulating the definition of his
                    Subclasses <hi rend="italic">Constrictipedes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inconstrictipedes,</hi> that the former ‘ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> make,
                    in general, compact and well-built nests, wherein they bring up their very weak,
                    blind, and mostly naked young, which they feed with care, by bringing food to
                    them for many days, until they are fledged and sufficiently strong to leave
                    their nest,” observing also that they “are principally monogamous” (pp. 55, 56);
                    while of the latter he says that they “make either a poor and rude nest, in
                    which they lay their eggs, or else none, depositing them on the bare ground. The
                    young are generally born with their full sight, covered with down, strong, and
                    capable of running or swimming immediately after they leave the egg-shell.” He
                    adds that the parents, which “are mostly polygamous,” attend their young and
                    direct them where to find their food (p. 63). The numerous errors in these
                    assertions hardly need pointing out. The Herons, for instance, are much more <hi
                    rend="italic">“Constrictipedes”</hi> than are the Larks or the Kingfishers, and,
                    so far from the majority of “<hi rend="italic">Inconstrictipedes”</hi> being
                    polygamous, there is scarcely any evidence of polygamy obtaining as a habit
                    among Birds in a state of nature except in certain of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >GaUinse</hi> and a very few others. Furthermore, the young of the Goatsuckers
                    are at hatching far more developed than are those of the Herons or the
                    Cormorants; and, in a general way, nearly every one of the asserted
                    peculiarities of the two Subclasses breaks down under careful examination, Yet
                    the idea of a “physiological” arrangement on the same kind of principle found
                    another follower, or, as he thought, inventor, in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Newman,</hi> who in 1850 communicated to the Zoological Society of London a
                    plan published in its <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for that year (pp.
                    46-48), and reprinted also in his own journal <hi rend="italic">The
                    Zoologist</hi> (pp. 2780-2782), based on exactly the same considerations,
                    dividing Birds into two groups, “Hesthogenous ”—a word so vicious in formation
                    as to be incapable of amendment, but intended to signify those that were hatched
                    with a clothing of down—and “Gymnogenous,” or those that were hatched naked.
                    These three systems are essentially identical; but, plausible as they may be at
                    the first aspect, they have been found to be practically useless, though such of
                    their characters as their upholders have advanced with truth deserve attention.
                    Physiology may one day very likely assist the systematist; but it must be real
                    physiology and not a sham.</p>

                    considerations are not very striking from a general point of view; but the
                    author adds to the weight of evidence which some of his predecessors had brought
                    to bear on certain matters, particularly in aiding to abolish the artificial
                    groups “Déodactyls,” “Syndactyls, ’’and “Zygodactyls,” on which so much reliance
                    had been placed by many of his countrymen; and it is with him a great merit that
                    he was the first apparently to recognize publicly that characters drawn from the
                    posterior part of the sternum, and particularly from the <hi rend="italic"

                    are of comparatively little importance, since their number is apt to vary in
                    forms that are most closely allied, and even in species that are usually
                    associated in the same genus or unquestionably belong to the same Family,<note

                    view of that group more correct according to modern notions than did most of his

                    Finally Divers, Auks, and Penguins, according to him, form the last term in the
                    series, and it seems fit to him that they should be regarded as forming a
                    separate Order. It is a curious fact that even at ä date so late as this, and by
                    an investigator so well informed, doubt should still have existed whether <hi
                    rend="italic">Apteryx</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Kiwi,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 104)
                    should be referred to the group containing the Cassowary and the Ostrich. On the
                    whole the remarks of this esteemed author do not go much beyond such as might
                    occur to any one who had made a study of a good series of specimens; but many of
                    them are published for the first time, and the author is careful to insist on
                    the necessity of not resting solely on sternal characters, but associating with
                    them those drawn from other parts of the body.</p>
                <p>Three years later in the same journal (xi. pp. 11-145, pls. 2-4) Μ. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Blanchard</hi> published some <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur
                    les caractères astrologiques des Oiseaux appliquées à la Classification
                    naturelle de ces animaux,</hi> strongly urging the superiority of such
                    characters over those drawn from the bill or feet, which, he remarks, though
                    they may have sometimes given correct notions, have mostly led to mistakes, and,
                    if observations of habits and food have sometimes afforded happy results, they
                    have often been deceptive; so that, should more be wanted than to draw up a mere
                    inventory of creation or trace the distinctive outline of each species, zoology
                    without anatomy would remain a barren study. At the same time he states that
                    authors who have occupied themselves with the sternum alone have often produced
                    uncertain results, especially when they have neglected its anterior for its
                    posterior part; for in truth every bone of the skeleton ought to be studied in
                    all its details. Yet this distinguished zoologist selects the sternum as
                    furnishing the key to his primary groups or “Orders” of the Class, adopting, as
                    Merrem had done long before, the same two divisions <hi rend="italic"

                    cited he treats of the sternum of only a portion of his first “Order.” This is
                    the more to be regretted by all ornithologists, since he intended to conclude
                    with what to them would have been a very great boon—the shewing in what way
                    external characters coincided with those presented by Osteology. It was also
                    within the scope of his plan to have continued on a more extended scale the
                    researches on ossification begun bv L’Herminier. and thus Μ.</p>

                <p>Blanchard’s investigations, if completed, would obviously have taken
                    extraordinarily high rank among the highest contributions to ornithology. As it
                    is, so much of them as we have are of considerable importance; for, in this
                    unfortunately unfinished memoir, he describes in some detail the several
                    differences which the sternum in a great many different groups of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Troρidostcrnii</hi> presents, and to some extent makes a
                    methodical disposition of them accordingly. Thus he separates the Birds-of-Prey
                    into three great groups—(1) the ordinary Diurnal forms, including the <hi
                    rend="italic">Falconidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vulturidae</hi> of the
                    systematist of his time, but distinguishing the American Vultures from those of

                    >Parrots</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> and then the vast assemblage of
                    “Passereaux ”—which he declares to be all of one type, even genera like <hi

                <p>Important as are the characters afforded by the sternum, that bone even with the
                    whole sternal apparatus should obviously not be considered alone. To aid
                    ornithologis's in their studies in this respect, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Eyton,</hi> who for many years had been forming a collection of Birds’
                    skeletons, began the publication of a scries of plates representing them. The

                    in 1859, and a volume was completed in 1867. A Supplement was issued in 1869,
                    and a Second Supplement, in three parts, between 1873 and 1875. The whole work
                    contains a great number of figures of Birds’ skeletons and detached bones; but
                    they aι⅛ not so drawn as to be of much practical use, and the accompanying
                    letter-press is too brief to be satisfactory.</p>
                <p>That the eggs laid by Birds should offer to some extent characters of utility to
                    systematists is only to be expected, when it is considered that those from the
                    same nest generally bear an extraordinary family-likeness to one another, and
                    also that in certain groups the essential peculiarities of the egg-shell are
                    constantly and distinctively characteristic. Thus no one who has ever examined
                    the egg of a Duck or of a Tinamou would ever be in danger of not referring
                    another Tinamou’s egg or another Duck’s, that he might see, to its proper
                    Family, and so on with many others. Yet, as has been stated on a former occasion
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 772), the expectation held out to
                    oologists, and by them, of the benefits to be conferred upon Systematic
                    Ornithology from the study of Birds’ eggs, so far from being fulfilled, has not
                    unfrequently led to disappointment. But at the same time many of the
                    shortcomings of Oology in this respect must be set down to the defective
                    information and observation of its votaries, among whom some have been very lax,
                    not to say incautious, in not ascertaining on due evidence the parentage of
                    their specimens, and the author next to be named is open to this charge. After
                    several minor notices that appeared in journals at various times, <hi

                    “Systema Oologicum” as the final result of his labours. In this scheme Birds are
                    arranged according to what the author considered to be their natural method and
                    sequence; but the result exhibits some unions as ill-assorted as can well be met
                    with in the whole range of tentative arrangements of the Class, together with
                    some very unjustifiable divorces. Its basis is the classification of Cuvier, the
                    modifications of which by Des Murs will seldom commend themselves to
                    systematists whose opinion is generally deemed worth having. Few, if any, of the
                    faults of that classification are removed, and the improvements suggested, if
                    not established by his successors, those especially of other countries than
                    France, are ignored, or, as is the case with some of those of L’Henninier, are
                    only cited to be set aside. Oologists have no reason to be thankful to Des Murs,
                    notwithstanding his zeal in behalf of their study. It is perfectly true that in
                    several or even in many instances he acknowledges and deplores the poverty of
                    his information, but this does not excuse him for making assertions (and such
                    assertions are not unfrequent) based on evidence that is either wholly
                    untrustworthy or needs further enquiry before it can be accepted <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1860, pp. 331-335). This being the case, it would seem
                    useless to take up further space by analysing the several proposed modifications
                    of Cuvier’s arrangement. The great merit of the work is that the author shews
                    the necessitj’ of taking Oology into account when investigating the
                    classification of Birds; but it also proves that in so doing the paramount
                    consideration lies in the thorough sifting of evidence as to the parentage of
                    the eggs which are to serve as the building stones of the fabric to be erected.
                    The attempt of Des Murs was praiseworthy; but in effect it has utterly failed,
                    notwithstanding the encomiums passed upon it by friendly critics <hi

                <p>Until about this time systematists, almost without exception, may be said to have
                    been wandering with no definite purpose. At least their purpose was indefinite
                    compared with that which they now have before them. No doubt they all agreed in
                    saying that they were prosecuting a search for what they called the True System
                    of Nature; but that was nearly the end of their agreement, for in what that True
                    System consisted the opinions of scarcely any two would coincide, unless to own
                    that it was some shadowy idea beyond the present power of mortals to reach or
                    even comprehend. The Quinarians, who boldly asserted that they had fathomed the
                    mystery of Creation, had been shewn to be no wiser than other men, if indeed
                    they had not utterly befooled themselves; for their theory at best could give no
                    other explanation of things than that they were because they were. The
                    conception of such a process as has now come to be called by the name of
                    Evolution was certainly not novel; but except to two men the way in which that
                    process was or could be possible had not been revealed.<note anchored="true"

                    following year of the former’s <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species,</hi> which
                    has effected the greatest revolution of human thought in this or perhaps in any
                    century. The majority of biologists who had schooled themselves on other
                    principles were of course slow to embrace the new doctrine; but their hesitation
                    was only the natural consequence of the caution which their scientific training
                    enjoined. A few there were who felt as though scales had suddenly dropped from
                    their eyes, when greeted by the idea conveyed in the now familiar phrase
                    “Natural Selection”; but even those who had hitherto believed, and still
                    continued to believe, in the sanctity of “Species” at once perceived that their
                    life-long study had undergone a change, that their old position was seriously
                    threatened by a perilous siege, and that to make it good they must find new
                    means of defence. Many bravely maintained their posts, and for them not a word
                    of blame ought to be expressed. Some few pretended, though the contrary was
                    notorious, that they had always been on the side of the new philosophy, so far
                    as they allowed it to be philosophy at all, and for them hardly a word of blame
                    is too severe. Others after due deliberation, as became men who honestly desired
                    the truth and nothing but the truth, yielded wholly or almost wholly to
                    arguments which they gradually found to be irresistible. But, leaving
                    generalities apart, and restricting ourselves to what is here our proper
                    business, there was possibly no branch of Zoology in which so many of the best
                    informed and consequently the most advanced of its workers sooner accepted the
                    principles of Evolution than Ornithology, and of course the effect upon its
                    study was very marked. New spirit was given to it. Ornithologists now felt they
                    had something before them that was really worth investigating. Questions of
                    Affinity, and the details of Geographical Distribution, were endowed with a real
                    interest, in comparison with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n42/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0042-0033"/> which any interest that had hitherto been taken
                    was a trifling pastime. Classification assumed a wholly different aspect. It had
                    up to this time been little more than the shuffling of cards, the ingenious
                    arrangement of counters in a pretty pattern. Henceforward it was to be the
                    serious study of the workings of Nature in producing the beings we see around us
                    from beings more or less unlike them, that had existed in bygone ages and had
                    been the parents of a varied and varying offspring—our fellow-creatures of
                    today. Classification for the first time was something more than the expression
                    of a fancy, not that it had not also its imaginative side. Men’s minds began to
                    figure to themselves the original type of some well-marked genus or Family of
                    Birds. They could even discern dimly some generalized stock whence had descended
                    whole groups that now differed strangely in habits and appearance—their
                    discernment aided, may be, by some isolated form which yet retained undeniable
                    traces of a primitive structure. More dimly still visions of what the first Bird
                    may have been like could be reasonably entertained; and, passing even to a
                    higher antiquity, the Reptilian parent whence all Birds have sprung was brought
                    within reach of man’s consciousness. But, relieved as it may be by reflexions of
                    this kind—dreams some may perhaps still call them—the study of Ornithology has
                    unquestionably become harder and more serious; and a corresponding change in the
                    style of investigation, followed in the works that remain to be considered, will
                    be immediately perceptible.</p>
                <p>That this was the case is undeniably shewn by some remarks of Canon <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tristram,</hi> who, in treating of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alaudidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Saxicolinae</hi> of Algeria (whence he
                    had recently brought a large collection of specimens of his own making), stated
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1859, pp. 429-433) that he could <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> not help feeling convinced of the truth of the views
                    set forth by Messrs Darwin and Wallace,” adding that it was “hardly possible, I
                    should think, to illustrate this theory better than by the Larks and Chats of
                    North Africa.” It is unnecessary to continue the quotation; the few words just
                    cited are enough to assure to their author the credit of being (so far as is
                    known) the first ornithological specialist who had the courage publicly to
                    recognize and receive the new and at that time unpopular philosophy.<note

                    was at hand. In June 1860 Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps">Parker</hi> broke, as most
                    will allow, entirely fresh ground, and ground that he has since continued to
                    till more deeply perhaps than any other zoologist, by communicating to the
                    Zoological Society a memoir “On the Osteology of <hi rend="italic"

                    >Transactions</hi> (iv. pp. 269-351). Of this contribution to science, as of all
                    the rest which have since proceeded from him, may be said in the words he
                    himself has applied <hi rend="italic">(ut supra,</hi> p. 271) to the work of
                    another labourer in a not distant field :—“This is a model paper for unbiassed
                    observation, and freedom from that pleasant mode of <hi rend="italic"

                    limited though it be in scope, could not fail to convince any one that it
                    proceeded from the mind of one who taught with the authority derived directly
                    from original knowledge, and not from association with the scribes—a conviction
                    that has become strengthened as, in a series of successive memoirs, the stores
                    of more than twenty years’ silent observation and unremitting research were
                    unfolded, and, more than that, the hidden forces of the science of Morphology
                    were gradually brought to bear upon almost each subject that came under
                    discussion. These different memoirs, being technically monographs, have strictly
                    no right to be mentioned in this place; but there is scarcely one of them, if
                    one indeed there be, that does not deal with the generalities of the study; and
                    the influence they have had upon contemporary investigation is so strong that it

                    copiously illustrated by plates from drawings made by the author
                    himself.</p></note> Moreover, the doctrine of Descent with variation is preached
                    in all—seldom, if ever, conspicuously, but perhaps all the more effectively on
                    that account. There is no reflective thinker but must perceive that Morphology
                    is the lamp destined to throw more light than that afforded by any other kind of
                    study on the obscurity that still shrouds the genealogy of Birds as of other
                    animals; and, though as yet its illuminating power is admittedly far from what
                    is desired, it has perhaps never shone more brightly than in Prof. Parker’s
                    hands. The great fault of his series of memoirs, if it may be allowed the
                    present writer to criticize them, is the indifference of their author to
                    formulating his views, so as to enable the ordinary taxonomer to perceive how
                    far he has got, if not to present him with a fair scheme. But this fault is
                    possibly one of those that are “to merit near allied,” since it would seem to
                    spring from the author’s hesitation to pass from observation to theory, for to

                    Classification. Still it is not the less annoying and disappointing to the
                    systematist to find that the man whose life-long application would enable him,
                    better than any one else, to declare the effect of the alliances and differences
                    that have been shewn to exist among various members of the Class should yet be
                    so reticent, or that when he speaks he should rather use the language of
                    Morphology, which those who are not morphologists find difficult of correct
                    interpretation, and wholly inadequate to allow of zoological deductions<note

                    Munich <hi rend="italic">(Sitzungsberichte,</hi> pp. 146-154; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ann. Nat. History,</hi> ser. 3, ix. pp. 261-267) an account of what he
                    conceived to be a feathered Reptile (assigning to it the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Griphosaurus∖</hi> the remains of which had been found in the lithographic beds
                    of Solenhofen; but he himself, through failing health, had been unable to see
                    the fossil. In 1862 the slabs containing the remains were acquired by the
                    British Museum, and towards the end of that year Sir R. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Owen</hi> communicated a detailed description of them to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> (1863, pp. 33-47), proving their Bird-like
                    nature, and referring them to the genus <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> of
                    Hermann von Meyer, hitherto known only by the impression of a single feather
                    from the same geological beds. Wagner foresaw the use that would be made of this
                    discovery by the adherents of the new Philosophy, and, in the usual language of
                    its opponents at the time, strove to ward off the “misinterpretations” that they
                    would put upon it. His protest, it is needless to say, was unavailing, and all
                    who respect his memory must regret that the sunset of life failed to give him
                    that insight into the future which is poetically ascribed to it. To Darwin and
                    those who believed with him scarcely any discovery could have been more welcome;
                    but that is beside our present business. It was quickly seen—even by those who
                    held <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> to be a Reptile —that it was a form
                    intermediate between existing Birds and existing Reptiles—while those who were
                    convinced by Sir R. Owen’s researches of its ornithic affinity saw that it must
                    belong to a type of Birds wholly unknown before, and one that in any future for
                    the arrangement of the Class must have a special rank reserved for it.<note

                <p>It behoves us next to mention the “Outlines of a Systematic Review of the Class
                    of Birds,” communicated by Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lilljeborg</hi> to the
                    Zoological Society in 1866, and published in its <hi rend="italic">Proceedings
                    for</hi> that year (pp. 5-20), since it was immediately after reprinted by the
                    Smithsonian Institution, and with that authorization has exercised a great
                    influence on the opinions of American ornithologists. Otherwise the scheme would
                    hardly need notice here. This paper is indeed little more than an English
                    trapslation of one published by the author in the annual volume <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ârsskrift)</hi> of the Scientific Society of Upsala for 1860, and
                    belonging to the preDarwinian epoch should perhaps have been more properly
                    treated before, but that at the time of its original appearance it failed to
                    attract attention. The chief merit of the scheme perhaps is that, contrary to
                    nearly every precedent, it begins with the lower and rises to the higher groups
                    of Birds, which is of course the natural mode of proceeding, and one therefore
                    to be commended. Otherwise the “principles” on which it is founded are not clear
                    to the ordinary zoologist. One of them is said to be “irritability,” and, though
                    this is explained to mean, not “muscular strength alone, but vivacity and
                    activity generally,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On
                    this ground it is stated that the <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> should be
                    placed highest in the Class. But those who know the habits and demeanour of many
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Limicolae</hi> would no doubt rightly claim for them
                    much more “vivacity and activity” than is possessed by most <hi rend="italic"

                    easily appreciated either as to quantity or quality; in fact, most persons would
                    deem it quite immeasurable, and, as such, removed from practical consideration.
                    Moreover, Prof. Lilljeborg’s scheme, being actually an adaptation of that of
                    Sundevall, of which we shall have to speak at some length almost immediately,
                    may possibly be left for the present with these remarks.</p>
                <p>In the spring pf the year 1867 Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps">Huxley,</hi> to the
                    delight of an appreciative audience, delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons
                    of England a course of lèctures on Birds, and it is much to be regretted that
                    his many engagements hindered him from publishing in its entirety his
                    elucidation of the anatomy of the Class, and the results which he drew from his
                    investigations of it; for never assuredly had the subject been attacked with
                    greater skill and power, or, since the days Buffon, had Ornithology been set
                    forth with greater eloquence. To remedy, in some degree, this unavoidable loss,
                    and to preserve at least a portion of the fruits of his labours, Prof. Huxley, a
                    few weeks after, presented an abstract of his researches to the Zoological
                    Society, in whose <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for the same year it will
                    be found printed (pp. 415-472) as a paper “On the Classification of Birds, and
                    on the taxonomic value of the modifications of certain of the cranial bones
                    observable in that Class.” Starting from the basis (which, undeniably true as it
                    is, not a little shocked many of his ornithological hearers) “that the phrase ‘
                    Birds are greatly modified Reptiles ’ would hardly be an exaggerated expression
                    of the closeness <hi rend="italic">” of</hi> the resemblance between the two
                    Classes, which he had previously brigaded under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sauropsida</hi> (as he had brigaded the <hi rend="italic">Pisces</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">A nιphibia</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Ichthyopsida'),</hi> he drew
                    in bold outline both their likenesses and their differences, and then proceeded
                    to inquire how the <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> could be most appropriately
                    subdivided into Orders, Suborders, and Families. In this course of lectures he
                    had already dwelt at some length on the insufficiency of the characters on which
                    such groups as had hitherto been thought to be established were founded; but for
                    the consideration of this part of his subject there was no room in the present
                    paper, and the reasons why he arrived at the conclusion that new means of
                    philosophically and successfully separating the Class must be sought are herein
                    left to be inferred. The upshot, however, admits of no uncertainty: the Class
                    <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> is held to be composed of <hi rend="italic">three
                    “</hi> Orders ”—(I.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Saururae,</hi> Häckel; (II.) <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ratitae,</hi> Μ errem; and (III.) <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Carinatae,</hi> Merrem. The <hi rend="italic">Saururae</hi> have the
                    metacarpals well developed and not ancylosed, and the caudal vertebrae are
                    numerous and large, so that the caudal region of the spine is longer than the
                    body. The furcula is complete and strong, the feet very Passerine in appearance.
                    The skull and sternum were at the time unknown, and indeed the whole Order,
                    without doubt entirely extinct, rested exclusively on the celebrated fossil,
                    then unique, <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Birds,</hi> vol. iii. pp. 728, 729). The <hi rend="italic">Ratitae</hi>
                    comprehend the Struthious Birds, which differ from all others now extant in the
                    combination of several peculiarities, some of which have been mentioned in the
                    preceding pages. The sternum has no keel, and ossifies from lateral and paired
                    centres only; the axes of the scapula and coracoid have the same general
                    direction; certain of the cranial bones have characters very unlike those
                    possessed by the next Order—the vomer, for example, being broad posteriorly and
                    generally intervening between the basisphenoidal rostrum and the palatals and
                    pterygoids; the barbs of the feathers are disconnected; there is no syrinx or
                    inferior larynx; and the diaphragm is better developed than in other Birds.<note

                    vomer is broad, abruptly truncated in front, and deeply cleft behind, so as to
                    embrace the rostrum of the sphenoid; the palatals have produced postero-external
                    angles; the maxillo-palatals are slender at their origin, and extend obliquely
                    inwards and forwards over the palatals, ending beneath the vomer in expanded

                    remarkable contribution to Ornithology, and it has to be added that for by far
                    the greater number of his minor groups Prof. Huxley relies solely on the form of
                    the palatal structure, the importance of which Dr Cornay, as already stated (p.
                    29), had before urged, though to so little purpose. That the palatal structure
                    must be taken into consideration by taxonomers as affording hints of some
                    utility there can no longer be a doubt; but the present writer is inclined to
                    think that the characters drawn thence owe more of their worth to the
                    extraordinary perspicuity with which they have been presented by Prof. Huxley
                    than to their own intrinsic value, and that if the same power had been employed
                    to elucidate in the same way other parts of the skeleton—say the bones of the
                    sternal apparatus or even of the pelvic girdle—either set could have been made
                    to appear quite as instructive and perhaps more so. Adventitious value would
                    therefore seem to have been acquired by the bones of the palate through the fact
                    that so great a master of the art of exposition selected them as fitting
                    examples upon which to exercise his skill.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The notion of the superiority of the palatal bones to all
                    others for purposes of classification has pleased many persons, from the fact
                    that these bones are not unfrequently retained in the dried skins of Birds sent
                    home by collectors in foreign countries, and are therefore available for study,
                    while such bones as the sternum and pelvis are rarely preserved. The common
                    practice of ordinary collectors, until at least very recently, has been tersely
                    described to the present writer as being to “shoot a bird, take off its skin,
                    and throw away its characters.”</p></note> At the same time it must be stated
                    this selection was not premeditated by Prof. Huxley, but forced itself upon him
                    as his investigations proceeded.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Perhaps this may be partially explained by the fact that the
                    Museum of the College of Surgeons, in which these investigations were chiefly
                    carried on, like most other museums of the time, contained a much larger series
                    of the heads of Birds than of their entire skeletons, or of any other portion of
                    the skeleton. Consequently the materials available for the comparison of
                    different forms consisted in great part of heads only.</p></note> In reply to
                    some critical remarks <hi rend="italic">{Ibis,</hi> 1868, pp. 85-96), chiefly
                    aimed at shewing the inexpediency of relying solely on one set of characters,
                    especially when those afforded by the palatal bones were not, even within the

                <p>The above scheme, in Prof. Huxley’s opinion, nearly represents the affinities of

                    hypothetic fashion.” Almost simultaneously with this he expounded more
                    particularly before the Zoological Society, in whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proceedings</hi> (1868, pp. 294-319) his results were soon after published, the
                    groups of which he believed the <hi rend="italic">Aledoramorphae</hi> to be
                    composed and the relations to them of some outlying forms usually regarded as
                    Gallinaceous, the <hi rend="italic">Tumicidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pteroclidae,</hi> as well as the singular <hi rend="smallcaps">Hoactzin</hi>
                    (vol. xii. p. 28), for all three of which he had to institute new groups—the

                    >Heteromorphae.</hi> More than this, he entered upon their Geographical
                    Distribution, the facts of which important subject are here, almost for the
                    first time, since the attempt of Blyth already mentioned,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is true that from the time of Buffon,
                    though lie scorned any regular Classification, Geographical Distribution had
                    been occasionally held to have something to do with systematic arrangement; but
                    the way in which the two were related was never clearly put forth, though people
                    who could read between the lines might have guessed the secret from Darwin’s <hi

                    been already treated at some length, there is no need to enter upon it here.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless it is necessary to mention here «he intimate connexion between
                    Classification and Geographical Distribution as revealed by the palaeontological
                    researches of Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonse Milne-Edwards,</hi> whose
                    magnificent <hi rend="italic">Oiseaux Fossiles de la France,</hi> began to
                    appear in 1867, and was completed in 1871—the more so, since the exigencies of
                    his undertaking compelled him to use materials that had been almost wholly
                    neglected by other investigators. A large proportion of the fossil remains the
                    determination and description of which was his object were what are very
                    commonly called the <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> long bones,” that is to say,
                    those of the limbs. The recognition of these, minute and fragmentary as many
                    were, and the referring them to their proper place, rendered necessary an
                    attentive study of the comparative osteology and myology of Birds in general,
                    that of the “long bones,” whose sole characters were often a few muscular ridges
                    or depressions, being especially obligatory. Hence it became manifest that a
                    very respectable Classification can be found in which characters drawn from
                    these bones play a rather important part. Limited by circumstances as is that
                    followed by Μ. Milne-Edwards, the details of his arrangement do not require
                    setting forth here. It is enough to point out that we have in his work another
                    proof of the multiplicity of the factors which must be taken into consideration
                    by the systematist, and another proof of the fallacy of trusting to one set of
                    characters alone. But this is not the only way in which the author has rendered
                    service to the advanced student of Orni thology. The unlooked-for discovery in
                    France of remains which he has referred to forms now existing it is true, but
                    existing only in countries far removed from Europe, forms such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Collocalia, Leptosomus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Psittacus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Serpentarius,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trogon,</hi> is perhaps
                    even more suggestive than the finding that France was once inhabited by forms
                    that are wholly extinct, of which, as has been already mentioned <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii. pp. 730, 731), in the older formations
                    there is abundance. Unfortunately none of these, however, can be compared for
                    singularity with <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> or with some American
                    fossil forms next to be noticed, for their particular bearing on our knowledge
                    of Ornithology will be most conveniently treated here.</p>
                <p>In November 1870 Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps">Marsh,</hi> by finding the imperfect

                    and, making us acquainted with a great number of forms long since vanished from
                    among the earth’s inhabitants, has thrown a comparatively broad beam of light
                    upon the darkness that, broken only by the. solitary spark emitted on the
                    recognition of <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx,</hi> had hitherto brooded over
                    our knowledge of the genealogy of Birds, and is even now for the most part
                    palpable. Subsequent visits to the same part of North America, often performed
                    under circumstances of discomfort and occasionally of danger, brought to this
                    intrepid and energetic explorer the reward he had so fully earned. Brief notices
                    of his spoils appeared from time to time in various volumes of the <hi
                    rend="italic">American Journal of Science and Arts</hi> (Silliman’s), but it is
                    unnecessary here to refer to more than a few of them. In that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal</hi> for May 1872 (ser. 3, iii. p. 360) the remains of a large swimming
                    Bird (nearly 6 feet in length, as afterwards appeared) having some affinity, it
                    was thought, to the <hi rend="italic">Colymbidae</hi> were described under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Hesperomis</hi><hi rend="italic">regalis,</hi> and a
                    few months later (iv. p. 344) a second fossil Bird from the same locality was
                    indicated as <hi rend="italic">Ichthyomis dispar—</hi> from the Fish-like,
                    biconcave form of its vertebrae. Further examination of the enormous collections
                    gathered by the author, and preserved in the Museum of Yale College at New Haven
                    in Connecticut, shewed him that this last Bird, and another to which he gave the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Apatomis,</hi> had possessed well-developed teeth
                    implanted in sockets in both jaws, and induced him to establish (v. pp. 161,
                    162) for their reception a “Subclass” <hi rend="italic">Odontornithes</hi> and
                    an Order <hi rend="italic">Ichthyornithes.</hi> Two years more and the
                    originally found <hi rend="italic">Hesperomis</hi> was discovered also to have
                    teeth, but these were inserted in a groove. It was accordingly regarded as the
                    type of a distinct Order <hi rend="italic">Odontolcae</hi> (x. pp. 403-408), to
                    which were assigned as other characters vertebrae of a saddle-shape and not
                    biconcave, a keelless sternum, and wings consisting only of the humerus. In 1880
                    Prof. Marsh brought out a grand volume, <hi rend="italic">Odontomithes,</hi>
                    being a monograph of the extinct toothed Birds of North America. Herein remains,
                    attributed to no fewer than a score of species, which were referred to eight
                    different genera, are fully described and sufficiently illustrated, and, instead
                    of the ordinal name <hi rend="italic">Ichthyornithes</hi> previously used, that
                    of <hi rend="italic">OdonU&gt;tormse</hi> was proposed. In the author’s
                    concluding summary he remarks on the fact that, while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odontolcae,</hi> as exhibited in <hi rend="italic">Hesperomis,</hi> had teeth
                    inserted in a continuous groove—a low and generalized character as shewn by
                    Reptiles, they had, however, the strongly differentiated saddle-shaped vertebrae
                    such as all modern Birds possess. On the other hand the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odontotormae,</hi> as exemplified in <hi rend="italic">Ichthyomis,</hi> having
                    the primitive biconcave vertebrae, vet possessed the highly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n46/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0046-0037"/> specialized feature of teeth in distinct sockets,
                    <hi rend="italic">llesperomis</hi> too, with its keelless sternum, had aborted
                    wings but strong legs and feet adapted for swimming, while <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ichthyomis</hi> had a keeled sternum and powerful wings, but diminutive legs
                    and feet. These and other characters separate the two forms so widely as quite
                    to justify the establishment of as many Orders for their reception, and the
                    opposite nature of the evidence they afford illustrates one fundamental
                    principle of evolution, namely, that an animal may attain to great development
                    of one set of characters and at the same time retain other features of a low
                    ancestral type. Prof. Marsh states that he had fully satisfied himself that <hi
                    rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> belonged to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odontornith.es</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> which he thought it advisable for
                    the present to regard as a Subclass, separated into three Orders— <hi
                    rend="italic">Odontolcae, Odontotormae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saururae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> all well marked, but evidently not of
                    equal rank, the last being clearly much more widely distinguished from the first
                    two than they are from one another. But that these three oldest-known forms of
                    Birds should differ so greatly from each other unmistakably points to a great
                    antiquity for the Class. All are true Birds; but the Reptilian characters they
                    possess converge towards a more generalized type. He then proceeds to treat of
                    the characters which may be expected to have occurred in their common ancestor,
                    whose remains may yet be hoped for from the Palaeozoic rocks if not from the
                    Permian beds that in North America are so rich in the fossils of a terrestrial
                    fauna. Birds, be believes, branched off by a single stem, which gradually lost
                    its Reptilian as it assumed the Ornithic type; and in the existing <hi
                    rend="italic">Ratitae</hi> we have the survivors of this direct line. The lineal
                    descendants of this primal stock doubtless at an early time attained feathers
                    and warm blood, but, in his opinion, never acquired the power of flight, which
                    probably originated among the small arboreal forms of Reptilian Birds. In them
                    even rudimentary feathers on the fore-limbs would be an advantage, as they would
                    tend to lengthen a leap from branch to branch, or break the force of a fall in
                    leaping to the ground. As the feathers increased, the body would become warmer
                    and the blood more active. With still more feathers would come increased power
                    of flight as we see in the young Birds of to-day. A greater activity would
                    result in a more perfect circulation. A true Bird would doubtless require warm
                    blood, but would not necessarily be hot-blooded, like the Birds now living.
                    Whether <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> was on the true Carinate line
                    cannot as yet be determined, and this is also true of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ichthyomis</hi>; but the biconcave vertebrae of the latter suggest its being an
                    early offshoot, while it is probable that <hi rend="italic">Hesperornis</hi>
                    came off from the main “Struthious” stem and has left no descendants.</p>
                <p>Bold as are the speculations above summarized, there seems no reason to doubt the
                    probability of their turning out to be, if not the exact truth, yet something
                    very like it.</p>
                <p>From this bright vision of the poetic past—a glimpse, some may call it, into the
                    land of dreams—we must relapse into a sober contemplation of the prosaic
                    present— a subject quite as difficult to understand. The former efforts at
                    classification made by Sundevall have already several times been mentioned, and
                    a return to their consideration was promised. In 1872 and 1873 he brought out at
                    Stockholm a <hi rend="italic">Methodi Naturalis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Avium</hi><hi rend="italic">Disponendarum Tentamen,</hi> two portions of which
                    (those relating to the Diurnal Birds-of-Prey and the “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Cichlomorphae,”</hi> or forms related to the Thrushes) he found himself under
                    the necessity of revising and modifying in the course of 1874, in as many
                    communications to the Swedish Academy of Sciences (W. <hi rend="italic">V.-Ak.
                    Förhandlingar,</hi> 1874, No. 2, pp. 21-30; No. 3, pp. 27-30). This <hi
                    rend="italic">Tentamen,</hi> containing the latest complete method of
                    classifying Birds in general, has naturally received much attention, the more so
                    perhaps, since, with its appendices, it was nearly the last labour of its
                    respected author, whose industrious life came to an end in the course of the
                    following year. From what has before been said of his works it may have been
                    gathered that, while professedly basing his systematic arrangement of the groups
                    of Birds on their external features, he had hitherto striven to make his schemes
                    harmonize if possible with the dictates of internal structure as evinced by the
                    science of anatomy, though he uniformly and persistently protested against the
                    inside being better than the outside. In thus acting he proved himself a true
                    follower of his great countryman Linnaeus; but, without disparagement of his
                    efforts in this respect, it must be said that when internal and external
                    characters appeared to be in conflict he gave, perhaps with unconscious bias, a
                    preference to the latter, for he belonged to a school of zoologists whose
                    natural instinct was to believe that such a conflict always existed. Hence his
                    efforts, praiseworthy as they were from several points of view, and particularly
                    so in regard to some details, failed to satisfy the philosophic taxonomer when
                    generalizations and deeper principles were concerned, and in his practice in
                    respect of certain technicalities of classification he was, in the eyes of the
                    orthodox, a transgressor. Thus instead of contenting himself with terms that had
                    met with pretty general approval, such as Class, Subclass, Order, Suborder,
                    Family, Subfamily, and so on, he introduced into his final scheme other
                    designations, “Agmen,” “Cohors,” “Phalanx,” and the like, which to the ordinary
                    student of Ornithology convey an indefinite meaning, if any meaning at all. He
                    also carried to a very extreme limit his views of nomenclature, which were
                    certainly not in accordance with those held by most zoologists, though this is a
                    matter so trifling as to need no details in illustration. It is by no means easy
                    to set forth briefly, and at the same time intelligibly, to any but experts, the
                    final scheme of Sundevall, owing to the number of new names introduced by him,
                    nevertheless the attempt must be made; but it must be understood that in the
                    following paradigm, in which his later modifications are incorporated, only the
                    most remarkable or best-known forms are cited as examples of his several groups,
                    for to give the whole of them would, if any explanations were added, occupy far
                    more space than the occasion seems to justify, and without such explanations the
                    list would be of use only to experts, who would rather consult the original
                    work.</p>
                <p>First, Sundevall would still make two grand divisions (“Agmina ”) of Birds, even
                    as had been done nearly forty years before; but, having found that the names,
                    <hi rend="italic">Altrices</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Praecoces,</hi> he had
                    formerly used were not always applicable, or the groups thereby indicated
                    naturally disposed, he at first distinguished them as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psilopaedes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ptüopaedes.</hi> Then, seeing that the
                    great similarity of these two words would produce confusion both in speaking and
                    writing, he changed them (p. 158) into the equivalent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnopaedes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dαsypaedes,</hi> according as the young
                    were hatched naked or clothed. The <hi rend="italic">Gymnopaedes</hi> are
                    divided into two “Orders”— <hi rend="italic">Oscines</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Volucres</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the former intended to be identical with
                    the group of the same name established by older authors, and, in accordance with
                    the observations of Keyserling and Blasius already mentioned, divided into two
                    “Series”— <hi rend="italic">Lαminiplαntαres,</hi> having the hinder part of the

                    separated into 4 “Cohorts” in his original work, but these were reduced in his

                    Cohorts— <hi rend="italic">Veri</hi> with 2 Families, Ostriches and Emeus; and
                    <hi rend="italic">Subnobiles,</hi> consisting of the genus <hi rend="italic"

                    >Saururse.</hi></p>
                <p>Such then is Sundevall’s perfected system, which has in various quarters been so
                    much praised, and has been partially recognized by so many succeeding writers,
                    that it would have been impossible to pass it over here, though the present
                    writer is confident that the best-informed ornithologists will agree with him in
                    thinking that the compilation of the above abstract has been but so much waste
                    of time, and its insertion here but so much waste of space. Without, however,
                    some such abstract its shortcomings could not be made aj&gt;parent, and it will
                    be seen to what little purpose so many able men have laboured if arrangement and
                    grouping so manifestly artificial—the latter often of forms possessing no real
                    affinity—can pass as a natural method. We should be too sanguine to hope that it
                    may be the last of its kind, yet any one accustomed to look deeper than the
                    surface must see its numerous defects, and almost every one, whether so
                    accustomed or not, ought by its means to be brought to the conclusion that, when
                    a man of Sundevall’s knowledge and experience <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n48/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0048-0039"/> could not, by trusting only to external
                    characters, do better than this, the most convincing proof is afforded of the
                    inability of external characters alone to produce anything save ataxy. The
                    principal merits it possesses are confined to the minor arrangement of some of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Oscines;</hi> but even here many of the alliances, such,
                    for instance, as that of <hi rend="italic">Pitta</hi> with the true Thrushes,
                    are indefensible on any rational grounds, and some, as that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Accentor</hi> with the Weaver-birds and Whydah-birds, verge upon the
                    ridiculous, while on the other hand the interpolation of the American
                    Fly-catching Warblers, <hi rend="italic">Mniotiltidae,</hi> between the normal
                    Warblers of the Old World and the Thrushes is as bad—especially when the genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Mniotilta</hi> is placed, notwithstanding its different
                    wing-formula, with the Tree-creepers, <hi rend="italic">Certhiidae.</hi> The
                    whole work unfortunately betrays throughout an utter want of the sense of
                    proportion. In many of the large groups the effect of very slight differences is
                    to keep the forms exhibiting them widely apart, while in most of the smaller
                    groups differences of far greater kind are overlooked, so that the forms which
                    present them are linked together in more or less close union. Thus, regarding
                    only external characters, great as is the structural distinction between the
                    Gannets, Cormorants, Frigate-birds, and Pelicans, it is not held to remove them
                    from the limits of a single Family; and yet the Thrushes and the Chats, whose
                    distinctions are barely sensible, are placed in separate Families, as are also
                    the Chats and the Nightingales, wherein no structural distinctions at all can be
                    traced. Again, even in one and the same group the equalization of characters
                    indicative of Families is wholly neglected. Thus among the Pigeons the genera
                    <hi rend="italic">Didus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Didunculus,</hi> which
                    differ, so far as we know it, in every external character of their structure,
                    are placed in one Family, and yet on the slightest pretext the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Goura,</hi> which in all respects so intimately resembles ordinary
                    Pigeons, is set apart as the representative of a distinct Family. The only use
                    of dwelling upon these imperfections here is the hope that thereby students of
                    Ornithology may be induced to abandon the belief in the efficacy of external
                    characters as a sole means of classification, and, by seeing how unmanageable
                    they become unless checked by internal characters, be persuaded of the futility
                    of any attempt to form an arrangement without that solid foundation which can
                    only be obtained by a knowledge of anatomy. Where Sundevall failed no one else
                    is likely to succeed; for he was a man gifted with intelligence of a rare order,
                    a man of cultivation and learning, one who had devoted his whole life to
                    science, who had travelled much, studied much and reflected much, a man whose
                    acquaintance with the literature of his subject probably exceeded that of any of
                    his contemporaries, and a man whose linguistic attainments rendered him the envy
                    of his many friends. Yet what should have been the crowning work of his long
                    life is one that all who respected him, and that comprehends all who knew him,
                    must regret.</p>

                    Ornithology has rarely been equalled and perhaps never surpassed. The present
                    writer finds it difficult to treat of the labours of two pupils and friends from
                    whose assistance he had originally hoped to profit in the preparation of this
                    very article, the more so that, while fully recognizing the brilliant nature of
                    some of their researches, he is compelled very frequently to dissent from the
                    conclusions at which they arrived, deeming them to have often been of a kind
                    that, had their authors survived to a maturer age, they would have greatly
                    modified. Still he well knows that learners are mostly wiser than their
                    teachers; and, making due allowance for the haste with which, from the
                    exigencies of the post they successively held, their investigations had usually
                    to be published, he believes that much of the highest value underlies even the
                    crudest conjectures contained in their several contributions to Ornithology.

                    having a more general scope, all published in the Zoological Society’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Proceedings,</hi> may be briefly considered. Starting from the
                    level reached by Prof. Huxley, the first attempt made by the younger
                    investigator was in 1873, “On the value in Classification of a Peculiarity in
                    the anterior margin of the Nasal Bones in certain Birds.” Herein he strove to
                    prove that Birds ought to be divided into two Subclasses—one, called
                    “Holorhinal,” in which a straight line drawn transversely across the hindmost
                    points of the external narial apertures passes in front of the posterior ends of
                    the nasal processes of the praemaxillae, and the other, called “Schizorhinal,”
                    in which such a line passes behind those processes. If this be used as a
                    criterion, the validity of Prof. Huxley’s group <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schizognathae</hi> is shaken; but there is no need to enlarge upon the
                    proposal, for it was virtually abandoned by its author within little more than a
                    twelvemonth. The next subject in connexion with Systematic Ornithology to which
                    Garrod applied himself was an investigation of the Carotid Arteries, and here,
                    in the same year, he made a considerable advance upon the labours of Nitzsch, as
                    might well be expected, for the opportunities of the latter were very limited,
                    and he was only able, as we have seen (page 22), to adduce four types of
                    structure in them, while Garrod, with the superior advantages of his situation,
                    raised the number to six. Nevertheless he remarks that their “disposition has
                    not much significance among Birds, there being many Families in which, whilst
                    the majority of the species have two, some have only one carotid.” The
                    exceptional cases cited by him are quite sufficient to prove that the condition
                    of this artery has nearly no value from the point of view of general
                    classification. If relied upon it would split up the Families <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bucerotidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cypselidae,</hi> which no sane person
                    would doubt to be homogeneous and natural. The femoral vessels formed another
                    subject of investigation, and were found to exhibit as much exceptional
                    conformation as those of the neck—for instance in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Centropus</hi><hi rend="italic">phasianus,</hi> one of the Birds known as
                    Coucals, the femoral artery accompanies the femoral vein, though it does not do
                    so in another species of the genus, <hi rend="italic">C. rufipennis,</hi> nor in
                    any other of the <hi rend="italic">Cuculidae</hi> (to which Family the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Centropus</hi> has been always assigned) examined by Garrod. Nor
                    are the results of the very great labour which he bestowed upon the muscular
                    conformation of the thigh in Birds any more conclusive when they come to be
                    impartially and carefully considered. Myology was with him always a favourite
                    study, and he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n49/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0049-0040"/> may be not unreasonably supposed to have a strong
                    feeling as to its efficacy for systematic ends. It was in favour of an
                    arrangement based upon the muscles of the thigh, and elaborated by him in 1874,
                    that he gave up the arrangement he had published barely more than a year before
                    based upon the conformation of the nostrils. Nevertheless it appears that even
                    the later of the two methods did not eventually content him, and this was only
                    to be expected, though he is said by Forbes <hi rend="italic">{Ibis,</hi> 1881,
                    p. 28) to have remained “satisfied to the last as to the naturalness of the two
                    main groups into which he there divided birds ”— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Homalogonatae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Anomalogonatae.</hi> The key to this
                    arrangement lay in the presence or absence of the <hi rend="italic">ambiens</hi>
                    muscle, “not because of its own intrinsic importance, but because its presence
                    is always associated with peculiarities in other parts never found in any
                    Anomalo-gonatous bird.” Garrod thought that so great was the improbability of
                    the same combination of three or four different characters (such as an accessory
                    femoro-caudal muscle, a tufted oil-gland, and caeca) arising independently in
                    different Birds that similar combinations of characters could only be due to
                    blood-relationship. The ingenuity with which he found and expressed these
                    combinations of characters is worthy of all praise; the regret is that time was
                    wanting for him to think out all their consequences, and that he did not take
                    also into account other and especially osteological characters. Every
                    osteologist must recognize that the neglect of these makes Garrod’s proposed
                    classification as unnatural as any that had been previously drawn up, and more
                    unnatural than many. So much is this the case that, with the knowledge we have
                    that ere his death he had already seen the need of introducing some
                    modifications into it, its reproduction here, even in the briefest abstract
                    possible, would not be advisable. Two instances, however, of its failure to shew
                    natural affinities or differences may be cited. The first Order <hi
                    rend="italic">Gcdliformes</hi> of his Subclass <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hoemalogonatae</hi> is made to consist of three “Cohorts ”— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Struthiones,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gallinaceae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psittaci</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a somewhat astonishing alliance; but even
                    if that be allowed to pass, we'find the second “Cohort” composed of the Families
                    <hi rend="italic">Palamedeidae, Gallinae, Rallidae, Otididae</hi> (containing
                    two Subfamilies, the Bustards and the Flamingoes), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musophagidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cuculidae.</hi> Again the Subclass <hi
                    rend="italic">Anomalogonatae</hi> includes three Orders— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pici-f</hi><hi rend="italic">ormes,</hi><hi rend="italic">Passeriformes,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Cypseliformes—</hi> a preliminary to which at first sight
                    no exception need be taken; but immediately we look into details we find the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alcedinidae</hi> placed in the first Order and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Meropidae</hi> in the second, together with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passeres</hi> and a collection of Families almost every feature in the skeleton
                    of which points to a separation. Common sense revolts at the acceptance of any
                    scheme which involves so many manifest incongruities. With far greater pleasure
                    we would leave these investigations, and those on certain other muscles, as well
                    as on the Disposition of the deep plantar Tendons, and dwell upon his researches
                    into the anatomy of the Passerine Birds with the view to their systematic
                    arrangement. Here he was on much safer ground, and it can hardly be doubted that
                    his labours will stand the test of future experience, for, though it may be that
                    all his views will not meet with ultimate approval, he certainly made the
                    greatest advance since the days of Müller, to the English translation of whose
                    classical work he added (as already mentioned) an excellent appendix, besides
                    having already contributed to the Zoological <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi>
                    between 1876 and 1878 four memoirs replete with observed facts which no one can
                    gainsay. As his labours were continued exactly on the same lines by Forbes, who,
                    between 1880 and 1882, published in the same journal six more memoirs on the
                    subject, it will be convenient here to state generally, and in a combined form,
                    the results arrived at by these two investigators.</p>
                <p>Instead of the divisions of Passerine Birds instituted by Müller, Garrod and
                    Forbes having a wider range of experience consider that they have shewn that the
                    <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> consist of two primary sections, which the
                    latter named respectively <hi rend="italic">Desmodactyli</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Eleutherodactyli,</hi> from the facts discovered by the former
                    that in the <hi rend="italic">Eurylaemidae,</hi> or Broadbills, a small Family
                    peculiar to some parts of the Indian Region, and consisting of some nine or ten
                    species only, there is a strong band joining the muscles of the hind toe exactly
                    in the same way as in many Families that are not Passerine, and hence the name
                    <hi rend="italic">Desmodactyli,</hi> while in all other Passerines the hind toe
                    is free. This point settled, the <hi rend="italic">Eleutherodactyli</hi> form
                    two great divisions, according to the structure of their vocal organs; one of
                    them, roughly agreeing with the <hi rend="italic">Clamatores</hi> of some
                    writers, is called <hi rend="italic">Mesomyodi,</hi> and the other,
                    corresponding in the main, if not absolutely, with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oscines, Polymyodi,</hi> or true <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> of various
                    authors, is named <hi rend="italic">Acromyodi—</hi> “an Acromyodian bird being
                    one in which the muscles of the syrinx are attached to the extremities of the
                    bronchial semi-rings, a Mesomyodian bird being one in which the muscles of the
                    syrinx join the semi-rings in their middle.” Furthermore, each of these groups
                    is subdivided into two: the <hi rend="italic">Acromyodi</hi> into “normal” and
                    “abnormal,” of which more presently; the <hi rend="italic">Mesomyodi</hi> into
                    <hi rend="italic">Homoeomeri</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Heteromeri,</hi>
                    according as the sciatic or the femoral artery of the thigh is developed —the
                    former being the usual arrangement among Birds and the latter the exceptional.
                    Under the head <hi rend="italic">Heteromeri</hi> come only two Families the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cotingidae</hi> (Chatterers) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pipridae</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Manakins,</hi> vol. xv. p. 455) of most
                    ornithologists, but these Garrod was inclined to think should not be considered
                    distinct. The <hi rend="italic">Homoeomeri</hi> form a larger group, and are at
                    once separable, on account of the structure of their vocal organs, into <hi
                    rend="italic">Tracheophonae</hi> (practically equivalent to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tracheophones</hi> of Müller) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Haploo-</hi><hi rend="italic">phonae</hi> (as Garrod named them)—the last being
                    those <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> which were by Müller erroneously included
                    among his <hi rend="italic">Picarii,</hi> namely, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tyrannidae</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">King-bird,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 80) with
                    <hi rend="italic">Rupicola,</hi> the Cocks-of-the-Rock. To these are now added
                    Families not examined by him,—but subsequently ascertained by Forbes to belong
                    to the same group,— <hi rend="italic">Pittidae, Philepittidae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Xenicidae</hi> (more properly perhaps to be called <hi
                    rend="italic">Acanthisittidae),</hi> and it is remarkable that these last three
                    Families are the only members of the <hi rend="italic">Mesomyodi</hi> which are
                    not peculiar to the New World—nay more, if we except the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tyrannidae,</hi> which in North America occur chiefly as migrants,— not
                    peculiar to the Neotropical Region. The <hi rend="italic">Tracheo-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">phonae</hi> are held to contain five Families— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fumariidae</hi> Oven-birds), <hi rend="italic">Pteroptochidae</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Tapaculos,</hi> g ’.v.), <hi rend="italic">Dendro-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">colaptidae</hi> (Piculules), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conopophagidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Formicariidae</hi> (Ant-Thrushes).
                    Returning now to the <hi rend="italic">Acromyodi,</hi> which include, it has
                    just been said, a normal and an abnormal section, the latter consists of birds
                    agreeing in the main, though not absolutely, as to the structure of the syrinx
                    with that of the former, yet differing so considerably in their osteology as to
                    be most justifiably separated. At present only two types of these abnormal <hi
                    rend="italic">Acromyodi</hi> are known— <hi rend="italic">Menura</hi> (the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lyre-bird,</hi> vol. xv. p. 115) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atrichia</hi> (the <hi rend="smallcaps">Scrub-bird,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >qyυ.∖</hi> both from Australia, while all the remaining <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passeres,</hi> that is to say, incomparably the greater number of Birds in
                    general, belong to the normal section. Thus the whole scheme of the <hi

                    type="authorial"><p>It is right to observe that this scheme was not a little

                    so far as it goes, is probably very near the truth, though for simplicity’s sake
                    some of the intermediate group-names might perhaps be omitted :—</p>

                <p>It will be seen that no attempt is here made to separate the Normal Acromyodians
                    into Families. Already, in <hi rend="italic">The Ibis tor</hi> 1874 (pp.
                    406-416), Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Wallace</hi> had published a plan, which, with
                    two slight modifications that were manifestly improvements, he employed two
                    years later in his great work on <hi rend="italic">The Geographical Distribution
                    of Animals,</hi> and this included a method of arranging the Families of this
                    division. Being based, however, wholly on alar characters, it has of course a
                    great similarity to the schemes of Dr Cabanis and of Sundevall, and, though
                    simpler than either of those, there is no need here to enter much into its

                    or Turdoid <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi>,” having a wing with ten primaries,
                    the first of which is always more or less markedly reduced in size, and to this
                    21 Families are allotted; B. “Tanagroid <hi rend="italic">Passeres,”</hi> having
                    a wing with nine primaries, the first of which is fully developed and usually
                    very long, and containing 10 Families; and C. “Sturnoid <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passeres,”</hi> having a wing with ten primaries, the first of which is
                    “rudimentary,” with only 4 Families. The remaining Families, 10 in number, which
                    are not normally acromyodian are grouped as Series D. and called “Formicaroid
                    <hi rend="italic">Passeres.”</hi></p>

                    harmonize the views of ornithotomists with those taken by the ornithologists who
                    only study the exterior; but, as he explained, his scheme is really that of
                    Prof. Huxley reversed, with some slight modifications mostly consequent on the
                    recent researches of Prof. Parker and of Garrod, and (he might have added) a few
                    details derived from his own extensive knowledge of the Class. Adopting the two
                    Subclasses <hi rend="italic">Carinatae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ratitae,</hi>
                    he recognized 3 “Orders” as forming the latter and 23 the former—a number far
                    exceeding any that had of late years met with the approval of ornithologists. It
                    is certainly difficult in the present state of our knowledge to get on with much
                    fewer groups; whether we call them “Orders” or not is immaterial. First of them
                    comes the <hi rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> of which Mr Sclater would make four

                    Sclater takes what seems to be quite the most reasonable view, when he states
                    that they “are all very closely related to one another, and, in reality, form
                    little more than one group, equivalent to other so called families of birds,”
                    going on to remark that as there are some 4700 known species of them “it is
                    absolutely necessary to subdivide them,” and finally proceeding to do this
                    nearly on the method of SundevalΓs <hi rend="italic">Tentamen</hi> (see above
                    pp. 37, 38), merely changing the names and position of the groups in accordance
                    with a plan of his own set forth in the <hi rend="italic">Nomenclator Avium
                    Neotropicalium,</hi> which he and Mr Salvin printed in 1873, making, as did
                    Sundevall, two divisions (according as the hind part of the “tarsus” is plated
                    or scaled), A. <hi rend="italic">Laminiplantares</hi> and B. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scutiρlantares—</hi> but confining the latter to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alaudidae</hi> alone, since the other Families forming Sundevall’s <hi

                <p>These six groups Mr Sclater thinks may be separated without much difficulty,
                    though on that point the proceedings of some later writers (a notable instance
                    of which he himself cites) shew that doubt may still be entertained; but he
                    rightly remarks that, “when we come to attempt to subdivide them, there is room
                    for endless varieties of opinion as to the nearest allies of many of the forms,”
                    and into further details he does not go. It will be perceived that, like so many
                    of his predecessors, he accords the highest rank to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dentirostres,</hi> which, as has before been hinted, seems to be a mistaken

                    some of them at least, should be classed; but the need for the establishment of
                    this group, and especially the insertion in it of certain forms, is not

                <p>As a whole it is impossible not to speak well of the scheme thus sketched out;
                    nevertheless it does seem in some parts to be open to amendment, though the task
                    of attempting to suggest any modifications of it by way of improvement is one
                    that the present writer approaches with reluctance and the utmost diffidence.
                    Yet the task, it appears, must be undertaken. From the preceding pages,
                    recounting the efforts of many system-makers— good, bad, and indifferent—it will
                    have been seen what a very great number and variety of characters need to be had
                    in remembrance while planning any scheme that will at all adequately represent
                    the results of the knowledge hitherto attained, and the best lesson to be learnt
                    from them is that our present knowledge goes but a very little way in comparison
                    with what we, or our successors, may hope to reach in years to come. Still we
                    may feel pretty confident that we are on the right track, and, moreover, that
                    here and there we can plant our feet on firm ground, however uncertain, not to
                    say treacherous, may be the spaces that intervene. Now that geographical
                    exploration has left so small a portion of the earth’s surface unvisited, we
                    cannot reasonably look for the encountering of new forms of ornithic life that,
                    by revealing hitherto unknown stepping stones, will quicken our course or
                    effectively point out our path. Indeed, as a matter of fact, the two most
                    important and singular types of existing Birds— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Balxniceps</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhinochetus—</hi> that in later years
                    have rewarded the exertions of travelling naturalists, have proved rather
                    sources of perplexity than founts of inspiration. Should fortune favour
                    ornithologists in the discovery of fossil remains, they will unquestionably form
                    the surest guide to our faltering steps; but experience forbids us to expect
                    much aid from this quarter, however warmly we may wish for it, and the pleasure
                    of any discovery of the kind would be enhanced equally by its rarity as by its
                    intrinsic worth. However, it is now a well accepted maxim in zoology that the
                    mature forms of the past are repeated in the immature forms of the present, and
                    that, where Palaeontology fails to instruct us, Embryology may be trusted to no
                    small extent to supply the deficiency. Unhappily the embryology of Birds has
                    been as yet very insufficiently studied. We have indeed embryological memoirs of
                    a value that can scarcely be rated too highly, but almost all are of a
                    monographic character. They are only oases in a desert of ignorance, and a
                    really connected and continuous series of investigations, such as the many
                    morphological laboratories, now-established in various countries, would easily
                    render possible, has yet to be instituted. No methodical attempt at this kind of
                    work seems to have been made for nearly half a century, and, with the advantage
                    of modern appliances, no one can justifiably doubt the success of a renewal of
                    such an attempt any more than he can possibly foresee the precise nature of the
                    revelations that would come of it.</p>
                <p>The various schemes for classifying Birds set forth by the authors of general
                    text-books of Zoology do not call for any particular review here, as almost
                    without exception they are so drawn up as to be rather of the nature of a
                    compromise than of a harmony. The best and most notable is perhaps that by Prof.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Carus</hi> in 1868 <hi rend="italic">(Handbuch der
                    Zoologie,</hi> i. pp. 191-368); but it is of course now antiquated. The worst
                    scheme is one of the most recent, that by Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps">Claus</hi>
                    in 1882 <hi rend="italic">(Grundzüge der Zoologie,</hi> ii. pp. 318-388). Of
                    most other similar text-books that have come under the writer’s notice,
                    especially those issued in the United Kingdom, the less said the better. It is
                    unfortunate that neither Prof. Gegenbaur nor the late Prof. F. Μ. Balfour should
                    have turned their attention to this matter; but an improvement may be expected
                    from Dr Gadow, who is engaged in completing the ornithological portion of
                    Bronn’s <hi rend="italic">Thierreich, so</hi> long left unfinished.</p>
                <p>Birds are animals so similar to Reptiles in all the most essential features of
                    their organization that they may be said to be merely an extremely modified and
                    aberrant Reptilian type. These are almost the very words of Prof. Huxley twenty
                    years ago,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    and there are now but few zoologists to dissent from his statement, which by

                    not intended here to enter upon their points of resemblance and differences.
                    These may be found summarized with more or less accuracy in any text-book of
                    zoology. We shall content ourselves by remarking that by the naturalist just
                    named Birds and Reptiles have been brigaded together under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi> as forming one of the three primary divisions of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the other two
                    being <hi rend="italic">Ichthyopsida</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mammalia.</hi>
                    Yet Birds have a right to be considered a Class, and as a Class they have become
                    so wholly differentiated from every other group of the Animal Kingdom that,
                    among recent and even the few fossil forms known to us, there is not one about
                    the assignation of which any doubt ought now to exist, though it is right to
                    state that some naturalists have even lately refused a place among <hi

                    which the remains of two individuals—most probably belonging to as many distinct
                    forms<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Prof. Seeley’s

                    the quarries of Solenhofen in Bavaria. Yet one of them has been referred,
                    without much hesitation, by Prof. Vogt to the Class <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reptilia</hi> on grounds which seem to be mistaken, since it was evidently in
                    great part if not entirely clothed with feathers.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prof. Vogt lays much stress on the absence of
                    feathers from certain parts of the body of the second example of <hi
                    rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> now, thanks to Dr Werner Siemens, in the museum
                    of Berlin. But Prof. Vogt himself shews that the parts of the body devoid of
                    feathers are also devoid of skin. Now it is well known that amongst most
                    existing Birds the ordinary “contour-feathers” have their origin no deeper than
                    the skin, and thus if that decayed and were washed away the feathers growing
                    upon it would equally be lost. This has evidently happened (to judge from
                    photographs) to the Berlin specimen just as to that which is in London. In each
                    case, as Sir R. Owen most rightly suggested of the latter, the remains exactly
                    call to mind the very familiar relics of Birds found on a seashore, exposed
                    perhaps for weeks or even months to the wash of the tides so as to lose all but
                    the deeply-seated feathers, and finally to be embedded in the soft soil. Prof.

                    predominate over those which are obviously Reptilian, he will not venture to
                    declare more concerning its relations to other Birds, and accordingly thinks it
                    advisable to leave the genus as the sole representative as yet known of the

                    that time may shew whether this provisional arrangement will be substantiated.
                    The great use of the discovery of <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> to
                    naturalists in general is well known to have been the convincing testimony it
                    afforded as to what is well called “the imperfection of the Geological Record.”
                    To ornithologists in particular its chief attraction is the evidence it
                    furnishes in proof of the evolution of Birds from Reptiles; though, as to the
                    group of the latter from which the former may have sprung, it tells us little
                    that is not negative. It throws, for instance, the Pterodactyls—so often
                    imagined to be nearly related to Birds, if not to be their direct
                    ancestors—completely out of the line of descent. Next to this its principal
                    advantage is to reveal the existence at so early an epoch of Birds with some
                    portions of their structure as highly organized as the highest of the present
                    day, a fact witnessed by its foot, which, so far as can be judged by its
                    petrified relics, might well be that of a modern Crow. The fossil remains of
                    many other Birds, for example Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps">Seeley’s</hi><hi

                    some more, are too fragmentary to serve the purposes of the systematist; but the
                    grand discoveries of Prof. Marsh, spoken of above, afford plentiful hints as to
                    the taxonomy of the Class, and their bearing deserves the closest consideration.
                    First of all we find that, while Birds still possess the teeth they had
                    inherited from their Reptilian ancestors, two remarkable and very distinct types
                    of the Class had already made their appearance, and we must note that these two
                    types are those which persist at the present day, and even now divide the Class
                    into <hi rend="italic">Ratitae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Carinatae,</hi> the
                    groups whose essentially distinct characters were recognized by Merrem.
                    Furthermore, while the Ratite type <hi rend="italic">(Hesperornis)</hi> presents
                    the kind of teeth, arrayed in grooves, which indicate (in Reptiles at least) a
                    low morphological rank, the Carinate type <hi rend="italic">(Ichthyornis)</hi>
                    is furnished with teeth set in sockets, and shewing a higher development. On the
                    other hand this early Carinate type has vertebrae whose comparatively simple,
                    biconcave form is equally evidence of a rank unquestionably low; but the
                    saddle-shaped vertebrae of the contemporary Ratite type as surely testify to a
                    more exalted position. Reference has been already made to this complicated if
                    not contradictory state of things, the true explanation of which seems to be out
                    of reach at present. It has been for some time a question whether the Ratite is
                    a degraded type descended from the Carinate, or the Carinate a superior
                    development of the Ratite type. Several eminent zoologists have declared
                    themselves in favour of the former probability, and at first sight most people
                    would be inclined to decide with them; for, on this hypothesis, the easiest
                    answer to the question would be found. But the easiest answer is not always the
                    true one; and to the present writer it seems that before this question be
                    answered, a reply should be given to another—Was the first animal which any one
                    could properly call a “Bird,” as distinguished from a “Reptile,” possessed of a
                    keeled sternum or not? Now Birds would seem to have been differentiated from
                    Reptiles while the latter had biconcave vertebrae, and teeth whose mode of
                    attachment to the jaw was still variable. There is no reason to think that at
                    that period any Reptile (with the exception of Pterodactyls, which, as has
                    already been said, are certainly not in the line of Birds’ ancestors) had a
                    keeled sternum. Hence it seems almost impossible that the first Bird should have
                    possessed one; that is to say, it must have been practically of the Ratite type.
                    Prof. Marsh has shewn that there is good reason for believing that the power of
                    flight was gradually acquired by Birds, and with that power would be associated
                    the development of a keel to the sternum, on which the volant faculty so much
                    depends, and with which it is so intimately correlated that in certain forms
                    which have to a greater or less extent given up the use of their fore-limbs the
                    keel though present has become proportionally aborted. Thus the Carinate type
                    would, from all we can see at present, appear to have been evolved from the
                    Ratite. This view receives further support from a consideration of the results
                    of such embryological research as has already been made—the unquestionable
                    ossification of the Ratite sternum from a smaller number of paired centres than
                    the Carinate sternum, in which (with the doubtful exception of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anatidae)</hi> an additional, unpaired centre makes its
                    appearance. Again the geographical distribution of existing, or comparatively
                    recent, Ratite forms points to the same conclusion. That these forms—Moa, Kiwi,
                    Emeu and Cassowary, Rhea, and finally Ostrich—</p>

                <p>must have had a common ancestor nearer to them than is the ancestor of any
                    Carinate form seems to need no proof. If we add to these the <hi rend="italic"

                    these Birds have been or are throughout the world, it seems justifiable to
                    consider them the survivals of a very ancient type, which has hardly undergone
                    any essential modification since the appearance of Bird-life upon the earth—even
                    though one at least of them has become very highly specialized.</p>
                <p>No doubt the difficulty presented by the biconcave vertebrae of the earliest
                    known representative of the Carinate type is a considerable obstacle to the view
                    just taken. But in the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Science</hi> (April
                    1879), and again in his great work (pp. 180, 181), Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Marsh</hi> has shewn that in the third cervical vertebra of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ichthy</hi><hi rend="italic">ornis</hi> “we catch nature in the act as it were”
                    of modifying one form of vertebra into another, for this single vertebra in <hi
                    rend="italic">Ichthyomis</hi> is in vertical section “moderately convex, while
                    transversely it is strongly concave, thus presenting a near approach to the
                    saddle-like articulation and he proceeds to point out that this specialized
                    feature occurs at the first bend of the neck, and, greatly facilitating motion
                    in a vertical plane, is “mainly due originally to its predominance.” The form of
                    the vertebrae would accordingly seem to be as much correlated with the mobility
                    of the neck as is the form of the sternum with the faculty of flight. If
                    therefore the development of the saddle shape be an indication of development,
                    as well may be the outgrowth of a keel. However, the solution of this perplexing
                    problem, if a solution be ever found, must remain for future palaeontological or
                    embryological discoverers. The present writer is far from attempting to decide a
                    question so complicated, though he does not hesitate to say, notwithstanding the
                    weight of authority on the other side, that according to present evidence the
                    probability is in favour of the Carinate having been evolved from a more ancient
                    Ratite type. One thing only is certain, and that is the independent and
                    contemporaneous existence of each of these great divisions at the earliest
                    period when Birds at all like recent forms are known to have lived. The facts
                    that each of these types was provided with teeth, and that the teeth were of a
                    different pattern, are of comparatively secondary importance.</p>
                <p>It seems therefore quite justifiable to continue, after the fashion that has been
                    set, to separate the Class <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> into three primary groups
                    :—I. <hi rend="italic">Saururae,</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Ratitae,</hi> III.

                    the two last, as well as possibly all of the first, being provided with teeth.
                    These three primary groups we may call “Subclasses.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prof. Huxley has termed them “Orders”; but it
                    is more in accordance with the practice of ornithological writers to raise them
                    to a higher rank, and to call the secondary groups “Orders.” There is a good
                    deal to be said in behalf of either view; but, as in most cases of mere
                    terminology, the matter is not worth wasting words over it, so long as we bear
                    in mind that what here is meant by an “Order” of <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> is

                    of arranging all of these orders according to their affinities, it will be best
                    to place their names alphabetically, thus :—</p>

                <p>Some systematists think there can be little question of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Struthiones</hi> being the most specialized and therefore probably the highest
                    type of these Orders, and the present writer is rather inclined to agree with
                    them. Nevertheless the formation of the bill in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apteryges</hi> is quite unique in the whole Class, and indicates therefore an
                    extraordinary amount of specialization. Their functionless wings, however, point
                    to their being a degraded form, though in this matter they are not much worse
                    than the <hi rend="italic">Megistanes,</hi> and are far above the <hi
                    rend="italic">Immanes</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> some of which at least appear
                    to have been absolutely wingless, and were thus the only members of the Class
                    possessing but a single pair of limbs.</p>
                <p>Turning then to the third Subclass, the <hi rend="italic">Carinatae,</hi> their
                    subdivision into Orders is attended with a considerable amount of difficulty;
                    and still greater difficulty is presented if we make any attempt to arrange
                    these Orders so as in some way or other to shew their respective relations—in
                    other words, their genealogy. In regard to the first of these tasks, a few
                    groups can no doubt be at once separated without fear of going wrong. For
                    instance, the <hi rend="italic">Crypturi</hi> or Tinamous, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Impennes</hi> or Penguins, the <hi rend="italic">Striges</hi> or Owls, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Psittaci</hi> or Parrots, and the <hi rend="italic">Passeres,</hi>
                    or at least the <hi rend="italic">Oscines,</hi> seem to stand as groups each
                    quite by itself, and, since none of them contains any hangers-on about the
                    character of which there can any longer be room to hesitate, there can be little
                    risk in setting them apart. Next comes a category of groups in which
                    differentiation appears not to have been carried so far, and, though there may
                    be as little doubt as to the association in one Order of the greater number of
                    forms commonly assigned to each, yet there are in every case more or fewer
                    outliers that do not well harmonize with the rest. Here we have such groups as
                    those called <hi rend="italic">Pygopodes,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gaviae,
                    Limicolae, Gallinae, Columbae,</hi><hi rend="italic">Anseres, Herodiones,
                    Steganopodes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Accipitres.</hi> Finally there are two
                    groups of types presenting characteristics so diverse as to defy almost any
                    definition, and, if it were not almost nonsense to say so, agreeing in little
                    more than in the differences. These two groups are those known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Picariae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alectorides</hi>; but, while
                    the majority <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n54/mode/1up"

                    former plainly have some features in common, the few Families or genera that
                    have been clubbed together in the latter make an assemblage that is quite
                    artificial, though it may be freely owned that with our present knowledge it is
                    impossible to determine the natural alliances of all of them.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Heterogeneous as is the group
                    as left by the latest systematist, it is nothing to its state when first founded
                    by liliger in 1811; for it then contained in addition the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Glareola</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cereopsis,</hi> but the last
                    was restored to its true place among the <hi rend="italic">Anseres</hi> by
                    Temminck. The <hi rend="italic">Alectrides</hi> of Duméril have nothing in
                    common with the <hi rend="italic">Alectorides</hi> of liliger, and the latter is
                    a name most unfortunately chosen, since the group so called does not include any
                    Cock-like Bird.</p></note></p>
                <p>That our knowledge is also too imperfect to enable systematists to compose a
                    phylogeny of Birds, even of the Carinate Subclass, and draw out their pedigree,
                    ought to be sufficiently evident. The uncertainty which still prevails among the
                    best-informed ornithologists as to the respective origin of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ratitae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Carinatae</hi> is in itself a
                    proof of that fact, and in regard to some groups much less widely differentiated
                    the same thing occurs. We can point to some forms which seem to be collaterally
                    ancestral (if such a phrase may be allowed), and among them perhaps some of
                    those which have been referred to the group “<hi rend="italic">Alectorides</hi>”
                    just mentioned, and from a consideration of their Geographical Distribution and
                    especially Isolation it will be obvious that they are the remnants of a very
                    ancient and more generalized stock which in various parts of the world have
                    become more or less specialized. The very case of the New-Caledonian Kagu <hi
                    rend="italic">(Rhinochetus'),</hi> combining features which occasionally recall
                    the Sun-Bittern <hi rend="italic">(Eurypyga),</hi> and again present an
                    unmistakable likeness to the <hi rend="italic">Limicolae</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rallidae,</hi> shews that it is without any very near relation on
                    the earth, and, if convenience permitted, would almost justify us in placing it
                    in a group apart from any other, though possessing some characteristics in
                    common with several.</p>
                <p>It is anything but the desire of the present writer to invent a new arrangement
                    of Birds. Such acquaintance as he possesses with the plans which have been
                    already propounded warns him that until a great deal more labour has been
                    expended, and its results made clearly known, no general scheme of
                    Classification will deserve to be regarded as final. Nevertheless in the best of
                    modern systems there are some points which, as already hinted, seem to be well
                    established, while in them there are also some dispositions and assignments
                    which he is as yet unable to accept, while he knows that he is not alone in his
                    mistrust of them, and he thinks it his duty here to mention them in the hope
                    that thereby attention may be further directed to them, and his doubts either
                    dispelled or established—it matters not which. The most convenient way of
                    bringing them to the notice of the reader will perhaps be by considering in
                    succession the different groups set forth by the latest systematist of any
                    authority—Mr Sclater—a sketch of whose method has been above given.</p>
                <p>If we trust to the results at which Prof. Huxley arrived, there can be little

                    liliger and others, or Tinamous, for their resemblance to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ratitae,</hi> is not to be disputed; but it must be borne in mind that nothing
                    whatever is known of their mode of development, and that this may, when made
                    out, seriously modify their position relatively to another group, the normal <hi
                    rend="italic">Anseres,</hi> in which the investigations of Cuvier and LΗerminier
                    have already shewn that there is some resemblance to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ratitae</hi> as regards the ossification of the sternum. It will be for
                    embryologists to determine whether this asserted resemblance has any real
                    meaning; but of the sufficient standing of the <hi rend="italic">Crypturi</hi>
                    as an Order there can hardly be a question.</p>
                <p>We have seen that Prof. Huxley would derive all other existing Carinate Birds
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Dromaeognathae</hi>; but of course it must be
                    understood in this, as in every other similar case, that it is not thereby
                    implied that the modern representatives of the Dromaeognathous type (namely, the
                    Tinamous) stand in the line of ancestry.</p>
                <p>Under the name <hi rend="italic">Impennes</hi> we have a group of Birds, the
                    Penguins, smaller even than the last, and one over which until lately
                    systematists have been sadly at fault <hi rend="italic">; for,</hi> though we as
                    yet know little if anything definite as to their embryology, no one, free from
                    bias, can examine any member of the group, either externally or internally,
                    without perceiving how completely different it is from anj others of the
                    Carinate division. There is perhaps scarcely a feather or a bone which is not
                    diagnostic, and nearly every character hitherto observed points to a low
                    morphological rank. It may even be that the clothing of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hesperomis</hi> was not very dissimilar to the “plumage” which now covers the
                    <hi rend="italic">Impennes,</hi> and the title of an Order can hardly be refused
                    to them.</p>
                <p>The group known as <hi rend="italic">Pygopodes</hi> has been often asserted to be
                    closely akin to the <hi rend="italic">Impennes,</hi> and we have seen that
                    Brandt combined the two under the name of <hi rend="italic">Urinatores,</hi>
                    while Mr Sclater thinks the <hi rend="italic">Pygopodes</hi> “seem to form a
                    natural transition between” the Gulls and the Penguins. The affinity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alcidae</hi> or Auks (and through them the Divers or <hi
                    rend="italic">Colymbidae)</hi> to the Gulls may be a matter beyond doubt, and
                    there appears to be ground for considering them to be the degraded offspring of
                    the former; but to the present writer it appears questionable whether the
                    Grebes, <hi rend="italic">Podicipedidae,</hi> have any real affinity to the two
                    Families with which they are usually associated, and this is a point deserving
                    of more attention on the part of morphologists than it has hitherto received.
                    Under the name of <hi rend="italic">Gaviae</hi> the Gulls and their close allies
                    form a very natural section, but it probably hardly merits the rank of an Order
                    more than the <hi rend="italic">Pygopodes,</hi> for its relations to the large
                    and somewhat multiform though very natural group <hi rend="italic"
                    >Limicolae</hi> have to be taken into consideration. Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Parker</hi> long ago observed <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Zool. Society,</hi> v.
                    p. 150) that characters exhibited by Gulls when young, but lost by them when
                    adult, are found in certain Plovers at all ages, and hence it would appear that
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gaviae</hi> are but more advanced <hi rend="italic"
                    >Limicolae.</hi> The Limicoline genera <hi rend="italic">Dromas</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Chionis</hi> have many points of resemblance to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Laridae·,</hi> and on the whole the proper inference would seem to
                    be that the <hi rend="italic">Limicolae,</hi> or something very like them, form
                    the parent-stock whence have descended the <hi rend="italic">Gaviae,</hi> from
                    which or from their ancestral forms the <hi rend="italic">Alcidae</hi> have
                    proceeded as a degenerate branch. If this hypothesis be correct, the association
                    of these three groups would constitute an Order, of which the highest Family
                    would perhaps be <hi rend="italic">Otididae,</hi> the Bustards; but until
                    further research shews whether the view can be maintained it is not worth while
                    to encumber nomenclature by inventing a new name for the combination. On the
                    other hand the Petrels, which form the group <hi rend="italic">Tubinares,</hi>
                    would seem for several reasons to be perfectly distinct from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gaviae</hi> and their allies, and possibly will have to rank as an
                    Order.</p>
                <p>Considerable doubt has already been expressed as to the existence of an Order <hi
                    rend="italic">Alectorides,</hi> which no one can regard as a natural group, and
                    it has just been proposed to retransfer to the <hi rend="italic">Limicolae</hi>
                    one of the Families, <hi rend="italic">Otididae,</hi> kept in it by Mr Sclater.

                    >Cariamidae,</hi> the true place of which has long been a puzzle to
                    systematizers. The present writer is inclined to think that those who have urged
                    its affinity to the <hi rend="italic">Accipitres,</hi> and among them taxonomers
                    starting from bases so opposite as Sundevall and Prof. Parker, have more nearly

                    that some members of both these Suborders exhibit many points of resemblance to
                    certain other forms that it is at present necessary to place in different

                    the resemblance to be one of affinity, and therefore of taxonomic value, instead
                    of mere analogy, and therefore of no worth in that respect.</p>
                <p>We have next to deal with a group nearly as complicated. The true <hi

                    found; but round and near them cluster some forms very troublesome to allocate.
                    The strange Hoactzin <hi rend="italic">(Opisthocomus~)</hi> is one of these, and
                    what seems to be in some degree its arrested development makes its position

                    rend="italic">Alesites,</hi> just mentioned, presents a case which may, however,

                    vol. xii. p. 28, and <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> p. 36). It must for the
                    present at least stand alone, the sole occupant of a single Order. Then there
                    are the Hemipodes or Button-Quails, which have been raised to equal rank by
                    Prof. Huxley as <hi rend="italic">Tumicomorphae</hi><hi rend="italic">∙,</hi>
                    but, though no doubt the osteological differences between them and the normal
                    <hi rend="italic">Gallinae,</hi> pointed out by him as well as by Prof. Parker,
                    are great, they do not seem to be more essential than are found in different
                    members of some other Orders, nor to offer an insuperable objection to their
                    being classed under the designation <hi rend="italic">Gallinae.</hi> If this be
                    so there, will be no necessity for removing them from that Order, which may then
                    be portioned into three Suborders— <hi rend="italic">Hemipodii</hi> standing
                    somewhat apart, and <hi rend="italic">Alectoropodes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peristeropodes,</hi> which are more nearly allied—the latter comprehending the
                    <hi rend="italic">Megapodiidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cracidae,</hi> and the
                    former consisting of the normal <hi rend="italic">Gallinae,</hi> of which it is
                    difficult to justify the recognition of more than a single Family, though in
                    that two types of structure are discernible.</p>
                <p>The Family of Sand-Grouse, <hi rend="italic">Pteroclidae,</hi> is perhaps one of
                    the most instructive in the whole range of Ornithology. In Prof. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Huxley’s</hi> words <hi rend="italic">(Proceedings,</hi> 1868,
                    p. 303), they are “completely intermediate between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alectoromorphae</hi><hi rend="italic">[i.e.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gallinae]</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Peristeromorphae</hi> [the Pigeons].
                    They cannot be included within either of these groups without destroying its
                    definition, while they are perfectly definable themselves.” Hence he would make
                    them an independent group of equal value with the other two. Almost the same
                    result has been reached by Dr <hi rend="smallcaps">Gadow</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(op. cit.,</hi> 1882, pp. 331, 332). No doubt there are strong and tempting
                    reasons for taking this step; but peradventure the real lesson taught by this
                    aggregation of common characters is rather the retention of the union of the
                    67√∕0iiεand <hi rend="italic">Columbae</hi> into a singlegroup, after the
                    fashion of by-gone years, under the name, however meaningless, of <hi

                    writer to group them as a Suborder of <hi rend="italic">Columbae</hi>; but the
                    many important points in which they differ from the more normal Pigeons,
                    especially in the matter of their young being clothed with down, and their
                    coloured and speckled eggs,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This fact tells in favour of the views of Dr Gadow and those who hold the
                    Sand-Grouse to be allied to the Plovers; but then he places the Pigeons between

                    freely admitted. Young Sand Grouse are described as being not only “Dasypaedes”
                    but even “Praecoces” at birth, while of course every one knows the helpless
                    condition of “Pipers”—that is, Pigeons newly-hatched from their white eggs. Thus
                    the opposite condition of the young of these two admittedly very near groups
                    inflicts a severe blow on the so-called “physiological” method of dividing Birds
                    before mentioned, and renders the <hi rend="italic">Pteroclidae</hi> so
                    instructive a form. The <hi rend="italic">Columbae,</hi> considered in the wide
                    sense just suggested, would seem to have possessed another and degenerate
                    Suborder in the Dodo and its kindred, though the extirpation of those strange
                    and monstrous forms will most likely leave their precise relations a matter of
                    some doubt; while the third and last Suborder, the true <hi rend="italic"
                    >Columbae,</hi> is much more homogeneous, and can hardly be said to contain more
                    than two Families, <hi rend="italic">Columbidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    now almost obliterated, in the direction of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musophagidae,</hi> and thence, we may not unreasonably infer, to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coccygomorphae</hi> of the same authority. But these
                    “Coccygomorphs” would also appear to reach a higher rank than some other groups
                    that we have to notice, and therefore, leaving the former, we must attempt to
                    trace the fortunes of a more remote and less exalted line. It has already been
                    stated that the <hi rend="italic">Gaviae</hi> are a group closely allied to
                    though somewhat higher than the <hi rend="italic">Limicolae,</hi> and that at

                    present an affinity to the latter. One of them, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhinochetus,</hi> has been several times thought to be connected through its
                    presumed relative <hi rend="italic">Eurypyga</hi> (from which, however, it is a
                    good way removed both as regards distribution and structure) with the <hi
                    rend="italic">lleriodiones,</hi> Herons. On the other hand the <hi rend="italic"

                    that needs to be here advanced, very hypothetical; but there is so much in the
                    osteology of the Flamingoes, besides other things, that resembles the <hi

                    rend="italic">Cariama,</hi> with its two species, must still remain an open
                    question.</p>
                <p>It has so long been the custom to place the Owls next to the Diurnal
                    Birds-of-Prey that any attempt to remove them from that position cannot fail to
                    incur criticism. Yet when we disregard their carnivorous habits, and certain
                    modifications which may possibly be thereby induced, we find almost nothing of
                    value to indicate relationship between them. That the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Striges</hi> stand quite independently of the <hi rend="italic">Accipitres</hi>
                    as above limited can hardly be doubted, and, while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psittaci</hi> or Parrots would on some grounds appear to be the nearest allies
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Accipitres,</hi> the nearest relations of the Owls must
                    be looked for in the multifarious group <hi rend="italic">Picariae.</hi> Here we
                    have the singular <hi rend="italic">Steatornis</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Guacharo,</hi> vol. ix. p. 227), which, long confounded with the <hi

                    p. 711), has at last been recognized as an independent form, and one cannot but
                    think that it has branched off from a common ancestor with the Owls. The
                    Goatsuckers may have done the like,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The great resemblance in coloration between Goatsuckers and
                    Owls is of course obvious, so obvious indeed as to make one suspicious of their
                    being akin; but in reality the existence of the likeness is no bar to the
                    affinity of the groups; it merely has to be wholly disregarded.</p></note> for
                    there is really not much to ally them to the Swifts and Humming-birds, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Macroclιires</hi> proper, as has often been recommended. However,
                    the present writer would not have it supposed that he would place the <hi
                    rend="italic">Striges</hi> under the <hi rend="italic">Picariae,</hi> for the
                    last are already a sufficiently heterogeneous assemblage, and one with which he
                    would not meddle. Whether the Woodpeckers should be separated from the rest is a
                    matter of deeper consideration after the deliberate opinion of Prof. Parker, who
                    would lift them as <hi rend="italic">Saurognathae</hi> to a higher rank than
                    that in which Prof. Huxley left them as <hi rend="italic">Celeomorphae,</hi>
                    indeed to be the peers of <hi rend="italic">Sclùzognathae, Desmognathae,</hi>
                    and so forth; but this advancement is based solely on the characters of their
                    palatal structure, and is unsupported by any others. That the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pici</hi> constitute a very natural and easily defined group is indisputable;
                    more than that, they are perhaps the most differentiated group of all those that
                    are retained in the “Order” <hi rend="italic">Picariae</hi>; but it does not
                    seem advisable at present to deliver them from that chaos when so many other
                    groups have to be left in it.</p>
                <p>Lastly we arrive at the <hi rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> and here, as already
                    mentioned, the researches of Garrod and Forbes prove to be of immense service.
                    It is of course not to be supposed that they have exhausted the subject even as
                    regards their <hi rend="italic">Mesomyodi,</hi> while their <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acromyodi</hi> were left almost untouched so far as concerns details of
                    arrangement; but the present writer has no wish to disturb by other than very
                    slight modifications the scheme they put forth. He would agree with Mr Sclater
                    in disregarding the distinctions of <hi rend="italic">Desmodactyli</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Eleutlιerodactyli,</hi> grouping the former <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Eurylaemidsè)</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">Heteromeri</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Haploo-</hi><hi rend="italic">phonae,</hi> which all together then
                    might be termed the Suborder <hi rend="italic">Oligomyodi.</hi> To this would
                    follow as a second Suborder the <hi rend="italic">Tracheophonae</hi> as left by
                    Garrod, and then as a third Suborder the abnormal <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acromyodi,</hi> whether they are to be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pseudoscines</hi> or not, that small group containing, so far as is known at
                    present, only the two Families <hi rend="italic">Atrichiidae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Menuridae.</hi> Finally we have the normal <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acromyodi</hi> or true <hi rend="italic">Oscines.</hi></p>
                <p>This last and highest group of Birds is one which, as before hinted, it is very
                    hard to subdivide. Some two or three natural, because well-differentiated,
                    Families are to be found in it—such, for instance, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hirundinidae</hi> or Swallows, which have no near relations; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alaudidae</hi> or Larks, that can be unfailingly distinguished at
                    a glance by their scutellated <hi rend="italic">planta,</hi> as has been before
                    mentioned; or the <hi rend="italic">Meliphggidae</hi> with their curiously
                    constructed tongue. But the great mass, comprehending incomparably the greatest
                    number of genera and species of Birds, defies any sure means of separation. Here
                    and there, of course, a good many individual genera may be picked out capable of
                    the most accurate definition; but genera like these are in the minority, and
                    most of the remainder present several apparent alliances, from which we are at a
                    loss to choose that which is nearest. Four of the six groups of Mr Sclater’s
                    “Laminiplantar” <hi rend="italic">Oscines</hi> seem to pass almost imperceptibly
                    into one another. We may take examples in which what we may call the
                    Thrush-form, the Treecreeper-form, the Finch-form, or the Crow-form is pushed to
                    the most extreme point of differentiation, but we shall find that between the
                    outposts thus established there exists a regular chain of intermediate stations
                    so intimately connected that no precise lines of demarcation can be drawn
                    cutting off one from the other.</p>
                <p>Still one thing is possible. Hard though it be to find definitions for the
                    several groups of <hi rend="italic">Oscines,</hi> whether we make them more or
                    fewer, it is by no means so hard, if we go the right way to work, to determine
                    which of them is the highest, and, possibly, which of them is the lowest. It has
                    already been shewn (page 30) how, by a woeful want of the logical apprehension
                    of facts, the <hi rend="italic">Turdidae</hi> came to be accounted the highest,
                    and the position accorded to them has been generally acquiesced in by those who
                    have followed in the footsteps of Keyserling and <pb break="no"

                    the present writer the order thus prescribed seems to be almost the very reverse
                    of that which the doctrine of Evolution requires, and, so far from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Turdidae</hi> being at the head of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oscines,</hi> they are among its lower members. There is no doubt whatever as
                    to the intimate relationship of the Thrushes <hi rend="italic">(Turdidae)</hi>
                    to the Chats <hi rend="italic">(Saxicolinae),</hi> for that is admitted by
                    nearly every systematizer. Now most authorities on classification are agreed in
                    associating with the latter group the Birds of the Australian genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Petroeca</hi> and its allies—the so-called <hi rend="superscript">
                    u</hi> Robins” of the English-speaking part of the great southern communities.
                    But it so happens that, from the inferior type of the osteological characters of
                    this very group of Birds, Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps">Parker</hi> has called them
                    <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Zool. Society,</hi> v. p. 152) “Struthious Warblers.”
                    Now if the Pefr&lt;κcα-group be, as most allow, allied to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saxicolinae,</hi> they must also be allied, only rather more remotely, to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Turdidae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> for Thrushes and Chats
                    are inseparable, and therefore this connexion must drag down the Thrushes in the
                    scale. Let it be granted that the more highly-developed Thrushes have got rid of
                    the low “Struthious” features which characterize their Australian relatives, the
                    unbroken series of connecting forms chains them to the inferior position, and of
                    itself disqualifiés them from the rank so fallaciously assigned to them. Nor
                    does this consideration stand alone. By submitting the Thrushes and allied
                    groups of Chats and Warblers to other tests we may try still more completely
                    their claim to the position to which they have been advanced.</p>
                <p>Without attaching too much importance to the systematic value which the
                    characters of the nervous system afford, there can be little doubt that,
                    throughout the Animal Kingdom, where the nervous system is sufficiently
                    developed to produce a brain, the creatures possessing one are considerably
                    superior to those which have none. Consequently we may reasonably infer that
                    those which are the best furnished with a brain are superior to those which are
                    less well endowed in that respect, and that this inference is reasonable is in
                    accordance with the experience of every Physiologist, Comparative Anatomist, and
                    Palaeontologist, who are agreed that, within limits, the proportion which the
                    brain bears to the spinal marrow in a .vertebrate is a measure of that animal’s
                    morphological condition. These preliminaries being beyond contradiction, it is
                    clear that, if we had a series of accurate weights and measurements of Birds’
                    brains, it would go far to help us in deciding many cases of disputed
                    precedency, and especially such a case as we now have under discussion. To the
                    dispraise of Ornithotomists this subject has never been properly investigated,
                    and of late years seems to have been wholly neglected. The present writer can
                    only refer to the meagre lists given by <hi rend="smallcaps">Tiedemann</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat.</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Naturgesch.</hi><hi rend="italic">der Vögel,</hi> i. pp. 18-22), based for the
                    most part on very ancient observations; but, so far as those observations go,
                    their result is conclusive, for we find that in the Blackbird, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Turdus merula,</hi> the proportion which the brain bears to the body is lower
                    than in any of the <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oscines</hi> there named, being as 1 is to 67. In the Redbreast, <hi

                    rend="italic">Turdidae,</hi> it is as 1 to 32; while it is highest in two of the
                    Finches—the Goldfinch, <hi rend="italic">Carduelis elegans,</hi> and the
                    Canary-bird, <hi rend="italic">Serinus</hi><hi rend="italic">canarius,</hi>
                    being in each as 1 to 14. The signification of these numbers needs no comment to
                    be understood.</p>
                <p>Evidence of another kind may also be adduced in proof that the high place
                    hitherto commonly accorded to the <hi rend="italic">Turdidae</hi> is undeserved.
                    Throughout the Class <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> it is observable that the young
                    when first fledged generally assume a spotted plumage of a peculiar
                    character—nearly each of the body-feathers having a light-coloured spot at its
                    tip—and this is particularly to be remarked in most groups of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oscines,</hi> so much so indeed, that a bird thus marked may, in the majority
                    of cases, be set down without fear of mistake as being immature. All the
                    teachings of morphology go to establish the fact that any characters which are
                    peculiar to the immature condition of an animal, and are lost in its progress to
                    maturity, are those which its less advanced progenitors bore while adult, and
                    that in proportion as it gets rid of them it shews its superiority over its
                    ancestry. This being the case, it would follow that an animal which at no time
                    in its life exhibits such marks of immaturity or inferiority must be of a rank,
                    compared with its allies, superior to those which do exhibit these marks. The
                    same may be said of external and secondary sexual characters. Those of the
                    female are almost invariably to be deemed the survival of ancestral characters,
                    while those peculiar to the male are in advance of the older fashion, generally
                    and perhaps always the result of sexual selection.<note anchored="true"

                    mean one of two things—either that the male has not lifted himself much above
                    the condition of his mate, or that, he having raised himself, the female has
                    successfully followed his example. In the former alternative, as regards Birds,
                    we shall find that neither sex departs very much from the coloration of its
                    fellow-species; in the latter the departure may be very considerable. Now,
                    applying these principles to the Thrushes, we shall find that without exception,
                    so far as is known, the young have their first plumage more or less spotted;
                    and, except in some three or four species at most,<note anchored="true"

                <p>Therefore as regards capacity of brain and coloration of plumage priority ought
                    not to be given to the <hi rend="italic">Turdidae.</hi> It remains for us to see
                    if we can find the group which is entitled to that eminence. Among
                    Ornithologists of the highest rank there have been few whose opinion is more
                    worthy of attention than Macgillivray, a trained anatomist and a man of
                    thoroughly independent mind. Through the insufficiency of his opportunities, his
                    views on general classification were confessedly imperfect, but on certain
                    special points, where the materials were present for him to form a judgment, one
                    may generally depend upon it. Such is the case here, for his work shews him to

                    which questions that have been brought uppermost by the doctrine of Evolution
                    existed, and yet he seems not to have been without perception that such
                    questions might arise. In treating of what he termed the Order <hi rend="italic"

                    >(Brit. Birds,</hi> i. pp. 485, 486) that they “are to be accounted among the
                    most perfectly organized birds,” justifying the opinion by stating the reasons,
                    which are of a very varied kind, that led him to it. In one of the earlier
                    treatises of Prof. <hi rend="smallcaps">Parker,</hi> he has expressed <hi
                    rend="italic">(Trans. Zool. Society,</hi> v. p. 150) his approval of
                    Macgillivray’s views, adding that, “as that speaking, singing, mocking animal,
                    Man, is the culmination of the Mammalian series, so that bird in which the gifts
                    of speech, song, and mockery are combined must be considered as the top and
                    crown of the bird-class.” Any doubt as to which Bird is here intended is
                    dispelled by another passage, written ten <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0058-0049"/> years later, wherein <hi rend="italic">{Monthly
                    Microsc. Journal,</hi> 1872, p. 217) he says, “The Crow is the great
                    sub-rational chief of the whole kingdom of the Birds; he has the largest brain;
                    the most wit and wisdom;” and again, in the Zoological Society’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions</hi> (ix. p. 300), “In all respects, physiological,
                    morphological, and ornithological, the Crow may be placed at the head, not only
                    of its own great series (birds of the <hi rend="italic">Crow-form),</hi> but
                    also as the unchallenged chief of the whole of the ‘Carinatae.’”</p>
                <p>It is to be supposed that the opinion so strongly expressed in the passage last
                    cited has escaped the observation of recent systematizers; for he would be a
                    bold man who would venture to gainsay it. Still Prof. Parker has left untouched
                    or only obscurely alluded to one other consideration that has been here brought
                    forward in opposing the claim of the <hi rend="italic">Turdidae,</hi> and
                    therefore a few words may not be out of place on that point—the evidence
                    afforded by the coloration of plumage in young and old. Now the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corvidae</hi> fulfil as completely as is possible for any group of
                    Birds to do the obligations required by exalted rank. To the magnitude of their
                    brain beyond that of all other Birds Prof. Parker has already testified, and it
                    is the rule for their young at once to be clothed in a plumage which is
                    essentially that of the adult. This plumage may lack the lustrous reflexions
                    that are only assumed when it is necessary for the welfare of the race that the
                    wearer should don the best apparel, but then they are speedily acquired, and the
                    original difference between old and young is of the slightest. Moreover, this
                    obtains even in what we may fairly consider to be the weaker forms of the <hi

                    the theory of Reversion occasionally though rarely occur. In them the young are
                    more or less spotted with a lighter shade, and these exceptional cases, if
                    rightly understood, do but confirm the rule.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    groups in which the transformation in appearance from youth to full age is as

                    >Anthus.</hi> These anomalies cannot be explained as yet, but we see that they
                    do not extend to more than a portion, and generally a small portion, of the
                    groups in which they occur; whereas in the Crows the likeness between young and
                    old is, so far as is known, common to every member of the Family. It is
                    therefore confidently that the present writer asserts, as Prof. Parker, with far
                    more right to speak on the subject, has already done, that at the head of the
                    Class <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> must stand the Family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corvidae,</hi> of which Family no one will dispute the superiority of the genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Comms,</hi> nor in that genus the pre-eminence of <hi
                    rend="italic">Corvus corax—</hi> the widely-ranging Raven of the Northern
                    Hemisphere, the Bird perhaps best known from the most ancient times, and, as it
                    happens, that to which belongs the earliest historical association with man.
                    There are of course innumerable points in regard to the Classification of Birds
                    which are, and for a long time will continue to be, hypothetical as matters of
                    opinion, but this one seems to stand a fact on the firm ground of proof.</p>
                <p>During the compilation of much of the present article the writer flattered
                    himself with the hope that he might at its conclusion have been able to give a
                    graphic illustration of the way in which the various groups of Birds may be
                    conceived to be related to one another in the form of a map, such as has been so
                    usefully furnished by several of his more gifted brethren in regard to other
                    Classes or portions of Classes of the Animal Kingdom. This hope he has been
                    reluctantly constrained to abandon,—whether from the inherent difficulty,
                    perhaps impossibility, of at present executing the task, or from his own want of
                    charto-graphical skill, it is not for him to say. He may, however, be allowed to
                    express the belief that there is no group in Animated Nature that more assuredly
                    deserves the further attention of the highest zoological intellects than Birds;
                    and, looking to the perplexities which on all sides beset their scientific
                    study, there is no department of Zoology that will better repay the application
                    of those intellects than Ornithology. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
