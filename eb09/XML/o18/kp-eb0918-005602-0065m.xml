                <p><label type="entry">OSPREY, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Ospray</hi></label>, a word
                    said to be corrupted from “Ossifrage,” in Latin <hi rend="italic">Ossifraga</hi>
                    or bone-breaker. The <hi rend="italic">Ossifraga</hi> of Pliny (7Z. Λ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>., x. 3) and some other classical writers seems, as
                    already said, to have been the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lämmer-</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">geyer</hi> (vol. xiv. p. 244); but the name, not inapplicable
                    in that case, has been transferred—through a not uncommon but inexplicable
                    confusion—to another bird which is no breaker of bones, save incidentally those
                    of the fishes it devours.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    rend="italic">Röm.</hi><hi rend="italic">Philol.,</hi> i. p. 432), to arise from
                    a mingling of two wholly different sources:—(1) <hi rend="italic">Oripelargus,
                    Oriperagus, Orprais,</hi> and (2) <hi rend="italic">Ossifraga.</hi> “Orfraie”
                    again is occasionally interchanged with <hi rend="italic">Effraie</hi> (which,
                    through such dialectical forms as <hi rend="italic">Fresaie, Fressaia,</hi> is
                    said to come from the Latin <hi rend="italic">praesaga),</hi> the ordinary
                    French name for the Barn-Owl, <hi rend="italic">Aluco</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    p. 91); but the subject is too complex for any but an expert philologist to
                    treat. According to Prof. Skeat’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> (i. p. 408),
                    “Asprey” is the oldest English form; but “Osprey” dates from Cotgrave at
                    least.</p></note> The Osprey is a rapacious bird, of middling size and of
                    conspicuously-marked plumage, the white of its lower parts, and often of its
                    head, contrasting sharply with the dark brown of the back and most of its upper
                    parts when the bird is seen on the wing. It is the <hi rend="italic">Falco
                    haliaetus</hi> of Linnaeus, but unquestionably deserving generic separation was,
                    in 1810, established by Savigny <hi rend="italic">(Ois. de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >V</hi><hi rend="italic">Égypte,</hi> p. 35) as the type of a new genus which he
                    was pleased to term <hi rend="italic">Pandion</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a
                    name since pretty generally accepted. It has commonly been kept in the Family
                    <hi rend="italic">Falconidae,</hi> but of late regarded as the representative of
                    a separate Family, <hi rend="italic">Pandionidae,</hi> for which view not a
                    little can be said.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr
                    Sharpe goes further, and makes a “Suborder” <hi rend="italic">Pandiones;</hi>
                    but the characters on which he founds such an important division are obviously
                    inadequate. The other genus associated with <hi rend="italic">Pandion</hi> by
                    him has been shown by Mr Gurney <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1878, p. 455) to
                    be nearly allied to the ordinary Sea-Eagles <hi rend="italic">(Haliaetus),</hi>
                    and therefore one of the true <hi rend="italic">Falconidae.</hi></p></note><hi
                    rend="italic">Pandion</hi> differs from the <hi rend="italic">Falconidae</hi>
                    not only pterylologically, as long ago observed by Nitzsch, but also
                    osteologically, as pointed out by Μ. Alphonse Milne-Edwards <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ois.</hi><hi rend="italic">Foss. France,</hi> ii. pp. 413, 419), and it is a
                    curious fact that in some of the characters in which it differs structurally
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Falconidae,</hi> it agrees with certain of the Owls;
                    but the most important parts of its internal structure, as well as of its
                    pterylosis, quite forbid a belief that there is any near alliance of the two
                    groups.</p>
                <p>The Osprey is one of the most cosmopolitan Birds-of-Prey. From Alaska to Brazil,
                    from Lapland to Natal, from Japan to Tasmania, and in some of the islands of the
                    Pacific, it occurs as a winter-visitant or as a resident. The countries which it
                    does not frequent would be more easily named than those in which it is found—and
                    among the former are Iceland and New Zealand. Though migratory in Europe at
                    least, it is generally independent of climate. It breeds equally on the
                    half-thawed shores of Hudson’s Bay and on the cays of Honduras, in the dense
                    forests of Finland and on the barren rocks of the Red Sea, in Kamchatka and in
                    West Australia. Where, through abundance of food, it is numerous—as in former
                    days was the case in the eastern part of the United States—the nests of the
                    Fish-Hawk (to use its American name) may be placed on trees to the number of
                    three hundred close together. Where food is scarcer and the species accordingly
                    less plentiful, a single pair will occupy an isolated rock, and jealously expel
                    all intruders of their kind, as happens in Scotland.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Two good examples of the different localities
                    chosen by this bird for its nest are illustrated in <hi rend="italic">Ootheca
                    Wolleyana,</hi> pls. B. &amp; H.</p></note> The lover of birds cannot see many
                    more enjoyable spectacles than an Osprey engaged in fishing—poising itself
                    aloft, with upright body, and wings beating horizontally, ere it plunges like a
                    plummet beneath the water, and immediately after reappears shaking a shower of
                    drops from its plumage. The feat of carrying off an Osprey’s eggs is often
                    difficult, and attended with some risk, but has more than once tempted the most
                    daring of birds’ nesters. Apart from the dangerous situation not unfrequently
                    chosen by the birds for their eyry,— a steep rock in a lonely lake, only to be
                    reached after a <pb break="no"

                    a very tall tree,—their fierceness in defence of their eggs and young is not to
                    be despised. Men and boys have had their head gashed by the sharp claw of the
                    angry parent, and this happening when the robber is already in a precarious
                    predicament, and unable to use any defensive weapon, renders the enterprise
                    formidable. But the prize is worthy of the danger. Few birds lay eggs so
                    beautiful or so rich in colouring: their white or pale ground is spotted,
                    blotched, or marbled with almost every shade of purple, orange, and red—passing
                    from the most delicate lilac, buff, and peach blossom, through violet, chestnut,
                    and crimson, to a nearly absolute black. A few years ago some of the
                    best-informed ornithologists were led to think that persecution had exterminated
                    the Osprey from Great Britain, except as a chance visitant. This opinion proved
                    to be incorrect, and at the present time the bird is believed still to breed in
                    at least two counties of Scotland, but the secret of its resorts is carefully
                    guarded by those who wish to retain it as a member of the country’s fauna, for
                    publication would doubtless speedily put an end to its occupancy. <hi
