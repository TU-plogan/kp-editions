                <p><label type="entry">OWEN, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1616-1683),
                    theologian, was born of Puritan parents at Stadham in Oxfordshire in 1616. At
                    twelve years of age he was admitted at Queen’s College, Oxford, where he took
                    his B.A. degree in 1632 and M.A. in 1635. During these years he worked with such
                    diligence that he allowed himself but four hours sleep a night, and damaged his
                    health by this excessive labour. In 1637 he was driven from Oxford by his
                    refusal to comply with the requirements of Laud’s new statutes. Having taken
                    orders shortly before, he became chaplain and tutor in the family of Sir Robert
                    Dormer of Ascot in Oxfordshire. At the outbreak of the civil troubles he adopted
                    Parliamentary principles, and thus lost both his place and the prospects of
                    succeeding to his uncle’s fortune. For a while he lived in Charterhouse Yard, in
                    great unsettlement of mind on religious questions, which was removed at length
                    by a sermon which he accidently heard at St Michael’s in Wood Street.</p>
                <p>His first publication, in 1642, <hi rend="italic">The Display of
                        Arminianism,</hi> dedicated to the committee of religion, gained him the
                    living of Fordham in Essex, from which a “scandalous minister” had been ejected.
                    Here he was married, and by his marriage he had eleven children.</p>
                <p>Although he was thus formally united to Presbyterianism, Owen’s views were
                    originally inclined to those of the Independents, and, as he acquainted himself
                    more fully with the controversy, he became more resolved in that direction. He
                    represented, in fact, that large class of persons who, falling away from
                    Episcopacy, attached themselves to the very moderate form of Presbyterianism
                    which obtained in England as being that which came first in their way. His views
                    at this time are shown by his <hi rend="italic">Duty of Pastors and People
                        Distinguished.</hi> At Fordham he remained until 1646, when, the old
                    incumbent dying, the presentation lapsed to the patron, who gave it to some one
                    else. He was now, however, coming into notice, for on April 29 he preached
                    before the Parliament. In this sermon, and still more in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Thoughts on Church Government,</hi> which he appended to it, his tendency
                    to break away from Presbyterianism is displayed.</p>
                <p>The people of Coggeshall in Essex now invited him to become their pastor. Here he
                    declared his change by founding a church on Congregational principles, and, in
                    1647, by publishing <hi rend="italic">∑shcol,</hi> as well as various works
                    against Arminianism. He made the friendship of Fairfax while the latter was
                    besieging Colchester, and urgently addressed the army there against religious
                    persecution. He was chosen to preach to Parliament on the day after the
                    execution of Charles, and succeeded in fulfilling his task without mentioning
                    that event, and again on April 19, when he spake thus :—“The time shall come
                    when the earth shall disclose her slain, and not the simplest heretic shall have
                    his blood unrevenged; neither shall any atonement or expiation be allowed for
                    this blood, while a toe of the image, or a bone of the beast, is left
                    unbroken.”</p>
                <p>He now became acquainted with Cromwell, who carried him off to Ireland in 1649 as
                    his chaplain, that he might regulate the affairs of Trinity College; while there
                    he began the first of his frequent controversies with Baxter by writing against
                    the latter’s <hi rend="italic">Aphorisms of Justification.</hi> In 1650 he
                    accompanied Cromwell to Scotland, and returned to Coggeshall in 1651. In March
                    Cromwell, as chancellor, gave him the deanery of Christ Church, and made him <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0095-0086"/> vice-chancellor in September 1652. In 1651,
                    October 24, after Worcester, he preached the thanksgiving sermon before
                    Parliament. In October 1653 he was one of several ministers whom Cromwell,
                    probably to sound their views, summoned to a consultation as to church union. In
                    December in the same year he had the honour of D.D. conferred upon him by his
                    university. In the Parliament of 1654 he sat, but only for a short time, as
                    member for Oxford university, and, with Baxter, was placed on the committee for
                    settling the “fundamentals” necessary for the toleration promised in the
                    Instrument of Government. He was, too, one of the Triers, and appears to have
                    behaved with kindness and moderation in that capacity. As vice-chancellor he
                    acted with readiness and spirit when a general rising in the west seemed
                    imminent in 1655; his adherence to Cromwell, however, was by no means slavish,
                    for he drew up, at the request of Desborough and Pride, a petition against his
                    receiving the kingship (see Ludlow’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> ed. 1751,
                    p. 224). During the years 1654-58 his chief controversial works were <hi
                        rend="italic">Divina Justitia,</hi><hi rend="italic">The Perseverance of
                        Saints</hi> (against Goodwin), and <hi rend="italic">Vindictes
                        Evangelicae</hi> (against the Socinians). In 1658 he took a leading part in
                    the conference which drew up the Savoy Declaration.</p>
                <p>Baxter declares that at the death of Cromwell Owen joined the Wallingford House
                    party. This, though supported by the fact that under the Restoration he had
                    among his congregation a large number of these officers, Owen himself utterly
                    denied. He appears, however, to have assisted in the restoration of the Rump
                    Parliament, and, when Monk began his march into England, Owen, in the name of
                    the Independent churches, to whom Monk was supposed to belong, and who were
                    keenly anxious as to his intentions, wrote to dissuade him from the
                    enterprise.</p>
                <p>In March 1660, the Presbyterian party being uppermost, Owen was deprived of his
                    deanery, which was given back to Reynolds. He retired to Stadham, where he wrote
                    various controversial and theological works, in especial the laborious <hi
                        rend="italic">Tlιeologoumena Pantodapa,</hi> a history of the rise and
                    progress of theology. In 1661 was published the celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                        >Fiat Lux,</hi> a work in which the oneness and beauty of Roman Catholicism
                    are contrasted with the confusion and multiplicity of Protestant sects. At
                    Clarendon’s request Owen answered this in 1662 in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Animadversions</hi>; and this led of course to a prolonged controversy.
                    Clarendon now offered Owen perferment if he would conform. Owen’s condition for
                    making terms was liberty to all who agree in doctrine with the Church of
                    England; nothing therefore came of the negotiation.</p>
                <p>In 1663 he was invited by the Congregational churches in Boston, New England, to
                    become their minister, but declined. The Conventicle and Five Mile Acts soon
                    drove him to London; and in 1666, after the Fire, he, as did other leading
                    Nonconformist ministers, fitted up a room for public service and gathered a
                    congregation, composed chiefly of the old Commonwealth officers. Meanwhile he
                    was incessantly writing; and in 1667 he published his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Catechism,</hi> which led to a proposal from Baxter for union. Various
                    papers passed, and after a year the attempt was closed by the following
                    laconical note from Owen: “I am still a well-wisher to these mathematics.” It
                    was now, too, that he published the first part of his vast work upon the Epistle
                    to the Hebrews.</p>
                <p>In 1669 Owen wrote a spirited remonstrance to the Congregationalists in New
                    England, who, under the influence of Presbyterianism, had shown themselves
                    persecutors. At home, too, he was busy in the same cause. In 1670 Parker
                    attacked the Nonconformists in his own style of clumsy intolerance. Owen
                    answered him; Parker repeated his attack; Marvell wrote <hi rend="italic">The
                        Rehearsal Transprosed</hi>; and Parker is remembered by this alone.</p>
                <p>At the revival of the Conventicle Acts in 1670, Owen was appointed to draw up a
                    paper of reasons which was submitted to the House of Lords in protest. In this
                    or the following year Harvard university invited him to become their president;
                    he received similar invitations from some of the Dutch universities.</p>
                <p>When Charles issued his Declaration of Indulgence in 1672, Owen drew up an
                    address of thanks. This indulgence gave the dissenters an opportunity for
                    increasing their churches and services, and Owen was one of the first preachers
                    at the weekly lectures which the Independents and Presbyterians jointly held in
                    Plummer’s Hall. He was held in high respect by a large number of the nobility
                    (one of the many things which point to the fact that Congregationalism was by no
                    means the creed of the poor and insignificant), and during 1674 both Charles and
                    James held prolonged conversations with him in which they assured him of their
                    good wishes to the dissenters. Charles gave him 1000 guineas to relieve those
                    upon whom the severe laws had chiefly pressed. In 1674 Owen was attacked by one
                    Dr Sherlock, whom he easily vanquished, and from this time until 1680 he was
                    engaged upon his ministry and the writing of religious works. In 1680, however,
                    Stillingfleet having on May 11 preached his sermon on “The Mischief of
                    Separation,” Owen defended the Nonconformists from the charge of schism in his
                        <hi rend="italic">Brief Vindication.</hi> Baxter and Howe also answered
                    Stillingfleet, who replied in <hi rend="italic">The Unreasonableness of
                        Separation.</hi> Owen again answered this, and then left the controversy to
                    a swarm of eager combatants. From this time to his death he was occupied with
                    continual writing, disturbed only by an absurd charge of being concerned in the
                    Rye House Plot. His most important work was his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on
                        Evangelical Churches,</hi> in which were contained his latest views
                    regarding church government. During his life he issued more than eighty separate
                    publications, many of them of great size. Of these a list may be found in Orme’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Owen.</hi> For some years before his death Owen
                    had suffered greatly from stone and asthma. He died quietly, though after great
                    pain, at Ealing, on August 24, 1683, and was buried on September 4th in Bunhill
                    Fields, being followed to the grave by a large procession of persons of
                    distinction. “In younger age a most comely and majestic form; but in the latter
                    stages of life, depressed by constant infirmities, emaciated with frequent
                    diseases, and above all crushed under the weight of intense and unremitting
                    studies, it became an incommodious mansion for the vigorous exertions of the
                    spirit in the service of its God.”</p>
