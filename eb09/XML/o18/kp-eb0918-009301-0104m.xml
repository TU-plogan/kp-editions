                    very irregular, its breadth varying from about 7 to 27∣ miles, and its greatest
                    length being about 52 miles. The total area is 483,621 acres, or about 756
                    square miles. The character of the scenery varies greatly in different
                    districts. The Chiltern Hills cross the south-western extremity of the county
                    from northeast to south-west. On the west side of the ridge Nettlebed Hill
                    expands into Nettlebed Common, an extensive table-land, reaching at some points
                    nearly 700 feet above sea-level. The Chiltern district is supposed to have been
                    at one time covered by forest, and there are still many fine beeches, as well as
                    oak and ash trees, although for the most part the district is now utilized as a
                    sheep-walk or as arable land. Camden mentions the woods of Oxfordshire as a
                    special feature of the county. The forest of Wychwood extended to 3735 acres of
                    forest proper. In the district of Staunton St John there are considerable traces
                    of natural woodland. The most extensive of the recent plantations is the great
                    belt at Blenheim. Immediately to the east of the city of Oxford a range of hills
                    stretches between the valleys of the Thames and Cherwell, the highest point
                    being Shotover Hill, 560 feet. In the central district the surface is less
                    varied, and along the rivers there are extensive tracts of flat land, but the
                    finely cultivated fields and the abundance of wood lend an aspect of richness to
                    the landscape. The northern part of the county is flat and bare, its bleakness
                    and monotony being increased in some districts by the stone fences. Wychwood has
                    been recently disafforested by statute.</p>
                <p>Oxfordshire abounds in streams and watercourses, the majority of which belong to
                    the basin of the Thames, which skirts the whole southern border· of the county,
                    forming for the most part of its course the boundary with Berks. In the earlier
                    part of its course it is called the Isis. Before reaching the city of Oxford it
                    receives the Windrush, and the united waters of the Evenlode and Glyme. It then
                    divides into various channels, but these soon unite, and the river flowing round
                    the city receives the united streams of the Cherwell and the Ray, and passes
                    south-east to Dorchester, where it is joined by the Thame. From this point it is
                    called the Thames. The Windrush and Evenlode both flow south-east from
                    Gloucestershire; the Cherwell traverses the whole length of the county south
                    from Northamptonshire; and the Thame crosses its south-east corner from Bucks.
                    The Thames is navigable for small craft to Gloucestershire, and for vessels of
                    considerable burden to Oxford. The Oxford Canal, 91 miles long, begun in 1769
                    and finished in 1790, enters the north-eastern extremity of the county near
                    Claydon, and following the course of the Cherwell passes south to the city of
                    Oxford.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The low ground in the north-west, along the vale
                    of Moreton, on the banks of the Cherwell as far as Steeple Aston, and along the
                    banks of the Evenlode, is occupied by the blue clays of the Lower Lias, the
                    higher regions being occupied by the Middle Lias. The Lower Lias contains beds
                    of hard shelly limestone called Banbury marble, which is worked into
                    chimneypieces; and associated with the blue limestone of the Middle Lias there
                    is a valuable deposit of brown haematite iron which is largely worked at
                    Adderbury near Banbury, the total quantity obtained in 1882 being 8614 tons,
                    valued at £1507. At one time the marlstone was covered by the Upper Lias clays,
                    but these are now found only in isolated strips and patches. Beds of Oolite,
                    called Northampton Sands, rest on the higher ridges above the Upper Lias, and
                    the Great Oolite is exposed on both sides of the Evenlode and extensively
                    quarried for building purposes, the upper beds forming also a white limestone
                    containing numerous fossils. Forest marble occupies the greater part of Wychwood
                    Forest, Blenheim Park, and adjoining regions. A wide extent of flat
                    uninteresting country in the south-west, stretching as far east as the city of
                    Oxford, belongs to the Oxford clay. Coral rag, Kimmeridge clay, and white
                    limestone occur at different places in the neighbourhood of the Thames. There
                    are also various outliers of Upper and Lower Greensand. At the junction of the
                    Chalk with the Greensand there is a line of springs which have determined the
                    sites of numerous villages. Chalk forms the ridges of the Chiltern Hills, and
                    Upper Chalk with flint extends eastward a considerable distance beyond them. In
                    the northern and eastern districts there are large accumulations of drift along
                    all the old river valleys; and a considerable breadth of flat country on the
                    banks of the Thames and Cherwell is occupied by alluvial deposits. Ochre of
                    remarkably fine quality is obtained from Shotover Hill.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate, Soil, and Agriculture.—</hi> The climate is salubrious
                    and dry, but generally colder than the other southern districts of England,
                    especially in the bleak and exposed regions of the Chilterns. Crops are later in
                    the uplands than in more northerly situations at a lower elevation. Agriculture
                    is in a fairly advanced condition, but the possibilities of improvement are not
                    by any means exhausted, as the soil is on the whole above the average in
                    fertility. In the northern districts there is a strong yet friable loam, well
                    adapted for all kinds of crops. The centre of the county is occupied for the
                    most part by a good friable but not so rich soil, formed of decomposed
                    sandstone, chalk, and limestone. A large district in the south-east is occupied
                    by the chalk of the Chiltern Hills, at one time covered by a forest of beech,
                    but now partly arable and partly used as sheep-walks. The remainder of the
                    county is occupied by a variety of miscellaneous soils ranging from coarse sand
                    to heavy tenacious clay, and occasionally very fertile.</p>
                <p>According to the agricultural returns of 1883, as many as 417,509 acres, or about
                    eight-ninths of the total of the county, were under cultivation, corn crops
                    occupying 152,437 acres, green crops 52,451, rotation grasses 44,472, and
                    permanent pasture 153,898. Wheat and barley, with 51,796 acres and 47,611 acres
                    respectively, occupy the largest areas among corn crops, and oats and beans come
                    next with 31,771 and 14,389. Potatoes are not much grown, but turnips occupy as
                    many as 34,618 acres. The most common course of crops on lighter soils is a four
                    years’ rotation, sometimes lengthened to six years with pease, oats, or similar
                    crops. On heavier soils the course is first turnips or other roots, second
                    barley or oats, third three or more years of clover and grass seed, fourth
                    wheat, and finally beans. Along the smaller streams there are very rich meadows
                    for grazing, but those on the Thames and Cherwell are subject to floods. On the

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0105-0094"/> hills there are extensive sheep pastures. Horses
                    in 1883 numbered 17,454, of which 13,716 were used solely for purposes of
                    agriculture. The number of cattle was 50,209, of which 16,914 were cows and
                    heifers in milk or in calf. The dairy system prevails in many places, but the
                    milk is manufactured into butter, little cheese being made. The improved
                    shorthorn is the most common breed, but Alderney and Devonshire cows are largely
                    kept. Sheep numbered as many as 270,288, of which 157,243 were one year old and
                    upwards. Southdowns are kept on the lower grounds, and Leicesters and Cotswolds
                    on the hills. Pigs in 1883 numbered 44,682, the county being famous for its
                    “brawn.”</p>
                <p>According to the latest return, the land was divided among 10,177 proprietors,
                    possessing 452,232 acres, at an annual value of £1,073,246, an average per acre
                    of about £2, 7s. Of the owners, 6833 possessed less than one acre, and the
                    following 10 upwards of 5000 acres, viz., the duke of Marlborough, 21,945; earl
                    of Ducie, 8799; earl of Abingdon, 8174; Μ. P. W. Boulton, 7946; Sir H. W.
                    Dashwood, 7515; earl of Jersey, 7043; Edward W. Harcourt, 5721; earl of
                    Macclesfield, 5491; Viscount Dillon, 5444; and Lord F. G. Churchhill, 5352.
                    Upwards of 30,000 acres were held by various colleges of Oxford, the largest
                    owner being Christ Church, 4837 acres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Blankets are manufactured at Witney, and
                    tweeds, girths, and horsecloths at Chipping Norton. There are paper mills at
                    Hampton-Gay, Shiplake, Sandford-on-Thames, Woolvercot,and Eynsham. Agricultural
                    implements and portable engines are made at Banbury, and gloves at Woodstock,
                    where the polished steel work has long ago ceased. A large number of women and
                    girls are employed in several of the towns and villages in the lace
                    manufacture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> The county is traversed by several branches of
                    the Great Western, which skirts its borders, and by the East Gloucestershire and
                    the London and North-Western Railways.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> Oxfordshire comprises
                    fourteen hundreds, the municipal boroughs of Banbury (3600) and Chipping Norton
                    (4167), the greater part of the city of Oxford, of which the remainder is in
                    Berkshire, and a small portion of the municipal borough of Abingdon, of which
                    the remainder is also in Berkshire. It has one court of quarter sessions, and is
                    divided into ten petty and special sessional divisions. The boroughs of Abingdon
                    and Banbury and the city of Oxford have commissions of the peace and separate
                    courts of quarter sessions. For parliamentary purposes the county is not
                    divided; it returns three members, having previous to the Reform Act of 1832
                    returned only two. The borough of Woodstock returns one member; and there are
                    parts of four other boroughs within the county, Oxford city returning two
                    members, and Abingdon, Banbury, and Wallingford one each. The university of
                    Oxford also returns two members. The county contains 292 civil parishes, with
                    parts of seven others. It is almost entirely in the diocese of Oxford. The
                    population in 1801 was 111,977, which by 1841 had increased to 163,143, by 1851
                    to 170,439, by 1871 to 177,975, and by 1881 to 179,559. of whom 88,025 were
                    males and 91,534 females. The average number of persons to an acre was 0 '37,
                    and of acres to a person 2 '69.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> At the Roman invasion the
                    district was inhabited by the Dobuni. To this early British period probably
                    belong the circle of stones and cromlech near Chipping Norton, the cromlech
                    called the “Hoarstone” at Enstone, and the scattered stones called the Devil’s
                    Quoits at Stanton-Harcourt. Icknield Street crossed the centre of the county
                    from Goring in the southwest to Chinnor in the north-east, and joined Watling
                    Street in Northamptonshire. Akeman Street crossed the county from east to west,
                    entering it from Bucks at Ambrosden, and passing through Chesterton,
                    Kirtlington, Blenheim Park, Stonesfield, and Asthall to Gloucestershire. Between
                    Mongewell and Nuffield there is a vallum with embankment 2⅜ miles in length
                    called Grimes Dyke or Devil’s Ditch; and there are remains of another with the
                    same name between the Glyme and the Evenlode near Ditchley. Traces still exist
                    of Roman and British camps, and on the east side of the Cotswolds the square and
                    the round camps lie together in pairs. Numerous Roman coins have been found at
                    Dorchester, and tesselated pavements at Great Tew and Stonesfield. For a long
                    time Oxford was the residence of the monarchs of Mercia. Cuthred of Wessex in
                    752 disowned the overlordship of Ethelbald of Mercia, whom he defeated at
                    Burford. From this time a portion of Oxfordshire seems to have been subject to
                    Wessex, but Offa of Mercia inflicted in 779 a severe defeat on the West Saxons
                    under Cynewulf, after which Oxfordshire probably became Mercian. The district of
                    Oxford was frequently the scene of conflict during the long contests between the
                    Saxons and the Danes, the latter of whom reduced the city of Oxford four times
                    to ashes, and in the 11th century occupied nearly the whole region. In 1387 the
                    insurgent nobles defeated the earl of Oxford at Radcot Bridge near Bampton. In
                    1469 the farmers and peasants of Yorkshire, to the number of 15,000, under the
                    leadership of Robin of Redesdale, marched to Banbury, and defeated and captured
                    the earl of Pembroke at Danes Moor on the borders of Oxford. During the civil
                    wars the county was frequently entered by the armies both of the Parliament and
                    the king, the more important incidents being the seizing of Oxford, Banbury, and
                    Broughton by the Royalists; the assembling of the adherents of the king at the
                    city of Oxford in 1644; the capture of the city by Fairfax in 1646; the surprise
                    of the Parliamentarians by Rupert at Caversham; their repulse at Chaigrove
                    Field, where Hampden received his death-wound; and the defeat of the Royalist
                    forces by Cromwell at Islip Bridge.</p>
                <p>Some portions still remain of the old Norman castle at Oxford; there are traces
                    of a moat at Banbury; of the castle at Bampton, the seat of Aylmer de Valence in
                    1313, there are a chamber and other fragments; and Broughton Castle is a good
                    moated house of various periods. Among old mansions, mention may be made of
                    Shirbum Castle, Mapledurham House, Chastleton House, Rousham Park, Crowsley
                    Park, Hardwick House, Shipton Court, Stonor Park, Stanton-Harcourt Manor House,
                    and Wroxton Abbey. In regard to Burford Priory, the High Lodge at Blenheim Park,
                    and the old manor houses of Holton and Minster Lovell, the interest is chiefly
                    historical. The most interesting churches, in addition to those in the city of
                    Oxford, are Iffley, Norman, one of the finest specimens of early ecclesiastical
                    architecture in England; Thame, with tombs and brasses; Bampton, mostly
                    tιansitional from Early English and Decorated; Kidlington, Decorated, with a
                    chancel and tower of earlier date; Ewelme, Perpendicular; Adderbury, with a
                    chancel built by William of Wykeham; Bloxham, with spire said to have been
                    erected by Wolsey; Burford, Norman and later; Chipping Norton, with brasses of
                    the 14th century; Dorchester, once an abbey church; Stanton-Harcourt, with Early
                    English chancel; Witney, Early English and Decorated, with Norman doorway. Among
                    the religious foundations in addition to those in the city were a college and
                    hospital at Banbury; an abbey of Austin canons at Bicester; a Cistercian abbey
                    at Bruern; a hospital at Burford; an Austin cell at Caversham; an alien priory
                    at Charlton-on-Otmoor; a Gilbertine priory at Clattercote; an alien priory of
                    Black monks ε,t Coggs; an Austin priory at Cold Norton; a hospital at Crowmarsh;
                    a priory of Austin canons at Dorchester; a hospital at Ewelme; a Benedictine
                    abbey at Eynsham; a priory of Austin nuns at Goring; a preceptory at Gosford; a
                    Benedictine house at Milton; an alien priory at Minster Lovell; an abbey of
                    Austin canons at Osney; a preceptory at Sandford-on-Thames; a Cistercian abbey
                    at Thame; an establishment of the Mathurins at Tuffield; a hospital at
                    Woodstock; and a house of Austin canons at Wroxton. There was a bishopric at
                    Dorchester as a West Saxon see from 634 to 705, which was restored towards the
                    close of the 9th century as a Mercian see. The bishopric was transferred to
                    Lincoln in 1067, from which Oxfordshire was separated and erected into a see in
                    1545. The diocese was enlarged by the addition of Berks in 1836 and of Bucks in
