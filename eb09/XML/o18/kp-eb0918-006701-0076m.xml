                    Otho’s mother. Otho distinguished himself in the war between England and France,
                    and in 1196 Richard I. made him duke of Aquitaine and count of Poitou. In 1197,
                    when the majority of the German princes, disregarding the previous election of
                    Frederick II., offered the crown to Philip of Swabia, a party in the Rhine
                    country, headed by the archbishop of Cologne, set up Otho as anti-king, and he
                    was crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle. The result was a civil war which lasted about
                    ten years, Philip being supported by most of the German princes and by the king
                    of France, Otho by the kings of England and Denmark. For some time Pope Innocent
                    hesitated to take part with either side, but at last he declared for Otho, who
                    promised to make over certain fiefs claimed by the holy see. Notwithstanding the
                    pope’s aid, Otho’s cause did not prosper; but in 1208 Philip was murdered by
                    Otho of Wittelsbach, and then Otho IV. was universally acknowledged as king. On
                    the 27th September 1209, at Rome, he was crowned emperor by the pope, to whom he
                    had made new and more important concessions. Otho gave deadly offence to
                    Innocent by seizing Ancona and Spoleto, which had been united to the papal
                    territories; and, when the emperor, having conquered Apulia, was about to cross
                    to Sicily, the pope excommunicated him, released the German princes from their
                    oath of allegiance, and recognized the right of Frederick II. to the throne. In
                    1212 Otho returned to Germany, where he acted with so much vigour that he seemed
                    to be capable of defying the papacy; but he immediately lost ground when
                    Frederick II., a youth of brilliant genius, appeared as his rival. After the
                    battle of Bouvines (July 27, 1214), in which Otho, with King John of England,
                    was defeated by the French, the discredited emperor had no chance of recovering
                    his position. He made some ineffectual attempts to assert his claims, but
                    ultimately he contented himself with the principality of Brunswick, which he had
                    inherited when the Guelphic territories were divided in 1202. On the 19 th of
                    May 1218 he died at the Harzburg.</p>
