                            of</hi></label> (1661- 1724), the eldest son of Sir Edward Harley, a
                    prominent landowner in Herefordshire, was born in Bow Street, Covent Garden,
                    London, 5th December 1661. His school days were passed near Burford, in
                    Oxfordshire, in a small school which produced at the same time a lord high
                    treasurer, a lord high chancellor, and a lord chief justice of the common pleas.
                    The principles of Whiggism and Nonconformity were instilled into his mind at an
                    early age, and if he changed the politics of his ancestors he never formally
                    abandoned their religious opinions. At the Revolution of 1688 Sir Edward and his
                    son raised a troop of horse in support of the cause of William III., and took
                    possession of the city of Worcester in his interest. The family zeal for the
                    Revolution recommended Robert Harley to the notice of the Boscawen family, and
                    led to his election, in April 1689, as the parliamentary representative of
                    Tregony, a borough under their control. He remained its member for one
                    parliament, when he was elected by the constituency of New Radnor, and he
                    continued to represent it until his elevation to the peerage in 1711. From the
                    first he gave great attention to the conduct of public business, bestowing
                    especial care upon the study of the forms and ceremonies of the House, and
                    acquiring from his labours that distinction which a knowledge of parliamentary
                    precedents always bestows. This reputation marked him out as a fitting person to
                    preside over the debates of the House, and from the general election of February
                    1701 until the dissolution of 1705 he held with general approbation the office
                    of speaker. For a part of this period, from 18th May 1704, he combined with the
                    speakership the duties of a principal secretary of state, displacing in that
                    office the Tory earl of Nottingham, a circumstance which may have impelled that
                    haughty peer to join the Whigs, some years later, in opposition to the treaty of
                    Utrecht. At the time of his appointment as secretary of state Harley had given
                    no outward sign of dissatisfaction with the Whigs, and it was mainly through
                    Marlborough’s good opinion of his abilities that he was admitted to the
                    ministry. For some time, so long indeed as the victories of the great English
                    general cast a glamour over the policy of his friends, and the constituencies
                    were enthusiastic in support of a war policy, Harley continued to act loyally
                    with his colleagues. But in the summer of 1707 it became evident to Godolphin
                    that some secret influence behind the throne was opposing his wishes and shaking
                    the confidence of the queen in her ministers. The sovereign had resented the
                    intrusion into the administration of the impetuous earl of Sunderland, and had
                    persuaded herself that the safety of the church depended on the fortunes of the
                    Tories. These convictions were strengthened in her mind by the new favourite
                    Abigail <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n111/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0111-0100"/> Hill (a relative of the duchess of
                    Marlborough through her mother, and of Harley on her father’s side), whose soft
                    and silky ways contrasted only too favourably in the eyes of the queen with the
                    haughty manners of her old friend, the duchess of Marlborough. Both the duchess
                    and Godolphin communicated to Marlborough their belief that this change in the
                    disposition of the queen was due to the sinister conduct of Harley and his
                    relatives, and the persistent protestations of the accused persons to the
                    contrary were accepted with an ill grace. Although Harley was for the present
                    permitted to remain in his office, subsequent experience convinced the chiefs of
                    the Government of the necessity for his dismissal, and an occurrence which
                    showed the remissness of his official conduct, if it did not prove his treachery
                    to the nation, furnished them with an opportunity for carrying out their wishes.
                    An ill-paid and poverty-stricken clerk in Harley’s office was detected in
                    furnishing the enemy with copies of many documents which should have been kept
                    from the knowledge of all but the most trusted advisers of the court, and it was
                    found that through the carelessness of the head of the department the contents
                    of such papers became the common property of all in his service. The queen was
                    thereupon informed that Godolphin and Marlborough could no longer serve in
                    concert with a minister whom they distrusted, and of whose incapacity there were
                    such proofs. They did not attend her next council, and when Harley proposed to
                    proceed with the business of the day one of their friends drew attention to
                    their absence, when the queen found herself forced (llth February 1708) to
                    accept the resignation of her secret adviser. At that time it seemed as if
                    Harley’s fortunes had sunk for ever.</p>
                <p>Harley went out of office, but his cousin, who had now become Mrs Masham,
                    remained by the side of the queen, and contrived to convey to her mistress the
                    views of the ejected minister. Every device which the defeated ambition of a man
                    whose strength lay in his aptitude for intrigue could suggest for hastening the
                    downfall of his adversaries was employed without scruple, and not employed in
                    vain. The cost 'of the protracted war with France, the danger to the national
                    church, the chief proof of which lay in the prosecution of Sacheverell, were the
                    weapons which he used to influence the masses of the people. Marlborough himself
                    could not be dispensed with, but his proud spirit was insulted in a thousand
                    ways, and his relations were dismissed from their posts in turn. When the
                    greatest of these, Lord Godolphin, was sent into private life, five
                    commissioners to the treasury were appointed (10th August 1710), and among them
                    figured Harley as chancellor of the exchequer. It was the aim of the new
                    chancellor to frame an administration from the moderate members of both parties,
                    and to adopt with but slight changes the policy of his predecessors; but his
                    efforts were doomed to disappointment. The Whigs refused to join in an alliance
                    with the man whose rule began with the retirement from the treasury of the
                    finance minister idolized by the city merchants, and the Tories, who were
                    successful beyond their wildest hopes at the polling booths, could not
                    understand why their leaders should pursue a system of government which copied
                    the faults of their political opponents. The clamours of the wilder spirits of
                    the party, the country members who met at the “October Club,” began to be
                    re-echoed even by those who were attached to the person of Harley, when, through
                    an unexpected event, his popularity was restored at a bound. A French refugee,
                    the ex-abbé de la Bourlie (better known by the name of the marquis de Guiscard),
                    was being examined before the privy council on a charge of treachery to the
                    nation which had befriended him, when he stabbed Harley in the breast with a
                    penknife (March 1711). To a man in good health the wounds would not have been
                    serious, but the minister had been for some time indisposed—a few days before
                    the occurrence Swift had penned the prayer “Pray God preserve his health,
                    everything depends upon it ”—and the joy of the nation on his recovery knew no
                    bounds. Both Houses presented an address to the crown, suitable response came
                    from the queen, and on Harley’s reappearance in the Lower House the speaker made
                    an oration which was spread broadcast through the country. On the 24th May 1711
                    the minister became Baron Harley of Wigmore and earl of Oxford and Mortimer;
                    before the month was ended he was created lord treasurer, and in the following
                    year he became a knight of the Garter. Well might his friends exclaim that he
                    had “grown by persecutions, turnings out, and stabbings.”</p>
                <p>With the sympathy which this attempted assassination had evoked, and with the
                    skill which the lord treasurer possessed for conciliating the calmer members of
                    either political party, he passed through several months of office without any
                    loss of reputation. He rearranged the nation’s finances, and continued to
                    support her generals in the field with ample resources for carrying on the
                    campaign, though his emissaries were in communication with the French king, and
                    were settling the terms of a peace independently of England’s allies. After many
                    weeks of vacillation and intrigue, when the negotiations were frequently on the
                    point of being interrupted, the preliminary peace was signed, and in spite of
                    the opposition of the Whig majority in the Upper House, which was met by the
                    creation of twelve new peers, the much-vexed treaty of Utrecht was at last
                    brought to a conclusion. While these negotiations were under discussion the
                    friendship between Oxford and St John was fast changing into hatred. The latter
                    had resented the rise in fortune which the stabs of Guiscard had secured for his
                    colleague, and when he was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron St John
                    and Viscount Bolingbroke, instead of with an earldom, his resentment knew no
                    bounds. The royal favourite, whose husband had been called to the Upper House as
                    Baron Masham, deserted her old friend and relation for his more vivacious rival.
                    The Jacobites found that, although the lord treasurer was profuse in his
                    expressions of good will for their cause, no steps were taken to ensure its
                    triumph, and they no longer placed reliance in promises which were repeatedly
                    made and repeatedly broken. Even Oxford’s friends began to complain of his
                    habitual dilatoriness, and to find some excuse for his apathy in ill health,
                    aggravated by excess in the pleasures of the table and by the loss of his
                    favourite child. By slow degrees the confidence of Queen Anne was transferred
                    from Oxford toBolingbroke; on the 27 th July 1714 the former surrendered his
                    staff as lord treasurer, and on the 1st August the queen died.</p>
                <p>On the accession of George I. the defeated minister retired to Herefordshire, but
                    a few months later his impeachment was decided upon and he was committed to the
                    Tower. After an imprisonment of nearly two years the prison doors were opened,
                    and he was allowed to resume his place among the peers, but he took little part
                    in public affairs, and died almost unnoticed 21st May 1724. Harley’s political
                    fame may now be dimmed by time, his statesmanship may seem but intrigue and
                    finesse, but his character is set forth in the brightest colours in the poems of
                    Pope and the prose of Swift. The Irish dean was his discriminating friend in the
                    hours of prosperity, his unswerving advocate in adversity. The books and
                    manuscripts which the first earl of Oxford and his son collected were among the
                    glories of their age. The manuscripts became the property of the nation; the
                    books were sold to a bookseller called Osborne, and described in <pb break="no"
