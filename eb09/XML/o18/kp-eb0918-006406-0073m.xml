                    the family honours the dignity of a consulship. Otho himself first appears in
                    history as one of the most reckless and extravagant of the young nobles who
                    surrounded Nero and shared his revels. But his friendship with that emperor was
                    brought to an abrupt close in 58 A.D., when Otho was only twenty-six years old,
                    by his refusal to divorce his beautiful wife Poppaea Sabina at the bidding of
                    Nero, who was enslaved by her charms. The emperor, impatient as usual of
                    anything that hindered the gratification of his passions, at once removed Otho
                    from the scene by appointing him governor of the remote province of Lusitania.
                    In this honourable exile Otho remained for ten years, and, contrary to all
                    expectation, his administration was marked by a moderation unusual at the time.
                    When in 68 his neighbour Galba, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, rose in
                    revolt against Nero, Otho at once joined him and accompanied him to Rome.
                    Resentment at the treatment he had received from Nero may very well have
                    impelled him to this course, but to this motive was added before long that of
                    personal ambition. Galba was far advanced in years, and Otho, encouraged by the
                    predictions of astrologers, aspired to succeed him, and, as a preliminary step,
                    to be adopted as his heir by the emperor himself. With this object in view he
                    set himself to win the affections of the soldiery and the populace in Rome, who,
                    disgusted by Galba’s old-fashioned parsimony and severity, were easily brought
                    to look favourably upon a claimant for the imperial purple whose open-handed
                    generosity and easy manners promised a return of the golden years of Nero. But
                    in January 69 his hopes in this direction were dissipated by Galba’s formal
                    adoption of L. Calpurnius Piso as the fittest man to succeed him. Nothing now
                    remained for Otho but to strike a bold blow for the prize which seemed to be
                    slipping from his grasp. Desperate as was the state of his finances, thanks to
                    his previous extravagance, he found money enough to purchase the services of
                    some three-and-twenty soldiers of the praetorian guard, with whom he arranged
                    his plan of operations. On the morning of January 15, five days only after the
                    adoption of Piso, Otho attended as usual to pay his respects to the emperor, and
                    then hastily excusing himself on the score of private business hurried from the
                    Palatine to meet his slender band of accomplices in the forum. By them he was
                    escorted to the praetorian camp, where, after a few moments of surprise and
                    indecision, he was saluted imperator by the assembled troops. At the head of an
                    imposing force he returned to the forum, and at the foot of the Capitol
                    encountered Galba himself, who, alarmed by vague rumours of treachery, was
                    making his way through a dense crowd of wondering citizens towards the barracks
                    of the guard. The cohort on duty at the Palatine, which had accompanied the
                    emperor, instantly deserted him; Galba himself was brutally murdered by the
                    fierce praetorians, and his fate was shared by his adopted heir Piso, and by his
                    chief confidants and advisers. The brief struggle over, Otho returned in triumph
                    to the camp. Towards sunset on the same day he proceeded to the senate-house,
                    and there was duly invested by the senators with the name of Augustus, the
                    tribunician power, and the other dignities belonging to the principate. Otho had
                    owed his success largely, not only to the resentment felt by the praetorian
                    guards at Galba’s well-meant attempts to curtail their privileges in the
                    interests of discipline, but also to the attachment felt in Rome for the memory
                    of Nero; and his first acts as emperor showed that he was not unmindful of the
                    fact. He accepted, or appeared to accept, the cognomen of Nero conferred upon
                    him by the shouts of the populace, whom his comparative youth and the effeminacy
                    of his appearance reminded of their lost favourite. Nero’s statues were again
                    set up, his freedmen and household officers reinstalled in their places, and the
                    intended completion of the Golden House announced. At the same time the fears of
                    the more sober and respectable citizens were allayed by Otho’s liberal
                    professions of his intention to govern equitably, and by his judicious clemency
                    towards Marius Celsus, consul-designate, a devoted adherent of Galba. These
                    favourable symptoms were eagerly seized upon as promising better things than
                    could have been hoped for from one who was only known as yet in Rome as a
                    passionate and reckless profligate and spendthrift.</p>
                <p>But any further development of Otho’s policy was speedily checked by the news
                    which reached Rome shortly after his accession, that the army in Germany had
                    declared for Vitellius, the commander of the legions on the lower Rhine, and
                    were already advancing upon Italy under the conmand of Vitellius’s two
                    lieutenants, Fabius Valens and Alienus Caecina. After in vain attempting to
                    conciliate Vitellius by the offer of a share in the empire, Otho, with
                    unexpected vigour, prepared for war. His resources were not contemptible. From
                    the remoter provinces, indeed, which had acquiesced in his accession little help
                    was to be expected; but the legions of Dalmatia, Pannonia, and Moesia were eager
                    in his cause, the praetorian cohorts were in themselves a formidable force, and
                    an efficient fleet gave him the mastery of the Italian seas. Nor was he himself
                    wanting in promptitude. The fleet was at once despatched to secure Liguria, and
                    on March 14 Otho, undismayed by omens and prodigies, started northwards at the
                    head of his troops, in the hopes of preventing the entry of the Vitellian troops
                    into Italy. But for this he was too late. Both Valens and Caecinar had already
                    crossed the Alps,—the former by the Cottian, the latter by the Pennine
                    passes,—and all that could be done was to throw troops into Placentia and hold
                    the line of the Po. The campaign opened favourably for Otho. His advanced guard
                    successfully defended Placentia against Caecina, and compelled that general to
                    fall back on Cremona. But the arrival of Valens altered the aspect of affairs.
                    The Vitellian commanders now resolved to bring on a decisive battle, and their
                    designs were assisted by the divided and irresolute counsels which prevailed in
                    Otho’s camp. The more experienced officers urged the importance of avoiding a
                    battle, until at least the legions from Dalmatia had arrived. But the
                    inconsiderate rashness of the emperor’s brother Titianus and of Proculus,
                    prefect of the praetorian guards, added to Otho’s feverish impatience of
                    prolonged suspense, overruled all opposition, and an immediate advance was
                    decided upon, Otho himself remaining behind with a considerable reserve force at
                    Brixellum, on the southern bank of the Po. At the time when this decision was
                    taken the Othonian forces had already crossed the Po and were encamped at
                    Bedriacum, a small village on the Via Postumia, and on the route by which the
                    legions from Dalmatia would naturally arrive. Leaving a strong detachment to
                    hold the camp at Bedriacum, the Othonian forces advanced along the Via Postumia
                    in the direction of Cremona. At a short distance from that city they
                    unexpectedly encountered the Vitellian troops, and a battle at once ensued. The
                    Othonians, though taken at a disadvantage, fought desperately, but were finally
                    defeated at all points and forced to fall back in disorder upon their camp at
                    Bedriacum. Thither on the next day the victorious Vitellians followed them, but
                    only to come to terms at once with their disheartened enemy, and to be welcomed
                    into the camp as friends. More unexpected still was the effect produced by the
                    news of the battle at Brixellum. Otho was still in command of a formidable
                    force—the Dalmatian legions had already reached Aquileia; and the spirit of his
                    soldiers and their officers was still unbroken. But he was resolved to accept
                    the verdict of the battle which his own impatience had hastened. He had made a
                    bold throw for success and had failed. He was weary of the suspense and
                    anxieties of a protracted struggle, and he may even have been sincere in his
                    professed unwillingness to cause further bloodshed. In a dignified speech he
                    bade farewell to those about him, and then retiring to rest slept soundly for
                    some hours. Early in the morning he stabbed himself to the heart with a dagger
                    which he had concealed under his pillow, and died as his attendants entered the
                    tent. His funeral was celebrated at once, as he had wished, and not a few of his
                    soldiers followed their master’s example by killing themselves at his pyre. A
                    plain tomb was erected in his honour at Brixellum, with the simple inscription
                    “Diis Manibus Marci Othonis.” At the time of his death (April 15, 69) he was
                    only iu his thirty-eighth year, and had reigned just three months. In all his
                    life nothing became him so well as his manner of leaving it; but the fortitude
                    he then showed, even if it was not merely the courage of despair, cannot blind

                <p>0TH.0 I. (912-973), called The Great, Holy Roman emperor, was born in 912. After
                    the death of his father, Henry, king of Germany, he was elected and crowned king
                    in 936 at Aix-la-Chapelle; and he occupied the throne upwards of thirty-six
                    years. His reign was one of the most momentous in mediaeval history, its chief
                    incident being his assumption of the imperial crown, whereby he rendered
                    impossible the growth of a compact German monarchy. Otho was a man of great
                    ambition, stern and resolute; and soon after his coronation as king of Germany
                    his leading vassals saw that he intended to claim from them something more than
                    nominal allegiance. First he had to suppress a rebellion headed by Eberhard,
                    duke of Franconia, in association with Thankmar, a son of King Henry by a
                    marriage which had been declared invalid. When this insurrection was put down,
                    Thankmar having died, there was a more formidable rising, in which Eberhard
                    secured the alliance of Otho’s younger brother Henry, of Giselbert, duke of
                    Lorraine, of Frederick, archbishop of Mainz, and of other powerful prelates. The
                    king was again triumphant, and on this occasion he strengthened his position by
                    retaining Franconia in his own hands, and by granting Lorraine to his supporter
                    Conrad, who married Otho’s daughter Liudgard. To his brother Henry, whom he
                    pardoned, he gave Bavaria; and over Swabia, after the death of its duke, he
                    placed his own son Ludolf. His native duchy, Saxony, was entrusted to Count
                    Hermann, called Billnng, a brave noble who had distinguished himself in wars on
                    the eastern borders of Germany. Thus all the great offices of the state were
                    held by Otho’s kinsmen and friends; and he exercised more direct control over
                    his subjects than any sovereign, except Charlemagne, had done before him. In
                    wars with the Bohemians, the Wends, and the Danes Otho was not less successful.
                    In 951 he crossed the Alps to help Queen Adelaide, and, having conquered
                    Berengar II., he married her and became king of Lombardy. On his return to
                    Germany his son Ludolf rebelled against him, and was aided by Duke Conrad, by
                    Archbishop Frederick of Mainz, and by many discontented magnates. In the midst
                    of the struggle Germany was attacked by the Magyars, whom Duke Conrad had
                    summoned to his aid. This common danger led to the establishment of internal
                    peace, and Otho succeeded in defeating the Magyars. When in 955 they returned in
                    greater numbers than ever, he inflicted on them so decisive a defeat that they
                    did not again invade Germany. In 961, in response to the appeal of Pope John
                    XII., Otho returned to Italy to punish his rebellious vassal Berengar; and on
                    the 2d February 962 he was crowned emperor by the pope, for the deposition of
                    whom he soon afterwards summoned a council. At this time Otho remained two years
                    in Italy, and a later visit extended over six years, during which he not only
                    maintained his authority in Lombardy, but sought to assert it in southern Italy.
                    In Germany his policy was directed chiefly to the strengthening of the church,
                    which was. to act as a counterpoise to the influence of the secular nobles. He
                    died on the 7th May 973, at Memleben, and was buried in Magdeburg, which he had
                    made the seat of an archbishopric.</p>
