                    (1803-1863), English general, was the son of Benjamin Outram of Butterley Hall,
                    Derbyshire, civil engineer, and was born 29th January 1803. His father died in
                    1805, and his mother, a daughter of Dr James Anderson, the Scottish writer on
                    agriculture, removed in 1810 to Aberdeenshire. From Udny school the boy went in
                    1818 to Marischal College, Aberdeen; and in 1819 an Indian cadetship was given
                    him. Soon after his arrival in India his remarkable energy attracted notice, and
                    in July 1820 he became acting adjutant to the first battalion of the 12th
                    regiment on its embodiment at Poona, an experience which he found to be of
                    immense advantage to him in his after career. . In 1825 he was sent to Khandesh,
                    where he succeeded in training a light infantry corps, formed of the wild robber
                    Bhils, gaining over them a marvellous personal influence, and employing them
                    with great success in checking outrages and plunder. Their loyalty to him had
                    its principal source in their boundless admiration of his hunting achievements,
                    which in their cool daring and hairbreadth escapes have perhaps never been
                    equalled. Originally a “puny lad,” and for many years after his arrival in India
                    subject to constant attacks of sickness, Outram seemed to win strength by every
                    new illness, acquiring a constitution of iron, “nerves of steel, shoulders and
                    muscles worthy of a six-foot Highlander.” In 1835 he was sent to Gujerat to make
                    a report on the Mahi Kanthâ district, and for some time he remained there as
                    political agent. On the outbreak of the Afghan war in 1838 he was appointed
                    extra aide-de-camp on the staff of Sir John Keane, and besides many other
                    brilliant deeds performed an extraordinary exploit in capturing a banner of the
                    enemy before Ghazni. After conducting various raids against different Afghan
                    tribes, he was in 1839 promoted major, and appointed political agent in Lower
                    Sind, and later in Upper Sind. On his-return from a short visit to England in
                    1843, he was, with the rank of brevet lieutenant-colonel, appointed to a command
                    in the Mahratta country, and in 1847 he was transferred from Satâra to Baroda.
                    In 1854 he became chief-commissioner of Oudh, and in 1856 he received the honour
                    of knighthood. Appointed in 1857, with the rank of lieutenant-general, to
                    command an expedition against Persia, he defeated the enemy with great slaughter
                    at Khushab, and otherwise conducted the campaign with such rapid decision that
                    peace was shortly afterwards concluded, his brilliant services being rewarded by
                    the Grand Cross of the Bath. From Persia he was summoned in June to India, with
                    the brief explanation,—“We want all our best men here.” Immediately on· his
                    arrival in Calcutta he was appointed to command the two divisions of the Bengal
                    army, occupying the country from Calcutta to Cawnpur; and to the military
                    control was also joined the commissionership of Oudh. Already the rebellion had
                    assumed such proportions as to compel Havelock to fall back on Cawnpur, which he
                    only held with difficulty, although a speedy advance was necessary to save the
                    garrison at Lucknow. On arriving at Cawnpur with reinforcements, Outram, “in
                    admiration of the brilliant deeds of General Havelock,” conceded to him the
                    glory of relieving Lucknow, and, waiving his rank, tendered his services to him
                    as a volunteer. During the advance he commanded a troop of volunteer cavalry,
                    and performed exploits of great brilliancy at Mangalwar, and in the attack at
                    the Alambagh; and in the final conflict he led the way, charging through a very
                    tempest of fire. Resuming supreme command, he then held the town till the
                    arrival of Sir Colin Campbell, after which he conducted the evacuation of the
                    residency so as completely to deceive the enemy. In the second capture of
                    Lucknow, on the commander-in-chief’s return, Outram was entrusted with the
                    attack on the side of the Gumti, and afterwards, having recrossed the river, he
                    advanced “through the Chattar Manzil to take the residency,” thus, in the words
                    of Sir Colin Campbell, “putting the finishing stroke on the enemy.” After the
                    capture of Lucknow he was gazetted lieutenant-general. In February 1858 he
                    received the special thanks of both Houses of Parliament, and in the same year
                    the dignity of baronet with an annuity of &lt;£1000. When, on account of
                    shattered health, he returned finally to England in 1860, a movement was set on
                    foot to mark the sense entertained, not only of his military achievements, but
                    of his constant exertions in behalf of the natives of India, whose “weal,” in
                    his own words, “he mat}e his first object.” The movement resulted in the
                    presentation of a public testimonial and the erection of statues in London and
                    Calcutta. He died 11th March 1863, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where
                    the marble slab on his grave bears the pregnant epitaph “The Bayard of
                    India.”</p>
