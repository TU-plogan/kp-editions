                    poverty of the English language—generally so rich in synonyms—is here very
                    remarkable. Though four well-known if not common species of Owls are native to
                    Britain, to say nothing of half a dozen others which occur with greater or less
                    frequency, none of them has ever acquired an absolutely individual name, and
                    various prefixes have to be used to distinguish them. In Greece and Italy,
                    Germany and France, almost each indigenous species has had its own particular
                    designation in the vulgar tongue. The English Owlet or Howlet is of course a
                    simple diminutive only.</p></note> of which group nearly two hundred species
                    have been recognized. The Owls form a very natural assemblage, and one about the
                    limits of which no doubt has for a long while existed. Placed by nearly all
                    systematists for many years as a Family of the Order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Accipitres</hi> (or whatever may have been the equivalent term used by the
                    particular taxonomers), there has been of late a disposition to regard them as
                    forming a group of higher rank. On many accounts it is plain that they differ
                    from the ordinary diurnal Birds-of-prey, more than the latter do among
                    themselves; and, though in some respects Owls have a superficial likeness to the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Goatsuckers</hi> (vol. x. p. 711), and a resemblance more
                    deeply seated to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Guacharo</hi> (vol. xi. p. 227), even
                    the last has not been made out to have any strong affinity to them. A good deal
                    is therefore to be said for the opinion which would regard the Owls as forming
                    an independent Order, or at any rate Sub-order, <hi rend="italic">Striges.</hi>
                    Whatever be the position assigned to the group, its subdivision has always been
                    a fruitful matter of discussion, owing to the great resemblance obtaining among
                    all its members, and the existence of safe characters for its division has only
                    lately been at all generally recognized. By the older naturalists, it is true,
                    Owls were divided, as was first done by Willughby, into two sections—one in
                    which all the species exhibit tufts of feathers on the head, the so-called
                    “ears” or “horns,” and the second in which the head is not tufted. The
                    artificial and therefore untrustworthy nature of this distinction was shewn by
                    Isidore Geoffroy St-Hilaire <hi rend="italic">(Ann. Sc.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Naturelles,</hi> xxi. pp. 194-203) in 1830; but he did not do much good in the

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0098-0089"/> arrangement of the Owls which he then proposed;
                    and it was hardly until the publication ten years later of Nitzsch’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Pterylographie</hi> that rational grounds on which to base a
                    division of the Owls were adduced. It then became manifest that two very
                    distinct types of pterylosis existed in the group, and further it appeared that
                    certain differences, already partly shewn by Berthold <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Beitr.</hi><hi rend="italic">zur Anatomie,</hi> pp. 166, 167), of sternal
                    structure coincided with the pterylological distinctions. By degrees other
                    significant differences were pointed out, till, as summed up by Prof. Alphonse
                    Milne-Edwards <hi rend="italic">(Ois.</hi><hi rend="italic">foss. de la
                    France,</hi> ii. pp. 474-492), there could no longer be any doubt that the bird
                    known in England as the Screech-Owl or Barn-Owl, with its allies, formed a
                    section which should be most justifiably separated from all the others of the
                    group then known. Space is here wanting to state particularly the pterylological
                    distinctions which will be found described at length in Nitzsch’s classical work
                    (English translation, pp. 70, 71), and even the chief osteological distinctions
                    must be only briefly mentioned. These consist in the Screech-Owl section wanting
                    any manubrial process in front of the sternum, which has its broad keel joined
                    to the clavicles united as a furcula, while posteriorly it presents an unbroken
                    outline. In the other section, of which the bird known in England as the Tawny
                    or Brown Owl is the type, there is a manubrial process; the furcula, far from
                    being joined to the keel of the sternum, often consists but of two stylets which
                    do not even meet one another; and the posterior margin of the sternum presents
                    two pairs of projections, one pair on each side, with corresponding fissures
                    between them. Furthermore the Owls of the same section shew another peculiarity
                    in the bone usually called the tarsus. This is a bony ring or loop bridging the
                    channel in which lies the common extensor tendon of the toes—which does not
                    appear in the Screech-Owl section any more than in the majority of birds. The
                    subsequent examination by Μ. Milne-Edwards <hi rend="italic">(Nouv. Arch, du
                    Museum,</hi> ser. 2, i. pp. 185-200) of the skeleton of an Owl known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Phodilus</hi> (more correctly <hi rend="italic"
                    >Photodilus)</hi><hi rend="italic">badius,</hi> hitherto attached to the
                    Screech-Owl section, shews that, though in most of its osteological characters
                    it must be referred to the Tawny Owl section, in several of the particulars
                    mentioned above it resembles the Screech-Owls, and therefore we are bound to
                    deem it a connecting link between them. The pterylological characters of <hi
                    rend="italic">Photodilus</hi> seem not to have been investigated, but it is
                    found to want the singular bony tarsal loop, as well as the manubrial process,
                    while its clavicles are not united into a furcula and do not meet the keel, and
                    the posterior margin of the sternum has processes and fissures like those of the
                    Tawny Owl section. <hi rend="italic">Photodilus</hi> having thus to be removed
                    from the Screech-Owl section, Prof. Milne-Edwards has been able to replace it by
                    a new form <hi rend="italic">Heliodilus</hi> from Madagascar, described at
                    length by him in Μ. Grandidier’s great work on the natural history of that
                    island <hi rend="italic">(Oiseaux,</hi> i. pp. 113-118). The unexpected results
                    thus obtained preach caution in regard to the classification of other Owls, and
                    add to the misgivings that every honest ornithologist must feel as to former
                    attempts to methodize the whole group—misgivings that had already arisen from
                    the great diversity of opinion displayed by previous classifiers, no two of whom
                    seem able to agree. Moreover, the difficulties which beset the study of the Owls
                    are not limited to their respective relations, but extend to their scientific
                    terminology, which has long been in a state so bewildering that nothing but the
                    strictest adherence to the very letter of the laws of nomenclature, which are
                    approved in principle by all but an insignificant number of naturalists, can
                    clear up the confusion into which the matter has been thrown by heedless or
                    ignorant writers—some of those who are in general most careful to avoid error
                    being not wholly free from blame in this respect.</p>
                <p>A few words are therefore here needed on this most unprofitable subject.<note

                    placed all the Owls known to him; but Brisson most justifiably divided that
                    genus, and in so doing fixed upon the Ä <hi rend="italic">stridula</hi><hi

                    the type. Some years later Savigny, who had very peculiar notions on
                    nomenclature, disregarding the act of Brisson, chose to regard the Linnaean <hi

                    followed until Fleming gave to the Screech-Owl the generic name of <hi

                    >Hybris</hi> to be conferred on the Screech-Owl. No doubt inconvenience is
                    caused by changing any general practice; but, as will have been seen, the
                    practice was not universal, and such inconvenience as may arise is not
                    chargeable on those who abide by the law, as it is intended in this article to
                    do. The reader is therefore warned that the word <hi rend="italic">Strix</hi>
                    will be here used in what is believed to be the legitimate way, for the genus
                    containing the <hi rend="italic">Strix stridula</hi> of Linnaeus, while <hi
                    rend="italic">Aluco</hi> is retained for that including the *S <hi

                <p>Except the two main divisions already mentioned, any further arrangement of the
                    Owls must at present be deemed tentative, for the ordinary external characters,
                    to which most systematists trust, are useless if not misleading.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is very much to be
                    regretted that a very interesting form of Owl, <hi rend="italic">Sceloglaux

                    without any effort, so far as is known, being made to ascertain its affinities.
                    It would seem to belong to the Strigine section, and is remarkable for its very
                    massive clavicles, that unite by a kind of false joint, which in some examples
                    may possibly be wholly ancylosed, in the median line.</p></note> Several
                    systematizers have tried to draw characters from the orifice of the ear, and the
                    parts about it; but hitherto these have not been sufficiently studied to make
                    the attempts very successful. If it be true that the predominant organ in any
                    group of animals furnishes for that group the best distinctive characters, we
                    may have some hope of future attempts in this direction,<note anchored="true"

                    know that few birds have the sense of hearing so highly developed as the Owls,
                    and also that the external ear varies considerably in form in several of the
                    genera which have been examined. Thus in <hi rend="italic">Surnia,</hi> the
                    Hawk-Owl, and in <hi rend="italic">Nyctea,</hi> the Snowy Owl, the external ear
                    is simple in form, and, though proportionally larger than in most birds, it
                    possesses no very remarkable peculiarities,—a fact which may be correlated with
                    the diurnal habits of these Owls—natives of the far north, where the summer is a
                    season of constant daylight, and to effect the capture of prey the eyes are
                    perhaps more employed than the ears.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>But this hypothesis must not be too strongly urged; for in
                    <hi rend="italic">Carine,</hi> a more southern form of nocturnal (or at least
                    crepuscular) habits, the external ear is perhaps even more normal. Of course by
                    the ear the real organ of hearing is here meant, not the tuft of feathers often

                    ear, however, has no very remarkable development of conch, which may perhaps be
                    accounted for by the ordinary prey of the bird being the larger rodents, that
                    from their size are more readily seen, and hence the growth of the bird’s
                    auditory organs has not been much stimulated. In <hi rend="italic">Strix</hi>
                    (as the name is here used), a form depending greatly on its sense of hearing for
                    the capture of its prey, the ear-conch is much enlarged, and it has, moreover,
                    an elevated flap or operculum. In <hi rend="italic">Asio,</hi> containing the
                    Long-eared and Short-eared Owls of Europe, Asia, and America, the conch is
                    enormously exaggerated, extending in a semicircular direction from the base of
                    the lower mandible to above the middle of the eye, and is furnished in its whole
                    length with an operculum.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    extraordinary in this genus is that the entrance to the ear is asymmetrical— the
                    orifice on one side opening downwards and on the other upwards. This curious
                    adaptation is carried still further in the genus <hi rend="italic">Nyctala,</hi>
                    containing two or three small species of the Northern hemisphere, in which the
                    asymmetry that in <hi rend="italic">Asio</hi> is only skin-deep extends, in a
                    manner very surprising, to several of the bones of the head, as may be seen in
                    the Zoological Society’s <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> (1871, pp. 739-
                    743), and in the large series of figures given by Messrs Baird, Brewer and
                    Ridgway <hi rend="italic">(N. Am. Birds,</hi> iii. pp. 97-102).</p>
                <p>Among Owls are found birds which vary in length from 5 inches—as <hi
                    rend="italic">Glaucidiunι cobanense,</hi> which is therefore much smaller than a
                    Skylark—to more than 2 feet, a size that is attained by many species. Their
                    plumage, none of the feathers of which possesses an aftershaft, is of the
                    softest kind, rendering their flight almost noiseless. But one of the most
                    characteristic features of this whole group is the ruff, consisting of several
                    rows of small and much-curved feathers with stiff shafts—originating from a fold
                    of the skin, which begins on each side of the base of the beak, runs above the
                    eyes, and passing downwards round and behind the ears turns forward, and ends at
                    the chin— and serving to support the longer feathers of the “disk” or space
                    immediately around the eyes, which extend over it. A considerable number of
                    species of Owls, belonging to various genera, and natives of countries most
                    widely separated, are remarkable for exhibiting two phases of coloration—one in
                    which the prevalent browns have a more or less rusty-red tinge, and the other in
                    which they incline to grey. Another characteristic of nearly all Owls is the
                    reversible property of their outer toes, which are not unfrequently turned at
                    the bird’s pleasure quite backwards. Many forms have the legs and toes thickly
                    clothed to the very claws; others have the toes, and even the tarsi, bare, or
                    only sparsely beset by bristles. Among the bare-legged Owls those of the Indian
                    <hi rend="italic">Ketupa</hi> are conspicuous, and this feature is usually
                    correlated with their fish-catching habits; but certainly other Owls that are
                    not known to catch fish present much the same character.</p>
                <p>Among the multitude of Owls there is only room here to make further mention of a
                    few of the more interesting. First must be noticed the Tawny Owl—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Strix stridula</hi> of Linnaeus, the type, as has been above said,
                    of the whole group, and especially of the Strigine section as here understood.
                    This is the <hi rend="italic">Syrnium aluco</hi> of some authors, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chat-huant</hi> of the French, the species whose tremulous hooting
                    “tu-whit, to-who,” has been celebrated by Shakespear, and, as well as the
                    plaintive call, “keewick,” of the young after-leaving the nest, will be familiar
                    sounds to many readers, for the bird is very generally distributed throughout
                    most parts of Europe, extending its range through Asia Minor to Palestine, and
                    also to Barbary—but not belonging to the Ethiopian Region or to the eastern half
                    of the Palaearctic. It is the largest of the species indigenous to Britain, and
                    is strictly a woodland bird, only occasionally choosing any other place for its
                    nest than a hollow tree. Its food consists almost entirely of small mammals,
                    chiefly rodents; but, though on this account most deserving of protection from
                    all classes, it is subject to the stupid persecution of the ignorant, and is
                    rapidly declining in numbers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>All Owls have the habit of casting up the indigestible parts
                    of the food swallowed in the form of pellets, which may often be found in

                    prey of the birds has been. The result in nearly every case shows the enormous

                    several species which from their size are usually known as Eagle-Owls. Here the
                    Nearctic and Palaearctic forms are sufficiently distinct—the latter, <hi

                    rend="italic">B. virginiamιs,</hi> extends over the whole of North America. A
                    contrast to the generally sombre colourof these birds is shown by the Snowy Owl,
                    <hi rend="italic">Nyctea</hi><hi rend="italic">scandiaca,</hi> a circumpolar
                    species, and the only one of its genus, which disdains the shelter of forests
                    and braves the most rigorous arctic climate, though compelled to migrate
                    southward in winter when no sustenance is left for it. Its large size and white
                    plumage, more or less mottled with black, distinguish this from every other Owl.
                    Then may be mentioned the birds commonly known in English as “Horned” Owls—the
                    <hi rend="italic">Hibous</hi> of the French, belonging to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Asio.</hi> One, <hi rend="italic">A. otus</hi> (the <hi
                    rend="italic">Otus vulgaris</hi> of some authors), inhabits woods, and,
                    distinguished by its long tufts, usually borne erected, would seem to be common
                    to both America and Europe—though experts profess their ability to distinguish
                    between examples from each country. Another specieε, <hi rend="italic">A.
                    accipitrinus</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">Otus brachyotus</hi> of many authors),
                    has much shorter tufts on its head, and they are frequently carried depressed so
                    as to escape observation. This is the ‘‘Woodcock-Owl” of English sportsmen, for,
                    though a good many are bred in Great Britain, the majority arrive in autumn from
                    Scandinavia, just about the time that the immigration of Woodcocks occurs. This
                    species frequents heaths, moors, and the open country generally, to the
                    exclusion of woods, and has an enormous geographical range, including not only
                    all Europe, North Africa, and northern Asia, but the whole of America,—reaching
                    also to the Falklands, the Galapagos, and the Sandwich Islands,—for the attempt

                    Commonly placed near <hi rend="italic">Asio,</hi> but whether really akin to it
                    cannot be stated, is the genus <hi rend="italic">Scops,</hi> of which nearly
                    forty species, coming from different parts of the world, have been described;
                    but this number should probably be reduced by one half. The type of the genus,
                    <hi rend="italic">S. giu,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Petit Due</hi> of the
                    French, is a well-known bird in the south of Europe, about as big as a Thrush,
                    with very delicately pencilled plumage, occasionally visiting Britain,
                    emigrating in autumn across the Mediterranean, and ranging very far to the
                    eastward. Further southward, both in Asia and Africa, it is represented by other
                    species of very similar size, and in the eastern part of North America by <hi
                    rend="italic">S. asio,</hi> of which there is a tolerably distinct western form,

                    rend="italic">S. asio</hi> is one of the Owls that especially exhibits the
                    dimorphism of coloration above mentioned, and it was long before the true state
                    of the case was understood. At first the two forms were thought to be distinct,
                    and then for some time the belief obtained that the ruddy birds were the young
                    of the greyer form which was called <hi rend="italic">S. naevia</hi>; but now
                    the “Red Owl” and the “Mottled Owl” of the older American ornithologists are
                    known to be one species.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    is made to the observations of Mr Allen in the Harvard <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bulletin</hi> (ii. pp. 338, 339).</p></note> One of the most remarkable of
                    American Owls is <hi rend="italic">Speotyto nmicularia,</hi> the bird that in
                    the northern part of the continent inhabits the burrows of the prairie dog, and
                    in the southern those of the biscacha, where the latter occurs—making holes for
                    itself, says Darwin, where that is not the case,—rattlesnakes being often also
                    joint tenants of the same abodes. The odd association of these animals,
                    interesting as it is, cannot here be more than noticed, for a few words must be
                    said, ere we leave the Owls of this section, on the species which has
                    associations of a very different kind—the bird of Pallas Athene, the emblem of
                    the city to which science and art were so welcome. There can be no doubt, from
                    the many representations on coins and sculptures, as to their subject being the
                    <hi rend="italic">Carine</hi><hi rend="italic">noctua</hi> of modern
                    ornithologists, but those who know the grotesque actions and ludicrous
                    expression of this veritable buffoon of birds can never cease to wonder at its
                    having been seriously selected as the symbol of learning, and can hardly divest
                    themselves of a suspicion that the choice must have been made in the spirit of
                    sarcasm. This Little Owl (for that is its only name —though it is not even the
                    smallest that appears in England), the <hi rend="italic">Chevêche</hi> of the
                    French, is spread throughout the greater part of Europe, but it is not a native
                    of Britain. It has a congener in <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >brama,</hi> a bird well known to all residents in India.</p>
                <p>Finally, we have Owls of the second section, those allied to the Screech-Owl, <hi

                    and its hissing, is far too well known to need description, for it is one of the
                    most widely-spread of birds, and is the Owl that has the greatest geographical
                    range, inhabit!ι g almost every country in the world,—Sweden and Norway, America
                    north of lat. 45°, and New Zealand being the principal exceptions. It varies,
                    however, not inconsiderably, both in size and intensity of colour, and several
                    ornithologists have tried to found on these variations more than half a dozen
                    distinct species. Some, if not most of them, seem, however, hardly worthy to be
                    considered geographical races, for their differences do not always depend on
                    locality. Mr Sharpe, with much labour and in great detail, has given his reasons
                    <hi rend="italic">(Cat. B. Brit. Museum,</hi> ii. pp. 291-309; and <hi
                    rend="italic">0mith. Miscellany,</hi> i. pp. 269-298; ii. pp. 1-21) for
                    acknowledging four “subspecies” of <hi rend="italic">A. flammeus,</hi> as well
                    as five other species. Of these last, <hi rend="italic">A. tenebricosus</hi> is
                    peculiar to Australia, while <hi rend="italic">A. novae-hollandiae</hi> inhabits
                    also New Guinea, and has a “subspecies,” <hi rend="italic">A. castanops,</hi>
                    found only in Tasmania; a third, <hi rend="italic">A. candidus,</hi> has a wide
                    range from Fiji and northern Australia through the Philippines and Formosa to
                    China, Burmah, and India; a fourth, <hi rend="italic">A. capensis,</hi> is
                    peculiar to South Africa; while <hi rend="italic">A. thomensis</hi> is said to
                    be confined to the African island of St Thomas. To these may perhaps have to be
                    added a species from New Britain, described by Count Salvador! as <hi
                    rend="italic">Strix</hi><hi rend="italic">aurantia,</hi> but it may possibly
                    prove on further investigation not to be an Alucine Owl at all. (A. N.)</p>
