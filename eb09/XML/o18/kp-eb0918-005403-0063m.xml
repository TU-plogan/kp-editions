                <p><label type="entry">OSCANS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Opicans</hi></label>, was the
                    name given both by Greeks and Romans to one of the ancient nations of central
                    Italy. There can be no doubt that the original form of the name was Opscus,
                    which, as we learn from Festus, was still used by Ennius. This the Greeks
                    softened into Opicus, while the Latin writers always used Oscus as a national
                    appellation, though they occasionally employ the term “opicus” in the sense of
                    barbarous or ignorant. It is singular that, though there can be no doubt the
                    name was a national one, it is not found in history as the name of any
                    particular nation. No mention occurs of the Oscans among the populations of
                    Italy that were successively reduced by the Roman arms; but we learn
                    incidentally from a passage in Livy (x. 20) that the language of the Samnites
                    and Campanians was Oscan; and it is certain<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0064-0055"/> that this continued to be the vernacular tongue
                    of the people of Italy until long after the Roman conquest. Of the ethnical
                    affinities or origin of the Oscans we know nothing, except what may be gathered
                    philologically from the remains of their language; and their relations with the
                    Samnites and other Sabellian tribes, whom we find during the historical period
                    settled in this part of Italy, are extremely obscure. Perhaps the most plausible
                    theory is that they were in very early times the inhabitants of the regions
                    subsequently occupied by a race of invaders from the north, who were known as
                    Sabines, Samnites, and Sabellians, but who, being comparatively few in numbers,
                    and in an inferior stage of civilization, gradually adopted the language of the
                    conquered race (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Italy,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 445).</p>
                <p>It is certain that the Oscan language continued in common use as a vernacular
                    dialect till the close of the Roman republic. Ennius boasted that he was
                    possessed of three tongues because he could speak Latin, Greek, and Oscan (Gell,
                    xvii. 17); and at the time of the Social War (88 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)
                    the allies made an attempt to introduce it as the official language, and struck
                    coins with Oscan inscriptions bearing the names of Viteliu (for Italia),
                    Safinim, &amp;c. After the failure of that movement there can be no doubt that
                    the language was never again employed for official purposes, though it would
                    linger long in use among the rustic populations of the mountains. Nor was it
                    altogether without a literature, for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >FabulaeAtellanae,</hi> a kind of rude farces popular among the Romans, not only
                    derived their names and origin from the Oscan district of Campania, but were
                    undoubtedly in the first instance composed and recited in the Oscan dialect. The
                    monuments of the language which have been preserved to us by inscriptions are
                    much more numerous than those of any other ancient Italian dialect. The
                    principal of them are enumerated in the article above referred to, and they are
                    all collected and examined in detail by Professor Mommsen in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Unter</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi rend="italic">Italischen
                    Dialekte</hi> (Leipsic, 1850). The general result is that the Oscan language
                    must have resembled the Latin much more closely than any other of the Italian
                    dialects, but wanted almost entirely the Greek or Pelasgic element which is
                    found so distinctly in the more cultivated language, and which formed the basis
                    of the Messapian and other dialects of the southern part of the Italian
                    peninsula.</p>
