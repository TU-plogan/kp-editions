                <p><label type="entry">OXYHYDROGEN FLAME</label>. Hydrogen gas readily burns in
                    oxygen or air with formation of vapour of water. The quantity of heat evolved,
                    according to Thomsen, amounts to 34116 units for every unit of weight of
                    hydrogen burned, which means that, supposing the two gases were originally at
                    the temperature of, say, 0° C., to bring the hot steam produced into the
                    condition of liquid water of 0° C., we must withdraw from it a quantity of heat
                    equal to that necessary to raise 34116 units of weight of liquid water from 0°
                    to l <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> C. This heat-disturbance is quite
                    independent of the particular mode in which the process is conducted; it is the
                    same, for instance, whether pure oxygen or air be used as a reagent, being
                    neither more or less than the balance of energy between 1 part of hydrogen plus
                    8 parts of oxygen on the one hand and 9 parts of liquid water on the other. The
                    temperature of the flame, on the other hand, does depend on the circumstances
                    under which the process takes place. It obviously attains its maximum in the
                    case of the firing of pure “oxyhydrogen” gas (we mean a mixture of hydrogen with
                    exactly half its volume of oxygen, the quantity it combines with in becoming
                    water). It becomes less when the “oxyhydrogen” is mixed with excess of one or
                    the other of the two co-reagents or an inert gas such as nitrogen, because in
                    any such case the same amount of heat spreads over a larger quantity of matter.
                    To calculate the “calorific effect,” we may assume that, in any case, for every
                    1 grain of hydrogen burned 9×637 = 5733 units of heat are spent in the
                    conversion of the 9 grains of liquid water (theoretically imagined to be)
                    produced into steam of 100° C., and that only the rest of 34116 - 5733 = 28383
                    units is available for heating up the products of combustion. Now the specific
                    heat of steam (from 120 to 220° C.) has been found to be equal to 0*4805 units;
                    hence, on the basis of certain obvious (but bold) assumptions, in the firing of
                    9 grains of oxyhydrogen gas, as every 9 × 0*4805 units of heat correspond to an
                    increase of 1° C. in temperature, the temperature of the flame should be by
                    28383 ÷ 9 times 0*4805 (or 6564° C.) higher than 100°, or equal to 6664° C.</p>
                <p>Let us now consider the case of 1 grain of hydrogen mixed with the quantity of
                    air containing 8 grains of oxygen, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the case of 1
                    grain hydrogen mixed with 8 grains of oxygen and 26*78 grains of nitrogen. Here
                    the temperature <hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the flame will be governed by the
                    equation, 28383 <hi rend="italic">= (t-</hi> 100) × 9 × 0∙4805 + <hi
                        rend="italic">1 ×</hi> 26*78 × 0*2438, —the last coefficient being the
                    specific heat of nitrogen. Thus i = 2655° C., as against the 6664° obtained with
                    pure oxygen. But one of our tacit assumptions. is obviously untenable;
                    ready-made vapour of water, if subjected to even the less of the two
                    temperatures, would suffer far-going dissociation involving an absorption of
                    heat and consequently a depression of temperature. Hence supposing a mass of
                    oxyhydrogen gas to have been kindled, as soon as the temperature has passed a
                    certain point the progress of the process of combination will be checked by that
                    of the corresponding dissociation, which latter, as the combustion progresses,
                    will go on at a greater and greater rate, or until it just compensates the
                    effect of the process of combination. That is to say, as soon as through the
                    combustion of a certain fraction of the oxyhydrogen a certain temperature (far
                    less than 6664° C.) has been produced, there is no further increase of
                    temperature, and the uncombined gas-residue would remain unchanged, if it were
                    not for the practically unavoidable loss of heat by radiation and conduction,
                    which enables it to become water.</p>
                <p>This interesting matter was inquired into experimentally by Bunsen. He exploded
                    fulminating gas mixtures in a close vessel constructed so that the maximum
                    tension attained by the gas-contents during the combustion could be observed and
                    measured, and from this value and the analytical data he calculated the maximum
                    temperature and the proportion of gas-mixture which had assumed the form of a
                    chemical compound at the moment when the maximum temperature prevailed. He found
                        <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> for the case of pure oxyhydrogen gas—maximum
                    temperature = 2844° C., fraction of burned gas at the respective moment 0*337;
                    (6) for the case of a mixture of 1 volume of oxygen, 2 volumes of hydrogen, and
                    3*78 of nitrogen (very nearly the same as one volume of oxygen in the shape of
                    air)— maximum temperature = 2024° C., burned gas corresponding =0*547 of the
                    potential water. Hence we see that the temperature of a pure oxyhydrogen flame
                    is not so much above that produced in the combustion of hydrogen by air as we
                    should have concluded from our calculations. But, whatever the exact numerical
                    value may be, it has long been known that the calorific effect of an oxyhydrogen
                    flame exceeds that of any furnace, and the effect has long been put to practical
                    use in the oxy hydrogen lamp.</p>
                <p>The most efficient form of this instrument is that which was given to it long ago
                    by Newman, who pumps pure oxyhydrogen into a strong copper reservoir under 2 to
                    3 atmospheres’ pressure, lets the gas stream out of a narrow nozzle, and kindles
                    it. The nozzle in the original apparatus consisted, of a glass tube about 4
                    inches long and of √ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>-inch bore. Newman worked long
                    with this apparatus without any accident occurring; but when he once came to
                    substitute a tube of - <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ∖ <hi rend="subscript">
                        r</hi> inch bore the flame travelled back and the apparatus burst like a
                    bomb-shell. Of the many safety arrangements suggested we will mention only that
                    of Hare, who inserts a plug of (microscopically) porous copper between reservoir
                    and nozzle, and forces the gas through this plug by applying a sufficient
                    pressure. The plug of course acts on the principle of the Davy lamp, and offers
                    protection as long as it has not got heated. But it may get hot without the
                    operator noticing it, and probably has done so occasionally. At any rate, the
                    use of ready mixed oxyhydrogen has long been given up in favour of the very
                    oldest form of lamp, which was invented, before Newman’s, by Hare. Hare’s lamp,
                    in all essential points, is our present gas-blowpipe as used for glass-blowing.
                    The fuel (hydrogen, or coal-gas, which works as well) streams out of the annular
                    space between two coaxial<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n117/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0117-0106"/> tubes, while oxygen is being blown into the
                    hydrogen flame through the central tube. The calorific effect of a Hare’s lamp
                    is of course less than that of Newman’s, but still exceeds that of any ordinary
                    fire; it is inferior only to that of the electric arc. Platinum fuses in the
                    flame with facility, and silica and alumina (though absolutely infusible in the
                    metallurgist’s sense) run into viscid glasses. Notwithstanding its enormous
                    temperature, an oxyhydrogen flame emits only a feeble light; but this arises
                    only from the absence iu it of good radiators. We need only communicate its high
                    temperature to some non-volatile and infusible solid, and a considerable portion
                    of the heat is converted into radiant energy which streams forth as a dazzling
                    white light. In the oxyhydrogen lamp as used in connexion with the magic lantern
                    or the “solar” microscope, a bit of lime fixed to an upright wire serves as a
                    radiator. Magnesia is said to be better, and it has been said that zirconia
                    excels both. Now that the electric light is coming into general use, the
                    oxyhydrogen lamp as a source of light will soon be a thing of the past. It is
                    sure, however, to survive as a powerful producer of intense heat, and not for
                    scientific purposes only. Thanks to the pioneering activity of Deville and
                    Debray, it has found its way into the platinum works, and will hold its ground
                    there until it may be superseded by the electric arc. The soldering together of
                    the several parts of a platinum apparatus is now done “autogynically” (i,e.,
                    without the interposition of any foreign “solder ’’) by means of the oxyhydrogen
                    blowpipe,—a great improvement over the old process of soldering with gold, which
                    stripped the platinum-work of its most valuable character, namely, its relative
                    infusibility. (W. D. )</p>
