                <p><label type="entry">OTTER</label>, a group of animals belonging to the family <hi
                    rend="italic">Mustelidae,</hi> of the order <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi>
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> vol. XV. p. 439), distinguished from
                    their allies by their aquatic habits. The true otters constitute the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Lutra</hi> of zoologists, of which the common species of the
                    British Isles, <hi rend="italic">L. vulgaris,</hi> may be taken as the type. It
                    has an elongated, low body, short limbs, short broad feet, with five toes on
                    each, connected together by webs, and all with short, moderately strong,
                    compressed, curved, pointed claws. Head rather small, broad, and flat; muzzle
                    very broad; whiskers thick and strong; eyes small and black; ears short and
                    rounded. Tail a little more than half the length of the body and head together,
                    very broad and strong at the base, and gradually tapering to the end, somewhat
                    flattened horizontally. The fur is of very fine quality, consisting of a short
                    soft under fur of a whitish grey colour, brown at the tips, interspersed with
                    longer, stiffer, and thicker hairs, very shining, greyish at the base, bright
                    rich brown at the points, especially on the upper parts and outer surface of the
                    legs; the throat, cheeks, under parts and inner surface of the legs brownish
                    grey throughout. Individual otters vary much in size. The total length from the
                    nose to the end of the tail averages about 3⅜ feet, of which the tail occupies 1
                    foot 3 or 4 inches. The weight of a full size male is from 18 to 24 B⅛, that of
                    a female about 4 8&gt; less.</p>
                <p>As the otter lives almost exclusively on fish, it is rarely met with far from
                    water, and usually frequents the shores of brooks, rivers, lakes, and, in some
                    localities, the sea itself. It is a most expert swimmer and diver, easily
                    overtaking and seizing fish in the water, but when it has captured its prey it
                    brings it to shore to devour it. When lying upon the bank it holds the fish
                    between its fore-paws, commences at the head and then eats gradually towards the
                    tail, which it is said always to leave. The female produces three to five young
                    ones at a time, in the month of March or April, and brings them up in a nest
                    formed of grass or other herbage, usually placed in a hollow place in the bank
                    of a river, or under the shelter of the roots of some overhanging tree. The
                    Common Otter is found in localities suitable to its habits throughout Great
                    Britain and Ireland, though far less abundantly than formerly, for, being very
                    destructive to fish, and thus coming into keen competition with those who pursue
                    the occupation of fishing either for sport or for gain, it is rarely allowed to
                    live in peace when once its haunts are discovered. Otter hunting with packs of
                    hounds of a special breed, and trained for the purpose, was formerly a common
                    pastime in the country. When hunted down and brought to bay by the dogs, the
                    otter is finally despatched by long spears carried for the purpose by the
                    huntsmen.</p>
                <p>The Common Otter ranges throughout the greater part of Europe and Asia. A closely
                    allied but larger species, <hi rend="italic">L. canadensis,</hi> is extensively
                    distributed throughout North America, where it is systematically pursued by
                    professional trappers for the value of its fur. An Indian species, <hi
                    rend="italic">L. nair,</hi> is regularly trained by the natives of some parts of
                    Bengal to assist them in fishing, by driving the fish into the nets. In China
                    also otters are taught to catch fish, being let into the water for the purpose
                    attached to a long cord.</p>
                <p>Otters are widely distributed over the earth, and, as they are much alike in size
                    and coloration, their specific distinctions are by no means well defined.
                    Besides those mentioned above, the following have been described, <hi
                    rend="italic">L. californica,</hi> North America; <hi rend="italic">L.
                    felina,</hi> Central America, Peru, and Chili; <hi rend="italic">L.
                    brasiliensis,</hi> Brazil; <hi rend="italic">L. maculicollis,</hi> South Africa;
                    <hi rend="italic">L. whiteleyi,</hi> Japan; <hi rend="italic">L. chinensis,</hi>
                    China and Formosa, and other doubtful species. A very large species from
                    Demerara and Surinam, with a prominent flange-like ridge along each lateral
                    margin of the tail, <hi rend="italic">L. sandbachii,</hi> constitutes the genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Pteronura</hi> of Gray. Others, with the feet only slightly
                    webbed, and the claws exceedinglysmall or altogether wanting on some of the
                    toes, and also ∖vith some difference in dental characters, are with better
                    reason separated into a distinct genus called <hi rend="italic">Aonyx.</hi>
                    These are <hi rend="italic">A. inunguis</hi> from South Africa and <hi
                    rend="italic">A. leptonyx</hi> from Java and Sumatra.</p>
                <p>More distinct still is the Sea-Otter <hi rend="italic">(Enhydra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lutris).</hi> It differs from all other known <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carnivora</hi> in having but two incisors on each side of the lower jaw, the
                    one corresponding to the first (very small in the true otters) being constantly
                    absent. Though the molar teeth resemble those of <hi rend="italic">Lutra</hi> in
                    their proportions, they differ very much in the exceeding roundness and
                    massiveness of their crowns and bluntness of their cusps. The fore feet are very
                    small, with five short webbed toes, and naked palms; the hind feet are
                    altogether unlike those of the true otters, but approaching those of the seals,
                    being large, flat, palmated, and furry on both sides. The outer toe is the
                    largest and stoutest, the rest gradually diminishing in size to the first. The
                    tail is about one-fourth of the length of the head and body, cylindrical and
                    obtuse. The entire length of the animal from nose to end of tail is about 4
                    feet, so that the body is considerably larger and more massive than that of the
                    English otter. The skin is peculiarly loose, and stretches when removed from the
                    animal so as to give the idea of a still larger creature than it really is. The
                    fur is remarkable for the preponderance of the beautifully soft woolly under
                    fur, the longer stiffer hairs being very scanty. The general colour is a deep
                    liver-brown, everywhere silvered or frosted with the hoary tips of the longer
                    stiff <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n79/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0079-0070"/> hairs. These are, however, removed when the skin
                    is dressed for commercial purposes.</p>
                <p>Sea-otters are only found upon the rocky shores of certain parts of the North
                    Pacific Ocean, especially the Aleutian Islands and Alaska, extending as far
                    south on the American coast as Oregon; but, owing to the unremitting persecution
                    to which they are subjected for the sake of their skins, which rank among the
                    most valuable known to the furrier, their numbers are greatly diminishing, and,
                    unless some restriction can be placed upon their destruction, such as that which
                    protects the fur seals of the Pribyloff Islands, the species is threatened with
                    extermination, or, at all events, excessive scarcity. When this occurs, the
                    occupation of five thousand of the half-civilized natives of Alaska, who are
                    dependent upon sea-otter hunting as a means for obtaining their living, will be
                    gone. The principal hunting grounds at present are the little rocky islets and
                    reefs around the island of Saanach and the Chernobours, where they are captured
                    by spearing, clubbing, or nets, and recently by the more destructive rifle
                    bullet. They do not feed on fish, like the true otters, but on clams, mussels,
                    sea-urchins, and crabs, and the female brings forth but a single young one at a
                    time, apparently at no particular season of the year. They are excessively shy
                    and wary, and all attempts to rear the young ones in captivity have hitherto
                    failed.</p>
