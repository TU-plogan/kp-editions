                <p><label type="entry">OWEN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label> (1771-1858),
                    philanthropist, and founder of English socialism, was born at the village of
                    Newtown, Montgomeryshire, in North Wales. His father had a small business in
                    Newtown as saddler and ironmonger, and there young Owen received all his school
                    education, which terminated at the age of nine. At ten he went to Stamford,
                    where he served in a draper’s shop for three or four years, and, after a short
                    experience of work in a London shop, removed to Manchester. His success at
                    Manchester was very rapid. When only nineteen years of age he became manager of
                    a cotton mill, in which five hundred people were employed, and by his
                    administrative intelligence, energy, industry, and steadiness soon made it one
                    of the very best establishments of the kind in Great Britain. In this factory
                    Owen used the first bags of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0096-0087"/> American sea-island cotton ever imported into the
                    country; it was the first cotton obtained from the Southern States of America.
                    Owen also made remarkable improvement in the quality of the cotton spun; and
                    indeed there is no reason to doubt that at this early age he was the first
                    cotton-spinner in England, a position entirely due to his own capacity and
                    knowledge of the trade, as he had found the mill in no well-ordered condition,
                    and was left to organize it entirely on his own responsibility. Owen had become
                    manager and one of the partners of the Chorlton Twist Company at Manchester,
                    when he made his first acquaintance with the scene of his future philanthropic
                    efforts at New Lanark. During a visit to Glasgow he had fallen in love with the
                    daughter of the proprietor of the New Lanark mills, Mr Dale. Owen induced his
                    partners to purchase New Lanark; and after his marriage with Miss Dale he
                    settled there, as manager and part owner of the mills (1800). Encouraged by his
                    great success in the management of cotton factories in Manchester, he had
                    already formed the intention of conducting New Lanark on higher principles than
                    the current commercial ones.</p>
                <p>The factory of New Lanark had been started in 1784 by Dale and Arkwright, the
                    water-power afforded by the falls of the Clyde being the great attraction.
                    Connected with the mills were about two thousand people, five hundred of whom
                    were children, brought, most of them, at the age of five or six from the
                    poorhouses and charities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. The children especially had
                    been well treated by Dale, but the general condition of the people was very
                    unsatisfactory. Many of them were the lowest of the population, the respectable
                    country people refusing to submit to the long hours and demoralizing drudgery of
                    the factories; theft, drunkenness, and other vices were common; education and
                    sanitation were alike neglected; most families lived only in one room. It was
                    this population, thus committed to his care, which Owen now set himself to
                    elevate and ameliorate. He greatly improved their houses, and by the unsparing
                    and benevolent exertion of his personal influence trained them to habits of
                    order, cleanliness, and thrift. He opened a store, where the people could buy
                    goods of the soundest quality at little more than cost price; and the sale of
                    drink was placed under the strictest supervision. His greatest success, however,
                    was in the education of the young, to which he devoted special attention. He was
                    the founder of infant schools in Great Britain; and, though he was anticipated
                    by Continental reformers, he seems to have been led to institute them by his own
                    views of what education ought to be, and without hint from abroad. In all these
                    plans Owen obtained the most gratifying success. Though at first regarded with
                    suspicion as a stranger, he soon won the confidence of his people. The mills
                    continued to be a great commercial success, but it is needless to say that some
                    of Owen’s schemes involved considerable expense, which was displeasing to his
                    partners. Tired at last of the restrictions imposed on him by men who wished to
                    conduct the business on the ordinary principles, Owen formed a new firm, who,
                    content with 5 per cent, of return for their capital, were ready to give freer
                    scope to his philanthropy (1813). In this firm Jeremy Bentham and the well-known
                    Quaker, William Allen, were partners. In the same year Owen first appeared as an
                    author of essays, in which he expounded the principles on which his system of
                    educational philanthropy was based. From an early age he had lost all belief in
                    the prevailing forms of religion, and had thought out a creed for himself, which
                    he considered an entirely new and original discovery. The chief points in this
                    philosophy were that man’s character is made not by him but for him; that it has
                    been formed by circumstances over which he had no control; that he is not a
                    proper subject either of praise or blame,—these principles leading up to the
                    practical conclusion that the great secret in the right formation of man’s
                    character is to place him under the proper influences—physical, moral, and
                    social—from his earliest years. These principles—of the irresponsibility of man
                    and of the effect of early influences— are the keynote of Owen’s whole system of
                    education and social amelioration. As we have said, they are embodied in his
                    first work, <hi rend="italic">A New View of Society, or Essays on the Principle
                    of the Formation of the Human Character,</hi> the first of these essays (there
                    are four in all) being published in 1813. It is needless to say that Owen’s new
                    views theoretically belong to a very old system of philosophy, and that his
                    originality is to be found only in his benevolent application of them. For the
                    next few years Owen’s work at New Lanark continued to have a national and even a
                    European significance. His schemes for the education of his workpeople attained
                    to something like completion on the opening of the institution at New Lanark in
                    1816. He was a zealous supporter of the factory legislation resulting in the Act
                    of 1819, which, however, greatly disappointed him. He had interviews and
                    communications with the leading members of Government, including the premier,
                    Lord Liverpool, and with many of the rulers and leading statesmen of the
                    Continent. New Lanark itself became a much-frequented place of pilgrimage for
                    social reformers, statesmen, and royal personages, including Nicholas,
                    afterwards emperor of Russia. According to the unanimous testimony of all who
                    visited it, the results achieved by Owen were singularly good. The manners of
                    the children, brought up under his system, were beautifully graceful, genial,
                    and unconstrained; health, plenty, and contentment prevailed; drunkenness was
                    almost unknown, and illegitimacy was extremely rare. The most perfect good
                    feeling subsisted between Owen and his workpeople, and all the operations of the
                    mill proceeded with the utmost smoothness and regularity; and the business was a
                    great commercial success.</p>
                <p>Hitherto Owen’s work had been that of a philanthropist, whose great distinction
                    was the originality and unwearying unselfishness of his methods. His first
                    departure in socialism took place in 1817, and was embodied in a report
                    communicated to the Committee of the House of Commons on the Poor Law. The
                    general misery and stagnation of trade consequent on the termination of the
                    great war was engrossing the attention of the country. After clearly tracing the
                    special causes connected with the war which had led to such a deplorable state
                    of things, Owen pointed out that the permanent cause of distress was to be found
                    in the competition of human labour with machinery, and that the only effective
                    remedy was the united action of men, and the subordination of machinery. His
                    proposals for the treatment of pauperism were based on these principles. He
                    recommended that communities of about twelve hundred persons each should be
                    settled on quantities of land of from 1000 to 1500 acres, all living in one
                    large building in the form of a square, with public kitchen and mess-rooms. Each
                    family should have its own private apartments, and the entire care of the
                    children till the age of three, after which they should be brought up by the
                    community, their parents having access to them at meals and all other proper
                    times. These communities might be established by individuals, by parishes, by
                    counties, or by the state; in every case there should be effective supervision
                    by duly qualified persons. Work, and the enjoyment of its results, should be in
                    common. The size of his community was no doubt partly suggested by his village
                    of New Lanark; and he soon proceeded to advocate such a scheme as the best form
                    for the reorganization of society in general. In its fully developed form—and it
                    cannot be said to have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n97/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0097-0088"/> changed much during Owen’s lifetime—it was as
                    follows. He considered an association of from 500 to 3000 as the fit number for
                    a good working community. While mainly agricultural, it should possess all the
                    best machinery, should offer every variety of employment, and should, as far as
                    possible, be self-contained. “As these townships,” as he also called them,
                    “should increase in number, unions of them federatively united shall be formed
                    in circles of tens, hundreds, and thousands,” till they should embrace the whole
                    world in a common interest.</p>
                <p>His plans for the cure of pauperism were received with great favour. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Times</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Morning Post</hi> and
                    many of the leading men of the country countenanced them; one of his most
                    steadfast friends was the duke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria. He had indeed
                    gained the ear of the country, and had the prospect before him of a great career
                    as a social reformer, when he went out of his way at a large meeting in London
                    to declare his hostility to all the received forms of religion. After this
                    defiance to the religious sentiment of the country, Owen’s theories were in the
                    popular mind associated with infidelity, and were henceforward suspected and
                    discredited. Owen’s own confidence, however, remained unshaken: and he was
                    anxious that his scheme for establishing a community should be tested. At last,
                    in 1825, such an experiment was attempted under the direction of his disciple,
                    Abram Combe, at Orbiston near Glasgow; and in the same year Owen himself
                    commenced another at New Harmony in Indiana, America. After a trial of about two
                    years both failed completely. Neither of them was a pauper experiment; but it
                    must be said that the members were of the most motley description, many worthy
                    people of the highest aims being mixed with vagrants, adventurers, and
                    crotchety, wrong-headed enthusiasts. After a long period of friction with
                    William Allen and some of his other partners, Owen resigned all connexion with
                    New Lanark in 1828. On his return from America he made London the centre of his
                    activity. Most of his means having been sunk in the New Harmony experiment, he
                    was no longer a flourishing capitalist, but the, head of a vigorous propaganda,
                    in which socialism and secularism were combined. One of the most interesting
                    features of the movement at this period was the establishment in 1832 of an
                    equitable labour exchange system, in which exchange was effected by means of
                    labour notes, the usual means of exchange and the usual middlemen being alike
                    superseded. The word “socialism” first became current in the discussions of the
                    Association of all Classes of all Nations, formed by Owen in 1835. During these
                    years also his secularistic teaching gained such influence among the working
                    classes as to give occasion for the statement in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Westminster Review</hi> (1839) that his principles were the actual creed of a
                    great portion of them. His views on marriage, which were certainly tax, gave
                    just ground for offence. At this period some more communistic experiments were
                    made, of which the most important were that at Ralahine, in the county of Clare,
                    Ireland, and that at Tytherly in Hampshire. It is admitted that the former
                    (1831) was a remarkable success for three and a half years, till the proprietor,
                    having ruined himself by gambling, was obliged to sell out. Tytherly, begun in
                    1839, was an absolute failure. By 1846 the only permanent result of Owen’s
                    agitation, so zealously carried on by public meetings, pamphlets, periodicals,
                    and occasional treatises, was the co-operative movement, and for the time even
                    that seemed to have utterly collapsed. In his later years Owen became a firm
                    believer in spiritualism. He died at his native town at the age of
                    eighty-seven.</p>
                <p>The exposition and criticism of Owen’s socialism and of his socialistic
                    experiments belong to the general subject (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Social</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">ism).</hi> Robert Owen was essentially a
                    pioneer, whose work and influence it would bo unjust to measure by their
                    tangible results. Apart from his socialistic theories, it should, nevertheless,
                    be remembered that he was one of the foremost and most energetic promoters of
                    many movements of acknowledged and enduring usefulness. He was the founder of
                    infant schools in England; he was the first to introduce reasonably short hours
                    into factory labour, and zealously promoted factory legislation—one of the most
                    needed and most beneficial reforms of the century; and he was the real founder
                    of the co-operative movement. In general education, in sanitary reform, and in
                    his sound and humanitarian views of common life, he was far in advance of his
                    time. Still he had many serious faults; all that was quixotic, crude, and
                    superficial in his views became more prominent in his later years; and by the
                    extravagance of his advocacy of them he did vital injury to the cause he had at
                    heart. In his personal character he was without reproach—frank, benevolent, and
                    straightforward to a fault; and he pursued the altruistic schemes in which he
                    spent all his means with more earnestness than most men devote to the
                    accumulation of a fortune.</p>
