                    trans-Uralian Ostiaks and Samoyedes as identical with the Yugra of the Russian
                    annals During the Russian conquest their abodes extended much farther south than
                    now, and they had numerous settlements on the basin of the Obi, no less than
                    forty one of their fortified places having been destroyed by the Cossacks in
                    1501, in the region of Obdorsk alone. Remains of these “towns” are still to be
                    seen at the Kunovat river, on the Obi 20 miles below Obdorsk, and elsewhere. The
                    total number of the Ostiaks may be estimated at a little over 27,000. Those on
                    the Irtish are mostly settled, and have adopted the manner of life of Russians
                    and Tartars. Those on the Obi are mostly nomads; along with 8000 Samoyedes in
                    the districts of Beryozoff and Surgut, they own 93,600 reindeer. The Obi Ostiaks
                    are Russified to a great extent. They live almost exclusively by fishing, buying
                    from Russian merchants corn for bread, the use of which has become widely
                    diffused.</p>
                <p>The Ostiaks call themselves Ass-yakh (people of the Obi), and it is supposed that
                    their present designation is a corruption of this name. By language they belong
                    (Castrén, <hi rend="italic">Reiseberichte, Reisebriefe·,</hi> Ahlqvist, <hi
                    rend="italic">Öf</hi><hi rend="italic">vers. af Finska Vet.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">-Soc.</hi><hi rend="italic">F&lt;&gt;rh.,</hi> xxi.) to the Ugrian
                    branch of the eastern Finnish stem,—a classification confirmed by a grammar of
                    their language, compiled in 1875, in Hungarian, by Hunfalvy. All the Ostiaks
                    speak the same language, mixed to some extent with foreign elements; but three
                    or four leading dialects can be distinguished.</p>
                <p>The Ostiaks are middle-sized, or of low stature, mostly meagre, and not ill made,
                    however clumsy their appearance in winter, in their thick fur-clothes. The
                    extremities are fine, and the feet are usually small. The skull is
                    brachycephalic, mostly of moderate size and height. The hair is dark and soft
                    for the most part, fair and reddish individuals being rare; the eyes are dark,
                    generally narrow; the nose is flat and broad; the mouth is large and with thick
                    lips; the beard is scanty. The younger men and women are sometimes of an
                    agreeable appearance. The Mongolian type is more strongly pronounced in the
                    women than in the men. On the whole, the Ostiaks are not a pure race; the purest
                    type is found among the fishers on the Obi, the reindeer-breeders of the tundra
                    being largely intermixed with Samoyedes (see Castrén; Γr Finsch’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Reise nach</hi><hi rend="italic">IV</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Investigators are unanimous in describing them as very kind, gentle, and honest;
                    rioting is almost quite unknown among them, as also theft, this last occurring
                    only in the vicinity of Russian settlements, and the only penalty enforced being
                    the restitution twofold of the propeιty stolen. The farther they are removed
                    from contact with Russian dealers and traders the higher do their moral
                    qualities become (Middendorff and Castrén).</p>
                <p>They are very skilful in the arts they practise, especially in carving wood and
                    bone, tanning (with egg-yolk and brains), preparation of implements from birch
                    bark, &amp;c. Some of their carved or decorated bark implements (like those
                    figured in Middendorff’s <hi rend="italic">Sibirische Reise,</hi> iv. 2) show
                    great artistic skill. Only a few have guns, the great majority continuing to
                    hunt with bow and arrows.</p>
                <p>Their folk lore, like to that of other Finnish stems, is imbued with a deep
                    feeling of natural poetry, and reflects also the sadness, or even the despair,
                    which has been noticed among them. The number of those who are considered
                    Christians reaches 2000; but their Shamanism is still retained, hardly anything
                    being borrowed from Christianity beyond the worship of St Nicholas, who is a
                    most popular saint among them.</p>
