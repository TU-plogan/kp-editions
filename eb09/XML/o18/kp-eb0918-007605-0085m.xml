                    born in Lübeck 4th July 1789. His ancestors for three generations had been
                    Protestant pastors; his father was doctor of laws, poet, mystic pietist, and
                    burgomaster of Lübeck. Within stone’s throw of the family mansion in the
                    Königstrasse stood the gymnasium, where the uncle, doctor of theology and a
                    voluminous writer, was the master; there the nephew became a classic scholar and
                    received instruction in art.</p>
                <p>The young artist left Lübeck in March 1806, and entered as student the academy of
                    Vienna, then under the direction of F. H. Füger, a painter of some renown, but
                    of the pseudo-classic school of the French David. Here was gained thorough
                    knowledge, but the teachings and associations proved unendurable to the
                    sensitive, spiritual-minded youth. Overbeck wrote to a friend that he had fallen
                    among a vulgar set, that every noble thought was suppressed within the academy,
                    and that losing all faith in humanity he turned inwardly on himself. These words
                    are a key to his future position and art. It seemed to him that in Vienna, and
                    indeed throughout Europe, the pure springs of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n86/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0086-0077"/> Christian art had been for centuries diverted and
                    corrupted, and so he sought out afresh the living source, and, casting on one
                    side his contemporaries, took for his guides the early and pre-Raphaelite
                    painters of Italy. At the end of four years, differences had grown so
                    irreconcilable that Overbeck and his band of followers were expelled from the
                    academy. True art, he writes, he had sought in Vienna in vain— <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> Oh! I was full of it; my whole fancy was possessed by
                    Madonnas and Christs, but nowhere could I find response.” Accordingly he left
                    for Rome, carrying his half-finished canvas Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem, as
                    the charter of his creed—“I will abide by the Bible; I elect it as my
                    standing-point.”</p>
                <p>Overbeck in 1810 entered Rome, which became for fifty-nine years the centre of
                    his unremitting labour. He was joined by a goodly company, including Cornelius,
                    Wilhelm Schadow, and Philip Veit, who took up their abode in the old Franciscan
                    convent of San Isidoro on the Pincian Hill, and were known among friends and
                    enemies by the descriptive epithets—“the Nazarites,” “the pre-Raphaelites,” “the
                    new-old school,” “the German-Roman artists,” “the church-romantic painters,”
                    “the German patriotic and religious painters.” Their precept was hard and honest
                    work and holy living; they eschewed the antique as pagan, the Renaissance as
                    false, and built up a severe revival on simple nature and on the serious art of
                    Perugino, Pinturicchio, Francia, and the young Raphael. The characteristics of
                    the style thus educed were nobility of idea, precision and even hardness of
                    outline, scholastic composition, with the addition of light, shade, and colour,
                    not for allurement, but chiefly for perspicuity and completion of motive.
                    Overbeck was mentor in the movement; a fellow-labourer writes:—“No one who saw
                    him or heard him speak could question his purity of motive, his deep insight and
                    abounding knowledge; he is a treasury of art and poetry, and a saintly man.” But
                    the struggle was hard and poverty its reward. Helpful friends, however, came in
                    Niebuhr, Bunsen, and Frederick Schlegel. Overbeck in 1813 joined the Roman
                    Catholic Church, and thereby he believed that his art received Christian
                    baptism.</p>
                <p>Faith in a mission begat enthusiasm among kindred minds, and timely commissions
                    followed. The Prussian consul, Bartholdi, had a house on the brow of the
                    Pincian, and he engaged Overbeck, Cornelius, Veit, and Schadow to decorate a
                    room 24 feet square with frescos from the Story of Joseph and his Brethren. The
                    subjects which fell to the lot of Overbeck were the Seven Years of Famine and
                    Joseph Sold by his Brethren. These tentative wallpictures, finished in 1818,
                    produced so favourable an impression among the Italians that in the same year
                    Prince Massimo commissioned Overbeck, Cornelius, Veit, and Schnorr to cover the
                    walls and ceilings of his garden pavilion, near St John Lateran, with frescos
                    illustrative of Tasso, Dante, and Ariosto. To Overbeck was assigned, in a room
                    15 feet square, the illustration of Tasso’s <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem
                    Delivered·,</hi> and of eleven compositions the largest and most noteworthy,
                    occupying one entire wall, is the Meeting of Godfrey de Bouillon and Peter the
                    Hermit. The completion of the frescos—very unequal in merit— after ten years’
                    delay, the overtaxed and enfeebled painter delegated to his friend Joseph
                    Führich. The leisure thus gained was devoted to a thoroughly congenial theme,
                    the Vision of St Francis, a wall-painting 20 feet long, figures life size,
                    finished in 1830, for the church of Sta Maria degli Angeli near Assisi. Overbeck
                    and the brethren set themselves the task of recovering the neglected art of
                    fresco and of monumental painting; they adopted the old methods, and their
                    success led to memorable revivals throughout Europe.</p>
                <p>Fifty years of the artist’s laborious life were given to oil and easel paintings,
                    of which the chief, for size and import, are the following :—Christ’s Entry into
                    Jerusalem (1824), in the Marien Kirche, Lübeck; Christ’s Agony in the Garden
                    (1835), in the great hospital, Hamburg; Lo Sposalizio (1836), Raczynski gallery,
                    Berlin; the Triumph of Religion in the Arts (1840), in the Stadel Institut,
                    Frankfort; Pietà (1846), in the Marien Kirche, Lübeck; the Incredulity of St
                    Thomas (1851), in the possession of Mr Beresford Hope, London; the Assumption of
                    the Madonna (1855), in Cologne Cathedral; Christ Delivered from the Jews (1858),
                    tempera, on a ceiling in the Quirinal Palace,—a commission from Pius IX., and a
                    direct attack on the Italian temporal government, therefore now covered by a
                    canvas adorned with Cupids. All the artist’s works are marked by religious
                    fervour, careful and protracted study, with a dry, severe handling, and an
                    abstemious colour.</p>
                <p>Overbeck belongs to eclectic schools, and yet was creative; he ranks among
                    thinkers, and his pen was hardly less busy than his pencil. He was a minor poet,
                    an essayist, and a voluminous letter-writer. His style is wordy and tedious;
                    like his art it is borne down with emotion and possessed by a somewhat morbid
                    “subjectivity.” His pictures were didactic, and used as propagandas of his
                    artistic and religious faith, and the teachings of such compositions as the
                    Triumph of Religion and the Sacraments he enforced by rapturous literary
                    effusions. His art was the issue of his life: his constant thoughts, cherished
                    in solitude and chastened by prayer, he transposed into pictorial forms, and
                    thus were evolved countless and much-prized drawings and cartoons, of which the
                    most considerable are the Gospels, forty cartoons (1852); Via Crucis, fourteen
                    water-colour drawings (1857); the Seven Sacraments, seven cartoons (1861).
                    Overbeck’s compositions, with few exceptions, are engraved. His life-work he
                    sums up in the words—“Art to me is as the harp of David, whereupon I would
                    desire that psalms should at all times be sounded to the praise of the Lord.” He
                    died in Rome in 1869, aged eighty, and lies buried in San Bernardo, the church
                    wherein he worshipped, <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> B. A.)</p>
