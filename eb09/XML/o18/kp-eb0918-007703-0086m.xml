                    square miles. The southern district belongs to the basin of the Yssel; the
                    northern is watered by the Vecht and various small streams falling into the
                    Zwartewater, the river which was for so many generations the object of dispute
                    between Zwolle and Hasselt. A large proportion of the surface is a sandy flat
                    relieved by hillocks, rising at times to a height of 230 feet above the sea.
                    Husbandry, stock-raising, and dairy-farming are the principal means of
                    subsistence in the province, though the fisheries, turf-cutting, the shipping
                    trade, and a number of manufacturing industries are also of importance. In the
                    district of Twenthe (towards the east) more especially there are a great many
                    cotton-mills and bleaching-works; brick and tile making is prosecuted in the
                    neighbourhood of the Yssel; and along the coast a good many people are engaged
                    in making mats and besoms. During the present century the province has been
                    opened up by the construction of several large canals—the Dedemsvaart, the
                    Noord-Willemsvaart (between the Yssel and the Zwartewater), the “Overyssel
                    canals” (running near the eastern frontier), &amp;e.; and a fairly complete
                    railway system has come into existence. The province is divided into the three
                    administrative districts of Zwolle, Deventer, and Almelo. Its population,
                    234,376 in 1859 and 263,008 in 1875 (134,201 males, 128,807 females), was
                    247,136 in 1879. Of the total for Ί875, 181,863 were Protestants, 76,891 Roman
                    Catholics, and 4018 Jews. The chief town, Zwolle, had in 1879 a communal
                    population of 22,759, and there were fourteen other communes with more than 2000
                    inhabitants, including Deventer, 19,162; Kämpen, 17,444; Almelo, 7758; Hengelo,
                    6502.</p>
                <p>Both the present name Overyssel and the older designation Oversticht are
                    explained by the fact that the province lies mainly on the other side of the
                    Yssel from Utrecht, with which it long constituted an episcopal principality.
                    Vollenhove was bestowed on the bishops in 943, Oldenzaal in 970, the land
                    north-east of Vollenhove in Ï042, Deventer in 1046, a part of Salland in 1226,
                    the countship of Goor in 1248, the lordship of Diepenheim in 1331, anl that of
                    Almelo in 1406. In 1527 Bishop Henry of Bavaria a l vised the recognition of
                    Charles V. as protector and ruler of the district, and Oversticht became
                    Overyssel. It was the sixth province to join the Union in 1579. During the
                    French occupation it bore the name of the department of Bouches de 1’Issel.</p>
