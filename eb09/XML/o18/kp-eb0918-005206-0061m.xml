                    Temminck, to a little bird, which, from the straightness of its claws,—a
                    character somewhat exaggerated by him,— its large feet and spiny tail, he judged
                    to be generically distinct from any other form. Concerning its affinities much
                    doubt has long prevailed, and this has been only lately set at rest. The typical
                    species, <hi rend="italic">O. spinicauda,</hi> is from south-eastern Australia,
                    where it is said to be very local in its distribution, and strictly terrestrial
                    in its habits. In the course of time two other small birds from New Zealand,
                    where they are known as the “Whitehead” and “Yellowhead,” were referred to the
                    genus, under the names of <hi rend="italic">O. albicilla</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It may be charitably

                    then the question of its affinity became more interesting. By some systematists
                    it was supposed to belong to the otherwise purely Neotropical <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dendrocolaptidae,</hi> and in that case would have been the sole representative
                    of the Tracheo<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0062-0053"/>phone <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> in the
                    Australian Region. Others considered it one of the nearest relatives of <hi
                    rend="italic">Menura,</hi> and if that view were correct it would add a third
                    form to the small section of <hi rend="italic">Pseudoscines</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lyre-Bird,</hi> vol. xv. p. 115); while Sundevall, in 1872,
                    placed it not far from <hi rend="italic">Timelia,</hi> among a group the proper
                    sorting of which will probably for years tax the ingenuity of ornithologists.
                    The late Mr W. A. Forbes shewed <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Soc.,</hi> 1882,
                    p. 544) that this last position was the most correct, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orthonyx spinicauda</hi> proved on dissection to be one of the true <hi
                    rend="italic">Oscines,</hi> but yet to stand, so far as is known, alone among
                    birds of that group, or any other group of <hi rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> in
                    consequence of the superficial course taken by the (left) carotid artery, which
                    is nowhere contained in the subvertebral canal. Whether this discovery will
                    require the segregation of the genus as the representative of a separate Family
                    <hi rend="italic">Orthonycidae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> which has been
                    proposed by Mr Salvin <hi rend="italic">(Catal. Coll. Strickland,</hi> p.
                    294)—remains to be seen. Forbes also demonstrated that one at least of the two
                    New-Zealand species above mentioned, <hi rend="italic">0. ochrocephala,</hi> had
                    been wrongly referred to this genus, and they therefore at present stand as <hi
                    rend="italic">Clitonyx.</hi> This is a point of some little importance in its
                    bearing on the relationship of the fauna of the two countries, for <hi
                    rend="italic">Orthonyx</hi> was supposed to be one of the few genera of
                    Land-birds common to both.</p>
                <p>The typical species of Orthonyx—for the scientific name has been adopted in
                    English—is rather larger than a Skylark, coloured above not unlike a
                    Hedge-Sparrow. The wings are, however, barred with white, and the chin, throat,
                    and breast are in the male pure white, but of a bright reddish-orange in the
                    female. The remiges are very short, rounded, and much incurved, showing a bird
                    of weak flight. The rectrices are very broad, the shafts stiff, and towards the
                    tip divested of barbs. Two other species that seem rightly to belong to the
                    genus have been described— <hi rend="italic">0. spaldingi</hi> from Queensland,
                    of much greater size than the type, and with a jet-black plumage, and <hi
                    rend="italic">0.</hi><hi rend="italic">novae-guineae,</hi> from the great island
                    of that name, which seems closely to resemble <hi rend="italic">0.
                    spinicauda.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
