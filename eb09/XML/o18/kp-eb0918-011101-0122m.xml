                <p><label type="entry">OYSTER-CATCHER</label>, a bird’s name which does not seem to
                    occur in books until 1731, when Catesby <hi rend="italic">{Nat. Hist.
                    Carolina,</hi> i. p. 85), used it for a species which he observed to be abundant
                    on the oyster-banks left bare at low water in the rivers of Carolina, and
                    believed to feed principally upon those molluscs. In 1776 Pennant applied the
                    name to the allied British species, which he and for nearly two hundred years
                    many other English writers had called the “Sea-Pie.” The change, in spite of the
                    misnomer—for, whatever may be the case elsewhere, in England the bird does not
                    feed upon oysters—met with general approval, and the new name has, at least in
                    books, almost wholly replaced what seems to have been the older one.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It seems however very
                    possible, judging from its equivalents in other European languages, such as the
                    Frisian <hi rend="italic">Oesterυisscher,</hi> the German <hi rend="italic"
                    >Augsterman,</hi><hi rend="italic">Austernfischer,</hi> and the like, that the
                    name “Oyster-catcher” may have been not a colonial invention but indigenous to
                    the mother-country, though it had not found its way into print before. The
                    French <hi rend="italic">Huttrier,</hi> however, appears to be a word coined by
                    Brisson. “Sea-Pie” has its analogues in the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pie-de-Mer,</hi> the German <hi rend="italic">Meerelster, Seeelster,</hi> and
                    so forth.</p></note> The Oyster-catcher of Europe is the <hi rend="italic"

                    some editions of Pliny (lib. x. cap. 47) is at best doubtful. Other editions
                    have <hi rend="italic">Himantopus</hi>; but Hardouin prefers the former reading.
                    Both words have passed into modern ornithology, the latter as the generic name
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Stilt</hi><hi rend="italic">(g.v.')∙,</hi> and some
                    writers have blended the" two in the strange and impossible compound <hi

                    rend="italic">ostralegus</hi> of Linnseus, belonging to the group now called <hi
                    rend="italic">Limicolae,</hi> and is generally included in the Family <hi
                    rend="italic">Charadriidae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> though some writers have
                    placed it in one of its own, <hi rend="italic">Haematopodidae,</hi> chiefly on
                    account of its peculiar bill—a long thin wedge, ending in a vertical edge. Its
                    feet also are much more fleshy than are generally seen in the Plover Family. In
                    its strongly-contrasted plumage of black and white, with a coral-coloured bill,
                    the Oystercatcher is one of the most conspicuous birds of the European coasts,
                    and in many parts is still very common. It is nearly always seen paired, though
                    the pairs collect in prodigious flocks; and, when these are broken up, its
                    shrill but musical cry of “tu-lup,” “tu-lup,” somewhat pettishly repeated, helps
                    to draw attention to it. Its wariness, however, is very marvellous, and even at
                    the breeding-season, when most birds throw off their shyness, it is not easily
                    approached within ordinary gunshot distance. The henbird commonly lays three
                    clay-coloured eggs, blotched with black, in a very slight hollow on the ground,
                    not far from the sea. As incubation goes on the hollow is somewhat deepened, and
                    perhaps some haulm is added to its edge, so that at last a very fair nest is the
                    result. The young, as in all <hi rend="italic">Limicolae,</hi> are at first
                    clothed in down, so mottled in colour as closely to resemble the shingle to
                    which, if they be not hatched upon it, they are almost immediately taken by
                    their parents, and there, on the slightest alarm, they squat close to elude
                    observation. This species occurs on the British coasts (very seldom straying
                    inland) all the year round; but there is some reason to think that those we have
                    in winter are natives of more northern latitudes, while our home-bred birds
                    leave us. It ranges from Iceland to the shores of the Red Sea, and lives chiefly
                    on marine worms, Crustacea, and such molluscs as it is able to obtain. It is
                    commonly supposed to be capable of prizing limpets from their rock, and of
                    opening the shells of mussels; but, though undoubtedly it feeds on both, further
                    evidence as to the way in which it procures them is desirable. Mr Harting
                    informs the writer that the bird seems to lay its head sideways on the ground,
                    and then, grasping the limpet’s shell close to the rock between the mandibles,
                    use them as scissor-blades to cut off the mollusc from its sticking-place. The
                    Oyster-catcher is not highly esteemed as a bird for the table.</p>
                <p>' Differing from this species in the possession of a longer bill, in having much
                    less white on its back, in the paler colour of its mantle, and in a few other
                    points, is the ordinary American species, already mentioned, <hi rend="italic"
                    >llaematopus</hi><hi rend="italic">palliatus.</hi> Except that its call-note,
                    judging from description, is unlike that of the European bird, the habits of the
                    two seem to be perfectly similar; and the same may be said indeed of all the
                    other species. The Falkland Islands are frequented by a third, <hi rend="italic"
                    >H. leucopus,</hi> very similar to the first, but with a black wing-lining and
                    paler legs, while the Australian Region possesses a fourth, <hi rend="italic">H.
                    longirostris,</hi> with a very long bill as its name intimates, and no white on
                    its primaries. China, Japan, and possibly eastern Asia in general have an
                    Oyster-catcher which seems to be intermediate between the last and the first. .
                    This has received the name of <hi rend="italic">H. osculans;</hi> but doubts
                    have been expressed as to its deserving specific recognition. Then we have a
                    group of species in which the plumage is wholly or almost wholly black, and
                    among them only do we find birds that fulfil the implication of the scientific
                    name of the genus by having feet that may be called blood-red. <hi rend="italic"
                    >H. niger,</hi> which frequents both coasts of the northern Pacific, has, it is
                    true, yellow legs, but towards the extremity of South America its place is taken
                    by <hi rend="italic">H. ater,</hi> in which they are bright red, and this bird
                    is further remarkable for its laterally compressed and much upturned bill. The
                    South African <hi rend="italic">H. capensis</hi> has also scarlet legs; but in
                    the otherwise very similar bird of Australia and New Zealand, <hi rend="italic"
                    >H. unicolor,</hi> these members are of a pale brick-colour. <hi
