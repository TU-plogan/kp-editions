                <p><label type="entry">ORVIETO</label>, a town in Umbria, Italy, on the main road
                    from Florence to Rome, situated on an almost isolated volcanic rock, about 770
                    feet above the plain. It is now the capital of a province, the seat of a bishop,
                    and in 1881 had a population of 8626. The town is of Etruscan origin, and is
                    said to have joined the Volscians in their war against Rome; it is the <hi
                        rend="italic">Urbibentum</hi> of Procopius (with which the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Herbanum</hi> of Pliny has been conjecturally identified), and the
                    mediaeval <hi rend="italic">Urbs Vetus</hi> (whence the modern name). Owing to
                    the strong Guelphic sympathies of the inhabitants, and the inaccessible nature
                    of the site, Orvieto has been constantly used as a place of refuge by the popes,
                    of whom no less than thirty-two have at different times found shelter there. The
                    town is very picturesque, both from its magnificent position and also from the
                    unusually large number of fine 13th-century houses and palaces which still exist
                    in its streets. The chief glory of the place is its splendid cathedral,
                    dedicated to the Virgin; it was founded in 1290 by Nicholas IV. on the site of
                    an older church; it was designed by Lorenzo Maitani, a Sienese architect, and
                    from the 13th till the 16th century was enriched by the labours of a whole
                    succession of great Italian painters and sculptors (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Orcagna).</hi> The exterior is covered with black and white marble; the
                    interior is of grey limestone with bands of a dark basaltic stone. The plan
                    consists of large rectangular nave, with semicircular recesses for altars,
                    opening out of the aisles, north and south. There are two transeptal chapels,
                    and a short choir. The most magnificent part of the exterior is the west façade,
                    built of richly-sculptured marble, divided into three gables with intervening
                    pinnacles, much resembling the front of Siena cathedral, the work of the same
                    architect. The mosaics are modern, and the whole church has suffered greatly
                    from recent “restoration.” The four wall-surfaces that flank the three western
                    doorways are decorated with very beautiful sculpture in relief, once ornamented
                    with colour, the work mainly of pupils of Niccolô Pisano, at the end of the 13th
                    century. This at least is Vasari’s statement. Giovanni Pisano, Arnolfo del
                    Cambio, and Fra Guglielmo da Pisa were the chief of these. The subjects are
                    scenes from the Old and New Testaments, and the Final Doom, with Heaven and
                    Hell. In the interior on the north, the Cappella del Corporale possesses a large
                    silver shrine, enriched with countless figures in relief and subjects in
                    translucent coloured enamels —one of the most important specimens of early

                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0063-0054"/>’s work that yet exists in Italy. It was begun
                    by Ugolino Veri 'of Siena in 1338, and was made to contain the Holy Corporal
                    from Bolsena, which, according to the legend, became miraculously stained with
                    blood during the celebration of mass to convince a sceptical priest of the truth
                    of the doctrine of transubstantiation. This is supposed to have happened in the
                    middle of the 13 th century, while Urban IV. was residing at Orvieto; and it was
                    to commemorate this miracle that the existing cathedral was built. On the south
                    side is the chapel of S. Brizio, separated from the nave by a fine 14th-century
                    wrought-iron screen. The walls and vault of this chapel are covered with some of
                    the best-preserved and finest frescos in Italy—among the noblest works of Fra
                    Angelico, his pupil Benozzo Gozzoli, and Luca Signorelli, mainly painted between
                    1450 and 1501,—the latter being of especial importance in the history of art
                    owing to their great influence on Michelangelo in his early days (see Symonds,
                        <hi rend="italic">Renaissance in Italy—Fine Arts,</hi> pp. 278-291). The
                    choir stalls are fine and elaborate specimens of <hi rend="italic">tarsia</hi>
                    and rich wood-carving—the work of various Sienese artists in the 14th century.
                    In 16th-century sculpture the cathedral is especially rich, containing many
                    statues, groups, and altar-reliefs by Simone Mosca, Ippolito Scalza, and Gian di
                    Bologna,—some of them well designed and carefully executed, but all showing
                    strongly the rapid decay into which the art of that time was falling. The well,
                    now disused, called II pozzo di S. Patrizio, is one of the chief curiosities of
                    Orvieto. It is 180 feet deep to the water-level and 46 feet in diameter, cut in
                    the rock, with a double winding inclined plane, so that oxen could ascend and
                    descend to carry up the water from the bottom. It was begun by the architect San
                    Gallo in 1527 for Clement VIL, who fled to Orvieto after the sack of Rome, and
                    was finished by Simone Mosca under Paul III. It resembles in many respects the
                    “Well of Joseph” (Saladin) in the citadel of Cairo. The Palazzo Faina has an
                    interesting collection of objects found in Etruscan tombs, of which a large
                    number exist in the neighbourhood of Orvieto. The church of S. Domenico contains
                    one of the finest works in sculpture by Arnolfo del Cambio. This is the tomb
                    with recumbent effigy of the Cardinal Brago or De Braye (1282), with much
                    beautiful sculpture and mosaic. It is signed <hi rend="smallcaps">hoc opvs fecit
                        arnvlfvs.</hi> It was imitated by Giovanni Pisano in his monument to Pope
                    Benedict XI. at Perugia.</p>
