                    at the Duke’s Theatre, Lincoln’s Inn Fields, in the <hi rend="italic">Forced
                    Marriage,</hi> a new play by Aphra Behn, but failed ignominiously. Declining to
                    take orders, he quitted the university in 1674, and obtained a cornetcy in a
                    troop of horse. Within a twelvemonth he sold his commission, and came to London
                    as a literary adventurer. In 1675 his <hi rend="italic">Alcibiades,</hi> a poor
                    play, was performed with indifferent success at the Duke’s Theatre. In the
                    following year <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos,</hi> a vigorous rhymed tragedy,
                    puerile in conception and showing little knowledge of human nature, but full of
                    declama?- tory energy, took the town fairly by storm. He followed it up with
                    translations of Racine’s <hi rend="italic">Berenice</hi> and Molière’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Fourberies</hi><hi rend="italic">de Scapin,</hi> and with a very
                    dull and indecent comedy of his own, <hi rend="italic">Friendship in
                    Fashion.</hi> He next went as a volunteer to the wars in Flanders, an
                    unfortunate expedition which pointed the merciless lampoons of Rochester, to
                    whom <hi rend="italic">Berenice</hi> had been dedicated, but with whom he had
                    now quarrelled. It also prompted his mediocre but not uninteresting play, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Soldier’s Fortune</hi> (1679), in which he has turned his
                    military experience to account. Next year he produced <hi rend="italic">The
                    Orphan,</hi> founded upon a novel called <hi rend="italic">English
                    Adventures,</hi> one of the two plays which have placed him in the first rank of
                    English tragic poets; and <hi rend="italic">Caius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Marius,</hi> a wholesale but acknowledged plagiarism from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Romeo and Juliet.</hi> In &lt;682 appeared his masterpiece, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Venice Preserved,</hi> the plot of which is taken from Saint Réal’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire de la Conjuration du Marquis de Bedemar.</hi> Its success
                    was decisive, but it brought little pecuniary advantage to the author, who was
                    already sinking into abject poverty, and, as appears by some letters attributed
                    by Mr Gosse to this date, was further tormented by a hopeless passion for the
                    beautiful Mrs Barry, the principal female performer in his plays. Some of his
                    letters to her were first published with Rochester’s works, and subsequently
                    included in his own. Desponding and broken-hearted, he seems to have given
                    himself up to dissipation, and produced but one more insignificant play, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Atheist,</hi> a second part of the <hi rend="italic">Soldier’s
                    Fortune</hi> (1684). On April 14, 1685, he died on Tower Hill, under most
                    melancholy circumstances if the tradition can be believed that he was choked by
                    a piece of bread begged from a passer by. There is no absolute confirmation of
                    this sad story, or of a later account which attributes his death to a fever
                    caught by over-exertion in pursuing a robber. Whatever the exact manner of his
                    decease, he certainly expired in obscurity and want. A tragedy called <hi
                    rend="italic">Heroic Friendship</hi> was published under his name in 1719. It
                    has generally been regarded as wholly spurious; but Mr Gosse, his most
                    sympathetic critic, recognizes some traces of his hand.</p>
                <p>Otway’s strong point is pathos. In this respect, though in no other, he is the
                    Euripides of the English stage. When he would excite compassion he is
                    irresistible. Unlike Shakespeare’s, however, his pathos springs entirely out of
                    the situation. His characters in themselves are not interesting, but the
                    circumstances in which they are placed afford scope for the most moving appeals,
                    and merit and demerit are altogether lost sight of in the contemplation of human
                    suffering. The love scenes between Jaffier and Belvidera cannot be surpassed;
                    and no plot more skilfully calculated to move the emotions than that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Venice Preserved</hi> was ever contrived by dramatist. It is to be
                    regretted that modem fastidiousness has banished from the stage <hi
                    rend="italic">The Orphan,</hi> in which Johnson saw no harm. In everything but
                    pathos Otway is mediocre: he has no deep insight into the human heart; his ideas
                    are circumscribed and commonplace; and his attempted eloquence is frequently
                    mere rant. Even the affecting madness of Belvidera verges dangerously on
                    burlesque, and is no <pb break="no"

                    and even <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos</hi> produces much the same effect in the
                    closet, though its rattling vigour carried it off well in the theatre at a time
                    when nature was little regarded. It was probably not unknown to Schiller. The
                    comedies and melodramas are simply tiresome, although a certain interest
                    attaches to the military scenes in the <hi rend="italic">Soldier’s Fortune.</hi>
                    There has hardly been another instance of a poet whose best and whose worst are
                    at such an immeasurable distance from each other as Otway’s; but his supreme
                    excellence in one of the most difficult branches of the dramatic art must always
                    be held to entitle him to an exalted place as a tragic poet. It has been
                    remarked that Dryden, with all his splendour, has but one truly pathetic passage
                    in the whole range of his dramas. Otway, writing simply from the heart, reached
                    at a bound an eminence inaccessible to the laborious efforts of the greater
                    poet. His miscellaneous poems are only interesting in so far as they illustrate
                    his life and character. Of the latter little is known. He was a man about town
                    in a dissipated age; but his references to his parents and friends, and his
                    letters to the object of his unfortunate passion, show that he possessed deep
                    and refined feeling.</p>
