                    Lorraine. Otho hastily assembled an army, drove Lothair from Lorraine, and
                    pushed on to Paris, which he unsuccessfully besieged. In the treaty by which
                    peace was concluded, France formally recognized the right of Germany to
                    Lorraine. Otho next went to restore order in Rome, from which Pope Benedict VII.
                    had been expelled by Crescentius. In southern Italy Otho (who, in virtue of his
                    wife, Theophano, claimed Apulia and Calabria} waged war with the Saracens, and
                    defeated them in a great battle. On the 13th July 982, however, he himself was
                    defeated, and was very nearly taken prisoner. At a diet in Verona, attended by
                    German and Italian princes, his son Otho, three years of age, was chosen to be
                    his successor, and arrangements were made for a new campaign in the south. On
                    the 7th December 983 Otho II. died, leaving the empire in a state of confusion,
                    the Danes and the Wends, encouraged by his defeat, having risen against German
                    supremacy. Although warlike and impetuous, Otho II. was a man of refined and
                    scholarly tastes, which had been carefully cultivated by his mother.</p>
