                    literary and historical criticism is concerned, of the Neo-Catholic movement in

                    1813. His family is said (as the name suggests) to have been of Jewish
                    extraction, and has a circumstantial though possibly fabulous genealogy of
                    extraordinary length. At any rate it had been settled in the Lyonnais for many
                    centuries. In the third generation before Frédéric it had reached distinction
                    through Jacques Ozanam, a mathematician of eminence. The critic’s father,
                    Antoine 0zanam, served in the armies of the republic, but could not stomach the
                    empire, and betook himself to commerce, teaching, and finally medicine. The boy
                    was brought up at Lyons, and was strongly influenced by one of his masters, the
                    Abbé Noirot. His conservative and religious instincts showed themselves early,
                    and he published a pamphlet against Saint-Simonianism in 1831, which attracted
                    the attention of Lamartine. He was then sent to study law in Paris, where he
                    fell in with the Ampère family, and through them with excellent literary
                    society. He also came under the influence of the Abbé Gerbet, the soberest and
                    most learned member of the religious school of Lamennais and Lacordaire. Ozanam,
                    however, though he joined with all the fervour of youth in the Neo-Catholic
                    polemic, never underwent the uncomfortable experiences of the direct followers
                    of Lamennais. His journal (for in those years every one was a journalist) was
                    not the <hi rend="italic">Avenir,</hi> but the more orthodox <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tribune</hi><hi rend="italic">Catholique</hi> of Bailly, and he with some other
                    young men founded the famous society of St Vincent de Paul, which was occupied
                    in practical good works. Meanwhile he did not neglect his studies. He was called
                    to the bar, and. in 1838 won his doctor’s degree in letters with a thesis on
                    Dante, which was the beginning of his best-known book. A year later he was
                    appointed to a professorship of commercial law at Lyons, and in another year
                    assistant professor to Fauriel at the Sorbonne. On this latter precarious
                    endowment he married, and visited Italy on his wedding tour. At Fauriel’s death
                    in 1844 he succeeded to the full professorship of foreign literature, and his
                    future was thereby tolerably assured. He had, however, by no means a strong
                    constitution, and he tried it severely by combining with his professorial work a
                    good deal of literary occupation, while he still continued his custom of
                    district-visiting as a member of the society of St Vincent de Paul. The short
                    remainder of his life was extremely busy, though it was relieved at intervals by
                    visits to Italy, Brittany, England, and other places. He produced numerous
                    books, and during the revolution of 1848 (of which, like not a few of his
                    school, he took an unduly sanguine view) he once more became a journalist in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ère Nouvelle</hi> and other papers for a short time. He was in
                    London at the time of the Exhibition of 1851. In little more than two years from
                    that date he died of consumption (which he had vainly hoped to cure by visiting
                    Italy) on September 8, 1853, at the age of forty.</p>
                <p>0zanam deserves the phrase which has been attached to his name at the beginning
                    of this article. He was more sincere, more learned, and more logical than
                    Chateaubriand, less of a political partisan and less of a literary
                    sentimentalist than Montalembert. λVhether his conception of a democratic
                    Catholicism was a possible one is of course a matter of opinion, and it may be
                    frankly admitted that, well as he knew the Middle Ages, he looked at them too
                    exclusively through the spectacles of a defender of the papacy. He confessed
                    that his object was to “prove the contrary thesis to Gibbon’s.” And no doubt any
                    historian, literary or other, who begins with the desire to prove a thesis is
                    sure to go more or less wrong. But his pictures were not so much coloured by his
                    prepossessions as some contemporary pictures on the other side, and he had not
                    only a great knowledge of mediaeval literature, but also a strong and
                    appreciative sympathy with mediaeval life.</p>
