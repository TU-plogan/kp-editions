                    miles from north to south and from 15 to 20 miles east and west, and bounded,
                    except towards the west, where it opens on Idzuminada Bay, by hills of
                    considerable height. It lies on both sides of the Yodogawa, or rather of its
                    headwater the Aji (the outlet of Lake Biwa), and is so intersected by
                    river-branches and canals as to suggest a comparison with Venice or Stockholm.
                    River steamers ply between Ozaka and its port Hiogo or Kobe, and a railway
                    between the two places, opened in 1873, has since been extended to Kioto and
                    farther. The streets are not very broad, but for the most part they are regular
                    and well kept; the houses, about 20 or 25 feet in height, are all built of wood.
                    Shin-sai Bashi Suji, the principal thoroughfare, leads from Kitahama, the
                    district lying on the south side of the Tosabori, to the iron suspension bridge
                    (Shin-sai Bashi) over the Dotom-bori. The foreign settlement is at Kawaguchi at
                    the junction of the Shirinashi-gawa and the Aji-Kawa. It is almost deserted by
                    the foreign merchants, who prefer to have their establishments at Kobe, but it
                    is the seat of a number of European mission stations. Though the Buddhist
                    temples of Ozaka number 1380 and the Shinto temples 538, few of them are of much
                    note. The Buddhistic Tennoji, founded by Shotoku Tai-shi, and restored in 1664,
                    covers an immense area at the south-east corner of the city, and has a fine
                    pagoda from which an admirable view of the country is obtained. Two other
                    Buddhist temples, which form a conspicuous object in the heart of the city, are
                    occupied, one as a Government hospital and the other as a Government school. The
                    principal secular buildings are the castle, the mint, and the arsenal. The
                    castle was founded in 1584 by Hideyoshi; the enclosed palace, “probably the
                    finest building Japan ever saw,” survived the capture of the castle by Iyeyasu,
                    and in 1867 and 1878 witnessed the reception of the foreign legations by the
                    Tokugawa shoguns; but in the latter year it was fired by the Tokugawa party.
                    Externally the whole castle is protected by a double enceinte of high and
                    massive walls and broad moats—the outer moat from 80 to 120 yards across and <pb

                    granite_40 feet by 10 or 20 feet occur in the masonry. The mint,'erected by T.
                    J. Waters, and organized by Major T. W. Kinder and twelve European officials,
                    covers an area of 40 acres, and employs about 600 persons. It was opened in
                    1871. Both cannon and guns are manufactured in the arsenal. Apart from these
                    Government establishments Ozaka is the seat of great industrial activity,
                    possessing iron foundries, copper foundries, and rolling mills, antimony works,
                    large glass works, paper mills, a sugar refinery, a cotton spinning mill, rice
                    mills, an oil factory, sulphuric acid works, match factories, soap works, saké
                    distilleries, a brewery (after the German pattern), shipyards, &amp;c. Bronzes,
                    sulphuric acid, and matches are among its chief exports. In the surrounding
                    district large quantities of rape-seed are grown. The population in 1872 was
                    271,992; in 1877, 284,105.</p>
                <p>Ozaka owes its origin to Ren-nio Sho-nin, the 8th head of the Shin-Shiu sect, who
                    in 1495-6 built, on the site now occupied by the castle, a temple which
                    afterwards became the principal residence of his successors. In 1580, after ten
                    years’ successful defence of his position, Ken-nio, the 11th “abbot,” was
                    obliged to surrender; and in 1583 the victorious Hideyoshi made Ozaka his
                    capital. The town was opened to foreign trade in 1868.</p>
