                    rend="italic">Alp</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Elf</hi> of Teutonic folklore. It
                    is, however, impossible to establish any connexion between the Orpheus legend in
                    the highly developed form which alone has come down to us and the beliefs
                    entertained about Ribhu and Elf. In Greece, Orpheus was always associated with
                    the early Thracian race, which was supposed to have inhabited the neighbourhood
                    of Mount Helicon, the district of Pieria in Macedonia, and the coasts and
                    country generally on the north of the Aegean Sea. The religion of the Muses and
                    the religion of Dionysus, with both of which Orpheus is connected, are
                    intimately associated with this race (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Muses).</hi>
                    Orpheus was son of the river god Oeagrus and the Muse Calliope. He played so
                    divinely on the lyre that all nature stopped to listen to his music. When his
                    wife Eurydice died, he went after her to Hades, and the strains of his lyre
                    softened even the stern gods of the dead. Eurydice was released, and followed
                    him to the upper world, but he looked back towards her before she was clear of
                    the world of death and she vanished again from his sight. The Thracian women,
                    jealous of his unconquerable love for his lost wife, tore him to pieces during
                    the frenzy of the Bacchic orgies; his head and his lyre floated “down the swift
                    Hebrus to the Lesbian shore,” where a shrine of Orpheus was built near Antissa.
                    The legend, with all its melancholy, its love, and its sympathy with nature, has
                    obviously taken shape in the hands of an early school of lyric poetry,
                    associated with the worship of the Muses; the ancient Thracian <hi rend="italic"
                    >aoidoi</hi> are recognized as the earliest singers in Greece, but their art and
                    their Muse-religion have passed to Lesbos, which was the chief seat of Greek
                    lyric poetry in the 7th and 6th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The
                    tragic death of Orpheus is obviously connected with the Bacchic ritual (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Orgies).</hi> Orpheus is the representative of the god torn to
                    pieces every year by the envious powers of nature, a ceremony that was duly
                    enacted by the Bacchae, in earlier times with a human victim, afterwards with a
                    bull to represent the bull-formed god.</p>
                <p>The Orpheus legend is closely analogous with that of Marsyas. Orpheus and Marsyas
                    are embodiments of the supposed origin of music in Thrace and in Phrygia,
                    countries inhabited by kindred races, viz., the influences of nature (both being
                    closely connected with river-worship) and the teaching or gift of a goddess. The
                    melancholy history of both must have its origin in the character of the
                    Thraco-Phrygian people: the divine gift brings sorrow as well as power. Each
                    uses the musical instrument that characterized his country.</p>
                <p>The name of Orpheus is equally important in the religious history of Greece; and
                    in this respect also it is associated with Thrace. He was the mythic founder of
                    a religious school or sect, with a code of rules of life, a mystic eclectic
                    theology, a system of purificatory and expiatory rites, and peculiar mysteries.
                    This school is first observable under the rule of Pisistratus at Athens in the
                    6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Its doctrines are founded on two
                    elements—(1) the Thraco-Phrygian religion of Bacchus with its enthusiastic
                    orgies, its mysteries, and its purifications, and (2) the tendency to
                    philosophic speculation on the nature and mutual relations of the numerous gods,
                    developed at this time by intercourse with Egypt and the East, and by the
                    quickened intercourse between different tribes and different religions in Greece
                    itself. These causes produced similar results in different parts of Greece. The
                    close analogy between Pythagoreanism and Orphism has been recognized from
                    Herodotus (ii. 81) to the latest modern writers. Both inculcated a peculiar kind
                    of ascetic life; both had a mystical speculative theory of religion, with
                    purificatory rites, abstinence from beans, &amp;c.; but Orphism was more
                    especially religious, while Pythagoreanism, at least originally, inclined more
                    to be a political and philosophical creed.</p>
                <p>The rules of the Orphic life <hi rend="italic">(βίος 'Ορφικός)</hi> prescribed
                    abstinence from beans, flesh, certain kinds of fish, &amp;c., the wearing of a
                    special kind of clothes, and numerous other practices and abstinences, for all
                    of which reasons were given in religious myths <hi rend="italic">(ιepoι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">λόγοι).</hi> The ritual of worship was peculiar, not admitting
                    bloody sacrifices. The belief was taught in the homogeneity of all living
                    things, in the transmigration of souls, in the view that the soul is imprisoned
                    in the body, and that it may gradually attain perfection during connexion with a
                    series of bodies. It is not possible here to treat of the Orphic mysteries (see
                    Lobeck, <hi rend="italic">Aglaophamus).</hi> The influence of Orphism on the
                    Eleusinian mysteries has been described under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mysteries,</hi> and points of similarity and diversity noted. Greek literature
                    was always hostile to the Orphic religion <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Eur., <hi
                    rend="italic">Hipp.,</hi> 952 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; Plato, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rep.,</hi> ii. 364; Theophr., <hi rend="italic">Char.,</hi>
                    25).</p>
                <p>A large number of writings in the tone of the Orphic religion existed and were
                    ascribed to Orpheus, as the poems of the Trojan and Theban cycles to Homer and
                    Hesiod. The real names of the authors of these works were in many cases known to
                    those who inquired into the matter, though the common people believed that all
                    were written before the time of Homer by Orpheus (Herod., ii. 53). Aristotle
                    declared that there had never been a poet Orpheus. The names of poets of the
                    Orphic cycle can be traced as early as 550 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Onomacritus is the most famous of them all (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Onomacritus).</hi> These poems were recited at rhapsodic contests alongside of
                    Homeric and Hesiodic works (Plato, <hi rend="italic">Ion,</hi> 536). Orphic
                    hymns were used in the mysteries at Phlya and Eleusis (Paus., ix. 27, 2; 30, 5;
                    i. 14). The poems were a favourite subject of study for the Alexandrian
                    grammarians. Again in the controversies between Christian and pagan writers in
                    the 3d and 4th centuries after Christ the Orphic religious poems played a great
                    part: pagan writers quoted them to show the real meaning of the multitude of
                    gods, while Christians retorted by reference to the obscene and disgraceful
                    fictions by which they degraded the gods.</p>
                <p>The Orphic literature was united in <hi rend="italic">a. corpus,</hi> entitled τά
                    <hi rend="italic">'Ορφικά,</hi> or Tà <hi rend="italic">els</hi><hi rend="italic

                    were connected, and the whole prefaced by a dedication to Musaeus as son and
                    first initiate of Orpheus. The chief poem was <hi rend="italic">η</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τoυ</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Oρφiωs θeoλoyla</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">μυθoπoda,</hi> which existed in several versions, showing
                    considerable variations. There was also a collection of Orphic hymns, containing
                    numerous liturgie songs used in the mysteries and in exoteric ceremonial; also
                    practical treatises, <hi rend="italic">'Ερya</hi><hi rend="italic">καϊ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">'Hμepaι,</hi> and poems on stones, herbs, and plants, &amp;c.
                    These works have been lost, except fragments collected by Lobeck. There exist
                    several poems called Orphic <hi rend="italic">(Argonautica,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hymns, Lithica).</hi> These are very late works, composed at the
                    time when paganism was passing away before Christianity.</p>
                <p>The story of Orpheus, as was to be expected of a legend told both by Ovid and
                    Boetius (bk. iii. cap. xxxv.), retained its popularity throughout the Middle
                    Ages and was transformed into the likeness of a northern fairy tale. In English
                    mediaeval literature it appears in three somewhat different versions:— <hi
