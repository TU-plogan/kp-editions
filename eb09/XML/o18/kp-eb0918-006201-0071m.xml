                    known by report than the strange, majestic, and fleet-footed creature that
                    “scorneth the horse and his rider,” or one that from the earliest times to the
                    present has been oftener more or less fully described; and there must be few
                    persons in any civilized country unacquainted with the appearance of this, the
                    largest of living birds, whose size is not insignificant in comparison even with
                    the mightiest of the plumed giants that of old existed upon the earth, since an
                    adult male will stand nearly 8 feet in height, and weigh 300 B&gt;.</p>
                <p>As to the ways of the Ostrich in a state of nature, not much has been added of
                    late years to the knowledge acquired and imparted by former travellers and
                    naturalists, many of whom enjoyed opportunities that will never again occur of
                    discovering its peculiarities, for even the most favourably-placed of their
                    successors in recent years seem to content themselves with repeating the older
                    observations, and to want either leisure or patience to make additions thereto,
                    their personal acquaintance with the bird not amounting to more than such casual
                    meetings with it as must inevitably fall to the lot of those who traverse its
                    haunts. Thus there are still several dubious points in its natural history. On -
                    the other hand we unquestionably know far more than our predecessors respecting
                    its geographical distribution, which has been traced with great minuteness in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Vögel Ost-Afrikas</hi> of Drs Finsch and Hartlaub, who
                    have therein given (pp. 597-607) the most comprehensive account of the bird that
                    is to be found in the literature of ornithology.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A good summary of it is contained in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ostriches and Ostrich Farming</hi> of Messrs De Mosenthal and
                    Harting, from which the accompanying figure is, with permission, taken. Von
                    Heuglin, in his <hi rend="italic">Ornithologie Nordost-Afrika'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> (pp. 925-935), has given more particular details of the
                    Ostrich’s distribution in Africa.</p></note> As with most birds, the Ostrich is
                    disappearing before the persecution of man, and this fact it is which gives the
                    advantage to older travellers, for there are many districts, some Qf wide
                    extent, known to have been frequented by the Ostrich within the present century,
                    especially towards the extremities of its African range— as on the borders of
                    Egypt and the Cape Colony—in which it no longer occurs, while in Asia there is
                    evidence, more or less trustworthy, of its former existence in most parts of the
                    south-western desert-tracts, in few of which it is now to be found. Xenophon’s
                    notice of its abundance in Assyria <hi rend="italic">(Anabasis,</hi> i. 5) is
                    well known. It is probable that it still lingers in the wastes of Kirwan in
                    eastern Persia, whence examples may occasionally stray northward to those of
                    Turkestan,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Drs Finsch
                    and Hartlaub quote a passage from Remusat’s <hi rend="italic">Remarques sur

                    repeated, as to its former occurrence in Baloochistan or Sindh, though not
                    incredible, seems to rest on testimony as yet too slender for acceptance.
                    Apparently the most northerly limit of the Ostrich’s ordinary range at the
                    present day cannot be further than that portion of the Syrian Desert lying
                    directly to the eastward of Damascus; and, within the limits of what may be.
                    called Palestine, Canon Tristram <hi rend="italic">(Fauna and Flora of
                    Palestine,</hi> p. 139) regards it as but a straggler from central Arabia,
                    though we have little information as to its appearance and distribution in that
                    country. Africa, however, is still, as in ancient days, the continent in which
                    the Ostrich most flourishes, and from the confines of Barbary to those of the
                    European settlements in the south it appears to inhabit every waste sufficiently
                    extensive to afford it the solitude it loves, and in many wide districts, where
                    the influence of the markets of civilization is feebly felt, to be still almost
                    as abundant as ever. Yet even there it has to contend with deadly foes in the
                    many species of <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> which frequent the same tracts
                    and prey upon its eggs and young—the latter especially; and Lichtenstein long
                    ago remarked that if it were not for its numerous enemies “the multiplication of
                    Ostriches would be quite unexampled.” The account given of the habits of the
                    species by this naturalist, who had excellent opportunities of observing it

                    most of its more recent historians we may do well by calling attention thereto.
                    Though sometimes assembling in troops of from thirty to fifty, and then
                    generally associating with zebras or with some of the larger antelopes,
                    Ostriches commonly, and especially in the breeding season, live in companies of
                    not more than four or five, one of which is a cock and the rest are hens. All
                    the latter lay their eggs in one and the same nest, a shallow pit scraped out by
                    their feet, with the earth heaped around to form a kind of wall against which
                    the outermost circle of eggs rest. As soon as ten or a dozen eggs are laid, the
                    cock begins to brood, always taking his place on them at nightfall surrounded by
                    his wives, while by day they relieve one another, more it would seem to guard
                    their common treasure from jackals and small beasts-of-prey than directly to
                    forward the process of hatching, for that is often left wholly to the sun.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By those whose experience is
                    derived from the observation of captive Ostriches this fact has been often
                    disputed. But, to say nothing of the effects of the enforced monogamy in which
                    such birds live, the difference of circumstances under which they find
                    themselves, and in particular their removal from the heat-retaining sands of the
                    desert and its burning sunshine, is quite enough to account for the change of
                    habit. Von Heuglin also (p. 933) is explicit on this point. That the female
                    Ostriches while on duty crouch down to avoid detection is only natural, and this
                    habit seems to have led hasty observers to suppose they were really
                    brooding.</p></note> Some thirty eggs are laid in the nest, and round it are
                    scattered perhaps as many more. These last are said to be broken by the old
                    birds to serve as nourishment for the newly-hatched chicks, whose stomachs
                    cannot bear the hard food on which their parents thrive. The greatest care is
                    taken by them not only to place the nest where it may not be discovered, but to
                    avoid being seen when going to or from it, and their solicitude for their tender
                    young is no less. Andersson in his <hi rend="italic">Lake N</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">gami</hi> (pp. 253-269) has given a lively
                    account of the pursuit by himself and Mr Francis Galton of a brood of Ostriches,
                    in the course of which the father of the family flung himself on the ground and
                    feigned being wounded to distract their attention from his offspring. Though the
                    Ostrich ordinarily inhabits the most arid districts, it requires water to drink;
                    more than that, it will frequently bathe, and sometimes even, according to Von
                    Heuglin, in the sea.</p>
                <p>The question whether to recognize more than one species of Ostrich, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Struthio camelus</hi> of Linnaeus, has been for some years
                    agitated without leading to a satisfactory solution. It has long been known
                    that, while eggs from North Africa present a perfectly smooth surface, those
                    from South Africa are pitted (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p.
                    775, note 1). It has also been observed that northern birds have the skin of the
                    parts not covered with feathers flesh-coloured, while this skin is bluish in
                    southern birds, and hence the latter have been thought to need specific
                    designation as <hi rend="italic">S. australis.</hi> Still more recently examples
                    from the Somali country have been described as forming a distinct species under
                    the name of N. <hi rend="italic">molybdophanes</hi> from the leaden colour of
                    their naked parts.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Struthio</hi> forms the type of one group of the
                    Subclass <hi rend="italic">Ratitae,</hi> which differs so widely from the rest,
                    in points that have been concisely set forth by Prof. Huxley <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1867, p. .419), as to justify us in regarding it as
                    an Order, to which the name <hi rend="italic">Struthiones</hi> may be applied
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ornithology,</hi> p. 44); but that term, as well as
                    <hi rend="italic">Struthionidae,</hi> has been often used in a more general
                    sense by systematists, even to signify the whole of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ratitae,</hi> and hence for the present caution must be exercised as to whether
                    certain fossil remains from the Sivalik formation, referred to <hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">Struthionidae,"</hi> be regarded as true Ostriches or
                    not. The most obvious distinctive character presented by the Ostrich is the
                    presence of two toes only, the third and fourth, on each foot,—a character
                    absolutely peculiar to the genus <hi rend="italic">Struthio.</hi></p>
                <p>The great mercantile value of Ostrich-feathers, and the increasing difficulty,
                    due to the causes already mentioned, of procuring them from wild birds, has led
                    to the formation in the Cape Colony and elsewhere of numerous “Ostrich-farms,”
                    on which these birds are kept in confinement, and at regular intervals of time
                    deprived of their plumes. In favourable localities and with judicious management
                    these establishments are understood to yield very considerable profit; while, as
                    the ancient taste for wearing Ostrich-feathers shews no sign of falling off, but
                    seems rather to be growing, it is probable that the practice will yet be largely
                    extended.</p>
