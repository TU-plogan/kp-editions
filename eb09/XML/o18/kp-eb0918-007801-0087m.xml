                <p><label type="entry">OVID</label> (P. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ovidius</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Naso)</hi> was the last in order, of time of the poets of the
                    Augustan age, whose works have given to it the distinction of ranking among the
                    great eras in the history of human culture. As is the case with most other Roman
                    writers, his personal history has to be gathered almost entirely from his own
                    writings. The materials for his life are partly the record of the immediate
                    impressions of the time in which they were written contained in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Amores,</hi> partly the reminiscences of his happier days, to
                    which his mind constantly recurred in the writings from his place of exile.</p>
                <p>His life is almost coincident in extent with that of the Augustan age. The year
                    of his birth, 43 B.c.,—the year of the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa, which
                    intervened between the death of Julius Caesar and the partition of the Roman
                    world among the Triumvirs,—may be regarded as the last year of the republic. It
                    was the year of the death of Cicero, which marks the close of the republican
                    literature. Thus the only form of political life known to Ovid was that of the
                    ascendency and absolute rule of Augustus and his successor. His character was
                    neither strengthened nor sobered, like that of his older contemporaries, by
                    personal recollection of the crisis through which the republic passed into the
                    empire. There is no sense of political freedom in any of his writings. The
                    spirit inherited from his ancestors was that of the Italian country districts
                    and <hi rend="italic">municipia,</hi> not that of Rome. He was sprung from the
                    Peligni, one of the four small mountain peoples whose proudest memories were of
                    the part they had played in the Social War. They had no old race-hostility with
                    Rome, such as that which made the most powerful representative of the Sabellian
                    stock remain till the last her implacable enemy; and their opposition to the
                    senatorian aristocracy in the Social War would predispose them to accept the
                    empire. Ovid belonged by birth to the same social class as Tibullus and
                    Propertius, that of old hereditary landowners; but he was more fortunate than
                    they in the immunity which his native district enjoyed from the confiscations
                    made by the triumvirs. His native town and district, Sulmo, lay high among the
                    Apennines, and is described by Mr Hare as “grandly situated on an isolated
                    platform, backed by snowy mountains.” The poet himself describes this district
                    as remarkable for the abundance of its streams and for its salubrity—</p>
                <p>‘ * Parva, sed irriguis ora salubris aquis;” and he recalls the fresh charm of
                    its scenery from the desolate waste of his Scythian exile. To his early life in
                    such a district he may have owed his eye for natural beauty, and that interest
                    in the common sights of the country which relieves the monotony of his life of
                    pleasure in Rome and the dreary record of the life spent within the walls of
                    Tomi, and enables him to add the charm of natural scenery to the romantic
                    creations of his fancy. The pure air of this mountain home may have contributed
                    to the vigorous vitality which prevented the life of pleasure from palling on
                    him, and which beats strongly even through all the misery of his exile. But if
                    this vitality —with its natural accompaniment, a keen capacity for enjoyment—was
                    a gift due to his birthplace, it was apparently a gift transmitted to him by
                    inheritance: for he tells us that his father lived till the age of ninety, and
                    that he performed the funeral rites to his mother after his father’s death.
                    While he mentions both with the piety characteristic of the old Italian, he
                    tells us little more about them than that “their thrift curtailed his youthful
                    expenses,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ex</hi><hi rend="italic">Ponto,</hi> i. 8, 42.</p></note> and that
                    his father did what he could to dissuade him from poetry, and to force him into
                    the more profitable career of the law courts. He had one brother, exactly a year
                    older than himself, who, after showing promise as a speaker, died at the age of
                    twenty. The tone in which Ovid speaks of him is indicative of sincere affection,
                    but not of such depth of feeling as was called forth in Catullus by a similar
                    loss. The two brothers had been brought early to Rome for their education, where
                    they attended the lectures of the most eminent rhetoricians of their time.
                    Education had become more purely rhetorical and literary, less philosophical and
                    political, than it had been in a previous generation. Ovid is said to have
                    attended these lectures eagerly, and to have shown in his exercises that his
                    gift was poetical rather than oratorical, and that he had a distaste for the
                    severer processes of thought. Like Pope, “he lisped in numbers,” and he wrote
                    and destroyed many verses before he published anything. The earliest edition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Amores,</hi> which first appeared in five books, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Heroides</hi> were given by him to the world at an early age.
                    He courted the society of the older and younger poets of his time, and formed
                    one among those friendly coteries who read or recited their works to one another
                    before they gave them to the world. “He had only seen Virgil”; but Virgil’s
                    friend and contemporary Aemilius Macer used in his advanced years to read his
                    didactic epic to him; and, although there is no indication in the works of
                    either the reigning or the rising poet of any intimacy between them, even the
                    fastidious Horace sometimes delighted his ears <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n88/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0088-0079"/> with the music of his verse. He had a closer bond
                    of intimacy with the younger poets of the older generation, Tibullus, whose
                    death he laments in one of the few pathetic pieces among his earlier writings,
                    and Propertius, to whom he describes himself as united in the close ties of
                    comradeship. The name of Maecenas occurs nowhere in his poems. The time of his
                    paramount influence both on public affairs and on literature was past before
                    Ovid entered on his poetical career, but Messala and Fabius Maximus, whose name
                    is mentioned by Juvenal along with that of Maecenas as the type of a munificent
                    patron of letters in the Augustan age, encouraged his earliest efforts. With
                    their sons he lived in intimacy in after years, and, as he speaks of having
                    known the younger Fabius in his cradle, his friendship with his family must have
                    begun early in his career. He enjoyed also the intimacy of poets and men of
                    literary accomplishment belonging to a younger generation; and with one of them,
                    Macer, he travelled for more than a year. It is not mentioned whether he
                    travelled immediately after the completion of his education, or in the interval
                    between the publication of his earlier poems and that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Medea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ars Amatoria;</hi> but it is in his later
                    works, the <hi rend="italic">.Fasti</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metamorphoses,</hi> that we seem chiefly to recognize the impressions of the
                    scenes he visited. In one of the epistles written from Pontus to his
                    fellow-traveller there is a vivid record of the pleasant time they had passed
                    together. Athens was to a Roman of that time <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> what
                    Rome is to an educated Englishman of the present day. Ovid speaks of having gone
                    there under the influence of literary enthusiasm (“studiosus ”); but the
                    impression of his visit which remains on his writings is not of the wisdom
                    taught “among the woods of Academus,” but of the flowers that grow on the
                    neighbouring Hymettus. A similar impulse induced him to visit the supposed site
                    of Troy. The two friends saw together the splendid cities of Asia, which had
                    inspired the enthusiasm of travel in Catullus, and had become familiar to Cicero
                    and Horace during the years they passed abroad. They spent nearly a year in
                    Sicily, which attracted him, as it had attracted Lucretius<note anchored="true"

                    sea-shore and inland scenery, and of legendary and poetical association,—a charm
                    which has found its most enduring expression in some of his most delightful
                    tales. He recalls with a fresh sense of pleasure the incidents of their tour
                    (which they made sometimes in a pinnace or yacht, sometimes in a light
                    carriage), and the endless delight which they had in each other’s conversation.
                    We would gladly exchange the recorα of his life of pleasure in Rome for more of
                    these recollections. The highest type of classic culture realized in ancient
                    Rome—the type realized in such men as Cicero and Catullus, Virgil and Horace,
                    Ovid and Germanicus—shows its affinity to a type which is the result of
                    essentially similar studies in modern times by nothing more clearly than the
                    enthusiasm for travel among lands famous for their natural beauty, their
                    monumehts of art, and their historical associations.</p>
                <p>When settled at Rome, although a public career, leading to senatorian position,
                    was open to him, and, although he filled various judicial offices, and claims to
                    have filled them well, he had no ambition for such distinction, and looked upon
                    pleasure and poetry as the occupations of his life. He tells us that he was
                    married, when little more than a boy, to a wife for whom he did not care, who,
                    he implies, was not worthy of him, and from whom he was soon separated, and
                    afterwards to a second wife, with whom his union, although through no fault of
                    hers, did not last long. But he had other objects of his volatile affections,
                    and one of them, Corinna, after the example of his predecessors Gallus,
                    Propertius, and Tibullus, and their Alexandrian prototypes Callimachus,
                    Philetas, &lt;fcc., he makes the heroine of his love elegies. It is doubtful
                    whether, like Lesbia, Delia, and Cynthia, she belonged to the class of Roman
                    ladies of recognized position, or to that to which the Chloes and Lalages of
                    Horace’s artistic fancy evidently belong. If trust can be placed in the later
                    apologies for his life, in which he states that he had never given occasion for
                    any serious scandal, it is probable that she belonged to the class of
                    “libertinae.” Ovid is not only a less constant but he is a much less serious
                    lover than Catullus, Tibullus, or Propertius. His tone is that either of mere
                    sensual selfregarding feeling or of persiflage. That tone is in many ways
                    offensive to modern taste, but in nothing is it more characteristic of his age
                    than in his light-hearted justification of his choice both of a theme and of a
                    career. In his complete emancipation from all sense of restraint or wish for
                    better things, Ovid goes beyond all his predecessors, although Tibullus and
                    Propertius, and even Horace in the ironical disclaimers of his earlier <hi
                    rend="italic">Odes,</hi> give indication of the same state of feeling. In this
                    Ovid reflects the tastes and tone of fashionable, well-born, and wealthy Roman
                    society between the years 20 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and the beginning of
                    our era. The memory of the civil wars no longer weighed on the world. The career
                    of ambition was so far from attracting men that they had to be urged and coerced
                    into filling official places and carrying on the routine duties of the senate.
                    Society was bent simply on amusement. There was less of coarseness in the
                    pursuit of pleasure than had prevailed among the contemporaries of Catullus. We
                    find little trace in Ovid of the convivial pleasures which Horace celebrates in
                    his lighter odes, or of the excesses of which Propertius makes confession. Ovid
                    says of himself that he drank scarcely anything but water, and from what he
                    tells us of his appearance and constitution he was evidently not of the
                    temperament to which convivial excesses bring any temptation.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare <hi rend="italic"
                    >Am.,</hi> ii. 23—</p><p>‘ Graciles, non sunt sine viribus artus; Pondere, non
                    nervis, corpora nostra carent.”</p></note> But probably it was not the fashion
                    of the time to live intemperately. As a result of the loss of political
                    interests, women came to play a more important and brilliant part in society,
                    and the tone of fashionable conversation and literature was adapted to them.
                    Julia, daughter of the emperor, was by her position, her brilliant gifts, and
                    her reckless laxity of character the natural leader of such a society. The
                    awakening of the Roman world out of this fool’s paradise of pleasure was due to
                    the discovery of her intrigue with Iulus Antonius, son of Mark Antony, and to
                    the open and violent display of anger with which Augustus resented what was at
                    once a shock to his affections and a blow to his policy. Nearly coincidently
                    with the publicity given to this scandal appeared the famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ars Amatoria</hi> of Ovid, perhaps the most immoral and demoralizing work ever
                    written, at least in ancient times, by a man of genius. Ovid was the favourite
                    poet of the fashionable world; he lived on terms of intimacy with its leading
                    members, the younger representatives of the old nobility, who had survived the
                    proscriptions and the fatal day of Philippi. His poetical accomplishment would
                    naturally recommend him to Iulus Antonius, of whose gifts Horace has spoken so
                    eulogistically. His marriage with his third wife, a lady of the great Fabian
                    house, and a friend of the empress Livia, had probably taken place before this
                    time. It thus seems likely that he mav have been admitted into the intimacy of
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n89/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0089-0080"/> younger society of the Palatine, although in the
                    midst of his most fulsome flattery he does not claim ever to have enjoyed the
                    favour of Augustus. Whether he was in anyway mixed up with this intrigue is not
                    known. But that the work which appeared coincidently with it excited deep
                    resentment in the mind of the emperor, as the pander to the passions by which
                    the dignity of his family had been outraged and his state policy thwarted, is
                    shown by his edict, issued ten years later, against the book and its author.
                    Augustus had the art of dissembling his anger; and Ovid appears to have had no
                    idea of the storm that was gathering over him. He still continued to enjoy the
                    society of the court and of the fashionable world; he passed before the emperor
                    in the annual procession among the ranks of the equites; he filled a more
                    important judicial place; and he had developed a richer vein of genius than he
                    had shown in his youthful prime. But he was aware that public opinion had been
                    shocked, or professed to be shocked, by his last work; and after writing a kind
                    of apology for it, called the <hi rend="italic">Remedia Amoris,</hi> he directed
                    his genius into other channels, and wrote during the next ten years the <hi

                    life and interest to the ceremonial observances of Roman religion; but it is as

                    with the realistic annals of Rome that he succeeds in the part assumed by him.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> professed to trace the relations of the
                    gods with human affairs from the reign of Chaos to the deification of Augustus;
                    and in the later books that work also may claim something of a national
                    character. But it consists for the most part of a series of tales of the love
                    adventures of the gods with nymphs and heroines, told in a tone of mixed irony
                    and romance. This work, which he regards as his most serious claim to
                    immortality, had not been finally revised at the time of his disgrace, and he
                    committed it to the flames; but other copies were in existence, and the book was
                    given to the world in his absence. He often regrets that it had not obtained his
                    final révisai. The <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> also was broken off by his
                    exile, after the completion and publication of the first six books, treating of
                    the first six months of the year.</p>
                <p>The actual offence which gave occasion for his banishment is not exactly known.
                    In his frequent references to it he wavers between assertions of his innocence
                    of anything beyond simplicity and error and the admission that, though he had
                    done nothing, he yet deserved his punishment. He had witnessed something which
                    was a cause of pain and offence to the emperor. In a letter to one of his
                    intimate friends, to whom he had been in the habit of confiding all his secrets,
                    he says that had he confided this one he would have escaped condemnation. In
                    writing to another friend in reference to his disgrace, he warns him against the
                    danger of courting too high society—“praelustria vita.” The cause which excited
                    or renewed the anger of Augustus was connected with the old offence of writing
                    and publishing the <hi rend="italic">Ars Amatoria.</hi> All this points to his
                    having been in some way mixed up with some scandal affecting the imperial
                    family. He distinctly disclaims the idea that he had anything to do with any
                    treasonable plot; and he certainly appears to have been the last man who ever
                    could have been made the confederate of a serious conspiracy. All this seems to
                    connect him with one event, coincident in time with his disgrace,—the intrigue
                    of the younger Julia, granddaughter of the emperor, with Silanus,— mentioned by
                    Tacitus in the third book of the <hi rend="italic">Annals.</hi> Tacitus tells us
                    how deeply Augustus felt these family scandals, looking upon them as acts of
                    treason and sacrilege It seems, at first sight, strange that the chief
                    punishment fell, not on the real offenders, but on Ovid, who at the worst could
                    only have been the confidant of their intrigue, perhaps may have lent his house
                    as a place of rendezvous for the lovers. To Julia herself was assigned the
                    lighter penalty of seclusion in one of the towns of Italy, and Silanus had no
                    other punishment than that of exclusion from the court. Augustus must have
                    regarded Ovid and his works as, if not the corrupter of the age, yet the most
                    typical representative of that corruption which in its effects on his own family
                    might be regarded as the nemesis attending on, as it was the direct consequence
                    of, the outward success of his policy. The date of this scandal must have been 7
                    or early in 8 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> as Tacitus, under the date 28 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> mentions the death of Julia after twenty years of
                    seclusion.</p>
                <p>A delay of nearly two years seems to have taken place between the disgrace and
                    the sentence passed on Ovid, and it must have been during this interval that he
                    visited his friend Fabius at Elba,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ex</hi><hi rend="italic">Ponto,</hi> ii.

                    At last the edict, dictated by relentless policy rather than personal
                    vindictiveness, was published. He was left in the enjoyment of the rights of
                    citizenship and in the possession of his property (perhaps through the exercise
                    of the influence of Livia in favour of his wife), but was ordered to leave Rome
                    on a particular day, and to settle at the very outskirts of civilization,—in the
                    semi-Greek semi-barbaric town of Tomi, near the mouth of the Danube. He tells
                    vividly the story of the agony of his last night at Rome, of the dangers and
                    hardships of his winter voyage down the Adriatic, and of his desolate feelings
                    on his first arrival at his new abode. But this was merely the beginning of his
                    miseries. For eight years he bore up in his solitude, in the dreariest
                    circumstances, suffering from the unhealthiness of the climate and exposed to
                    constant alarm from the incursions of the neighbouring barbarians. He continued
                    to be buoyed up by hopes first of a remission of his sentence, afterwards of at
                    least a change to another place of exile. He wrote his complaints first in a
                    series of books sent successively to Rome, afterwards in a number of poetical
                    epistles, also collected into books, addressed to all his friends who were
                    likely to have influence at court. He believed that Augustus had softened
                    towards him before his death, but his successor was inexorable to his
                    complaints. Perhaps the person who most deeply resented the offence was the one
                    who exercised the greatest influence over both, the empress Livia, whose life
                    and example were a protest against the laxity of the age, and who was an
                    unsympathetic stepmother to the members of the imperial family. His chief
                    consolation was the exercise of his art, and the only expression of a worthy
                    feeling of resistance to his misery is in a letter to his daughter Perilla, in
                    which he asserts that over his genius Augustus had no control :—</p>
                <p>“Ingenio tamen ipse meo comitorque fruorque: Caesar in hoc potuit juris habere
                    nihil.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">Tristia,</hi> iii. 7, 47.</p>
                <p>Yet as time goes on he is painfully conscious of failure in power, and of the
                    absence of all motive to perfect his work. He had access to no books except such
                    as he may have brought with him, and the zest for reading, as for all <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n90/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0090-0081"/> other pleasure, was gone. He recalls the memories
                    of the happy days he had spent at Rome; and the chief relief to the misery of
                    his exile was the receipt of letters from his friends. Μ. Gaston Boissier says
                    that he left his genius behind him at Rome; and it is true that the works
                    written in exile have not the brilliant versatility, the buoyant spirit, or the
                    finished art of his earlier writings. They harp eternally on the same theme. All
                    his faults of diffuseness and self-repetition appear in an exaggerated form. But
                    there is the same power of vivid realization and expression, the same power of
                    making his thought, feeling, and situation immediately present to the reader.
                    What they lose in art they gain in personal interest. They have, like the
                    letters of Cicero to Atticus, the fascination exercised by those works which
                    have been given to the world under the title of <hi rend="italic">Confessions
                    ∙,</hi> and they are the sincerest expression in literature of the state of mind
                    produced by a unique experience,—that of a man, when well advanced in years, but
                    still retaining extraordinary sensibility to pleasure and pain, withdrawn from a
                    most brilliant position in the centre of social and intellectual life and
                    material civilization, and cast upon his own resources in a place and among
                    people affording the dreariest contrast to all that had gratified his eye,
                    heart, and mind through the whole of his previous life. How far these letters
                    and confidences are to be regarded as equally sincere expressions of his
                    affection or admiration for his correspondents is another question, which need
                    not be pressed. Even in those addressed to his wife, in which he might be
                    supposed to pour out his heart naturally, there may perhaps be detected a
                    certain ring of insincerity. He pays her compliments, addresses her in the
                    studied language of gallantry, and compares her to Penelope and Laodamia and the
                    other famous heroines of ancient legend. Had she been a Penelope or a Laodamia
                    she would have accompanied him in his exile, as we learn from Tacitus was done
                    by other wives <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> in the more evil days of which he
                    wrote the record. There is a note of truer affection in the one letter to his
                    daughter Perilla, of whose genius and beauty he was proud, and who in her tastes
                    and character was more in sympathy with him. This is one of several points of
                    resemblance in the position, feelings, and fortunes of Ovid with one whose
                    career and character were so essentially different—Cicero. He shows a regard for
                    many of his friends, and dependence on their sympathy and appreciation, and he
                    recalls with some bitterness the coldness with which some of those in whom he
                    had trusted treated him when his disgrace first overtook him. He was moved by
                    the persistent hostility of one whom he had regarded as a friend to an act of
                    retaliation for which neither his temper nor his genius was adapted,—the
                    composition of a lampoon, the <hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> in imitation of a
                    poem of Callimachus, called by the same name. His affections, like his genius,
                    were diffused widely rather than strongly concentrated, and he seems to have had
                    rather a large circle of intimate acquaintances than any close friends to whom
                    he was attached as Cicero was to Atticus, Horace to Maecenas, Catullus to Calvus
                    and Verannius. He was evidently a man of gentle and genial manners; and, as his
                    active mind induced him to learn the language of the new people among whom he
                    was thrown, his active interest in life enabled him to gain their regard and
                    various marks of honour. One of the last acts of his literary career was to
                    revise the <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> and re-edit it with a dedication to
                    Germanicus. The last lines of the <hi rend="italic">Ex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ponto</hi> sound like the despairing sigh of a drowning man who had long
                    struggled alone with the waves :—</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ Omnia perdidimus, tantum modo vita relicta est Praebeat ut sensum materiamque
                    malis.”</p>
                <p>Shortly after these words were written the poet died, at the age of sixty-one, in
                    the year 17 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the third year of the reign of
                    Tiberius.</p>
                <p>The natural temperament of Ovid, as indicated in his writings, has more in common
                    with the suppleness and finesse of the modern Italian than with the strength and
                    direct force of the ancient Roman. That stamp of her own character and
                    understanding which Rome impressed on the genius of those other races, Italian,
                    Celtic, or Iberian, which she incorporated with herself, is fainter in Ovid than
                    in any other great writer. He ostentatiously disclaims the manliness which in
                    the republican times was regarded as the birthright not of Romans only but of
                    the Sabellian races from which he sprung. He is as devoid of dignity in his
                    abandonment to pleasure as in the weakness with which he meets calamity. He has
                    no depth of serious conviction, no vein of sober reflexion, and is sustained by
                    no great or elevating purpose. Although the beings of a supernatural world fill
                    a large place in his writings, they appear stripped of all sanctity and mystery.
                    It is difficult to say whether the tone in which the adventures of the gods and
                    goddesses of mythology are told, or his prayer offered to the gods of heaven and
                    of the sea, when in danger of shipwreck,</p>
                <p>“Pro superi viridesque dei, quibus aequora curae,” implies a kind of
                    half-believing return to the most childish elements of paganism, or is simply
                    one of mocking unbelief. He has absolutely no reverence, and consequently almost
                    alone among the greater poets of Greece or Rome (the “sancti” of Lucretius, the
                    “pii vates” of Virgil) he inspires no reverence in his reader. With all a poet’s
                    feeling for the life, variety, and subtlety of nature, he has no sense of her
                    mystery and majesty. Though he can give dramatic expression to pathetic emotion,
                    the profound melancholy of Lucretius, the spiritual sadness, half-relieved by
                    dim spiritual hopes, of Virgil, the thoughtful renunciation with which Horace
                    fronts “the cloud of mortal destiny,” are states of mind which were seemingly
                    inconceivable by him. Nor is he more capable of sounding the deeper sources of
                    joy than of sorrow. The love which he celebrates is sensual and superficial—a
                    matter of vanity as much as of passion. He prefers the piquant attraction of
                    falsehood and fickleness to the charm of truth and constancy. Even where he
                    follows Roman tendencies in his art he perverts them. Didactic poetry has set
                    before itself many false ends in ancient Roman as in modern English literature;
                    but the pedantry of systematic teaching has never been so strangely misapplied,
                    as it never has been so strangely combined with brilliant power of execution, as
                    in the methodical teaching of the art—“corrumpere et corrumpi.” The <hi
                    rend="italic">Fasti</hi> is a work conceived in the prosaic spirit of Roman
                    antiquarianism. But this conception might have been made poetical had it been
                    penetrated by the religious and patriotic spirit in which Virgil treats the
                    origin of ancient ceremonies, or the serious, half mystic spirit in which he
                    accepts the revelations of science. The contrast between the actual trivialities
                    of ancient science and ancient ceremonial, on the one hand, and the new meaning
                    which both were capable of receiving from a reverential treatment, could not be
                    more effectually enforced than by a comparison of passages in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Georgies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> treating the
                    astronomical fancies and religious ceremonies of early ages with the literal
                    definiteness or the light persiflage of the <hi rend="italic">Fasti.</hi></p>
                <p>These grave defects in strength and gravity of character had an important effect
                    on the artistic result of Ovid’s writings. Though he wanted neither diligence,
                    perseverance, nor literary ambition, he seems incapable of conceiving a great
                    and serious whole. Though his mind works very actively in the way of observing
                    and reflecting on <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> “Comitatae profugos liberos
                    matres, secutae maritos in exilia conjuges” (Tac., <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi>

                <p>the superficial aspects of life, yet he has added no great thoughts or maxims to
                    the moral or intellectual heritage of the world. With a more versatile dramatic
                    faculty than any of his countrymen, he has created no great character,
                    comparable either with the grand impersonations of Greek tragedy, or with the
                    Dido and Turnus of Virgil. He has both the psychological power of reading and
                    the rhetorical power of expressing passion and emotion of different kinds; but
                    he has not a genuine and consistent sense of human greatness or heroism. He
                    represents with impartial sympathy the noble heart of Laodamia and the
                    unhallowed lust of Myrrha. His spirit seems thoroughly ironical or indifferent
                    in regard to the higher ideals or graver convictions of men.</p>
                <p>But with all the laxity and levity of his character he must have had qualities
                    which made him, if not much esteemed, yet much liked in his own day, and which
                    have perpetuated themselves in the genial amiability of his writings. He claims
                    for himself two social virtues, highly prized by the Romans, “fides” and
                    “candor,”—the qualities of social honour and kindly sincerity, the qualities
                    which made a man a pleasant member of society and a friend who might be relied
                    on in the ordinary relations of life. There is no indication of anything base,
                    anything ungenerous, or anything morose in his relations to others. The literary
                    quality of “candor,” the generous appreciation of all sorts of excellence, he
                    possesses in a remarkable degree. He heartily admires everything in the
                    literature of the past, Greek or Roman, that had any merit. In him more than in
                    any of the other Augustan poets we find words of admiration more than once
                    applied to the rude genius of Ennius and the high spirit of Accius. It is by
                    him, not by Virgil or Horace, that Lucretius is first named and the sublimity of
                    his genius is first acknowledged. The image of Catullus that most haunts the
                    imagination is that of the poet who died so early—</p>
                <p>.... “hedera juvenalia cinctus Tempora,”</p>
                <p>as he is represented by Ovid coming to meet the shade of the young Tibullus in
                    Elysiuni. To his own contemporaries, known and unknown to fame, he is as liberal
                    in his words of recognition. He enjoyed society too in a thoroughly amiable and
                    unenvious spirit. He lived on a friendly footing with a large circle of men of
                    letters, poets, critics, grammarians, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.,</hi> but he
                    showed none of that sense of superiority which is manifest in Horace’s estimate
                    of the “tribes of grammarians” and the poetasters of his day. Like Horace, too,
                    he courted the society of the great, and probably he did not maintain an equally
                    independent attitude towards it; but unlike Horace he expresses no contempt for
                    the profane world outside. With his gifts of irony and knowledge of the world
                    one might have expected him to be the social satirist of the later phase of the
                    Augustan age. But he wanted the censorious and critical temper necessary for a
                    social, and the admixture of gall in his disposition necessary for a successful
                    personal satirist.</p>
                <p>“Candidus a salibus suffusis feile refugi”</p>
                <p>is a claim on our regard which he is fully justified in making. In his exile, and
                    in imitation of his model Callimachus, he did retaliate on one enemy and
                    persistent detractor; but the <hi rend="italic">Ibis</hi> is a satire more
                    remarkable for irrelevant learning than for epigrammatic sting.</p>
                <p>But his chief personal endowment was his vivacity, and his keen interest in and
                    enjoyment of life. He had no grain of discontent in his composition. He had no
                    regrets for an ideal past nor longings for an imaginary future. The age in which
                    his lot was cast was, as he tells us, that in which more than any other he would
                    have wished to live.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>He is its most gifted representative, but he does not rise above it. The great
                    object of his art was to amuse and delight it by the vivid picture he presented
                    of its actual fashions and pleasures, and by creating a literature of romance
                    which reflected these fashions and pleasures, and which could stimulate the
                    curiosity and fascinate the fancy of a society too idle and luxurious for
                    serious intellectual effort. The sympathy which he felt with the love adventures
                    and intrigues of his contemporaries, to which he probably owed his fall,
                    quickened his creative power to the composition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heroides</hi> and the romantic tales of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metamorphoses.</hi> Catullus, by his force of concentration, makes the actual
                    life of his age more immediately present; but none of the Roman poets can people
                    a purely imaginary world with such spontaneous fertility of fancy as Ovid. In
                    heart and mind he is inferior to Lucretius and Catullus, to Virgil and Horace,
                    perhaps to Tibullus and Propertius; but in the power and range of imaginative
                    vision he is surpassed by no ancient and by few modem poets. This power of
                    vision is the counterpart of his lively sensuous nature. He has a keener eye for
                    the apprehension of outward beauty, for the life and colour and forms of nature,
                    than any Roman or perhaps than any Greek poet. This power, acting upon the
                    wealth of his varied reading, gathered with eager curiosity and received into a
                    singularly retentive mind, has enabled him to body forth scenes of the most
                    varied and picturesque beauty in all the lands of Europe and Asia famous in
                    ancient song and story. If his tragedy the <hi rend="italic">Medea,</hi> highly
                    praised by ancient critics, had been preserved, we should have been able to
                    judge whether Roman art was capable of producing a great drama. In many of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Heroides,</hi> and in several speeches attributed to his
                    imaginary personages, he gives evidence of true dramatic creativeness. Catullus,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Ariadne</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Attis,</hi> has
                    given a voice to deeper and more powerful feeling, and he presents an idyllic
                    picture of the heroic age with a purer charm. But the range and variety of his
                    art were limited by the shortness as well as the turmoil of his life. Catullus
                    is unsurpassed as the author of an epic idyll. Ovid is not idyllic in his art,
                    or whatever there is of idyllic in it is lost in the rapid movement of his
                    narrative. But he is one, among the poets of all times, who can imagine a story
                    with most vivid inventiveness and tell it with most unflagging animation. An
                    ideal world, poetical and supernatural, but never fantastic or grotesque, of
                    beings rich with the beauty and fulness of youth, playing their part in scenes
                    of picturesque beauty, is brought before us in verse and diction of apparently
                    inexhaustible resource and unimpeded flow, partly created or rising up
                    spontaneously for the occasion, partly borrowed boldly and freely from all his
                    predecessors in Latin poetry, but always full of genuine life and movement. The
                    faults of his verse and diction are those which arise from the vitality of his
                    temperament,—too facile a flow, too great exuberance of illustration. He has as
                    little sense of the need of severe restraint in his art as in his life. He is
                    not without mannerism, but he is quite unaffected, and, however far short he
                    might fall of the highest excellence of verse or style, it was not possible for
                    him to be rough or harsh, dull or obscure.</p>
                <p>As regards the school of art to which he belongs, he may be described as the most
                    brilliant representative of Roman Alexandrinism. The latter half of the Augustan
                    age was, in its social and intellectual aspects, more like the Alexandrian age
                    than any other era of antiquity. The Alexandrian age was like the Augustan, one
                    of refinement and luxury, of outward magnificence and literary dilettanteism
                    flourishing under the fostering influence of an absolute monarchy. Poetry was
                    the only important branch of literature cultivated, and the chief subjects of
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n92/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0092-0083"/> poetry were mythological tales, various phases of
                    the passion of love, the popular aspects of science, and some aspects of the
                    beauty of nature. These, too, were the chief subjects of the later Augustan
                    poetry. The higher feelings and ideas which found expression in the poetry of
                    Virgil, Horace, Varius, and the writers of an older generation no longer acted
                    on the Roman world. It was to the private tastes and pleasures of individuals
                    and society that Roman Alexandrinism had appealed both in the poetry of
                    Catullus, Cinna, Calvus, &amp;c., and in that of Gallus, Tibullus, and
                    Propertius. Ovid was the last of this school of writers; he profited at the very
                    entrance on his poetical career by the artistic accomplishment in form, metre,
                    and diction which had been gained by the slow labours of his predecessors; his
                    fancy was much more active and brilliant than that of any of them; and his
                    spirit was more unreservedly satisfied with the conditions imposed both by the
                    art to which he devoted himself and the political and social circumstances by
                    which he was surrounded. Like all his countrymen, he wanted power to create a
                    new form of art and a new vehicle of expression. But if he could have foreseen
                    his future fame his literary ambition would have been completely satisfied by
                    the consciousness that he had not only immeasurably surpassed, but had, for all
                    after time, practically superseded his Greek models. He has confined himself to
                    two vehicles of expression—the elegiac metre and the hexameter. In the first the
                    great mass of his poetry is written,—the <hi rend="italic">Heroides,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Amores,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ars Amatoria,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Remedia Amoris,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Fasti,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tristia,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ponto,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Medicamina</hi><hi rend="italic">Faciei;</hi> in the hexameter we have the work
                    which he regarded as that on which his hope of immortality was based, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Metamorphoses,</hi> and a fragment of a didactic poem written in
                    the style of the Alexandrians, probably with the mere desire to kill time in the
                    place of his exile, called the <hi rend="italic">Halieutica.</hi> Of the first
                    metre he is the acknowledged master. He brought it to its highest perfection,
                    and all the immense mass of elegiac verse published and written in modern times
                    has merely endeavoured to reproduce the echo of his rhythm and manner. In the
                    direct expression and illustration of feeling, his elegiac metre has much more
                    ease, vivacity, and sparkle than that of any of his predecessors, while he alone
                    has communicated to it, without altering its essential characteristic of
                    recurrent and regular pauses, a fluidity and rapidity of movement which makes it
                    an admirable vehicle for tales of pathetic and picturesque interest. It was
                    impossible for him to give to the hexameter a greater perfection than it had
                    already attained, but he imparted to it also a new character, wanting indeed the
                    weight, and majesty, and intricate harmonies of Virgil, but rapid, varied,
                    animated, and in complete accord with the swift, versatile, and fervid movement
                    of his imagination. One other proof he gave of his irrepressible energy and
                    vitality by composing, during his exile, a poem in the Gothic language, in
                    praise of Augustus,—the loss of which, whatever it may have been to literature,
                    is one much to be regretted in the interests of philological science.</p>
                <p>Ovid would, in any previous century since the revival of classical studies, have
                    been regarded as a more important representative of ancient life and feeling,
                    and as a greater poet, than he is in the present day. During the earlier period
                    of this revival, the beauty and refinement of ancient literature, and of the
                    life to which that literature is the key, were better appreciated than their
                    moral and intellectual greatness. As the representative writer of an age of
                    great material civilization and luxury, he gained the attention of a time and a
                    class struggling towards a similar civilization and animated by the same love of
                    pleasure. It was in his writings that the world of romance and wonder, created
                    by the early Greek imagination, was first revealed to the modem world. The
                    vivid, sensuous fancy through which he reproduced the tales and beings of
                    mythology, as well as the transparent lucidity, the unfailing liveliness, the
                    ease and directness of the medium through which this is done, made his works the
                    most accessible and among the most attractive of the recovered treasures of
                    antiquity. His influence was first felt in the literature of the Italian
                    Renaissance. But in the most creative periods of English literature he seems to
                    have been more read than any other ancient poet, not even excepting Virgil; and
                    it was on the most creative minds, such as those of Marlowe, Spenser,
                    Shakespeare,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    influence of Ovid on Shakespeare is shown conclusively in the interesting papers
                    on “What Shakespeare learned at School,” contributed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fraser's Magazine</hi> (1879, 1880) by Prof. Baynes.</p></note> Milton, and
                    Dryden, that he acted most powerfully. The continuance of his influence is
                    equally unmistakable during the classical era of Addison and Pope. The most
                    successful Latin poetry of modern times has been written in imitation of him;
                    and the accomplishment by which the faculty of literary composition and the
                    feeling for ancient Roman culture were most developed in the great schools of
                    England and France was the writing of Ovidian elegiacs. His works gave also a
                    powerful stimulus and supplied abundant materials to the great painters who
                    flourished during and immediately subsequent to the Renaissance. The
                    mythological figures and landscapes which crowd the great galleries of Europe
                    reproduce on canvas the forms, life, colour, and spirit which first were clothed
                    in words anc. metre in his <hi rend="italic">Elegies</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metamorphoses.</hi></p>
                <p>But, whatever charm individual readers of ancient literature may still find in
                    him, no one would claim for him anything like the same influence on literature,
                    art, and education in the present day as he formerly enjoyed. Judged by the
                    attention given to their works by professional scholars and also in current
                    criticism, not only Virgil and Horace, but Lucretius and Catullus, appear to be
                    more in esteem than Ovid. This may perhaps be due as much to a loss in
                    imagination as to a gain in critical power. Although the spirit of antiquity is
                    better understood now than it was in the 16th and 17th centuries, yet in the
                    capacity of appreciating works of brilliant fancy we can claim no superiority
                    over the centuries which produced Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton, nor over
                    those which produced the great Italian, French, and Flemish painters. Still,
                    whatever be the cause of the change in taste, Ovid is not one of those poets who
                    seem to have much to teach us, or much power to move and interest us now.
                    Perhaps the very liveliness and clearness of his style and manner, which made
                    him the most accessible of ancient authors in times of less exact learning, have
                    tended to deaden curiosity about him in the present day. There is no deep or
                    recondite meaning to be extracted from him. The sensuous and more superficial
                    aspects of the later phase of ancient civilization, of which he is the most
                    brilliant exponent, have much less interest for us than the heroic aspects of
                    its earlier phase, and the spiritual, ethical, and political significance of its
                    maturity. The art which chiefly ministers to pleasure, though it had its place
                    in the great ages of antiquity, had then only a subordinate one; and it is to
                    that place that it has been relegated by the permanent judgment of the world. It
                    is of that art that Ovid is the chief master, and it is that with which he is
                    identified. There might almost seem to be some danger of his falling into the
                    neglect which has deservedly overtaken the authors of the epics of the Flavian
                    era. It is therefore perhaps worth while to indicate some of the grounds on
                    which his works must continue to hold an important place in any comprehensive
                    study of Roman literature or human culture.</p>
                <p>His first claim on the attention of modern readers is that already indicated—the
                    influence which he exercised on the earlier development of modern art and
                    literature. Just as certain Greek poets and literary periods (the Alexandrian
                    for instance) claim attention as much on account of their influence on the
                    development of Roman literature as on their own account, so, if for no other
                    reason, the works of Ovid must always retain an importance, second only to those
                    of Virgil and Horace, as one of the chief media through which the stream of
                    ancient feeling and fancy mingled with the great river of modern literature.</p>
                <p>He is interesting further as the sole contemporary exponent of the last half of
                    the Augustan age. The whole of that age is a time of which the outward show and
                    the inner spirit are known from the works, not of contemporary historians or
                    prose-writers, but of its poets. The successive phases of feeling and experience
                    through which the world passed during the whole of this critical period of human
                    affairs are revealed in the poetry of Virgil, Horace, and Ovid. Virgil throws an
                    idealizing and religious halo around the hopes and aspirations of the first rise
                    of the empire. His aim seems to be to bring the new regime into living connexion
                    with the past, not of Rome only but of the civilized world. Horace presents the
                    most complete image of his age in its most various aspects, realistic and ideal.
                    Ovid, in all his earlier writings, reflects the life of the world of wealth and
                    fashion under the influence of the new court. It is a life of material
                    prosperity, splendour, refinement, of frivolity and intrigue, of dilettanteism
                    in literature, of decay in all the nobler energies, of servility and adulation.
                    He is the most characteristic painter such a time could have found. For the
                    continuous study <pb break="no"

                    relations, his place is important as marking a stage of transition between the
                    representation of Horace, in which the life of pleasure and amusement has its
                    place, but one subordinate to the life of reflexion and of serious affairs, and
                    the life which reveals itself in the cynicism of Martial aud the morose disgust
                    of Juvenal.</p>
                <p>From the times of Ennius and Lucilius, Roman poetry occupied itself much with the
                    lives, pursuits, and personal feelings of its authors, and this is one element
                    of interest which it has in common with such works as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letters</hi> of Cicero and of Pliny. Few poets of any age or country bring
                    themselves into such close relation with their readers as Catullus, Horace,
                    Ovid, aud Martial. Ovid is in mind and character perhaps the least interesting
                    of the four. But an exceptional interest attaches to his history. He attracts
                    curiosity by having a secret, which, though it may be guessed with an approach
                    to certainty, is not fully revealed. He excites also personal sympathy by the
                    contrast presented in his writings between the unclouded gaiety of his youth and
                    prime and the long heart-break of his exile. If we knew him only from the
                    personal impression which he makes in the <hi rend="italic">Amores</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ars Amatoria,</hi> it would be allowed that few men of equal
                    genius had so little claim on the esteem of the world. In the ten books of
                    complaint which he pours out from his place of exile, though he shows no sign of
                    a manlier temper than when he wrote his “imbelles elegi,” yet by the vividness
                    with which he realizes the contrast between his past and present, by his keen
                    capacity for ι&gt;leasure and pain, by the unreserve with which he exposes all
                    his èelings, he forces himself on our intimacy, and awakens those sympathies
                    which all sincere and passionate confessions create, where there is nothing base
                    or malignant in the temper of their author to alienate them. Though his fate
                    does not rouse the powerful interest inspired by the “fiery courage” and
                    “Titanic might” with which Byron struggled during his self-imposed exile, yet to
                    it, too, apply the sympathetic words of Virgil—“Mentem mortalia tangunt.”</p>
                <p>But it was not owing to the historical and personal interest of his works that he
                    gained his great name among his countrymen and the readers of a former
                    generation, nor is it on that ground solely that he claims attention now. He is
                    the last true poet of the great age of Roman literature,—which begins with
                    Lucretius and closes with him,—of the age which drew the most powerful stimulus
                    from the genius and art of Greece, from the sentiment inspired by Rome, and from
                    the Italian love of nature. Among the five or six great poets of that time Ovid
                    is distinguished both as a brilliant artist who brought one branch of poetry to
                    the highest perfection and also as a poet in whom one rich vein of the genius of
                    I taly most conspicuously manifested itself. It is mainly through his
                    reproduction of the forms, metres, and materials of the chief Alexandrian poets
                    that these have maintained an enduring place in literature. But, great as he
                    was,in art and imitative faculty, his spontaneous gifts of genius were still
                    more remarkable. If his works had perished we should have had a most inadequate
                    idea of what the fervid Italian genius could accomplish in ancient times. No
                    other Roman poet can invent and tell a story and make an outward scene and
                    dramatic situation present to the eye and mind with such vivid power. If he does
                    not greatly move the deeper sources of emotion, he has the power of lightly
                    stirring many of them. No Roman poet writes with such ease, life, and rapidity
                    of movement None is endowed with such fertility of fancy, such quickness of
                    apprehension. In respect of his vivacity and fertility we recognize in him the
                    countryman of Cicero and Livy. But the type of genius of which he affords the
                    best example is more familiar in modern Italian than in ancient Roman
                    literature. While the serious spirit of Lucretius and Virgil reappeared in
                    Dante, the qualities attributed by his latest and most accomplished critic to
                    Ariosto may be said to reproduce the light-hearted gaiety and the brilliant
                    fancy of Ovid.</p>
                <p>There were several editions of Ovi i’s collected works in the 16th and 17th
                    centuries, the time in which he enjoyed his greatest popularity. Recent editions
                    of the text have been published by R. Merkel and A. Riese. The most important
                    aids to the study of Ovid recently made in England are the editions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ibis</hi> by Mr Robinson Ellis, and those of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Her aides,</hi> by Mr A. Palmer. Much light is thrown on the diction of Ovid by
                    Zingerle in his <hi rend="italic">Ovidius</hi><hi rend="italic">und sein
                    Verhältniss zu den Vorgängern.</hi> The most interesting discussion on the cause
                    of his exile is that of Μ. Gaston Boissier, which originally appeared in the <hi
