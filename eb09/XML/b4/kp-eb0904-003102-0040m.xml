                    Beled-el-A’neb</hi></label><hi rend="italic">{the town of jujubes),</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Annaba,</hi> a fortified town and seaport of Algeria, in the
                    province of Constantine, 85 miles N.E. of the city of that name, on a bay of the
                    same name at the mouth of the Seybouse, in lat. 36° 54' N. and long. 7° 47' E.
                    The town is surrounded with a modern rampart erected outside of the old Arab
                    wall, the compass of which was found too small for its growth. In other respects
                    also it has been greatly Europeanized; much of the old town has been demolished,
                    and the ground occupied by new buildings. The streets are wide and well laid
                    out, but in some instances are very steep, owing to the formation of the ground.
                    All the ordinary conveniences of a flourishing French city are met
                    with,—bazaars, markets, coffee-houses, hotels, readingrooms, a bank, a theatre,
                    barracks, hospitals, an orphan asylum, and schools of various kinds. There is
                    also a cathedral dedicated to St Augustine, as well as other Roman Catholic
                    churches, a nunnery for sisters of mercy, handsome mosques, a synagogue, and a
                    Protestant church. Bône is an important seat of the coral fishery, and carries
                    on a considerable trade, the exports consisting chiefly of iron and lead ore,
                    corn, coral, cattle and sheep, olive oil, salt fish, and tobacco. The
                    manufactures comprise native garments, <pb break="no"

                    soap has come into repute. In 1872 there entered the port 461 French vessels,
                    with a tonnage of 187,415 tons, and 506 foreignship3 with a tonnage of 40,822.
                    The anchorage was long insecure; but about 1870 a harbour, with an area of 195
                    acres, was constructed by means of two breakwaters, and an inner basin,
                    surrounded with masonry quays, and having an extent of nearly 25 acres. The
                    marshes at the mouth of the river have also been drained by a system of canals,
                    to the great improvement of the sanitary condition of the town, which has the
                    further advantage of an abundant supply of water obtained from the neighbouring
                    hills. There are cork-woods and marble-quarries in the vicinity, and various
                    other resources of the surrounding country are being rapidly developed. The
                    λvoods, however, suffered severely from a conflagration in 1873; and it will be
                    many years before the production of cork can become as extensive as before. The
                    port will be rendered still more important by the railway in course of
                    construction to various inland towns. Bone is identified with the ancient <hi
                    rend="italic">Aphrodisiunι,</hi> the seaport of <hi rend="italic">Hippo
                    Regius</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ubbo,</hi> but it derives its name from the
                    latter city, the ruins of which, consisting principally of large cisterns, and
                    part of the Roman walls, are still to be found about a mile to the south of the
                    town. Hippo, the bishopric of Augustine, was burnt by the Vandals in 430,
                    partially restored by Belisarius, and again sacked by the Arabs in the 7th
                    century. The latter conquerors built the city of Bona, or Annaba, which has
                    since passed through many vicissitudes. From the beginning of the 14th to the
                    middle of the 15th century it was frequented by Italians and Spaniards, and in
                    the 16th it was held for some time by Charles V., who strengthened its <hi
                    rend="italic">Casbah</hi> or citadel, originally built in 1300. From the time of
                    Louis XIV. to the Revolution the French <hi rend="italic">Compagnie
                    d’Afrique</hi> maintained a very active trade with the port. The town was
                    finally captured by the French in 1832, and its citadel was defended by a small
                    body of marines for some months against the Turks. Population in 1872, 16,196,
                    about half of whom are European; in 1832 it was only 3000 or 4000.</p>
