                    university, not taking his degree as master till 1792. Iu 1789 he published, in
                    a small quarto volume, <hi rend="italic">Fourteen Sonnets,</hi> which met with
                    considerable favour at the time, were hailed with delight by Coleridge and his
                    young contemporaries, and have since been recognized as the first notes of the
                    modern revolt against the artificial school of poetry, the traditions of which
                    had descended from Pope. The <hi rend="italic">Sonnets</hi> even in form were a
                    revival, a return to the older and purer poetic style, and by their grace of
                    expression, melodious versification, tender tone of feeling, and vivid
                    appreciation of the life and beauty of nature, stood out in strong contrast to
                    the affected common-places which at that time formed the bulk of English poetry.
                    A second edition of the little volume was called for in the same year in which
                    it had appeared, and there have been many subsequent editions. A few short
                    pieces were published in 1790 and 1792, which were also received with favour.
                    After taking his degree at Oxford he entered the church, and was soon appointed
                    to the vicarage of Chicklade in Wiltshire. In 1797 he received the vicarage of
                    Dumbleton in Gloucestershire, and in 1801 was presented to the vicarage of
                    Brem-hill in Wiltshire. In the same year he was collated by Bishop Douglas to a
                    prebendal stall in the cathedral of Salisbury. In 1818 he was made chaplain to
                    the Prince Regent, and in 1828 he was elected residentiary canon of Salisbury.
                    He died at Salisbury in April 1850, aged 88. Of the longer poems published by
                    Bowles none attain a very high standard of excellence, though all are
                    distinguished by purity of imagination, cultured and graceful diction, and great
                    tenderness of feeling. The most extensive were <hi rend="italic">The Spirit of
                    Discovery,</hi> 1804, which was mercilessly ridiculed by Byron; <hi
                    rend="italic">The Missionary of the Andes,</hi> 1815; <hi rend="italic">The
                    Grave of the Last Saxon,</hi> 1822; and <hi rend="italic">St John in
                    Patmos,</hi> 1833. Bowles is perhaps more celebrated as a critic of poetry than
                    as a poet. In 1807 he published an edition of Pope’s works with notes and an
                    essay on the poetical character of Pope. In this essay he laid down certain
                    canons as to poetic imagery which, with slight modification, have been since
                    recognized as true and valuable, but which were received at the time with strong
                    opposition by all admirers of Pope and his style. The “Pope and Bowles”
                    controversy brought into sharp contrast the opposing views of poetry, which may
                    be roughly described as the natural and the artificial. Bowles maintained that
                    images drawn from nature are poetically finer than those drawn from art; and
                    that in the highest kinds of poetry the themes or passions handled should be of
                    the general or elemental kind, and not the transient manners of any society.
                    These positions were vigorously assailed by Byron, Campbell, Roscoe, and others
                    of less note, while for a time Bowles was almost solitary. Hazlitt and the
                    Blackwood critics, however, came to his assistance, and on the whole Bowles had
                    reason to congratulate himself on having once for all established certain
                    principles which might serve as the basis of a true method of poetical
                    criticism, and of having inaugurated, both by precept and by example, a new era
                    in English poetry. Among other prose works from his prolific pen was a <hi
