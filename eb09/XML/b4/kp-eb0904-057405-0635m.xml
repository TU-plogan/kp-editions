                    grey clay and rock, unenlivened by any kind of vegetation. The town, which is of
                    a triangular form, occupies the extremity of a peninsula eleven miles long and
                    four broad, and is encircled by the sea on all sides except the south. It is
                    fortified on the land side by a mud wall with round towers. The houses being
                    mostly built of white stone gives the city, when viewed from a distance, a
                    rather clean and handsome appearance, but on closer inspection the streets are
                    found to be narrow, irregular, ill-paved, and filthy. Almost the only handsome
                    buildings arc the sheikh’s palace and the British residency. Ships of 300 tons
                    are obliged to lie in the roads six miles from the town. The water immediately
                    east of the town <pb break="no"

                    which can only be passed by vessels drawing not more than 8 or 9 feet of water,
                    except at spring-tides, when there is a rise of from 8 or 10 feet. Bushire
                    carries on a considerable trade, particularly with Calcutta, Bombay, and Java.
                    Its imports are indigo, sugar, rice, spices, steel, cotton and woollen goods,
                    coffee, &lt;fcc.; and its principal exports artraw silk, opium, Kerman wool,
                    shawls, silk goods, carpets, horses, dried fruits, wine, grain, copper,
                    turquoises, pearls, asafoetida, and gall-nuts. The climate is excessively hot,
                    particularly in the months of June, July, and August, The water is very bad;
                    that fit for drinking requires to be brought in goat-skins from wells, distant
                    1∣ mile from the city walls. The population is variously estimated at from
                    10,000 to 20,000.</p>
                <p>The importance of Bushire has muchincreased of late years. It is now not only the
                    headquarters of the English naval squadron in the Persian Gulf, and the land
                    terminus of the Indo-European line of telegraph, but it also forms the chief
                    station in these seas of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company, which runs
                    its vessels weekly between Bombay arid Bussorah, and it is further expected
                    that, if our Foreign Jurisdiction Act should be applied to Persia, an appellate
                    court will be formed at Bushire. In the meantime several European mercantile
                    houses have been established in the town, and there can be no doubt that if the
                    means of communication with the interior were improved, trade would rapidly
                    increase, Notwithstanding, indeed, the drawbacks of bad roads, insufficient
                    means of transport (wheeled carriages being unknown and beasts of burthen being
                    few and dear), want of security, and illegal exactions, the annual value of the
                    Bushire trade is now estimated at £600,000, of which one-quarter represents the
                    exports and three-quarters the imports, the balance of trade against Persia at
                    this single port thus amounting to about £300,000 a year, which is met by a
                    constant drain of the precious metals to India. During the late war with Persia
                    (1856-57) Bushire surrendered to a British force, and remained in our occupation
                    for some months. The town yields a yearly revenue of about £15,000, mainly
                    derived from customs, and is the chief place of a district, extending for 300
                    miles along the sea-coast from Dilem to Congoon, which is assessed in the Shiràz
                    register at about £25,000 per annum. At Rishire, in the vicinity of Bushire,
                    there are extensive ruins, among which bricks stamped with cuneiform legends
                    have been found, showing that the place was a very old Elamite settlement under
                    the kings of Susa. It continued also t&lt;* flourish under the name of
                    Riv-Ardeshir, during the Sassanian period, and only fell into decay after the
                    Arab conquest, its place as the great emporium of trade being successively taken
                    by SirAf (the modern Tâhiri), Kcis, and Ormuz. The British commercial factory
                    was transferred from Gombroon (modern Bander AbbAss) to Bushire during the last
                    century; but the duties of the B½sħire resident at present are exclusively
                    political. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. c.</hi> κ.)</p>
