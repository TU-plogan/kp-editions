                    westward; the two Cumbraes, less than a mile apart; and Arran, with the Holy
                    Isle and Pladda islet, separated from each other by about a mile; the groups
                    themselves being divided by channels from five to eight or ten miles in width.
                    The area of the county is about 225 square miles. Before the application of
                    steam to navigation and the introduction of the railway system, the voyage from
                    Glasgow to Bute, Cumbrae, or Arran was always tedious and disagreeable, and
                    sometimes fraught with peril, being performed in small and generally open
                    sail-boats, often occupying days, and occasionally even weeks; now, by rail and
                    steamer, the several islands can be reached in an hour and a half or two hours
                    from Glasgow. In consequence of those facilities, and their acknowledged
                    salubrity of climate, beauty and sublimity of scenery, and scientific and
                    historic interest, the chief islands of Buteshire have for years attracted
                    increasing numbers of tourists, artists, and men of science from all parts of
                    the world. Buteshire, with the exception of some half-dozen small estates, is in
                    the hands of four great proprietors. Arran, Holy Isle, and Pladda belong to the
                    duke of Hamilton, and Bute and Inchmarnoch to the noble marquis who derives his
                    title from the former. The Larger Cumbrae is the property of the earl of Glasgow
                    and Lord Bute; and the Lesser Cumbrae, with its single farm, belongs to the earl
                    of Eglinton. The proprietors of Bute and the Larger Cumbrae,—whose residences
                    are respectively Mount Stuart, a few miles from Rothesay, and the Garrison, a
                    handsome marine villa in the heart of Millport,—have given every encouragement
                    to feuing and to all public improvements; consequently the beautiful
                    watering-places in their vicinity have grown rapidly in population and
                    importance. The census of 1871 gives the resident population of Buteshire at
                    16,977, 7623 males and 9354 females. Of these 10,094 were in Bute, 5259 in
                    Arran, and 1624 in the Cumbraes. Since then the numbers are known to have
                    largely increased, and in summer the population must be vastly greater. The
                    electoral roll, which grows of course with the growth of the better class of
                    feuars and householders, numbers at present 1150 voters. Prior to 1832
                    Buteshire, alternately with Caithness-shire, sent a member to
                    Parliament,—Rothesay enjoying at the same time the privilege of sharing a
                    representative with Ayr, Campbelton, Inveraray, and Irvine. On the passing of
                    the Reform Bill of 1832, Rothesay was merged in the county, which since then has
                    had a member to itself. Buteshire and Renfrewshire form one sheriffdom, with a
                    sheriff-substitute resident in Rothesay, where are also situated the county
                    buildings, including the court-house, prison, and public offices. The circuit
                    courts are held at Inveraray.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bute,</hi> the most important of the several islands in the
                    Firth of Clyde which constitute the county of the same name, is situated about
                    18 miles west of Greenock, and 40 by water from Glasgow. It is about 15 miles in
                    length, extending from the picturesque “Kyles ”—the narrow winding strait which
                    separates the island on the north from the district of Cowal—to the Sound of
                    Bute, about 8 miles in width, which separates it on the south from Arran. In
                    breadth the island is unequal, from the deep indentations, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n641/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0641-0580"/> on both sides, of its numerous bays, but it
                    averages from 3 to 5 miles, having on the east the Cumbraes 5 miles and the
                    Ayrshire coast 8 miles off, and on the west Inchmarnoch (with an area of 675
                    acres) close at hand, and Ardrishaig, the highway to the Hebrides, within little
                    more than two hours’ sail of Rothesay.</p>
                <p>The island has an area of 31,161 acres, two-thirds of which are arable, the
                    remainder consisting of hill-pasture, plantings, moors, and sheets of water. Of
                    the latter there are six. The largest, Loch Fad, 3 miles from Rothesay, is
                    nearly 3 miles in length and about ⅜ mile in breadth. From this copious source
                    the Rothesay cotton-spinning mill, the first establishment of the sort erected
                    in Scotland, derived by gravitation its propelling power. The mill continued in
                    active operation, giving employment to some hundreds of people, until a few
                    years ago, when, from the machinery having become antiquated and other causes,
                    it ceased to be remunerative, and was closed. There are still two factories in
                    the neighbourhood, with more modern machinery, for the weaving of cloth, but
                    they are driven by steam-power. Loch Fad has a peculiar interest attaching to
                    it, from having, on its western bank, the cottage built in 1827 by Edmund Kean,
                    the great tragedian, who there found it “glorious through the loopholes of
                    retreat to peep on such a world.” The cottage, after Kean’s death, fell into the
                    hands of Mr J. B. Neilson, the ingenious inventor of “the hot-blast,” and is now
                    the property of Lord Bute. Notwithstanding the change of hands, the drawing-room
                    is still retained precisely as Kean left it. Loch Ascog, within two miles of
                    Rothesay, is less than Loch Fad, but quite as useful. It covers an area of 72
                    acres, and supplies the inhabitants of Rothesay with excellent water for
                    domestic purposes. Quien Loch covers 54 acres, Greenan Loch 12, Loch Dhu 9, and
                    Lochantarb 5 acres. The climate of Bute is mild, genial, and healthful, and is
                    likened, not unfrequently, to that of Devonshire or of Montpellier. The
                    mountains of Argyll and the peaks of Arran breaking the clouds as they pass from
                    the Western Ocean, less rain falls on Bute than on any other part of the west
                    coast; and the sea-breeze, generally blowing from the west and south, keeps the
                    air cool in summer, and prevents snow from remaining or frost from continuing
                    long in winter. The soil of Bute, for the most part light and gravelly,
                    produces, under skilful treatment, excellent crops, particularly of potatoes,
                    which, being readily disposed of by the acre while growing, are conveyed in
                    barrels day by day to the Glasgow market. The farmers are a respectable class of
                    men, intelligent, able-bodied, and long-lived. Coal has been found in the
                    island, but of inferior quality and doubtful quantity. Supplies of this
                    indispensable mineral are therefore brought from the fields of Ayrshire and
                    Lanarkshire. Native limestone has been burned and used, but of late years it has
                    given way almost entirely to Irish lime, which is extensively imported for
                    building and manuring purposes. Of soft red sandstone, slate, and whinstone
                    there is no lack, but they are chiefly used in the building of dykes and the
                    gables and back walls of tenements, white sandstone and slates being largely
                    imported for the front elevations and roofing of the better class of houses,
                    which are now rapidly increasing in number. At Kilchattan there is an abundance
                    of superior clay, and a thriving brick and tile work. Granite of a grey
                    complexion, susceptible of a high polish, is also found at Kilchattan.</p>
                <p>The islands of Bute and Inchmarnoch, excepting the small estates of Ascog and
                    Ardbeg, the burgh lands, and one or two trifling holdings adjoining the town,
                    belong to the marquis of Bute, whose favourite seat, Mount Stuart, is four miles
                    from Rothesay on the eastern shore. The house, for which a much better site,
                    commanding a view all round the island, might have been found, was begun in 1719
                    by the second earl, and finished after his death, in 1723, by Lady Bute, a
                    daughter of the first duke of Argyll. It is a plain unpretentious mansion of
                    moderate dimensions, recently much improved internally by the present
                    marquis.</p>
                <p>To the geologist, Bute offers little attraction as compared with Arran; yet the
                    masses of conglomerate on the beach and forming the bold cliffs at Craigmore;
                    the dykes of trap which crop up strikingly through the red sandstone and
                    conglomerate at Ascog, and which may be traced shoreward towards Bogany Point
                    and across the island to Ettrick Bay; and the vitrified forts at Dunnagoil
                    (Garroch-head) and Island-bui (Kyles),—whether the' result of volcanic action or
                    only of beacon fires is doubtful,— will not be found unworthy of his notice. To
                    the antiquary and the student of mediaeval history Bute offers ample scope. The
                    Druidical monuments, and the barrows, cairns, and cists are numerous throughout
                    the island, as are also the remains of ancient chapels. For an account of
                    Rothesay Castle and its deeply interesting historical associations, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rothesay.</hi> Another object of interest is St Blane’s chapel,
                    picturesquely situated in a sheltered nook in the parish of Kingarth. It is
                    believed to have been founded in the reign of Malcolm Canmore, tow ards the
                    close of the 11th century, on the site of a much older edifice. This seems not
                    improbable, as St Blane, who is said to have been a nephew of St Cattan, lived
                    in the latter half of the 6th century. At all events, the names of both saints
                    have been perpetuated in connection with the chapel and the neighbouring bay of
                    Kilchattan. In the year 1204, Walter, Steward of Scotland, anxious “for the
                    souls of kings David and Malcolm, and the souls of his own father and mother,”
                    as well as for “the salvation of himself and heirs,” granted a charter conveying
                    St Blane’s, with all its valuable belongings in Bute, “to the monastery at
                    Paisley, and the monks serving God therein.” Time out of mind the chapel has
                    been a ruin, surrounded by numerous graves of the forgotten dead; and having
                    passed long ago from the custody of the church, it again belongs, with the lands
                    attached to it, to a Stuart, Lord Bute.</p>
                <p>There are still extant and habitable several old mansions in Bute, one or two of
                    which may be pointed out. The most considerable is Kames Castle, three miles
                    north-west of Rothesay. It stands in an extensive well-wooded park opposite the
                    fine bay of the same name. It was long the residence of the Bannatyne family, a
                    member of which, Lord Bannatyne, a judge of the Court of Session, projected the
                    Highland Society in 1784, and founded the village of Port-Bannatyne, an abode of
                    hardy fishermen, and now also a flourishing watering-place. Kames estate and
                    castle are now the property of Lord Bute. Ascog House, about three miles from
                    Rothesay in the opposite direction coastwise, is another old mansion in the
                    Scottish baronial style. Standing on a richly-wooded height, it commands
                    extensive views of the firth, and whether regarded from the road or the w ater
                    contributes largely to enhance the beauty of perhaps the finest landscape in the
                    island. The estate of Ascog belonged at one time to a branch of the Bute family.
                    In 1815 it was purchased by the late Mr Robert Thom, C.E., of the Rothesay
                    spinningmill, who acquired celebrity by successfully engineering the
                    introduction of water to the town of Greenock.</p>
                <p>The island is divided into four parishes,·—Rothesay, New Rothesay, Kingarth, and
                    North Bute.</p>
                <p>Rothesay, with its population of 7760 souls, has two Established churches, with a
                    Gaelic chapel, two Free churches, with a Gaelic chapel, one United Presbyterian
                    church, and three chapels — Episcopalian, Baptist, and Roman Catholic; while at
                    Kingarth there are two <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n642/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0642-0581"/> churches, Established and Free; at Ascog one, a
                    Free church; and in North Bute an Established and a Free church. The school
                    accommodation is likewise ample, both in town and country.</p>
                <p>Touching the origin of the name of Bute, there is considerable doubt. It has been
                    written Both, Bote, Boot, and Botis, and may thus be derived from “Both,” which
                    is the Irish for “a cell,” St Brendan, an Irish abbot, having, it is said,
                    caused a cell to be erected in the island in the 6th century; or it may have
                    been derived from the old British words “Ey Budh,” or the Gaelic words “Ey
                    Bhiod,” signifying the “island of corn,” or <hi rend="superscript"> tl</hi>
                    island of food,” from its fertility as compared with the neighbouring islands
                    and Highland districts. Although now all but obsolete, Gaelic was formerly the
                    current language spoken. The Butemen in fighting times were called Brandanes, a
                    distinction which they prized; and the numerous small landed proprietors, in
                    virtue of a charter granted them in 1506 by James IV., took the title of baron,
                    which became hereditary in their families. The title is now all but extinct, the
                    lauds which conferred it having passed by purchase from time to time, with one
                    or two trifling exceptions, into possession of the Bute family. The descendants
                    of the Brandanes were among the earliest to take part in the volunteer movement,
                    by furnishing a couple of batteries to Lord Lome’s battalion of Argyll and Bute
                    Artillery Volunteers, as well as a company to the Renfrewshire Rifles.</p>
                <p>Great improvements have been recently made and are now (1876) in progress in
                    Bute. The renovation, all but completed, of the grand old castle, and the
                    formation of the esplanades of Rothesay,—together with the erection of an
                    aquarium, and of an iron pier, where the accommodation was wanted, at the
                    entrance to the bay, will tend, with other appreciated advantages, to give the
                    island and shores of Bute a higher place than ever among the attractions of the
                    Clyde. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. h.)</hi></p>
