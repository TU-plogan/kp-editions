                    last goddess was also called <hi rend="italic">Merienptah,</hi> or “the beloved
                    of Ptah.” Although the names of Bast, Sexet, and Merienptah are written with
                    different hieroglyphs, their types are exactly alike, being that of a
                    lion-headed goddess having on her head the sun’s disk entwined by an uraeus.
                    Sexet and Bast appear both to have personified fire acted upon by Ptah, the
                    cosmic demiurgos, and Vulcan. Owing to the pantheistic ideas prevalent in Egypt,
                    Bast was identified at times with Neith, the Egyptian Athene or Minerva, and
                    Athor, the Aphrodite or Venus. Her type and attributes were also those of Tefnu
                    or Daphne, the pupil or daughter of the sun; and it was probably from her
                    relation to this goddess, who, with her twin brother Su or Sos, represented the
                    Apollo and Artemis of the religious, and the Gemini, or Twins, of the zodiacal
                    system, that Bast was identified with Diana. Bast was supposed to be the
                    beneficent portion of the element fire and the bringer of good fortune; her
                    sister and rival Sexet to represent the malevolent deity of the element and the
                    bringer of ill-fortune. At a later period Bast has the head of a cat substituted
                    for that of a lion, and holds in her hands a vase or situlus. About the time of
                    the 26th dynasty, figures of her, made of porcelain, abound, representing the
                    goddess seated and sometimes holding a sistrum. Her local worship was
                    principally carried on at Bubastis, the modern Tel Basta. The Speos Artemidos,
                    or Sheik Hassan, Anxtata supposed to be Letopolis near Memphis. The cat was
                    sacred to this goddess, and mummies of this animal are found at Bubastis, the
                    Speos Artemidos, and Thebes, sometimes in bronze or wooden figures in shape of
                    the cat seated on a pedestal, carved in form of the vase which was the
                    hieroglyphic name of the goddess. Connected with Bubastis were the Bubasteia or
                    festival of the goddess, celebrated with great pomp at the city of Bubastus, and
                    the largest and most important in Egypt. The Egyptians flocked to it by water,
                    accompanied by music; and as many as 700,000 are said to have been present on
                    the occasion. A nome was also named after this goddess, and the capital city
                    called Bubastus or Bubastis was on the site of the present Tel Basta on the
                    Bubastite branch of the Nile. In later times the canal of Necho started from it
                    to the Red Sea, and the adjoining lands were given by Psammetichus to the Greek
                    mercenaries. It is, however, mentioned in inscriptions of the earlier periods of
                    history, and was an important city. Taken by the Persians under Memnon, its
                    walls were razed, and it sunk gradually in importance. The nome struck some
                    bronze coins of small size in the eleventh year of the Emperor Hadrian, 127
                    A.υ., with a goddess holding in her hands a small animal, possibly a cat. Many
                    antiquities and remains are found in the ruins of the city.</p>
