                    to which he was sent being at Chippenham. At the age of fourteen he became
                    possessed of a small lot of books, and among them were <hi rend="italic"
                    >Robinson</hi><hi rend="italic">Crusoe,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's
                    Progress,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Life of Peter, Czar of Muscovy.</hi> At
                    sixteen he went to London, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0403-0356"/> and through the influence of a relative was
                    apprenticed to a wine merchant. Prevented by failing health from serving his
                    full six years, he found himself adrift in the world, without money, without
                    friends, and without education. In his hand-to-hand fight with poverty he was
                    put to strange shifts, becoming cellarman at a tavern and clerk to a lawyer,
                    reciting and singing at a small theatre, and compiling a collection of common
                    songs. During his apprenticeship he had read much in a loose, aimless manner;
                    and gradually by successive small ventures he found his way into the broad paths
                    of literature. A Salisbury publisher having projected a work on Wiltshire,
                    invited Britton to undertake its preparation. The proposal was accepted; and in
                    conjunction with his friend Edward Wedlake Brayley, Britton set himself to the
                    task. Such was the small beginning of the voluminous work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Beq,uties of England and Wales.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beauties of Wiltshire</hi> appeared in two volumes in 1801, a third volume
                    being added in 1825. The authors proceeded with other counties, and nine volumes
                    of the entire series were their work. In the course of these early labours
                    Britton’s attention was especially drawn to antiquarian subjects; and
                    thenceforth his proper field was before him, and in it he worked honourably. In
                    1805 appeared the first portion of his <hi rend="italic">Architectural
                    Antiquities of Great Britain,</hi> which extended to five volumes quarto, and
                    was nine years in publication. On its completion Britton commenced his great
                    work on the <hi rend="italic">Cathedral Antiquities of England,</hi> the section
                    on Salisbury Cathedral being the first published. It was completed in 1835,
                    having been more than twenty years in progress, and forming altogether fourteen
                    folio volumes. It is profusely illustrated by copperplate engravings.</p>
                <p>As sole or joint author or editor Britton’s name is attached to a large number of
                    works of a like character. Among these may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historical Account of Redcliffe Church, Bristol</hi> (1813); <hi rend="italic"
                    >Illustrations of FonthillAbbey</hi> (1823); <hi rend="italic">Architectural
                    Antiquities of Normandy,</hi> with illustrations by Pugin, published in
                    1825-1827; <hi rend="italic">Picturesque Antiquities of English Cities</hi>
                    (1830); and the splendid <hi rend="italic">History of the Palace and Houses of
                    Parliament at Westminster,</hi> the joint work of Britton and Brayley, published
                    in 1834-36. Mr Britton was a frequent contributor to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gentleman's Magazine</hi> and other periodicals; he wrote the article
                    “Shakespeare” for Rees’s <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia,</hi> and the articles
                    “Stonehenge,” “Avebury,” and “Tumulus” for the <hi rend="italic">Penny
                    Cyclopaedia.</hi> In his later years he began to write his Autobiography, but
                    did not carry the personal narrative far. The portion published is rich in
                    literary anecdote of the times. Britton died in London, Januaryl,ιl857, and his
                    remains were inteιτed in Norwood Cemetery. A <hi rend="italic">Descriptive
                    Account of his Literary Works</hi> was published by his assistant T. E. Jones.
                    Britton was the originator of a hew class of literary works. “Before his time,”
                    says Mr Digby Wyatt, “popular topography was unknown.” He first combined
                    antiquarian with topographical description. He effected a great improvement in
                    the style and character of the illustrations of ancient monuments; and the
                    general admiration excited by the engravings in his works gave rise to a novel
                    interest in his subject, and became one of the incitements to deeper studies and
                    investigations.</p>
