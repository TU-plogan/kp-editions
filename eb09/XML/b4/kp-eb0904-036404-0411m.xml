                    Cornish family. At the date of his marriage, in 1812, Mr Bronte held the living
                    of Hartshead in Yorkshire, and there his tv^p eldest daughters, Maria and
                    Elizabeth, were born. In 1815 he removed to Thornton, in the parish of Bradford,
                    where Charlotte, her brother Patrick Branwell, and her younger sisters, Emily
                    and Anne, were born. In 1820 he was presented to the living of Haworth, and
                    removed in that year to the parsonage, a bleak and solitary house, standing
                    close by the churchyard and backed by a wide expanse of moorland. Mrs Bronte
                    died soon after their removal, and the little family of young children were left
                    to educate and train themselves. They saw little of their father, whose health
                    was bad, and who seems to have been eccentric in his modes of thinking and
                    acting. The charge of the little flock devolved upon the eldest daughter, a girl
                    of between seven and eight when her mother died; and, under the peculiar
                    circumstances of their life, the children’s intellectual powers and sympathies
                    developed with rapidity. Utterly deprived of all companions of their own age,
                    with none of the usual outlets for their pent-up energies, they lived in a
                    little world of their own. The harsh realities around them, the bleak scenery,
                    the coarse and rugged natures of the few inhabitants with whom they came in
                    contact, only impelled them to construct for themselves an ideal w orld,
                    modelled after their own strange and untrained imaginations, in which they found
                    satisfaction and reality. By the time Charlotte Bronte was thirteen years of
                    age, it had become her constant habit, and one of her few pleasures, to weave
                    imaginary tales, idealizing her favourite historical heroes, and bodying forth
                    in narrative form her own thoughts and feelings. Nor was she alone in this
                    curious occupation; all the family took part in the composition of juvenile
                    stories and magazine articles. It was a strange training for a child, boding
                    little good for her future happiness when thrown into the ordinary routine of
                    life.</p>
                <p>An event which made a deep impression on this strange family circle was the
                    entering of the two eldest girls, in 1824, at a school recently opened at
                    Cowan’s Bridge, near Haworth, and intended for daughters of clergymen. A vivid
                    picture of this school, and one which Miss Bronto always maintained was not
                    over-coloured, is presented in <hi rend="italic">Jane Εyre,</hi> for the Lowood
                    of that story is Cowan’s Bridge <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0412-0365"/> Of all pupils the Brontes were the least likely
                    to fall in well with the requirements of their new mode of life. Everything was
                    novel and repulsive to them; their peculiar natures were repressed and stunted;
                    their intellectual sympathies found no food. Charlotte and Emily became pupils
                    later in the same year, but it was soon found necessary to remove Maria. Iler
                    health had given way completely, and she died a few days after her return to
                    Haworth in the spring of 1825. But a few months later and Elizabeth followed her
                    sister to the grave. The younger girls were removed in the autumn of 1825; and
                    Charlotte, as the eldest of the household, took upon herself the duties that
                    Maria had formerly discharged. For six years she remained at home leading the
                    usual quiet, isolated life, and indulging to the full her rare faculty of
                    composition. She then spent one of her happiest years in a school at Roe Head,
                    and some of the acquaintances made there became life-long friends. To this
                    school she returned in 1835 in the capacity of teacher, and for a time her
                    sisters were with her as pupils. After three years her health, always delicate,
                    gave way alarmingly, and she had to be withdrawn to Haworth. Two short
                    experiences as governess in a family having shown her how little such a life was
                    suited to her, she turned her thoughts towards taking a school, a plan which
                    would have had the special advantage of keeping together the three devoted
                    sisters. Some money was advanced for this scheme by their aunt, and it was
                    resolved that, as a preliminary step, Charlotte and Emily should study French
                    upon the Continent. In 1842, accordingly, they found themselves in Brussels, and
                    a new world, a new experience, was opened up to Miss Bronte’s vigorous and
                    imaginative mind, a world to be afterwards reproduced in living characters. She
                    studied hard, and before her return to England in January 1844 had acquired a
                    very thorough knowledge of French.</p>
                <p>She came back to a home into which a fresh element of unhappiness had been
                    introduced. Her brother Patrick, a youth of fine talents, had fallen into habits
                    of dissipation, which rapidly rendered him a hopeless drunkard. For some years
                    the sisters had the misery of seeing daily before them the spectacle of a wasted
                    life, of powers thrown away, and of opportunities despised. The details of his
                    unfortunate story may well rest in obscurity. He lingered on till September
                    1848.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, amid their distress, the sisters, who found refuge in their habits of
                    composition, had made their first literary venture. During their separation,
                    while Charlotte was in Brussels, and Anne in a situation as governess, they had
                    been quietly pursuing their favourite occupation; and in 1845 they made the
                    discovery of each other’s poetical efforts. After some correspondence with
                    publishers they resolved to print a small volume of poems, assuming the <hi
                    rend="italic">noms</hi><hi rend="italic">de plume</hi> of Currer, Ellis, and
                    Acton Bell. The book appeared in the spring of 1846, was barely noticed by the
                    reviews, and attracted no public attention. The authors, however, were
                    encouraged to make a further trial, and each began to prepare a prose tale.
                    Charlotte’s was <hi rend="italic">The Professor;</hi> Emily’s, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wuthering</hi><hi rend="italic">Heights;</hi> Anne’s, <hi rend="italic">Agnes
                    Grey. The Professor</hi> was refused on all hands; the other two were accepted,
                    but their publication was delayed for some time. Nothing daunted by her want of
                    success, Charlotte devoted herself heart and soul to a new tale, <hi
                    rend="italic">Jane Eyre,</hi> which she completed in August 1847. The MS. was
                    accepted by Messrs Smith and Elder; the book appeared with the name of Currer
                    Bell on the title page in October 1847, and at once achieved a decided
                    success.</p>
                <p>Few works of an unknown author have been received with such sudden and general
                    acclamation. The utter and even paradoxical disregard for the conventional which
                    the book displayed, the masculine vigour and glowing energy with which the mam
                    characters were drawn, and its intense realism, at once seized and secured the
                    popular favour, and showed the literary world that a new and powerful competitor
                    for its honours was in the field. Its success was not so much the result of the
                    favourable verdicts of trained judges, for these came but slowly, as of its own
                    intrinsic force. The delineation of the harsh and rugged but powerful northern
                    character was the revelation of a new world, and the intensest interest was
                    excited as to the true name and abode of the unknown author. Numerous were the
                    conjectures as to Currer Bell, but the secret was well kept. Even the publishers
                    were unaware of the truth, till the disclosure had to be made to them in
                    consequence of the publication of <hi rend="italic">Wuthering</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Heights</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Agnes Grey,</hi> and of the
                    announcement of <hi rend="italic">The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.</hi> The public,
                    however, remained in the dark till after the appearance of the second work by
                    the unknown, when a shrewd Yorkshireman, who knew Haworth, divined the secret
                    and published his discovery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shirley,</hi> this second work, fully sustained the author’s
                    high reputation. Yet it was written under melancholy circumstances. The death of
                    Patrick Bronte, in September 1848, was followed by the deaths of Emily and Anne
                    in quick succession. Emily died on the 19th December 1848; Anne on the 28th May
                    1849. <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi> was published in October 1849. The
                    disclosure of Miss Bronte’s name as the writer at once introduced her to the
                    great literary society of London. She met all the most prominent men of letters
                    of the time; yet, though she was in the world, she was not of it. Her previous
                    life and her peculiarly sensitive and retiring disposition made notoriety and
                    attention painful to her, and she gladly escaped to the quiet of Haworth
                    parsonage. Slowly, and with long interruptions from failing health, her last
                    work proceeded to completion. <hi rend="italic">Villette</hi> was published in
                    1853, and was hailed with universal delight. It is in some respects the most
                    pleasing of her works, while it at the same time exhibits some of her gravest
                    faults. The description of the life at the foreign <hi rend="italic"
                    >pension,</hi> and the whole delineation of the principal characters, are
                    reflexes of her own experience, and impress one with their vivid reality and
                    truth. The plot, however, is unskilfully constructed, and the interest seems to
                    shift from one set of characters to another in the progress of the story.</p>
                <p>In June 1854 Miss Bronte was married to her father’s curate, the Rev. Mr
                    Nicholls, and for a brief period she tasted the strange new happiness of
                    domestic life. But the seeds of decay were in her constitution; the same malady
                    that had carried off her sisters, worked its way with fatal facility in her
                    enfeebled frame. She died on the 31st March 1855. After her death <hi
                    rend="italic">The Professor,</hi> her first luckless tale, was published from
                    her MSS.</p>
                <p>A comparison has sometimes been made between Miss Bronte and Miss Austen. The
                    points of contrast are certainly more apparent than the points of similarity;
                    and it is a fact not without significance that Miss Bronte could never
                    thoroughly appreciate the merits of her great predecessor. Both were consummate
                    masters of literary expression, and both finished their work with the utmost
                    care and precision. Miss Austen is distinctly superior in skilful evolution of
                    plot and in the nice adjustment of character and incident. But her figures are
                    tame and lifeless when compared with those of Miss Bronte, and what she chiefly
                    lacked, the fierce glow and fire of imagination, and the perception of depths in
                    human nature only revealed through suffering experience, the other possessed to
                    an almost unrivalled extent. Miss Bronte’s experience was, indeed, narrow, but
                    it was of a rare kind, such as was peculiarly adapted to her strong and yet
                    sensitive spirit. She had too what Goethe calls the true secret of poetic
                    genius, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n413/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0413-0366"/> penetration to the individual and real; what she
                    had herself known and felt, the deep impressions made on her mind by wild
                    scenery, and by rugged yet genuine human natures, that she mirrored forth with
                    living truth and fiery vehemence. Doubtless her strength at times approaches too
                    near to coarseness, the situations become almost melodramatic, and the result
                    may be charged with sensationalism, but the pervading sense of intense reality
                    is more than sufficient to carry off these defects.</p>
                <p>Of her three great works <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi> will always be the one
                    which occurs most readily in connection with her name; it has all the vigour and
                    individuality of a first-born work of genius. <hi rend="italic">Shirley,</hi>
                    one of the sweetest love-stories in the range of English fiction, abounds in
                    rich humour, but wants the perfection of artistic unity. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Villette</hi> contains, perhaps, more of the author’s personality than either
                    of the others. The character of the heroine is in truth that of Miss Bronte
                    herself, and the analysis of it is at times morbidly acute. <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Professor</hi> has never gained much popularity, though the main conception
                    is one of great beauty and is skilfully handled.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="smallcaps">Emily Bronte’s</hi> works it is somewhat difficult to
                    speak, Hers was a strange nature, not easily understood; and it had but little
                    time to develop. Some of her poems are singularly powerful, and show uncommon
                    abilities. <hi rend="italic">Wuther</hi><hi rend="italic">ing</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Heights</hi> is a literary curiosity. Unmistakably the work of a
                    strong mind, into which the wild scenery of the north had sunk deeply, it shows
                    absolutely no comprehension of human character. We are transplanted to a
                    dreamland, enveloped in a lurid thunderous atmosphere, through which stalk
                    fantastic giant beings, gloomy and devilish in their utter wickedness. It is the
                    production of a powerful imagination, but of an imagination unrestrained by any
                    experience of the real, and regulated by no considerations of artistic beauty
                    and proportion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Anne Bronte’s</hi> was a mind of weaker calibre. <hi
                    rend="italic">Agnes Grey</hi> is a gentle, gracefully written tale, founded on
                    the writer’s own experiences of a governess’s life; but it manifested little
                    power or promise. <hi rend="italic">The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</hi> has much
                    greater force and vigour; but the main conception is an unpleasant one over
                    which the writer had brooded until she had been seized with a morbid craving to
                    give it shape and substance. It is a painful story, inartistically told.</p>
                <p>Charlotte Bronte’s friend, Mrs Gaskell, has narrated her life, as only a woman of
                    kindred genius could. Of Emily and Anne, incomparably the best notice is that
