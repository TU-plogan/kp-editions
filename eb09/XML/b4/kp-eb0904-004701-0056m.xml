                    extraordinary mathematical powers of George Boole did not manifest themselves in
                    early life. The classical languages formed at first the favourite subject of his
                    studies. Not until the age of seventeen years did he attack the higher
                    mathematics, and his progress was much retarded by the want of efficient
                    help.</p>
                <p>When about sixteen years of age he became assistantmaster in a private school at
                    Doncaster, and he maintained himself to the end of his life in one grade or
                    other of the scholastic profession. Few distinguished men, indeed, have had a
                    less eventful life. Almost the only changes which can be called events are his
                    successful establishment of a school at Lincoln, its removal to Waddington, his
                    appointment in 1849 as professor of mathematics in the Queen’s College at Cork,
                    and his marriage in 1855 to Miss Mary Everest.</p>
                <p>To the public Boole was known only as the author of numerous abstruse papers on
                    mathematical topics, and of three or four distinct publications which have
                    become standard works. His earliest published paper was one upon the “Theory of
                    Analytical Transformations,” printed in the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge
                    Mathematical Journal</hi> for 1839, and it led to a friendship between Boole and
                    D. F. Gregory, the editor of the journal, which lasted until the premature death
                    of the latter in 1844. A long list of Boole’s memoirs and detached papers, both
                    on logical and mathematical topics, will be found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalogue of Scientific Memoirs</hi> published by the Royal Society, and in the
                    supplementary volume on <hi rend="italic">Differential Equations,</hi> edited by
                    Mr Todhunter. To the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Mathematical Journal</hi> and
                    its successor, the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical
                    Journal,</hi> Boole contributed in all twenty-two articles. In the third and
                    fourth series of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi> will be found
                    sixteen papers. The Royal Society printed six important memoirs in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> and a few other memoirs are to be
                    found in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of
                    Edinburgh</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Irish Academy,</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bulletin de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Académie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de St Pétersbourg</hi> for 1862 (under the name G. Boldt, vol. iv.
                    pp. 198-215), and in <hi rend="italic">Crellds Journal.</hi> To these lists
                    should be added a paper on the mathematical basis of logic, published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mechanic’s Magazine</hi> for 1848. The works of Boole are thus
                    contained in about fifty scattered articles and a few separate publications.</p>
                <p>Only two systematic treatises on mathematical subjects were completed by Boole
                    during his lifetime. The well-known <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Differential
                    Equations</hi> appeared in 1859, and was followed, the next year, by a <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences,</hi> designed to
                    serve as a sequel to the former work. These treatises have become the standard
                    text-books on the important branches of mathematics in question, and Boole, in
                    composing them, seems to have combined elementary exposition with the profound
                    investigation of the philosophy of the subject in a manner hardly admitting of
                    improvement. To a certain extent these works embody the more important
                    discoveries of their author. In the 16th and 17th chapters of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Differential Equations</hi> we find, for instance, a lucid account
                    of the general symbolic method, the bold and skilful employment of which led to
                    Boole’s chief discoveries, and of a general method in analysis, originally
                    described in his famous memoir printed in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions for</hi> 1844. Boole was one of the most eminent of those who
                    perceived that the symbols of operation could be separated from those of
                    quantity and treated as distinct objects of calculation. His principal
                    characteristic was perfect confidence in any result obtained by the treatment of
                    symbols in accordance with their primary laws and conditions, and an almost
                    unrivalled skill and power in tracing out these results.</p>
                <p>During the last few years of his life Boole was constantly engaged in extending
                    his researches with the object of producing a second edition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Differential Equations</hi> much more complete than the first
                    edition; and part of his last vacation was spent in arduous study in the
                    libraries of the Royal Society and the British Museum for the purpose of
                    acquiring a complete knowledge of the less accessible original memoirs on the
                    subject. It must be always a matter’ of regret that this new edition was never
                    completed. Even the manuscripts left at his death were so incomplete that Mr
                    Todhunter, into whose hands they were put, found it impossible to use them in
                    the publication of a second edition of the original treatise, and wisely printed
                    them, in 1865, in a supplementary volume.</p>
                <p>Profound and important as were Boole’s discoveries in pure mathematics, his
                    writings on logic may be considered as still more original. With the exception
                    of De Morgan, he was probably the first English mathematician since the time of
                    Wallis who had also written upon logic; and his wholly novel views of logical
                    method were due to the same profound confidence in symbolic reasoning to which
                    he had successfully trusted in mathematical investigation. From the preface to
                    his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Analysis of Logic,</hi> printed as a separate
                    tract in 1847, we learn that speculations concerning a calculus of reasoning had
                    at different times occupied Boole’s thoughts, but it was not till the spring of
                    1847 that a memorable logical controversy led him to put his ideas into a
                    definite form. Boole afterwards regarded this pamphlet as a hasty and imperfect
                    exposition of his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n57/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0057-0048"/> logical system, and he desired that his much
                    larger work, <hi rend="italic">An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on which
                    are founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities,</hi> published
                    in 1854, should alone be considered as containing a mature statement of his
                    views. Nevertheless, there is a charm of originality about his earlier logical
                    work which no competent reader can fail to appreciate, and the introduction
                    gives striking evidence of his profound views and wide reading.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to give in a few words a correct notion of Boole’s logical system,
                    and only those who are conversant with the principles of symbolical reasoning
                    can exactly apprehend his position. He did not regard logic a3 a branch of
                    mathematics, as the title of his earlier pamphlet might be taken to imply, but
                    he pointed out such a deep analogy between the symbols of algebra and those
                    which can be made, in his opinion, to represent logical forms and syllogisms,
                    that we can hardly help saying that logic is mathematics restricted to the two
                    quantities, 0 and 1. By unity Boole denoted the universe of thinkable objects;
                    literal symbols, such as <hi rend="italic">x, y, z, v, u,</hi> &amp;c., were
                    used with the elective meaning attaching to common adjectives and substantives.
                    Thus, if <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = horned, and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> =
                    sheep, then the successive acts of election represented by <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> if performed on unity, give the whole of
                    the class <hi rend="italic">horned sheep.</hi> Boole showed that elective
                    symbols of this kind obey the same primary lawβ of combination as algebraical
                    symbols, whence it followed that they could be added, subtracted, multiplied,
                    and even divided, almost exactly in the same manner as numbers. Thus, 1 - <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> would represent the operation of selecting all things in
                    the world except <hi rend="italic">horned things,</hi> that is, <hi
                    rend="italic">all not horned things,</hi> and (1 — <hi rend="italic">x)</hi> (1
                    - <hi rend="italic">y)</hi> would give us <hi rend="italic">all things neither
                    horned nor sheep.</hi> By the use of such symbols propositions could be reduced
                    to the form of equations, and the syllogistic conclusion from two premises was
                    obtained by eliminating the middle term according to ordinary algebräic
                    rules.</p>
                <p>Still more original and remarkable, however, was that part of his system, fully
                    stated in his <hi rend="italic">Laws of Thought,</hi> which formed a general
                    symbolic method of logical inference. Given any propositions involving any
                    number of terms, Boole showed how, by the purely symbolic treatment of the
                    premises, to draw any conclusion logically contained in those premises. The
                    second part of the <hi rend="italic">Laws of Thought</hi> contained a
                    corresponding attempt to discover a general method in probabilities, which
                    should enable us from the given probabilities of any system of events to
                    determine the consequent probability of any other event logically connected with
                    the given events. Soon after its publication this method was the subject of a
                    controversy iu the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine;</hi> but it cannot
                    be said that the exact value of this part of his works has ever been clearly
                    ascertained.</p>
                <p>It is often supposed that mathematicians are deficient in judgment and knowledge
                    of other matters. In Boole this was not the case; for though he published little
                    except the mathematical and logical works already mentioned, his acquaintance
                    with general literature was wide and deep. Dante was his favourite poet, and he
                    preferred the <hi rend="italic">Paradiso</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inferno.</hi> The metaphysics of Aristotle, the ethics of Spinoza, the
                    philosophical works of Cicero, and many less celebrated works of a kindred
                    character, were also frequent subjects of study. His reflections upon
                    scientific, philosophical, and religious questions are to be mainly gathered
                    from four addresses upon <hi rend="italic">The Genius of Sir Isaac Newton, The
                    Right Use of Leisure, The Claims of Science,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Social Aspect of Intellectual Culture,</hi> which he delivered and printed at
                    different times.</p>
                <p>The personal character of Boole inspired all his friends with the deepest esteem.
                    He was marked by the modesty of true genius, and his life was given to the
                    single-minded pursuit of truth. Though he received a royal medal for his memoir
                    of 1844, and the honorary degree of LL.D, from the University of Dublin, it may
                    be said that he neither sought nor received the ordinary rewards to which his
                    discoveries would entitle him.</p>
                <p>On the 8th of December 1864, in the full vigour of his intellectual powers, Boole
                    died of an attack of fever, ending in suffusion on the lungs An excellent sketch
                    of his life and works, by the Rev. R. Harley, F.R.S., to which the present
