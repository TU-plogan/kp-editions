                <p><label type="entry">BOWLS</label>, one of the oldest and most popular of English
                    pastimes, the origin of which can be traced back to the 12th century. William
                    Fitzstephens, in his <hi rend="italic">Survey of London,</hi> written during the
                    last quarter of that century, states that in the summer holidays youths took
                    exercise amongst other pastimes <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">jactu
                        lapidum,</hi> “in throwing of stones.” This might be taken as referring to
                    throwing stones by slings or other artificial means, were it not that the next
                    pastime mentioned is “slinging of missiles to be delivered beyond a certain mark
                        <hi rend="italic">{amentatis missilibus</hi><hi rend="italic">ultra</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">metam expediendis).”</hi> Fitzstephens was both an accurate
                    observer and a careful writer, and he clearly alludes to two distinct exercises.
                    In early days stone spheres are known to have been used for bowling, and the
                    like thing and name were in vogue for the next two centuries, in fact till 11
                    Henry IV. (1409). There is little doubt, therefore, that Fitzstephens here
                    refers to bowls. It has been a matter of speculation whether bowling was first
                    practised in the open air on turf or under cover in alleys, and Fitzstephens may
                    help to decide the question. He states that the citizens went outside the city
                    walls into the suburbs to witness these games, but the alleys were within the
                    walls and in the midst of the population. Again, these alleys were always held
                    up as scenes of vice and debauchery, and it is certain that had they existed at
                    this date they would have been included in the resorts forbidden to the clergy
                    by the constitutions of Walter de Cantilupe, bishop of Worcester, 24 Henry III.
                    (1240). In the Close Roll, 39 Ed. III. (1366) mem. 23, <hi rend="italic">jactus
                        lapidum,</hi> “throwing of stones,” is mentioned as one of the <hi
                        rend="italic">ludos inhonestos</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">minus utiles</hi><hi rend="italic">aut valentes,</hi> “games
                    alike dishonourable, useless, and unprofitable.” But then there was a reason for
                    this depreciation. The king was concerned lest the practice of archery, so much
                    more important to the military spirit of the kingdom, should suffer, and the
                    same reason prompted the action of Parliament. By 12 Rich. II. cap. 6 (1388),
                    servants, artificers, and labourers were forbidden —amongst other games to play
                    at <hi rend="italic">gettre de peer,</hi> or “casting of the stone,” as the
                    practice of archery was becoming lax. This statute was confirmed by 11 Henry IV.
                    cap. 4. (1409-10), wherein “<hi rend="italic">gettre de peer”</hi> is again
                    forbidden. From 17 Ed. IV. cap. 3 (1477-8) it appears that bowling still
                    remained in disrepute; for “half-bowl” is included among the “many new imagined
                    plays” which were followed by all classes “to their own impoverishment, and by
                    their ungracious procurement and encouraging do inducen other into such plays
                    till they be utterly undone and impoverished of their goods.” Even murders,
                    robberies, and felonies were the consequence. Accordingly, it was enacted that
                    any one playing at half-bowl after the following Eastar, or the occupier or
                    governor of any “house, tenement, garden, or other place,” where such games arc
                    permitted, should be punished by fines and imprisonment. Here it is probable
                    that both the outdoor and indoor games are referred to, as “house” and “garden”
                    are mentioned, and it may be concluded that by this time alleys had sprung into
                    existence in towns. This then may be considered the first mention of the game as
                    practised under cover, though it is equally clear that alleys had not entirely
                    superseded greens.</p>
                <p>By 3 Henry VIII. cap. 3 (1511-12) the previous statutes against unlawful games
                    were confirmed; the word “bowls” for the first time occurs, and the game is
                    deemed an illegal pursuit. Owing, however, to the impossibility of following the
                    outdoor game except during the summer, and the absorption of playing fields for
                    building purposes, public alleys continued to flourish, as they were again the
                    cause of legislation in 27 Henry VIII. cap. 25 (1535-6), whilst 33 Henry VIII.
                    cap. 9 (1541-2) was very severe indeed on them. They were distinctly mentioned
                    by name, and it was enacted that no one “by himself, factor, deputy, servant, or
                    other person, shall, for his or their gain, lucre, or living, keep, have, hold,
                    occupy, exercise, or maintain any common house, alley, or place of bowling;” and
                    magistrates might search suspected tenements and make arrests. Oddly enough,
                    however, no <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n221/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0221-0180"/> punishment was to be inflicted, except
                    binding offenders over by their own recognizances, and making them find sureties
                    not to break the law again. Artificers, servants, and the like, might play
                    during Christmas time in their masters’ houses and presence, but no one could at
                    any time “play at any bowle or bowles in open place out of his garden or
                    orchard,” whilst a licence might be granted to any one worth over £100 per annum
                    to play privately in his own domain, but not to keep any common or open place of
                    play. By 2 and 3 Mary, cap. 9 (1555), these licences were cancelled, evidently
                    for religious and political reasons, as they were considered excuses for
                    “unlawful assemblies, conventicles, seditions, and conspiracies.” The evil still
                    continued and remained irrepressible. Stephen Gosson, in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >School of Abuse</hi> (1579), says—</p>
                <p>“Common bowling alleys are privy moths that eat up the credit of many idle
                    citizens; whose gains at home are not able to weigh down their losses abroad ·;
                    whose shops are so far from maintaining their play, that their wives and
                    children cry out for bread, and go to bed supperless often in the year.”</p>
                <p>Again, twenty years later, Stow, in his <hi rend="italic">Survey of London,</hi>
                    states—</p>
                <p>“What should I speak of the ancient daily exercises in the long bow by citizens
                    of this city, now almost clean left off and forsaken? I overpass it; for by the
                    means of closing in the common grounds, our archers, for want of room to shoot
                    abroad, creep into bowling alleys and ordinary dining houses nearer home, where
                    they have room enough to hazard their money at unlawful games. And there I leave
                    them to take their pleasure.”</p>
                <p>Stow also mentions in another place that the gardens of old Northumberland House,
                    in Coleman Street, City,</p>
                <p>“Were made into bowling alleys, and other parts into dining houses, common to all
                    comers for their money, there to bowl and hazard; but now, of late, so many
                    bowling alleys and other houses for unlawful gaming have been raised in other
                    parts of the city and suburbs, that this, their ancient and only patron of
                    misrule, is left and forsaken of her gamesters.” Again, Goswell Street is
                    described as “replenished with small tenements, cottages, alleys, gardens,
                    banqueting houses, and bowling places.”</p>
                <p>The law, doubtless, was transgressed with impunity until the beginning of the
                    18th century, when power was given by 2 George II. cap. 28, § 9 (1728), and
                    confirmed by 18 George II. cap. 34 (1745), to commit offenders to prison. From
                    this date alleys were rigorously suppressed, whilst greens began to increase
                    rapidly; and, during the 18th century, no country gentleman’s mansion was
                    considered complete without one. There is evidence that it was a royal game,
                    since Stow states that bowling alleys were amongst the additions made by Henry
                    VIII. to Whitehall, and the unfortunate Charles I. was an enthusiast of the
                    open-air pastime. During his confinement at Holmby, Northamptonshire, he
                    frequently went over to Lord Vaux’s at Harrowden, and Earl Spencer’s at
                    Althorpe, both of which seats possessed unrivalled bowling greens. He is said to
                    have been engaged at the game when seized by Cornet Joyce. After the suppression
                    of alleys “long bowling,” or “Dutch rubbers,” was practised for a short time. It
                    consisted of bowling at nine pins, placed on a square frame 30 yards distant,
                    but does not appear ever to have found much favour in England. The first regular
                    bowling club of which there exists any trace is the Willowbank Club founded in
                    Glasgow at the commencement of the 19th century. The game is now chiefly
                    practised in the northern counties of England and in Scotland. In the present
                    era of violent athletic exercises its principal votaries are middle-aged and
                    elderly persons, to whom it affords a pleasant and not too vehement exercise
                    during summer evenings.</p>
                <p>For the outdoor pastime the first requisite is a smooth and level plot of turf,
                    well mown, watered, rolled, and kept in order,—hence the comparison, “as smooth
                    as a bowling green.” The earliest delineation extant of the game shows two
                    players with a ball each, but no jack or mark to bowl at. It is presumed from
                    this that the first cast his bowl to constitute a mark for the second to play at
                    and knock from its position. Probably it was soon found expedient to introduce
                    some definite mark, and in a 13th century MS., marked 20 Ed. IV., in the Royal
                    Library, there is a picture of a game of bowls being played with a small cone
                    erected at each end. Here the principle was evidently the same as at present,
                    viz., to see who could cast his bowl nearest the mark. The modern green may be
                    laid out on any suitable piece of smooth and level turf. The dimensions vary,
                    according to the ground available, but from 90 to 150 feet in length, with a
                    proportionate width, is found most suitable. The bowls are made of <hi
                        rend="italic">lignum</hi><hi rend="italic">vitoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi> and, instead of being perfect spheres, are more or less oval with a
                    bias. Formerly biaβ was accorded them by loading one side with lead, but now the
                    more simple method of turning one-half of the oval smaller or leaner than the
                    other half is universally adopted. The chief difficulty of the game consists in
                    each player’s mastering the bias of his own particular bowl. The “jack” <hi
                        rend="italic">or</hi> mark to be bowled at consists of a white ball of
                    smaller size, which has superseded the old-fashioned cones. “Pegs” are a length
                    of cord, with one end firmly attached to a bone or wooden peg, and the other
                    passing through a hole in a similar peg. They are used for measuring which of
                    two bowls is nearest the jack <hi rend="italic">; and,</hi> if the distance be
                    under a yard, the “standard ”—consisting of a light straw or reed —may be called
                    into requisition. A “rub” or “set” is when a jack or bowl, <hi rend="italic">in
                        transitu,</hi> comes in contact with any object on the green. The “footer”
                    is the small piece of material—cocoa-nut matting is the best—whereon each player
                    stands in delivering his ball. “Cast,” or “point,” is the term for each unit in
                    scoring the game, which is “up” or won when the number of casts agreed on have
                    been obtained by the winning side. A “dead bowl” is one knocked off the green,
                    or against one lying in the ditch, or an illegally played bowl, and must at once
                    be removed from the green. Should the boundary of the green consist of fencing,
                    touching the fence constitutes a dead bowl. “Mark,” or “set a mark,” means the
                    delivery of the jack at the commencement of a game. The jack must be bowled at
                    least 63 feet from the footer and not over 3 feet from the edge of the green.
                    The bowling generally takes place alternately from the two “ends” of the green.
                    A “void end” is wnen neither side can score a cast. “Turning the jack” is when a
                    player claims the game to be finished as the bowls then lie, and can only occur
                    when one side has but a single bowl to deliver, all the opposite side’s bowls
                    having been cast. For the rules of the outdoor game as now played, reference may
                    be made to Mitchell’s <hi rend="italic">Manual of Bowl-playing,</hi> Glasgow,
                    1865.</p>
                <p>In France, according to Cotgrave, there formerly existed a game termed <hi
                        rend="italic">carreau,</hi> somewhat similar to bowls, the jack or mark
                    being set up on a square stone at the end of an alley.</p>
                <p>In the United States of America a game of bowls, termed “Ten Pins,” is very
                    popular. It is strictly an indoor game, played in alleys 60 feet by 4 feet. Ten
                    wooden pins are set up at the further end of the alley, in the shape of an
                    equilateral triangle with the apex (termed the “king pin)” towards the players.
                    The object is to knock down the greatest number of pins with the fewest balls.
                    These are made of <hi rend="italic">lignum</hi><hi rend="italic">vitoe,</hi>
                    unlimited in size or weight, but perfect spheres, instead of being biassed. A
                    game consists of ten “rolls” of three balls each (if necessary), or thirty in
                    all. The score is kept on a large vertical slate with ten divisions,
                    corresponding to the ten rolls, for each player. The chief point is to try and
                    hit the king pin at the apex of the triangle, as this affords the best chance of
                    knocking down all the pins. Should a player succeed in doing so with the <hi
                        rend="italic">first</hi> ball of a roll he <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n222/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0222-0181"/> gains a “double spare,” his bowling is over
                    for that roll, and he is entitled to add whatever number of pins he knocks down
                    with the first <hi rend="italic">two</hi> balls of the next roll to the ten
                    already down. Should he gain another double spare with the first ball of the
                    succeeding roll he has to wait for the first ball of a third roll before the
                    total score for the first roll can be ascertained, and so on in succession.
                    Accordingly, should a player obtain a double spare in each roll—or ten in
                    all—his total reaches 300, the highest attainable. If a double spare be scored
                    with the first ball of the tenth roll, the player is entitled to bowl his two
                    remaining balls at once as he has no further rolls to play. Should he knock down
                    all the pins with the first <hi rend="italic">two</hi> balls of a roll, he gains
                    a “single spare,” his bowling is over for that roll, and he is in a similar
                    manner entitled to add whatever number of pins he knocks down with the <hi
                        rend="italic">first</hi> ball of the next roll to the ten already down. The
                    technical name for this method of scoring is “counting old and new.” There are a
                    few ten-pin alleys in London and the suburbs, but the pastime is not much
                    practised in England. The rules will be found in <hi rend="italic">The Modern
