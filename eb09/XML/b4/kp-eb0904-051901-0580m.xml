                    >(e.g.,</hi> Pius, not Pius IX.), then follows the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >episcopus,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">servus</hi><hi rend="italic">servorum
                    Dei,</hi> then either the phrase <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> or the greeting <hi rend="italic">in
                    Domino</hi><hi rend="italic">salutem</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">apostolicam</hi><hi rend="italic">benedictionem.</hi> It closes
                    with the place and the date, which is commonly given according to the kalends,
                    nones, or ides of the month and the year of the pope. The chief mark, however,
                    of a bull is the seal. The popes use three kinds of seals—1, the signet-ring; 2,
                    since the end of the 5th century, the <hi rend="italic">bulla;</hi> 3, from the
                    13th century, the <hi rend="italic">annulus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >piscatoris.</hi> A bull is sealed with the second, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bulla,</hi> and from this it derives its name. The <hi rend="italic">bulla</hi>
                    is a globular seal of lead; on the one side there is, in modern times, the heads
                    of St Peter and St Paul, with the letters S. PE, and S. PA.; on the other side
                    is the name of the Pope, Formerly the <hi rend="italic">bulla</hi> often bore
                    other impressions; the name of the Pope was always given, but sometimes the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Papa</hi> was impressed on the opposite side; sometimes
                    a Scriptural image, such as the Good Shepherd. The popes evidently began to use
                    this particular seal when, from the growing weakness of the empire, the temporal
                    authority of the bishop of Rome began to be a real thing, and the popes assumed
                    the consular dress and insignia; for the <hi rend="italic">bτdla</hi> had been
                    used by the emperor of Constantinople, and its use was permitted to many of the
                    great officers of state who were accustomed to act for the emperor. The <hi
                    rend="italic">bulla</hi> was the common imperial seal, and was used not merely
                    by the emperors of the East, but also by the early German emperors, and even by
                    some of the minor European sovereigns. It was sometimes made of gold, sometimes
                    of silver, often of lead, and it was not until the earlier part of the Middle
                    Ages that the leaden <hi rend="italic">bulla</hi> became the distinctive mark of
                    a Papal charter.</p>

                <p>“Non auro, non argento, sacra Bulla refulget, Insignit chartas plumbea forma
                    sacras.”</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">bulla—</hi> meaning first a bubble, then any kind of
                    small ornament “<hi rend="italic">quasi</hi><hi rend="italic">inflata,”</hi>
                    then a seal of a globular shape—came to be applied to a charter sealed with such
                    a globular seal, and since the 15th century, exclusively to Papal letters of the
                    first rank. If the bull is <hi rend="italic">in forma</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gratiosa</hi> the seal is attached by threads of red and yellow silk; if <hi
                    rend="italic">in forma rigorosa,</hi> hemp is used. If the Pope issues a bull
                    before he is enthroned, nothing is put on the seal, and the bull is commonly
                    called <hi rend="italic">bulla</hi><hi rend="italic">blanca.</hi> Before the
                    time of Nicholas IV. such bulls were only valid if confirmed after enthroning.
                    Since then they have been valid without confirmation. Consistorial bulls are
                    issued after consultation with the consistory of cardinals, and are signed by
                    all the cardinals consulted. Ducange <hi rend="italic">(Gloss. Med.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Inf. Lat.)</hi> says that consistorial
                    bulls are often sealed with the signet-ring.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">brief</hi> is not so important as a bull. It is written upon
                    white paper, or thin parchment, in modern cursive characters, and is sometimes
                    sent open, sometimes closed. It begins with the name of the Pope, then the title
                    <hi rend="italic">Papa,</hi> then the number of the Pope, then the phrase <hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">in Domino</hi><hi rend="italic">salutem et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >apostolicam</hi><hi rend="italic">benedictionem</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it
                    ends with the name of the place, and the date (the day of the month, the year
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and the year of the Pope), and, finally, the
                    words <hi rend="italic">sub annulo</hi><hi rend="italic">piscatoris.</hi> The
                    principal mark of the brief is its seal. It is sealed with red wax, with the
                    signet called “the fisherman’s ring,” which dates from the 13th century, and
                    bears a representation of St Peter fishing in a boat, and the name and the
                    number of the Pope. The distinction between briefs and bulls is not much older
                    than the 15th century. In the early Middle Ages the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >breve</hi> was used to denote all sorts of <hi rend="italic">short</hi>
                    charters, and Ducange in his <hi rend="italic">Glossary</hi> gives over a
                    hundred different kinds of these. Papal bulls and briefs, like all other
                    important legal instruments, are liable to be forged, and hence Roman Catholic
                    jurists have made a special study of the various marks by which they are able to
                    tell the age of a charter. The bulls and briefs of greatest importance have been
                    published in <hi rend="italic">Bullaria</hi> collections which have been put
                    forth at different times under the authority of the church. The most important
                    of those collections is the <hi rend="italic">Bullarium Magnum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Romanum,</hi><hi rend="italic">a Leone Magno usque ad Benedictum
                    XIV.,</hi> Luxembourg <hi rend="italic">,</hi> 1727-1758, 19 vols. fol., and its
                    continuations.</p>
