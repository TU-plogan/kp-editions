                    Osbaldeston, on his admission to the bishopric of Carlisle. It was probably
                    during his residence at Carlisle that Brown wrote his poem entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Honour,</hi> inscribed to Lord Lonsdale. His next poetical
                    production was his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Satire,</hi> addressed to Dr
                    Warburton, to whom it was so acceptable, that he took Brown into his friendship.
                    He also introduced him to Ralph Allen, of Prior Park, near Bath, to whom in 1751
                    Brown dedicated his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Characteristics of Lord
                    Shaftesbury.</hi> In 1754 he was promoted by the earl of Hardwicke to the living
                    of Great Horkesley in Essex, and in the following year he took the degree of
                    doctor of divinity at Cambridge. In this year also he published his tragedy of
                    <hi rend="italic">Barbarossa,</hi> which, under the management of Garrick, was
                    acted with considerable applause, though it was sharply censured when published.
                    This tragedy was followed by a second, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Athelstane,</hi> which was represented at Drury Lane theatre. This was also
                    well received by the public, but did not become so popular as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Barbarossa.</hi> Among the most remarkable of his other productions are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times,</hi> a bitter
                    satire; the <hi rend="italic">Additional Dialogue of the Dead,</hi> which was a
                    vindication of Chatham’s policy; and the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the
                    Rise, Union, and Power, &lt;kc., of Poetry and Music.</hi> Dr Brown, who had an
                    hereditary tendency to insanity, and from early life had been subject at times
                    to fits of excessive melancholy, committted suicide on the 23rd of September
                    1766.</p>
