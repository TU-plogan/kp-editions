                    Haslington in Cheshire, in 1689. He was educated upon the foundation at Eton,
                    and was captain of the school a whole year, without any vacancy occurring by
                    which he might have obtained a scholarship at King’s College. Being by this
                    delay superannuated, he was sent to St John’s College by the contributions of
                    his friends, and obtained a small exhibition there. His fondness for metrical
                    composition was then such that his companions familiarly called him “Poet.” He
                    appeared early in the world as a translator of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>
                    into prose, in conjunction with Ozell and Oldisworth, the translation being
                    superior, in Toland’s opinion, to that of Pope. Broome was introduced to Pope,
                    who was then visiting Sir John Cotton at Madingley, near Cambridge, and gained
                    so much of his esteem that he was employed to make extracts from Eustathius for
                    the notes to the translation of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> and in the
                    volumes of poetry published by Lintot, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Pope’s
                    Miscellanies,</hi> many of his early pieces were insetted.</p>
                <p>When the success of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> gave encouragement to a
                    version of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> Pope, weary of the toil, called
                    Fenton and Broome to his assistance; and taking only half the work upon himself,
                    divided the other half between his partners, giving four books to Fenton and
                    eight to Broome. To the lot of Broome fell the second, sixth, eighth, eleventh,
                    twelfth, sixteenth, eighteenth, and twenty-third, together with the burden of
                    writing all the notes. The price at which Pope purchased this assistance was
                    £300 paid to Fenton and £500 to Broome, with as many copies as he wanted for his
                    friends, which amounted to £100 more. The payment made to Fenton is known only
                    by hearsay; Broome’s is very distinctly told by Pope in the notes to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dunciad.</hi> It is evident that, according to Pope’s own
                    estimate, Broome was unfairly treated. If four books could merit £300, eight,
                    aud all the notes, equivalent at least to four more, had certainly a right to
                    more than £600. Broome probably considered himself as injured, for he always
                    spoke of Pope as too much a lover of money, and Pope pursued him with avowed
                    hostility. He not only named Broome disrespectfully in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dunciad,</hi> but quoted him more than once in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bathos,</hi> as a proficient in the art of sinking. It has been said that they
                    were afterwards reconciled, but their peace was probably without friendship.
                    Broome afterwards published a <hi rend="italic">Miscellany of Poems.</hi> He
                    never rose to very high dignity in the church; he became rector of Sturston in
                    Suffolk, where he married a wealthy widow; and afterwards, when the king visited
                    Cambridge, in 1728, he was made doctor of laws. In the same year he was
                    presented to the rectory of Pulham. Towards the close of his life he amused
                    himself with translating some of the Odes of Anacreon, which he published in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gentleman’s Magazine,</hi> under the name of Chester. He died
                    at Bath in 1745. (See T. W. Barlow, <hi rend="italic">Memoir of William
                    Broome,</hi> 1855.)</p>
