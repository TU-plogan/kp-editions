                    afterwards removed to Chiswick. At Chiswick he was thoroughly grounded in
                    classics, and began to give promise of great ability, particularly in the
                    department of verse composition, one of his school poems being deemed worthy of
                    insertion in a magazine. He was a boy of a refined, gentle nature, intensely
                    studious, a devourer of literature of all kinds, and much loved by his
                    companions. After attending two other schools at Bromley and Kensington, he
                    returned to Edinburgh, and in 1792 began his course at the university by joining
                    the logic class, then conducted by Professor Finlayson. During the summer of
                    1793 he made acquaintance with Dugald Stewart’s <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of
                    the Human Mind,</hi> and found himself irresistibly attracted towards
                    metaphysical speculation. He joined Stewart’s class, that of moral philosophy,
                    in the following session, and quickly introduced himself to the professor’s
                    notice by reading to him a paper of objections to one of his theories, marked by
                    great acuteness and ability. His attendance on the classes at the university
                    seems to have been somewhat desultory; it does not appear that he ever passed
                    through the regular curriculum of arts studies. But he carried on his reading
                    with great vigour, and while still a student made his first appearance in the
                    arena of philosophical disputation. His attention had been drawn towards
                    Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Zoonomia,</hi> which was then exciting a lively
                    sensation in the literary world. His remarks on this book were published in
                    1798, and were received with great approval as one of the best and most mature
                    examinations of the theory. His next contribution to literature was an article
                    in the second number of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> on the
                    philosophy of Kant. It is acute, like all that Brown ever wrote, but it shows
                    neither sufficient knowledge nor adequate appreciation of the philosopher it
                    handled. Meantime he had been devoting himself to the study of medicine, having
                    relinquished that of law, to which for a while he had applied. His graduation
                    thesis, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Somno,</hi> which was thought
                    worthy of being published, is a fine piece of psychologico-medical analysis. A
                    few months later appeared two volumes of his poems, which were not received with
                    much favour. Nor did his later poetical efforts attain much popularity, with the
                    partial exception of the <hi rend="italic">Paradise of Coquettes.</hi> They all
                    show refined feeling and sweetness of diction, but they are wanting in the
                    elements of true poetry. They are faint echoes of Akenside and Beattie, neither
                    of whom can stand much dilution. Brown’s real strength lay altogether in
                    metaphysical analysis, and a favourable opportunity for calling it forth soon
                    presented itself. Some captious objections had been raised against the
                    appointment of the celebrated Leslie to the professorship of mathematics, on the
                    ground that he had approved of Hume’s doctrine of causality. The Humian theory
                    was believed to lead inevitably to scepticism and infidelity, and these
                    consequences were, of course, charged upon Leslie. Brown undertook the defence
                    not of Leslie but of Hume, and in his examination of Hume’s doctrine showed that
                    in reality the theory was in no way inimical to the interests of true religion
                    or theology. This examination, at first but a pamphlet, swelled out in its third
                    edition (1818) into a bulky treatise, <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the
                    Relation of Cause and Effect,</hi> containing not merely a criticism of Hume,
                    but an elaborate theory of the causal relation. This relation Brown regards as
                    nothing but constancy of antecedence and sequence, while at the same time he
                    admits an intuitive belief in the permanency or universality of the causal
                    connection. The work is a fine specimen of Brown’s faculty of analysis, which it
                    exhibits in its very best aspect.</p>
                <p>As early as 1806 Dr Brown had engaged in practice as a physician, having been
                    received into partnership with Dr Gregory; but though very successful in his
                    profession, he was by nature more strongly attracted towards a literary life. He
                    had twice failed in his application for a professorship in the university of
                    Edinburgh, when in the session 1808-9 he was called upon to deliver a few
                    lectures to the class of moral philosophy, in consequence of the temporary
                    illness of Dugald Stewart. In the following year, Stewart’s health still
                    incapacitating him from active exertion, Dr Brown delivered the lectures for the
                    greater part of the session. His success in conducting the class was
                    unequivocal; the enthusiasm of the students was such as one reflects on with a
                    little wonder. They were fascinated not more by the splendid rhetoric of the
                    lecturer than by the novelty and ingenuity of the views presented. In the summer
                    of 1810 it was resolved to appoint Brown as colleague to Dugald Stewart, and in
                    the ensuing session he began his course as professor of moral philosophy. During
                    the few remaining years of his life he published only his poems, but he was
                    busily engaged in preparing an abstract of his lectures to serve as a handbook
                    for the class. His health, never strong, gave way completely under the pressure
                    of his work. A voyage to London, which had been recommended, proved of no avail,
                    and he died on the 2d April 1820, at the early age of forty-two. After his death
                    were published the first part of his proposed text-book, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physiology of the Human Mind,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the
                    Philosophy</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n435/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0435-0388"/><hi rend="italic">of the Human Mind,</hi> 4 vols.,
                    of which the <hi rend="italic">Physiology</hi> is an abstract. The fame achieved
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> when published surpassed even what they
                    had attained when delivered. It is no exaggeration to say that never before or
                    since has a work of metaphysics been so popular. In 1851 the book had reached
                    its 19th edition in England, and in America its success was perhaps greater.
                    Since that time, however, its popularity has declined with almost equal
                    rapidity; judgments on its merits are now as severe as they were formerly
                    favourable, and the name of Brown may be said to be a dead letter in the annals
                    of philosophy. It is interesting to inquire how far this extravagant laudation
                    and neglect are justifiable; and it is of importance to know exactly what were
                    Brown’s contributions to mental science, and how far his system is consistent
                    and true.</p>
                <p>Some part of Brown’s popularity is no doubt to be accounted for from the fact
                    that he was the leader of a revolt against the established system of
                    philosophical thought in Scotland. It had come to be looked upon as established
                    that in the common sense philosophy of Reid alone were metaphysical truth and
                    soundness to be found. Brown not only showed that in many points of detail the
                    earlier Scottish psychology was in fault, above all in their crucial doctrine of
                    perception, but changed the whole aspect of the science by treating itfrom a
                    thoroughly new and original standpoint. Still more of his fame was due to the
                    lively impression made by his brilliant rhetorical powers. It was a novelty to
                    find the most subtle analysis expounded in the most richly poetical language.
                    Philosophical diction had been dry enough in Reid, and though Dugald Stewart was
                    a master of literary exposition, his eloquence was of a chaste and elegant kind.
                    Brown’s, on the other hand, is florid and ornamental to excess, and one soon
                    wearies of the copious quotations from poets like Akenside, Beattie, or Young.
                    Yet the style had, and still has, a certain fascination. But in addition to
                    these extraneous causes, one cannot help acknowledging as the main reason for
                    Brown’s quick accession to fame, his undeniable acuteness and originality. His
                    mind was extraordinarily quick and active; there is not one of his lectures
                    which does not contain either some addition to the older doctrine, or some new
                    and striking application of it. What a mind of such fertility and subtility
                    might have achieved had the thinker been spared a little longer, it would be
                    hard to say. But it must not be forgotten in estimating his merits, that we
                    possess only part of his system, and that he had not brought his psychology to
                    bear upon the deeper problems of metaphysics.</p>
                <p>Of positive contributions made by him to mental science, the following are
                    perhaps the most important:—(1.) General conception of the object and method of
                    psychology. According to him mental phenomena are to be treated by the
                    recognized methods of physical science. Complex mental facts are to be resolved
                    into their simple elements; and sequences of such facts are to be analyzed so as
                    to bring out the general laws of their connection. Analysis is thus the one
                    instrument to be employed. (2.) View of mental processes and rejection of the
                    ordinary doctrine of faculties. Just as physical science has to analyze and
                    trace the connections of the various phenomena or modes of appearance of matter,
                    without ever reaching the essence which lies behind them, so psychology treats
                    all mental facts as <hi rend="italic">states</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >modes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">modifications</hi> of the mind. Perceptions,
                    abstractions, emotions, or desires are simply the mind in the several states of
                    perceiving, abstracting, feeling, or desiring. The so-called faculties are
                    nothing but the various modes in which mental activity manifests itself.
                    Consciousness is not to be distinguished from the several mental states. Mental
                    modifications may be classified according to what gives rise to them; they
                    spring up either after some internal cause, or after some other mental mode. In
                    the first case they may be called external states, in the second, internal. The
                    internal may be again divided into intellectual and emotional. (3. ) Analysis of
                    touch into touch proper and the muscular sense. This is perhaps the most
                    valuable of Brown’s contributions. There are no doubt anticipations of the
                    division, particularly in De Tracy, whom Brown had studied, but his originality
                    is, we think, beyond question. The analysis has since been carried out much more
                    perfectly than by Brown. (4.) Theory of extension. Brown was one of the first to
                    attempt the resolution of our knowledge of extension into a series of muscular
                    feelings, successive in time. His analysis is exceedingly acute, though in many
                    points it must now be looked upon as erroneous. (5.) Doctrine of perception.
                    According to him, all that we <hi rend="italic">know</hi> of the external world
                    consists of the feelings of resistance, outness, and extension, which are
                    combined into one complex state; but our intuitive belief in the causal
                    principle compels us to postulate a real existence as Tying behind and giving
                    rise to these feelings. (6.) Prominence given to the doctrine of suggestion or
                    association. All internal intellectual states may be reduced to simple
                    suggestions, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> where one state arises in consequence
                    of another, and to relative suggestion, where the relation between two states
                    gives rise to a third state. Brown analyzes with great skill the powers of
                    suggestion or association, and illustrates very fully the primary and secondary
                    states. Undeι∙ the head of relative suggestion, he discusses at great length the
                    perception of resemblance or similarity, and draws out an elaborate theory of
                    generalization, intended to supplement the defective view of the Nominalist and
                    to reduce to its proper sphere the supposed abstract idea of the Conceptualist.
                    The analysis was highly popular in its time, but has little of real novelty in
                    it. (7.) Ethical doctrine. To this Brown added little; indeed, the weakest part
                    of his psychology is that bearing upon the will, which he identifies with
                    desire. With regard to conscience, he postulates the existence of a primitive
                    susceptibility to moral emotion; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a certain ethical
                    feeling is infallibly excited by those actions of agents which are right or
                    wrong.</p>
                <p>On the whole, it will be seen from this brief statement of what was new in
                    Brown’s philosophy, that it occupies an intermediate place between the earlier
                    Scottish school and the later analytical or associational psychology. . To the
                    latter Brown really belonged, but he had preserved certain doctι⅛es of the older
                    school which were out of harmony with his fundamental view. He still retained a
                    small quantum of intuitive beliefs, and did not appear to see that the very
                    existence of these could not be explained by his theory of mental action. This
                    intermediate or wavering position accounts for the comparative neglect into
                    which his works have now fallen. They did much to excite thinking, and advanced
                    many problems by more than one step, but they did not furnish a coherent system,
                    and the doctrines which were then new have since been worked out with greater
                    consistency and clearness.</p>

                    is Beneke, who found in him anticipations of some of his own doctrines. See <hi
