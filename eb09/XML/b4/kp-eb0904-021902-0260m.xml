                    November 7, 1805. He was the son of a landed proprietor, of ancient family, and
                    received an ordinary commercial education at a Chester school. He began his
                    professional career at the age of sixteen as apprentice to Mr Lawton, a
                    surveyor, and on the completion of his term became the partner of his master.
                    Soon after his marriage his master died, and he assumed the sole management of
                    the business. In the local surveys to which he devoted his attention during his
                    early years he acquired the knowledge and practical experience which were the
                    necessaryfoundation of his great reputation. His first engagement as railway
                    contractor was entered upon in 1835, when, on the invitation of the
                    distinguished engineer Joseph Locke, he undertook the execution of a portion of
                    the Grand Junction Railway. Soon after Mr Locke entrusted him with the
                    completion of the London and Southampton Railway, a task which involved
                    contracts to the amount of £4,000,000 sterling and the employment of a body of
                    3000 men. At the same time he was engaged on portions of several other lines in
                    the north of England and in Scotland. In conjunction with his partner, Mr W.
                    Mackenzie, Brassey undertook, in 1840, the construction of the railway from
                    Paris to Rouen, of which Mr Locke was engineer. He subsequently carried out the
                    extension of the same line. A few years later he was engaged with his partner on
                    five other French lines, and on his own account on the same number of lines in
                    England, Wales, and Scotland. “At this time,” says <hi rend="italic">The
                    Builder,</hi> “the industrial army set in motion and controlled by Mr Brassey
                    amounted to 75,000 men, and his weekly payments must have distributed, as the
                    price of labour, from £15,000 to £20,000 every Saturday. The capital involved in
                    these various contracts amounted to some £36,000,000 sterling.” But his energy
                    and capacity were equal to still larger tasks. He undertook in 1851 other works
                    in England and in Scotland; and in the following year he engaged in the
                    construction of railways in Holland, Prussia, Spain, and Italy. One of his
                    vastest undertakings was the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, 1100 miles in
                    length, with its astonishing bridge over the River St Lawrence. In this work he
                    was associated with Peto and Betts. In the following years divisions of his
                    industrial army were found in almost every country in Europe, in India, in
                    Australia, and in South America. It must be remembered that, besides actual
                    railway works, he originated and maintained a great number of subordinate
                    assistant establishments, coal and iron-works, dockyards, &amp;c., the direction
                    of which alone would be sufficient to strain the energies of a common mind. His
                    profits were, of course, enormous, but prosperity did not intoxicate him; and
                    when heavy losses came, as sometimes they did, he took them bravely and quietly.
                    Among the greatest of his pecuniary disasters were those caused by the fall of
                    the great Barentin viaduct on the Rouen and Havre railway, and by the failure of
                    Peto and Betts. Brassey was one of the first to aim at improving the relations
                    between engineers and contractors, by setting himself against the corrupt
                    practices which were common. He resolutely resisted the “scamping” of work and
                    the bribery of inspectors, and effected what he called the “smothering of the
                    engineer” by destroying the power of the inspectors and preventing all just
                    grounds of dissatisfaction. Large hearted and generous to a rare degree, modest
                    and simple in his taste and manners, he was conscious of his power as a leader
                    in his calling, and knew how to use it wisely and for noble ends Honours came to
                    him unsought. The cross of the Legion of Honour was conferred on him. From
                    Victor Emmanuel he received the cross of the Order of St Maurice and St Lazarus;
                    and from the emperor of Austria the decoration of the Iron Crown, which it is
                    said had not before been given to a foreigner. He died at St Leonards at the age
                    of 65, December 8, 1870. His life and labours are commemorated in a small volume
                    published by Sir Arthur Helps in 1872.</p>
