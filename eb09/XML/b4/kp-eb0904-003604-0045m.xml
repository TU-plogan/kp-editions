                    young man, albeit he would acknowledge no authority but reason, was obliged to
                    obey. The change, however, was worse than useless; for the dulness of Bern so
                    preyed upon his mind that he made an attempt on his life, which was frustrated
                    by the somewhat curious accident of a ray of the moon attracting his attention
                    when about to discharge the pistol. His father seeing his condition, sent him to
                    Leyden to finish his studies; but as the climate of the place disagreed with
                    him, he was allowed to exchange it for England, which he reached in 1769. The
                    facility with which he gathered friends around him, which distinguished him,
                    perhaps, as much as anything else, made his stay in England not the least happy
                    period of his life. He went home by way of Paris, where he was introduced to
                    much of the best literary society in France, but on his return <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0046-0037"/> he found that the mournful duty awaited him of
                    nursing his father iυ his last illness. Immediately after his father’s death he
                    agaiu left home and spent a considerable time in Italy, travelling as far south
                    as Naples. Time and experience had done much to alter the character of Bon·
                    stetten since the days of his wild theorizings at Geneva. No longer a
                    Republican, but still a Liberal, he was daily recognizing with greater clearness
                    that the watchwords of revolution meant anything but law and order. On returning
                    to Bern he became a member of the avoyer’s council, and soon after was appointed
                    magistrate at Ges-senay Thence he was removed in 1787 to Nyon in the Pays de
                    Vaud, a place attractive to him from its proximity to the intellectual life and
                    society of Geneva and Lausanne, but in other respects unsuitable; for the Pays
                    de Vaud, as well from its nearness to France and to Geneva, as from the weight
                    of the Bernese yoke, was nearly ripe for revolt, and Bonstetten was, as a
                    magistrate, trusted neither by his revolutionary friends and former allies, nor
                    by his fellowrulers in the government of Bern. He firmly declared that he should
                    stand by his order, a declaration that was not without good effects; but in
                    1792, when Geneva was threatened by the army of the Convention, he took certain
                    steps to avert the danger, which, as he had not received a military training,
                    were not very judicious. This increased the suspicion which the Bernese
                    Government felt towards him; and, in consequence, he was permitted to exchange
                    his office for one on the Ticino, where he remained until 1797, when political
                    troubles and the French armies compelled him to leave his native country. At the
                    solicitation of Madame Brün he at first repaired to Copenhagen, but he finally
                    determined to settle at Geneva, which proved to be his home for the rest of his
                    life. There, as of old, he enjoyed the society-of many distinguished persons;
                    but if this last half of his life is the most brilliant, it is also the least
                    eventful. He died in February 1832.</p>
                <p>As a writer Bonstetten cannot be said to occupy a very high place. His works,
                    indeed, show a great power of observation, aud an extensive insight into human
                    character; but as a psychologist he is deficient in method, exactness, and
                    depth; and his style, like his thought, wants point and clearness. In psychology
                    he occupies an eclectic position, and urges the necessity of making use of
                    internal observation in the study of mind. It is, however, in his social
                    character, as a conversationalist, and as the friend, often the intimate
                    companion, of many of the leaders of thought and action during his long life,
                    that Bonstetten will be best remembered. The following are the titles of his
