                <p>BOMBAY, a Presidency and Governorship of British India, consisting partly of
                    British districts, and partly of native states under the protection of Her
                    Majesty’s Indian Government. This territory extends from 28° 32' to 13° <hi
                    rend="italic">65'</hi> N. lat., and from 66° 43' to 76° 20' E. long.; and is
                    bounded on the N. by Beluchistan, the Panj Ab, and the native states of
                    Rajputana; on the E. by the native state of Indor, the Central Provinces, West
                    Berar, and the Nizam’s dominions; on the S. by Madras and Mysor; and on the W.
                    by the Arabian Sea. Area, including Sindh, 188,195 square miles, viz., 124,943
                    British, and 63,252 under Native rule. Population, 25,624,696 souls, viz.,
                    British districts, 16,352,623; Native states, 9,272,073. Bombay Presidency
                    comprises three British divisions or commissionerships, the northern, the
                    southern, and the Sindh divisions, with the following 24 districts :—Bombay,
                    Ahmadabad, KairA, Panch Mahals, Broach, Surat, TanιιA, KolabA, Khandesh, Nasik,
                    Ahmadnagar, Belg Am, KanarA, Dharwar, Kaladgi, PûnA, Ratnagiri, SatarA,
                    Sholapur, Upper Sindh Frontier, Karachi, Haidar Ab Ad, Shikarpur, and Thar
                    Parkar. The Native states are under the supervision of British political
                    officers, and are divided into 16 agencies, viz., Baroda, Kachh, Kathiawar,
                    KairA, Surat, Sholâpur, SatarA, Kolhapur, South Marhattâ Country, Rewakanta,
                    Mahikanta, Pahlanpur, Sawantwari, TannA, KolabA, and Dharwar. The Presidency
                    also includes the Portuguese possessions of Daman, Diu, and Goa.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Physical Aspects.</hi> —The Bombay Presidency consists of a
                    long strip of land along the Indian Ocean from the south of the Panjab to the
                    north of Mysor, from 25° to 14° 3' N. lat. The coast is rock-bound and difficult
                    of access; and though it contains several bays forming fair-weather ports for
                    vessels engaged in the coasting trade, Bombay, Karachi in Sindh, and Karwar
                    alone have harbours sufficiently landlocked to protect shipping during the
                    prevalence of the south-west monsoon. The coast-line is regular and little
                    broken, save by the Gulfs of Kambay and Kachh, between which lies the peninsula
                    of Kathiawar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains.—</hi> Speaking generally, a range of hills, known as
                    the Western Ghats (ghauts), runs down the coast, at places rising in splendid
                    bluffs and precipices from the water’s edge, at others retreating inland, and
                    leaving a flat fertile strip of 5 to 50 miles between their base and the sea. In
                    the north of the Presidency on the right bank of the Indus, the HA1A mountains,
                    a continuation of the great Sulaiman range, separate British India from the
                    dominions of the Khan of Khelat. Leaving Sindh, and passing by the ridges of low
                    sand hills,—the leading feature of the desert east of the Indus,—and the
                    isolated hills of Kachh and Kathiawar, which form geologically the western
                    extremity of the Aravali range, the first extensive mountain range is that
                    separating Gujarat from the states of Central India. The rugged and mountainous
                    country south of the Tapti forms the northern extremity of the. Sahyadri or
                    Western Ghats. This great range of hills, sometimes overhanging the ocean, and
                    generally running parallel to it at a distance nowhere exceeding 50 miles, with
                    an average elevation of about 1800 feet, contains individual peaks rising to
                    more than double that height. They stretch southwards for upwards of 500 miles,
                    with a breadth of 10 to 20 miles. The western declivity is abrupt, the land at
                    the base of the hills being but slightly raised above the level of the sea. As
                    is usually the case with the trap formation, they descend to the plains in
                    terraces with abrupt fronts. The landward slope is in many places very gentle,
                    the crest of the range being sometimes but slightly raised above the level of
                    the plateau of the Dakhin. Their best-known elevation is Mahabaleshwar, 4800
                    feet high, a fine plateau, 37 miles from Pûna, covered with rich vegetation, and
                    used by the Bombay Government as its summer retreat and sanitarium. In the
                    neighbourhood of the Sahyadri hills, particularly towards the northern extremity
                    of the range, the country is rugged and broken, containing isolated peaks,
                    masses of rock, and spurs, which, running eastward, form watersheds for the
                    great rivers of the Dakhin. The Satpura hills separate the valley of the Tapti
                    from the valley of the NarbadA, and the district of Khandesh from the
                    territories of Indor. The Satmala or Ajanta hills, which are rather the northern
                    slope of the plateau than a distinct range of hills, separate Khandesh from the
                    Nizam’s dominions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plains.—</hi> The more level parts of Bombay consist of five
                    well-demarcated tracts—Sindh, Gujarat, the Konkan, the Dakhin or Deccan, and the
                    Karnatic. Sindh, or the lower valley of the Indus, is very flat, with but scanty
                    vegetation, and depending for productiveness entirely on irrigation. Gujarat,
                    except on its northern parts, consists of rich, highly cultivated alluvial
                    plains, watered by the Tapti and NarbadA, but not much subject to inundation.
                    The Konkan lies between the Western Ghats and the sea. It is a rugged and
                    difficult country, intersected by creeks, and abounding in isolated peaks and
                    detached ranges of hills. The plains of the Dakhin and Khandesh are watered by
                    large rivers, but as the rainfall is uncertain, they are generally, during the
                    greater part of the year, bleak and devoid of vegetation. The Karnatic plain, or
                    the country south of the River KrishnA, consists of extensive tracts of black or
                    cotton soil in a high state of cultivation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> The chief river of Western India is the Indus,
                    which enters the Presidency from the north of Sindh, and flowing south in a
                    tortuous course, falls into the Arabian Sea by several mouths, such as the
                    Ghizri creek, Khudi creek, Pitiani creek, Sisa creek, Hajamri creek, Vatho
                    creek, Mall creek, Wari creek, Bhitiara creek, Sir creek, and Khori creek. In
                    the dry season the bed varies at different places from 480 to 1600 yards. The
                    flood season begins in March and continues till September, the average depth of
                    the river rising from 9 to 24 feet, and the velocity of the current increasing
                    from 3 to 7 miles an hour. Next to the Indus comes the NarbadA. Rising in the
                    Central Provinces,' and traversing the dominions of Holkar, the Narbada enters
                    the Presidency at the north-western extremity of the Khandesh district, flows
                    eastward, and after a course of 700 miles from its source, falls into the Gulf
                    of Kambay, forming near its mouth the alluvial plain of Broach, one of the
                    richest districts of Bombay. For about 100 miles from the sea the Narbada is at
                    all seasons navigable by small boats, and during the rains by vessels of from 30
                    to 50 tons burden. The Tapti enters the Presidency a few miles south of the town
                    of Burhanpur, a station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, flows eastward
                    through the district of Khandesh, the native state of Rewakanta, and the
                    district of Surat, and falls into the Gulf of Kambay, a few miles west of the
                    town of Surat. The Tapti drains about 250 miles of country, and is, in a
                    commercial point of view, the most useful of the Gujarat rivers. Besides these
                    there are many minor streams. The Banas and the Saraswati take their rise in the
                    Aravali hills, and flowing eastward through the native state of Pahlanpur, fall
                    into the Rann of Kachh. The Sabarmati and the Mahi rise in the Mahikanta hills,
                    and flowing southwards, drain the districts of Northern Gujarat, and fall into
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n31/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0031-0022"/> sea near the head of the Gulf of Kambay. The
                    streams which, rising in the Sáhyádri range, or Western Gháts, flow westward
                    into the Arabian Sea, are of little importance. During the rains they are
                    formidable torrents, but with the return of the fair weather they dwindle away,
                    and during the hot season, with a few exceptions, they almost dry up. Clear and
                    rapid as they descend the hills, on reaching the lowlands of the Konkan they
                    become muddy and brackish creeks. The Kanarese rivers have a larger body of
                    water and a more regular flow than the streams of the Konkan. One of them, the
                    Sheráwatí, forcing its way through the western ridge of the Gháts, plunges from
                    the high to the low country by a succession of falls, the principal of which is
                    890 feet in height. The Sáhyádri, or Western Gháts, also throw off to the
                    eastward the two principal rivers of the Madras Presidency, the Godávarí and the
                    Krishná. These rivers collect countless tributary streams, some of them of
                    considerable size, and drain the entire plain of the Dakhín as they pass
                    eastward towards the Bay of Bengal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lakes.—</hi> The Manchar Lake is situated on the right bank of
                    the Indus. During inundations it attains a length of 20 miles, and a breadth of
                    10, covering a total area estimated at 180 square miles. But the most peculiar
                    lacustrine feature of the Presidency is the Rann or Lake of Kachh <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cutch),</hi> which, according to the season of the year, is a
                    salt marsh, an inland lake, or an arm of the sea. Its area is estimated at 8000
                    square miles. It forms the western boundary of the province of Gujarát, and when
                    flooded during the rains, unites the Gulfs of Kachh (Cutch) and Kambay, and
                    converts the territory of Kachh into an island. In the dry season the soil is
                    impregnated with salt, the surface in some places being moist and muddy, and in
                    others, like a dry river bed or sea-beach, strewn with gravel or shingle. The
                    Rann is now used as the great source of salt supply for the whole Presidency.
                    Its present condition is probably the result of some natural convulsion. But
                    whether the Rann is an arm of the sea from which the waters have receded, or an
                    inland lake whose seaward barrier has been swept away, still remains a matter of
                    discussion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> Great varieties of climate are met with in the
                    Presidency. In its extreme dryness and heat, combined with the aridity of a
                    sandy soil, Upper Sindh resembles the sultry deserts of Africa. The mean maximum
                    temperature at Haidarábád, in Lower Sindh, during the six hottest months of the
                    year, is 98° 5' in the shade, and the water of the Indus reaches blood heat; in
                    Upper Sindh it is even hotter, and the thermometer has been known to register
                    130° in the shade. In Kachh and in Gujarát the heat, though less, is still very
                    great. The Konkan is hot and moist, the fall of rain during the monsoon
                    sometimes approaching 300 inches. The table-land of the Dakhín above the Gháts,
                    on the contrary, has an agreeable climate except in the hot months, as has also
                    the southern Marhattâ country; and in the hills of Mahábaleshwar, Singarh, and
                    other detached heights, Europeans may go out at all hours with impunity. Bombay
                    Island itself, though in general cooled by the sea breeze, is oppressively hot
                    during May and October. The south-west monsoon generally sets in about the first
                    week in June, and pours down volumes of rain along the coast. From June to
                    October travelling is difficult and unpleasant, except in Sindh, where the
                    monsoon rains exert little influence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forests.—</hi> Bombay Presidency possesses two great classes of
                    forests—those of the hills and those of the alluvial plains. The hill forests
                    are scattered over a wide area, extending from 23° to 14° N. lat. Most of them
                    lie among the Sáhyádri hills or Western Gháts. The alluvial forests lie in
                    Sindh, on or close to the banks of the Indus, and extend over an area of 550
                    square miles. The principal timber trees in the forests arc—teak; blackwood of

                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> Geologically the Bombay Presidency is divided
                    into two tracts: the north-western part, consisting of Sindh, Kachh (Cutch), and
                    Gujarát; and the south-western, comprising the Marhattá country. Undulating
                    sandy plains, with scattered craggy hills, are found in Gujarát; the immense
                    alluvial flats to the north being, for the most part, deserts of blown sand, and
                    the fertile country consisting of a belt along the borders of the sea. In Sindh,
                    the country, except on the banks of the Indus, or where reclaimed by irrigation,
                    is an arid tract of gravel and sand, from which rise steep scarps of limestone
                    ranges. The rocks of Gujarát, Kachh, and Sindh, are only partially represented
                    in the more southern peninsula, and are continuous with the formations found in
                    Persia and Arabia. In the Marhattá country the greater portion of the surface is
                    composed of nearly horizontal strata of basalt and similar rocks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Population.</hi> —The census of 1872 returns the total area
                    of the Presidency, including Sindh, at 188,195 square miles, and the total
                    population at 25,624,696 souls. Details, however, are only available for the
                    British part of the Presidency, which contains an area of 124,943 square miles,
                    and a total population of 16,352,623 souls. The average density of population in
                    the British districts is 131 persons per square mile, but it varies from a
                    maximum of 29,291 ∙13 in Bombay city to 14∙20 in Thar and Párkar. Total number
                    of houses in the British districts, 2,164,338; and average number of persons per
                    house, 4∙99. Of the total population of the British portion, 12,440,659, or
                    76∙08 per cent., are Hindus; 2,847,756, or 17∙4 pel cent., Muhammadans; 192,245,
                    or 1T7 per cent., Buddhists; 106,133, or 0∙65 per cent., Christians; 67,115, or
                    0∙41 per cent., Pársís; 603,836, or 3∙69 per cent., aborigines; and 94,879, or
                    0∙58 per cent., of unspecified religion or nationality. The males number
                    8,547,100, or 52 per cent. of the population; the females, 7,805,523, or 48 per
                    cent. The percentage of the total number of children under twelve years of age
                    is 31∙65. The Hindus are most numerous in Satára, and fewest in the Upper Sindh
                    Frontier district. The Muhammadans form nearly the whole population of Sindh,
                    and are least numerous in the Pánch Mahals. Except in Sindh, the Buddhists are
                    widely scattered throughout the whole Presidency. The Christians are chiefly
                    confined to Bombay city, Tánná, the Indo-Portuguese possessions, and the larger
                    cantonments, such as Púna. The British districts of the Presidency contain
                    upwards of 26,800 villages, and 175 towns of upwards of 5000 inhabitants.
                    Besides Bombay city, there are 213 municipalities established under Act 26 of
                    1850, Of these, 4 have an income of over £10,000; 27 of over £1000; 22 of over
                    £500; 94 of over £100; and 66 of under £100. Exclusive of the town of Bombay,
                    the total municipal revenue realised in 1872-73 amounted to £198,857. Average
                    rate of municipal taxation, 2s. 1½d. per head of the town population. The

                    Europe in large quantities from Karachi, and on a smaller scale from Bombay.
                    Barley is principally grown in the northern parts of the Presidency. Nâchani <hi

                    Much has been done of late years to improve the cotton of the Presidency.
                    American varieties have been introduced with much advantage in the Dhârwâr
                    collectorate and other parts of the southern Marhattâ country. In Khândesh the
                    indigenous plant from which one of the 2owest classes of cotton in the Bombay
                    market takes its name, has been almost entirely superseded by the superior
                    Hinganghât variety. Miscellaneous crops :—Sugar-cane, requiring a rich soil and
                    a perennial water supply, and only grown in favoured localities, red pepper,
                    potatoes, turmeric, and tobacco. In 1871-72, 3,379,937 acres were under cotton
                    cultivation; in 1872-73 the area increased to 3,715,945 acres. The total
                    out-turn was 260,444 <hi rend="italic">candies</hi> (560 β&gt;) in 1872-73,
                    against 221,144 in 1871-72. A legislative enactment has been passed to prevent
                    adulteration of cotton, and in 1872-73, 24 persons were convicted under it. In
                    1872-73, 2281 steam cotton gιnf were at work with 158 steam presses. Two model
                    farms have been established in the Presidency—one at Hâlâ, near Haidarâbâd, in
                    Sindh, and the other in Khândesh. Experiments have been instituted in the
                    cultivation of fibres and tobacco. Large quantities of Carolina rice seed were
                    distributed over the country, but the results hitherto cannot be deemed to have
                    been successful. The same may be said of the endeavours which have been made to
                    propagate the cinchona tree near Mahâbaleshwar. Acreage under principal
                    crops—Joâr, 6,552,385 acres; bajrâ, 4,560,271; rice, 2,009,115; wheat,
                    1,322,835; and pulses, 1,167,809 acres. The land system of the Presidency is
                    complicated, each province having a variety of tenures of its own. But the most
                    important, and by far the most universal, is the survey tenure created by the
                    British administration, which gives a right of occupancy to the holder on
                    condition of his paying the Government demand.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Public Works and Railways.</hi> —In 1872-73 the sum of
                    £1,180,000 was expended on account of Public Works in the Bombay Presidency; and
                    the allotment under this head tends annually to increase. In the same year there
                    were five railways open—1. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway: total miles open,
                    1278; total capital invested, £25,569,568; total receipts during the year,
                    £1,872,826; working expenses, £1,203,200; net profit, £669,626. 2. The Bombay,

                    £43,730; receipts, £2302; working expenses, £1241; net profit, £1061. 5.</p>
                <p>The Sindh section of the Sindh Panjâb and Dehli Railway: miles open, 106; capital

                    profit, £38,166. Total miles open of the above five railways, 1786|; total
                    capital invested, £36,726,136; total receipts in 1872, £2,598,400; total working
                    expenses, £1,662,723; total net profit, £980,667. Besides these, the following
                    railways are either in progress or about to be undertaken: —(1), State line,
                    Southern Marhattâ country; (2), Native State line, Virâwal, Junâgarh, and
                    Dhorâji; (3), Pâtri Branch (State line, light rail); (4), Anand and Dâkor
                    Branch; (5), Migângâon and Dhaboi Railway; (6), Wardhâ to Hinganghât and Warorâ:
                    (7), Wadi to Haidarâbâd; (8), Khandwâ to Indor. In 1872-73 the Bombay Telegraph
                    Department had 4406 miles of wire in operation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Post-Offices.</hi> —In 1872-73, 447 post-offices were
                    distributed over the Presidency; total mileage of postal lines, 10,208 miles;
                    total number of letters, parcels, &amp;c., despatched and received,
                    17,601,982.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mines and Quarries.</hi> —The Presidency of Bombay though
                    deficient in mineral wealth, is abundantly supplied with stores of stone fitted
                    for building and road-making purposes. At Teagar, in the Dhârwâr district,
                    iron-ore is mined and smelted, but the scarcity of fuel prevents operations
                    being conducted on an extensive scale. There are also large slate quarries in
                    Dhârwâr. Mândargé hill is quarried extensively for stone, the right of working
                    it being annually sold by public auction. In Belgâm district are quarries, from
                    which building stones, stone bricks, or oblong quadrangular blocks of soft rock
                    are obtained in abundance. Limestone is also found in the river beds of this
                    district. There are a few trap and laterite quarries in the Ratnâgiri district.
                    The trap stone is used for tank and well building, and for the plinths of
                    houses; the laterite is used for housebuilding. Near Karâchi are five quarries
                    containing a species of limestone, largely used in buildings in that town.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Manufactures.</hi> —The indigenous manufactures of the
                    country have rapidly declined since the influx of Manchester goods. But cotton
                    weaving is still carried on upon a small scale in every village of any
                    importance. Dyeing is practised in most places where fresh water is procurable.
                    Printed cotton goods are manufactured in all the large towns of Gujarât, and the
                    further the locality is removed from the direct influence of railways the better
                    the work is. This is owing to the competition of European cotton goods, which
                    are sold much cheaper, and are more brilliant in colour, although less strong
                    and durable, than the native manufactures. Most of the lower classes still wear
                    homespun and woven goods; but the cotton-mills erected in Bombay, Broach, and in
                    other parts of the Presidency, have introduced threads and cloths, which are
                    readily bought up, and upon which the native workmen display their taste and
                    skill. The cloths manufactured for the Marhattâ castes are of various kinds.
                    Some are all cotton, or cotton and silk, some cotton silk with metallic threads,
                    some silk with gold or silver thread. Ahmadâbâd, Yeolâ, Ahmadnagar, Mâligâon,
                    Nâsik, Pùnâ, and Dhârwâr, are ail celebrated for their cotton goods. Carpets,
                    rugs, horsecloths, towels, napkins, &lt;fcc,, made of cotton, are manufactured
                    throughout the Presidency. Ahmadnagar has an ancient reputation for the strength
                    and durability of its carpets; Khândesh and Dhârwâr for druggets, rugs, and
                    bullock cloths. A new future has lately been opened to manufacturing energy by
                    the introduction of machinery from England. The ancient products of the
                    Presidency, above named, are chiefly household industries. But large steam mills
                    are now rapidly springing up in Bombay city, Broach, Surat, and other stations
                    on the railway lines, especially in the cotton districts. Several of these
                    employ over 1500 hands; one is reported to have nearly double <pb break="no"

                    natural aptitude of the native for textile work, enables the Bombay mill-owners
                    to compete with the Lancashire manufacturers, notwithstanding the heavy cost of
                    importing machinery and of European supervision. Several of the mills have a
                    capital of some hundreds of thousands sterling invested in them; and their
                    superior reputation for turning out unglazed and genuine goods has almost driven
                    the lower qualities of Manchester fabrics from the market. In 1873 fifteen mills
                    were at work in the town and island of Bombay, and five in other parts of the
                    Presidency. Most of them have both spindles and looms, and their yarn and piece
                    goods find a ready market. In Ahmadâbâd, Surat, Yeolâ, Nâsik, and Bombay,
                    considerable quantities of silk goods are made, the silk being imported from
                    China either in the cocoon or in skeins. Gold and silver thread enter largely
                    into the manufacture of silk and cotton fabrics. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >lcinkhdb</hi> (kincob), the richest kind produced, is either gold thread and
                    silk, or silver, gold, and silk. Embroidery in silk cloth and cotton, and in
                    gold, silver, and silk thread, is carried on to some extent in Haidarâbâd, in
                    Sindh, principally for European markets. Fibres are used for the manufacture of
                    paper in Ahmadâbâd, Baroda, Surat, Nâsik, Bombay, and Kolhâpur. Mats, beds,
                    &amp;c., are manufactured from cocoa-nut fibre. Leather is worked into a variety
                    of articles throughout the Presidency. The manufactures of minor importance
                    consist of pottery, brass, and copper utensils, cutlery, and agricultural
                    implements, gold and silver ornaments, carved wood, ivory work, &amp;c.</p>

                    1872-73 upwards of 55,300 tons of cotton were imported into Bombay in the shape
                    of Manchester goods, and 143,017 tons of raw cotton exported from it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Revenue and Expenditure.</hi> —The total revenue of the
                    Presidency for the year 1872-73 amounted to £9,980,043, and the expenditure to
                    £8,027,040. The principal heads of revenue are as follows:—Land revenue,
                    £3,751,050; tributes and contributions from native states, £92,337; forests,
                    £114,640, excise, £418,746· assessed taxes, £110,098; customs, £667,825; salt,

                    £64,475; interest, £103,209. The settlement of the land revenue is usually made
                    for thirty years. A revision of the thirty years’ settlement of Poona, Nâsik,
                    and Sholâpur districts, is now (1874) in progress.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Statistics of Protection.</hi> —The military strength of the

                    European non-commissioned officers and rank and file, 27,002 Native commissioned
                    and noncommissioned officers and rank and file; total, 39,319. The whole are
                    under the control of a separate commanderin-chief for Bombay. Ten ships
                    constitute the strength of the Bombay marine. The regular police of Bombay
                    consisted in 1872-73 of 18,166 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of
                    £305,810; the average being 1 man to every 6 ’ 8 square miles of the area, and

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">History.</hi> —The territories now comprising the Presidency
                    of Bombay formed in ancient times several separate Hindu kingdoms, among which
                    Mahârâshthra, Gujarâshthra, Sindhu, were the most important. As in other parts
                    of India, the great majority of the people are Hindus, with more recent
                    accretions of Muhammadans, and a sprinkling of hill-tribes practising non-Hindu
                    rites, and representing the pre-Aryan races. The first Muhammadan invasion of
                    which we have authentic accounts is that of Mahmùd of Ghazni, who, in 1024 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> invaded Gujarât with a large army, destroyed the
                    national Hindu idol of Somnâth, and carried away an immense booty. Muhammad
                    Ghori also invaded Gujarât, and left a garrison in its capital. But it was not
                    till after the Musalmân power was firmly established in Northern India that the
                    Muhammadan sovereigns of Dehli attempted the conquest of the south. In 1294 the
                    Emperor Alâ-ud-din first invaded the Dakhin (Deccan), and in 1297 he conquered
                    Gujarât. In 1312 the Muhammadan arms were triumphant through the Marhattâ
                    country; and seven years later the whole of Malabar fell a prey to the invaders.
                    In the middle of the 14th century the weakness of the Dehli sovereigns tempted
                    the governors of provinces to revolt against their distant master, and to form
                    independent kingdoms. In this way the Bâhmini kingdom was established in the
                    Dakhin, and embraced a part of the Bombay Presidency. Ahmadnagar and Gujarât
                    also became the seats of a new kingdom. In 1573 Akbar conquered Gujarât and
                    reannexed it to the empire, and in 1601 he effected the reconquest of Ahmadnagar
                    and Khândesh. From this time the country was never tranquil, and Ahmadnagar
                    became the focus of constant rebellions. During the latter part of the 17th
                    century the Marhattâs rose into power, and almost every part of the country now
                    comprising the Presidency of Bombay fell under their sway.</p>
                <p>As early as 1532 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the island of Bombay was occupied
                    by the Portuguese. The Dutch and English made an unsuccessful attempt to gain
                    possession of the island in 1627, and in 1653 proposals were suggested for its
                    purchase from the Portuguese. In 1661 it was ceded to the English Crown, as part
                    of the dower of the Infanta Catherina on her marriage with Charles II. So
                    lightly was the acquisition esteemed in England, and so unsuccessful was the
                    administration of the Crown officers, that in 1668 Bombay was transferred to the
                    East India Company for an annual payment of £10. The population at that time did
                    not exceed 10,000 souls, and so unhealthy was the climate, that three years were
                    regarded as the average duration of the life of its European inhabitants. At the
                    time of the <pb break="no"

                    administration of justice were also conferred; a European regiment was enrolled;
                    and the fortifications erected proved sufficient to deter the Dutch from their
                    intended attack in 1673. In 1687 Bombay was placed at the head of all the
                    Company’s possessions in India; but in 1753 the Government of Bombay became
                    subordinate to that of Calcutta. The first English settlement in the Bombay
                    Presidency was in 1618, when the East India Company established a factory at
                    Surat, protected by a charter obtained from the Emperor Jahângir. After the
                    termination of the second Marhattâ war in 1803, the East India Company obtained
                    the districts of Surat, Broach, Kairâ, &amp;c.; and on the overthrow of the
                    Peshwâ in 1813, they annexed Pùnâ, Ahmadnagar, Nâsik, Sholâpur, Belgâm, Kâladgi,
                    Dhârwâr, &amp;c. Sindh was conquered in 1843, and became a part of the British
                    empire. The native states under the supervision of the Government of Bombay are
                    divided, historically and geographically, into two main groups. The northern or
                    Gujarât group includes the territories of the Gaikwâr, with the smaller states
                    which form the administrative divisions of Kachh, Pâhlanpur, Rewâ Kânta, and
                    Mâhi Kânta. These territories, with the exception of Kachh (Cutch), have an
                    historical connection, as being the allies or tributaries of the Gaikwâr in
                    1805, when final engagements were concluded between that prince and the British
                    Government. The southern or Marhattâ group includes Kolhâpur, Akalkot,
                    Sâwantwâri, and the Sâtârâ and southern Marhattâ Jâgfrs, and has an historical
                    bond of union in the friendship they showed to the British in their final
                    struggle with the power of the Peshwâ in 1818. The remaining territories may
                    conveniently be divided into a small cluster of independent zamindâris, situated
                    in the wild and hilly tracts at the northern extremity of the Sâhyâdri range,
                    and certain principalities which, from their history or geographical position,
                    are to some extent isolated from the rest of the Presidency.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Administration.</hi> —The Government of Bombay is
                    administered by a Governor in Council, the latter consisting of the Governor as
                    president, two ordinary civil members, and, as a rule, the commander-in-chief of
                    the Bombay army. These are the executive members of Government. For making laws
                    there is a legislative council, consisting of the Governor and his Executive
                    Council, with certain other persons, not fewer than four or more than eight in
                    number, nominated by the Governor to be members of council for legislative
                    purposes only, and intended to represent the non-official European and Native
                    communities. Each of the members of the Executive CounciΓhas in his charge one
                    or two departments of the Government; and each department has a secretary, an
                    under-secretary, and an assistant secretary, with a numerous staff of clerks.
                    The political administration of the native states is under the superintendence
                    of British agents placed at the principal native courts; their position varies
                    in different states according to the relations in which the principalities stand
                    with the paramount power. The administration of justice throughout the
                    regulation districts of the Presidency is conducted by a High Court at Bombay,
                    cohsisting of a Chief Justice and seven Puisne judges, along with district and
                    assistant judges throughout the districts of the Presidency. The revenue
                    administration of the regulation districts is carried on by two revenue
                    commissioners, seventeen collectors, twenty assistant collectors, and a varying
                    number of supernumerary assistants. (w. w. <hi rend="smallcaps">h.)</hi><hi

                <p>The Island of Bombay, with an area slightly in excess of <hi rend="italic"
                    >22</hi> square miles, is situated in 18° 53' 54" N. lat., and 72° 52' E. long.
                    It consists of a plain about 11 miles long by 3 broad, flanked by two parallel
                    lines of low hills. A neck of land stretching towards the south-west forms the
                    harbour on its eastern side, sheltering it from the force of the open sea, and
                    enclosing an expanse of water from 5 to 7 miles wide. At the south-west of the
                    island, Back Bay, a shallow basin rather more than 2 miles in breadth, runs
                    inland for about 3 miles between the extreme points of the two ranges of hills.
                    On a slightly raised strip of land between the head of Back Bay and the harbour
                    is situated the fort, the nucleus of the city of Bombay. From this point the
                    land slopes westward towards the central plain, a low lying tract, which before
                    the construction of the embankment known as the Hornby Velard, used at high tide
                    to be submerged by the sea. To the north and east, although causeways and
                    railway embankments have now shut out the sea, a large area of salt-marsh land
                    still remains subject to inundation.</p>
                <p>In the foregoing article on the Bombay Presidency it is explained that Bombay
                    Island passed to the English Crown as part of the dower of the Infanta
                    Catherina, on her marriage with Charles II., and that although the new
                    acquisition was at first despised, it rose in 1687 to the chief importance in
                    the East India Company’s possessions. In the next century it declined before the
                    growth of Calcutta, and sank into a subordinate settlement. The present century
                    has again witnessed a revolution in its fortunes. Its splendid harbour and
                    comparative nearness to the Suez Canal, with the system of railways which now
                    connect Bombay with the other Presidencies, have marked out for it a career
                    scarcely second, if at all second in commercial importance, to that of Calcutta
                    itself. The sudden demand for Indian cotton, which resulted from the American
                    war, gave an unprecedented rapidity to its development. The cotton of Gujarât,
                    Dhârwâr, and other parts of Bombay, is much superior to the Bengal fibre.
                    Several years of brilliant prosperity culminated in 1866-67 in a financial
                    crisis, that left the commerce of Bombay in a shattered state. Depending as it
                    does chiefly on the one article of cotton, along with some export of grain and
                    the Government opium, the trade of Bombay rests on a narrower basis than that of
                    Calcutta, which in years of misfortune has a large variety of staples to fall
                    back upon, such as tea, indigo, jute, rice, hides, oil-seeds, &amp;c. Moreover,
                    Bombay has only the costly railway communication with the interior parts of
                    India, while Calcutta commands the confluence of two of the greatest river
                    systems in the world, the Brahmaputra and the Ganges. Nevertheless, Bombay is
                    pressing close upon Calcutta as the commercial capital of India. Its imports are
                    about as great, and its exports not very far short. In 1871-72 its total trade
                    was £50,384,929 against a total of £54,136,829 in Calcutta. In that year the
                    Bombay imports were 22⅜ millions sterling; the exports, 23 J millions, and the
                    re-exports, 4∣ millions: total, 50∣ millions sterling.</p>
                <p>In natural scenery and in the sanitary advantages of its position Bombay ranks
                    first among the cities of India. The Bombay Island, or, as it ought to be more
                    correctly called, the Bombay Peninsula, is now connected with the mainland by
                    the railway causeways. It stands out from a coast ennobled by lofty mountains,
                    and its harbour is studded by rocky islands and precipices, whose peaks rise to
                    a great height. The approach from the sea discloses one of the finest panoramas
                    in the world,—the only European analogy being the Bay of Naples. The town itself
                    consists of well-built and unusually handsome native bâzârs, and of spacious
                    streets devoted to European commerce. In the native bâzâr the houses rise three
                    or four stories in height, with elaborately carved pillars and front work. Some
                    of the European hotels and commercial <pb break="no"

                    rival in any°other city of India. The private houses of the European residents
                    lie apart alike from the native and from the mercantile quarters of the town. As
                    a rule, each is built in a large garden or <hi rend="italic">compound;</hi> and
                    although the style of architecture is less imposing than that of the stately
                    residences in Calcutta, it is well suited to the climate, and has a beauty and
                    comfort of its own. The favourite suburb is Malabar hill, a high ridge running
                    out into the sea, and terraced to the top by handsome houses, which command one
                    of the finest views in the world. To the right of this ridge, looking towards
                    the sea, runs another suburb known as Breach Candy, built close upon the beach
                    and within the refreshing sound of the waves. To the left of Malabar hill the
                    island forms a spacious bay, with a promontory at the other side, which marks
                    the site of the old Bombay Fort. The fort is now a mere garrison, with small
                    pretensions to defensive capabilities. Its walls are demolished, and its area is
                    chiefly devoted to mercantile buildings. Further round the island, beyond the
                    fort, is Mazagon Bay, commanding the harbour, and the centre of maritime
                    activity. The defences of the port consist chiefly m ironclad “Monitors”
                    anchored off the town, with one or two fortified islands, and the guns which
                    still line a portion of the old fort walls that have been left standing towards
                    the sea. The census of 1872 disclosed a population of 644,405 souls; of whom
                    408,680, or 63∙42 per cent., arθ Hmdns; 138,815, or 2154 per cent., Muhammadans;
                    44,091, or 6∙84 per cent., Pârsfs; 15,121, Buddhists and Jams; 34,705, or 5 ’ 39
                    per cent., European, African,</p>
                <p>Eurasian, and Native Christians, with 2993 classified under the head of “others.”
                    Dyeing, tanning, and working in metals may be noticed as specially active
                    trades, but the most progressive and important industry is the manufacture of
                    yarn and cotton cloth. In 1873 there were 5 steam spinning and weaving mills in
                    Bombay, giving employment to about 11,000 hands. In these factories 380,000
                    spindles and 5000 looms were at work. A considerable section of the population
                    is supported by the cultivation of cocoa-nut trees and the preparation of
                    intoxicating drinks from the juice of the different species of palm. Rice is the
                    chief agricultural product, but many varieties of garden vegetables are
                    profitably cultivated. Of these the most common are onions, “bhendis” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Abelmoschus</hi><hi rend="italic">esculentus'),</hi> and gourds
                    of different sorts. The imperial revenue from the town and island of Bombay is
                    derived from two sources, —the one supervised by the collector of Bombay, the
                    other by the commissioner of customs. The total receipts for the past year,
                    under the first head, amounted to £148,287, of which £23,131 was derived from
                    land, £17,250 from excise, and £107,906 from stamps. The total amount collected
                    by the commissioner of customs was £3,252,714, of which the customs yielded
                    £609,630, and the export duty on opium £2,643,084. Owing to the difficulty of
                    procuring colonists in the early days of the settlement, the land is generally
                    held on easy terms,—the payment to Government being in most cases of the nature
                    of a quit rent, free from enhancement or resettlement as long as the land is
                    used for cultivation only. Of the whole area, 13 miles are returned as
                    cultivated, and 9 as unculturable. During the year 1872 there were 101 schools
                    in Bombay, attended by 11,351 scholars, or 1 to every 56 of the entire
                    population. The total strength of the local police force in 1872 was 1402, or 1
                    policemanto every 459 inhabitants. Of the entire number, 1124 are municipal, and
                    278 Government police. Of the former, 35 are European, and 13 are mounted.
                    Native police. The Government police are employed on harbour duty and as guards
                    for Government offices. Eight of them are Europeans.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Municipal Statistics.</hi> —The limits of the Bombay
                    municipality extend over the whole of the island of Bombay, including, as stated
                    above, a population of 644,405 souls. The total municipal revenue for the year
                    1873 amounted to £314,645, of which £223,041 was raised by taxation, £59,958 on
