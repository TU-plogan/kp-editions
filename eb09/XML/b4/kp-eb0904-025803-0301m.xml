                <p><label type="entry">BRESLAU</label>, a city of Prussia, capital of the government
                    of Silesia, is situated mainly on the left but partly also on the right bank of
                    the Oder, at the influx of the Ohlau, and on the railway from Berlin to Vienna,
                    190 miles S.E. of the former city. The latitude of the observatory is 51° 6' 56"
                    N., and its longitude 17° 2' 18" E. The city consists of a new and an old town,
                    and a number of extensive suburbs stretching out in all directions. The
                    fortifications, which were dismantled shortly after 1813, have given place to
                    beautiful promenades; and even in the older parts of the town, where the streets
                    are generally narrow, there are <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0302-0259"/> several open spaces of considerable area. The old
                    cathedral (founded in the 12th century, and recently restored), the Catholic
                    church of the Holy Cross, the Protestant church of St Elizabeth—with its lofty
                    tower, the Jewish synagogue, and the bishop’s palace are the principal
                    ecclesiastical buildings. The <hi rend="italic">Pathhaus</hi> (a fine specimen
                    of the architecture of the 14th century), the townhouse (of quite recent
                    erection), the royal palace (now used as the Government buildings), the chamber
                    of the states, the exchange, the barracks, the theatre, the post-office, and the
                    new court-house and prison are the more important of the secular structures. At
                    the head of the educational institutions for which Breslau is celebrated stands
                    the university, which was founded in 1702 by Leopold I. as a Jesuit college, and
                    was greatly extended by the incorporation of the university of Frankfort-on-Oder
                    in 1811. Its library contains upwards of 300,000 volumes; and among its
                    auxiliary establishments are botanic gardens, an observatory, an anatomical and
                    an antiquarian museum. In 1873 its professors and teachers numbered 103, and its
                    students 962, the majority in the Faculty of Arts. Among the minor institutions
                    are four gymnasiums, a higher girls’ school, a normal school, a school of arts
                    and manufactures, several orphanages, a deaf and dumb institute, and a blind
                    asylum. There are also seventeen hospitals and numerous charitable foundations.
                    The town is the seat of several provincial courts, a chamber of mines, an*
                    independent Roman Catholic bishopric, and a Protestant consistory. Its
                    manufactures, which are both varied and extensive, comprise machinery and tools,
                    railway carriages, cast-iron goods, gold and silver -work, carpets, woollen
                    cloth, cotton goods, paper, and musical instruments. A very active export trade
                    is carried on; and a number of large fairs for particular kinds of goods are
                    held every year. The popula tion, which was 110,702 in 1849, had increased to
                    171,926 in 1867, when about 33 per cent, was Roman Catholic, 58 Protestant, and
                    7 Jewish. In 1871 the total amounted to 207,977.</p>
                <p>Breslau (Latin, <hi rend="italic">Vratislaυia)</hi> is first mentioned by Ditmar,
                    the chronicler, in 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>; and its foundation seems
                    to be of slightly earlier date. It became the seat of a bishop in 1052, and the
                    capital of an independent duchy in 1163. In 1241 it was reduced to ashes by the
                    Mongolian invaders; but it soon recovered its prosperity, and, its population
                    becoming largely Germanized, it joined the Hanseatic League in 1261. On the
                    death of Henry, the last duke, in 1335, the lordship of Breslau passed to the
                    Bohemian crown; and several of the Bohemian kings bestowed numerous privileges
                    on the city, which began to extend its commerce in all directions,— to Russia
                    and Tartary, Greece and Italy, the Netherlands and Flanders. Under the stimulus
                    of prosperity the citizens soon showed themselves disposed to assert their
                    independence, both against the aristocratic element within their walls, and
                    against their feudal superiors without. From 1482 to 1490 they suffered severely
                    from the oppressive measures of Stein, the minister of their king, Corvinus of
                    Hungary, whom they had prefeιτed to George Podiebrad of Bohemia. After the
                    battle of Mohacz, Breslau passed with the rest of Silesia to the house of
                    Austria, in whose possession it continued till 1741, when it was captured by
                    Frederick II. of Prussia. In 1757 it was retaken by the Austrians under Charles
                    of Lorraine, but in the same year the Prussians again made good their claim by
                    force of arms, and took no fewer than 21,000 men prisoners. The attempt of
                    Laudon in 1760 to surprise the city was a failure. It was forced, however, after
                    a lengthened siege to yield to the French in 1806-7. Their subsequent investment
                    of it in 1813 was interrupted by the peace.</p>
