                <p><label type="entry">BORDEAUX</label>, one of the finest and wealthiest commercial
                    cities of France, formerly the capital of Guienne and Bordelais, and now the
                    chief town of the department of Gironde. It is situated 370 miles S.E. of Paris,
                    in 44° 50' N. lat. and 0° 25 ’ W. long., on the left bank of the Garonne, about
                    60 or 70 miles from its mouth, and in the midst of an extensive plain which
                    comprises the district of Médoc, well-known for its red wines. Opposite the town
                    the river makes a semicircular curve, and widens out into an extensive basin,
                    which serves as a harbour, and is lined with quays on both sides for a distance
                    of three miles. Vessels of 800 tons can come up to the town, and ships of the
                    greatest ordinary tonnage have depth enough as far as Pauillac, about 35 miles
                    from the mouth of the river. The basin is crossed by a magnificent stone bridge
                    of 17 arches, 1534 feet long, which was built in 1821, and remained in the hands
                    of a company till 1861 when it was declared free. A short distance further up
                    the river is spanned by a railway bridge. Few cities in Europe can show such a
                    striking water-front as Bordeaux; and though the streets of the older part are
                    narrow and mean, those of the newer portions are wide and well paved, and
                    contain handsome houses and public buildings. The principal square is the Place
                    des Quinconces, which is adorned with statues of Montaigne and Montesquieu.
                    Among the ecclesiastical buildings the most important are the cathedral of Saint
                    André, a fine Gothic structure with two spires 160 feet high; the church of
                    Saint Michel, founded in 1160, and formerly remarkable for a spire 319 feet in
                    height, destroyed by a storm in 1768; Saint Croix, probably in existence before
                    the 7th century, restored in 1864-5; Saint Paul, built by the Jesuits in 1676;
                    and the church of the Collège Royal, in which is the tomb of Montaigne. The
                    great intellectual activity of the city may be seen from the fact that it
                    possesses an academy (with faculties of theology, law, science, and literature),
                    a medico-pharmaceutical school, a lyceum, a school for deaf-mutes, a normal
                    school, and a school of navigation; numbers among its societies an academy of
                    sciences, arts, and belles lettres, a medical society (founded in 1798), an
                    agricultural society, a philomathic, a Linnaean, a horticultural, and an
                    archaeological society; and maintains nine daily papers, about as many weeklies,
                    and two or three monthly periodicals, besides the official publications of
                    several of the above-mentioned societies. Its communal library, which dates from
                    1566, contains about 200,000 volumes; and it has also an antiquarian museum, a
                    museum of natural history, and a picture gallery. Among its benevolent
                    institutions are the hospital of Saint André, founded in 1825 to replace an
                    older building of the same name, which dated from 1390, a children’s hospital,
                    originated in 1619, a hospital for incurables, a maternity and a military
                    hospital, the lock hospital of Saint Jean, and a magnificent deaf and dumb
                    asylum. Of theatres there are five,—the Grand Théâtre, finished in 1780 and
                    seated for 1300; the Théâtre Louit, opened in 1868, for 2500; the Théâtre
                    Français, dating from 1857, for 1300; the Théâtre National, opened in 1866, for
                    1000; and the Théâtre des Folies Bordelaises built in 1872. A few buildings are
                    of merely antiquarian interest, the most important being the Palais Gallien,
                    which is really an old Roman amphitheatre of the 3d century, and the tower of
                    Pey Berland. Bordeaux is the seat of an archbishop, and has a court of appeal, a
                    court of assize, and tribunals of primary instance and commerce. It has also a
                    mint, the coinage of which is marked by the letter K. Its commercial
                    institutions are necessarily numerous and varied; comprising an exchange, banks,
                    insurance-offices, custom <pb break="no"

                    some forty different countries. The trade is very extensive, particularly in
                    wines, and has undergone a remarkable development since the introduction of
                    railways and steamships. For a long time Bordeaux was greatly indebted to the
                    Languedoc canal, but this means of communication is now of minor importance. The
                    toial value of the export and import trade is annually about £16,500,000, about
                    a third belonging to Britain. In 1872 the value of Bordeaux wines exported from
                    France was upwards of £5,600,000, and the brandy and liqueurs from Bordeaux
                    itself annually produce about £1,000,000. The other articles exported comprise
                    corn, fruits, sugar, wood, resin, rags, madder, tartar, gums, indigo, and native
                    manufactures. Shipbuilding is a leading industry, the number of firms in that
                    department being about twenty in 1875. In the same year 220 vessels belonged to
                    the port, with a total tonnage of upwards of 92,000 English tons.</p>
                <p>Bordeaux, or <hi rend="italic">Burdigala,</hi> was originally the chief town of
                    the Bituriges Vivisci. Under the Roman empire it became a flourishing commercial
                    city, and in the 3d century it was made the capital of Aquitania Secunda.
                    Ausonius, a writer of the 4th century, who was a native of the place, describes
                    it as four-square and surrounded with walls and lofty towers, and celebrates its
                    importance as one of the greatest educational centres of Gaul. In the evils that
                    resulted from the disintegration of the empire Bordeaux had its full share, and
                    did not recover its prosperity till the beginning of the 10th century. Along
                    with Guienne it belonged to the English kings for nearly three hundred years
                    (1154-1452), and was for a time the seat of the brilliant court of the Black
                    Prince, whose son Richard was born in the city. An extensive commerce was
                    gradually developed between the Bordeaux merchants and their fellowsubjects in
                    England,—London, Hull, Exeter, Dartmouth, Bristol, and Chester being the
                    principal ports with which they traded. For full details regarding the character
                    of the traffic and its influence on the destinies of the city the reader may

                    salt-tax by force of arms, a pardonable rebellion for which they were punished
                    by Montmorency with merciless severity. At a later period they held out for the
                    Frondeurs against the royal army under Louis XIV. and Richelieu, with an
                    obstinacy that brought the monarch and his minister to a humbler mood. During
                    the Reign of Terror the city suffered almost as severely as Lyons and
                    Marseilles, and its commerce was greatly reduced under Napoleon I. In 1814 it
                    declared for the House of Bourbon; and Louis XVIII. afterwards gave the title of
                    duke of Bordeaux to his grandnephew, better known as the Count de <pb break="no"
