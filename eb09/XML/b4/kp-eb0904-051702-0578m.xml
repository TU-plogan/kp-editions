                    Doctors” of the law school of Bologna. He is sometimes erroneously called
                    Bulgarinus, which was properly the name of a jurist of the 15th century.
                    Bulgarus was a native of Bologna, and was regarded as the Chrysostom of the
                    Gloss-writers, being frequently designated by the title of the “Golden Mouth”
                    <hi rend="italic">(os</hi><hi rend="italic">aureum).</hi> The time of his birth
                    is not known. A popular tradition represents him to have been a pupil of
                    Irnerius, but unfortunately nothing is known of Irnerius after 1118 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Bulgarus, on the other hand, died in 1166 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> having attained a great age, and having become
                    childish before his death. There is thus no inseparable difficulty in point of
                    time in accepting this tradition as far as regards Bulgarus, although Savigny
                    considers the general tradition to be inadmissible which represents all the Four
                    Doctors to have been pupils of Irnerius. Martinus Gosia was the next most
                    celebrated of the Four Doctors. He and Bulgarus were the chiefs of two opposite
                    schools at Bologna, corresponding in many respects to the Procubans and
                    Sabinians of Imperial Rome, Martinus being at the head of a school which
                    accommodated the law to what his opponents styled the equity of “the purse” <hi
                    rend="italic">{cequitas</hi><hi rend="italic">bursalis),</hi> whilst Bulgarus
                    adhered more closely to the letter of the law. The school of Bulgarus ultimately
                    prevailed, and it numbered amongst its adherents Joannes Bassianus, Azo, and
                    Accursius, each of whom in his turn exercised a commanding influence over the
                    course of legal studies at Bologna. Bulgarus took the leading part amongst the
                    Four Doctors at the diet of Roncaglia in 1158, and was one of the most trusted
                    advisers of the Emperor Frederick I. His most celebrated work is his commentary
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Regulis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Juris,</hi> which was at one time printed amongst the writings of Placentinus,
                    but has been properly reassigned to its true author by Cujacius, upon the
                    internal evidence contained in the additions annexed to it, which are
                    undoubtedly from the pen of Placentinus. Saviguy considers this <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentary,</hi> which is the earliest extant work of its kind
                    emanating from the school of the Gloss-writers, to be a model specimen of the
                    excellence of the method introduced by Irnerius, and a striking example of the
                    brilliant results which had been obtained in a short space of time by a '
                    constant and exclusive study of the sources of law.</p>
