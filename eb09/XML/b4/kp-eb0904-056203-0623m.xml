                    Session, with the title of Lord Crimond. Gilbert, the youngest son, was at ten
                    years of age sent to Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he was admitted A. Μ.
                    before he was fourteen years of age. His own inclination led him to the study of
                    the civil and feudal law; but he afterwards changed his views, and, to the great
                    satisfaction of his father, began to apply to divinity. He received ordination
                    before the age of eighteen; and Sir Alexander Burnet, his cousin-german, offered
                    him a benefice, which, however, he refused to accept.</p>
                <p>In 1663, about two years after the death of his father, he went to England; and
                    after six months stay at Oxford and Cambridge, returned to Scotland, which he
                    soon left again to make a tour of some months, in 1664, in Holland and France.
                    At Amsterdam, by the help of a Jewish rabbi, he perfected himself in the Hebrew
                    language; and likewise became acquainted with the leading men of the different
                    persuasions tolerated in that country—Calvinists, Arminians, Lutherans,
                    Anabaptists, Brownists, Papists, and Unitarians. In each of these sects he used
                    frequently to declare he met with men of such unfeigned piety and virtue that be
                    became fixed in a strong principle of universal charity, and an invincible
                    abhorrence of all severities on account of religious dissensions.</p>
                <p>Upon his return from his travels he was admitted minister of Saltoun, in which
                    station he served five years in the most exemplary manner. He drew up a
                    memorial, in which he took notice of the principal errors in the conduct of the
                    Scottish bishops, which he observed not to be conformable to the primitive
                    institution, and he sent a copy of it to several of them. This exposed him to
                    their resentment; but to show he was not actuated by a spirit of ambition, he
                    led a retired course of life for two years, which so endangered his health that
                    he was obliged to abate his excessive application to study. In the year 1668 he
                    was appointed professor of divinity in the university of Glasgow; and, according
                    to the usual practice, he read his lectures in the Latin language. It was
                    apparently at this period that he laid the chief foundation of that theological
                    learning for which he became so distinguished. In 1669 he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Modest and Free Conference between a Conformist and
                    Nonconformist.</hi> He became acquainted with the duchess of Hamilton, who
                    communicated to him all the papers belonging to her father and her uncle; upon
                    which he drew up the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Dulces of Hamilton,</hi>
                    afterwards printed at London, in folio, in the year 1677. The duke of
                    Lauderdale, hearing that he was engaged in this work, invited him to London, and
                    introduced him to Charles II. He returned to Scotland, and married Lady Margaret
                    Kennedy, daughter of the earl of Cassillis, a lady of great knowledge, and
                    highly esteemed by the Presbyterians, to whose sentiments she was strongly
                    inclined. As there was some disparity in their ages, that it might be <pb

                    owing to inclination, and not to avarice or ambition, the day before their
                    marriage he delivered to the lady a deed, by which he renounced all pretensions
                    to her fortune, which was very considerable, and must otherwise have fallen into
                    his hands, she herself having no intention to secure it. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vindication of the Authority, Constitution, and Laws of the Church and State of
                    Scotland</hi> was printed at Glasgow, in 8vo, in the year 1673. This was
                    considered so material a service to the Government, that he was offered a
                    bishopric, with a promise of the next vacant archbishopric; but he did not
                    accept of it, because he could not approve of the measures of the court, the
                    great aim of which he perceived to be the advancement of popery. The publication
                    itself was one of those which the author could not afterwards recollect with
                    much satisfaction.</p>
                <p>His intimacy with the dukes of Hamilton and Lauderdale procured <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> him frequent messages from the king and the duke of
                    York, who had conversations with him in.private. But Lauderdale, who was the
                    most unprincipled man of the age, conceiving a resentment against him on account
                    of the freedom with which he spoke to him, represented at last to the king that
                    Dr Burnet was engaged in an opposition to his measures; and on his return to
                    London he perceived that these suggestions had entirely deprived him of the
                    king’s favour, though the duke of York treated him with greater civility than
                    ever, and dissuaded him from going to Scotland. He accordingly resigned his
                    professorship at Glasgow, and settled in London. About this time the living of
                    Cripplegate being vacant, the dean and chapter of St Paul’s (in whose gift it
                    was), hearing of his circumstances, and the hardships which he had undergone,
                    made him an offer of the benefice; but, as he had been informed of their first
                    intention of conferring it on Dr Fowler, he generously declined it. In 1675, at
                    the recommendation of Lord Hollis, whom he had known in France as ambassador at
                    that court, he was appointed preacher at the Rolls chapel, by Sir Harbottle
                    Grimstone, master of the rolls, notwithstanding the opposition of the court; and
                    he was soon afterwards chosen lecturer at St Clement’s, and became one of the
                    most popular preachers in town. The first volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Reformation of the Church of England</hi> was published in folio
                    in 1681, the second in 1683, and the third in 1715. For this great work he
                    received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament. Of the first two volumes he
                    published an abridgment in the year 1683.</p>
                <p>In 1682, when the administration was changed in favour of the duke of York, being
                    much resorted to by persons of all ranks and parties, in order to avoid
                    returning visits, he built a laboratory, and for above a year pursued a course
                    of chemical experiments. Not long after he refused a country living of £300 a
                    year offered him by the carl of Essex on condition that he should reside in
                    London. When the inquiry concerning the popish plot was on foot he was
                    frequently sent for and consulted by the king, who offered him the bishopric of
                    Chichester, then vacant, if he would engage in his interests; but he refused to
                    accept it on these terms. He preached at the Rolls till 1684, when he was
                    dismissed by order of the court.</p>
                <p>On the accession of James II. to the throne, having obtained leave tc quit the
                    kingdom, he first went to Paris, and lived in great retirement, till,
                    contracting an acquaintance with Brigadier Stouppe, a Protestant gentleman in
                    the French service, he made a tour with him into Italy. He met with an agreeable
                    reception at Rome. Pope Innocent XI. hearing of his arrival, sent the captain of
                    the Swiss guard to acquaint him he would give him a private audience in bed, to
                    avoid the ceremony of kissing his holiness’s slipper; but Dr Burnet excused
                    himself as well as he could. Here, with more zeal than prudence, he engaged in
                    some religious disputes; and, on receiving an intimation from Prince Borghese,
                    he found it necessary to withdraw from this stronghold of priestcraft, and
                    pursued his travels through Switzerland and Germany. He afterwards came to
                    Utrecht, with an intention to settle in some of the seven provinces. There he
                    received an invitation from the. prince and princess of Orange (to whom their
                    party in England had recommended him) to come to the Hague, and accepted the
                    invitation. He was soon made acquainted with the secret of their councils, and
                    advised the preparation of a fleet in Holland sufficient to support their
                    designs and encourage their friends. His known share in the councils of the
                    Prince of Orange, and the pamphlets which he sent over to England, excited
                    against him the intensest enmity of James. A prosecution for high treason was
                    commenced against him both in England and Scotland; but having received the
                    intelligence before it was announced to the States he avoided the storm by
                    petitioning for, and obtaining without any difficulty, a bill of naturalization,
                    in order to his intended marriage with Mary Scott, a Dutch lady of considerable
                    fortune.</p>
                <p>Being now legally under the protection of Holland, he omitted no opportunity of
                    supporting and promoting the design which the prince of Orange had formed of
                    delivering Great Britain; and, having accompanied him in the capacity of
                    chaplain, he was in the year 1689 advanced to the see of Salisbury. He declared
                    for moderate measures with regard to the clergy who scrupled to take the oaths,
                    and many were displeased with him for advocating the toleration of
                    Nonconformists. “As my lord of Salisbury,” says the earl of Shaftesbury, “has
                    done more than any man living for the good and honour of the Church of England
                    and the Reformed religion, so he now suffers more than any man from the tongues
                    and slander of those ungrateful churchmen; who may well call themselves by that
                    single term of distinction, having no claim to that of Christianity or
                    Protestant, since they have thrown off all the temper of the former, and all
                    concern or interest with the latter.” The same noble writer has elsewhere
                    mentioned him in the following terms of commendation :—“The bishop of
                    Salisbury’s <hi rend="italic">Exposition of the Articles</hi> is, no doubt,
                    highly worthy of your study. None can better explain the sense of the church
                    than one who is the greatest pillar of it since the first founders,—one who best
                    explained and asserted the Reformation itself, was chiefly instrumental in
                    saving it from Popery before and at the Revolution, and is now the truest
                    example of laborious, primitive, pious, and learned episcopacy.”<note

                <p>In 1698 he lost his wife by the small-pox; and as he was almost immediately after
                    appointed preceptor to the duke of Gloucester, of whose education he took great
                    care, this employment, and the tender age of his children, induced him the same
                    year to supply her loss by a marriage with Mrs Berkeley, a widow, who was eldest
                    daughter of Sir Richard Blake. In 1699 he published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exposition of the Thirty-nine Articles,</hi> which occasioned a charge against
                    him in the Lower House of Convocation in the year 1701, but he was vindicated in
                    the Upper House. His speech in the House of Lords in 1704 against the Bill to
                    prevent occasional conformity was severely attacked. He <pb break="no"

                    which he pressed forward with such success, that an Act of Parliament was passed
                    in the second year of Queen Anne, for the augmentation of the livings of the
                    poor clergy. He died in 1715, and was interred in the church of St James’s,
                    Clerkenwell, where a monument was erected to his memory.</p>
                <p>Bishop Burnet’s <hi rend="italic">History of his Own Time,</hi> consisting of two
                    large volumes in folio, was not published till several years after the author’s
                    death; the first volume appeared in 1724, and the second in 1734. An account of
                    his life was added by his youngest son Sir Thomas Burnet, one of the judges of
                    the Court of Common Pleas. The <hi rend="italic">History</hi> itself was not
                    printed without mutilations; but after an interval of nearly a century, an
                    edition containing all the passages which had formerly been suppressed, was
                    published under the superintendence of the learned Dr Routh. (Oxford, 1823, 6
                    vols. 8vo.) This is a work of great and intrinsic value; without it our
                    knowledge of the times would be exceedingly imperfect. His materials are not
                    always very carefully digested, and the style is sometimes supposed to be too
                    familiar; but these defects are abundantly compensated for by the copiousness of
                    his information, the benevolence of his sentiments, and the earnestness of his
                    manner. In general Burnet’s statements may be accepted with great confidence,
                    his judgment is always sound and sober, and he possesses considerable skill in
                    the delineation of character. The best editions of his two great works are— <hi
