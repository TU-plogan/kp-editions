                <p><label type="entry">BONAPARTE</label>, or, as it was originally spelled, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Buonaparte,</hi> the name of the Italian family from whom the
                    great Napoleon was descended. The father of the first emperor, Carlo Maria
                    Bonaparte, was born at Ajaccio in 1746. He was a lawyer by profession, and took
                    a vigorous part in Paoli’s insurrection. In 1781 he was one of the members of
                    the council of Corsican nobility; he also held the post of assessor of Ajaccio.
                    In 1785 he died of cancer in the stomach at Montpellier, whither he had removed
                    for his health. His wife, Letizia Ramolino, born in 1750, was celebrated for her
                    majestic beauty and resolute courage. She accompanied her husband through the
                    campaigns with Paoli, and in 1793 emigrated with her family to Marseilles, where
                    for a time she lived in great penury. After her son was made first consul she
                    removed to Paris; and, on the establishment of the empire, received the title of
                    Madame Mère. She cared little for display; and her frugal style of living
                    frequently displeased Napoleon. After the battle of Waterloo she took up her
                    abode in Rome, where she continued to reside till her death in 1836. Of her
                    large family of thirteen, eight survived their father and have become known in
                    history. These in order of age are—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph,</hi> the eldest son, born on the 7th January
                    1768. He was placed, along with his younger brother Napoleon, at the school of
                    Autun, from which the latter was soon afterwards withdrawn. On completing his
                    education he contemplated a military career, but, on the death of his father,
                    devoted himself to the cave of his family. He studied law at the University of
                    Pisa, and was received as an advocate in Corsica. He and his brother eagerly
                    embraced the revolutionary side; and in 1793 the whole family wero compelled to
                    emigrate to Marseilles. In the following year he married Mlle, Clary, daughter
                    of a rich merchant, whose younger sister afterwards became the wife of
                    Bernadotte. Two years later, when Napoleon was made general of the army of
                    Italy, Joseph accompanied him as commissary-general. In 1797 he was elected to
                    the Council of Five Hundred, and sent as ambassador to the Pope. On the
                    establishment of the consulate he was made councillor of state, and by his suave
                    and courteous manners rendered good diplomatic service. He conducted the
                    negotiations with the United States in 1800, concluded the Treaty of Luneville
                    in 1801, and was similarly engaged at the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. In 1805,
                    after refusing various posts offered by his brother, he was left in charge of
                    the Government during the war in Germany. In the following year, however, he was
                    compelled to take command of the army of Naples, and soon after he set out it
                    was announced to him that he must assume the throne of that kingdom. With
                    considerable reluctance he accepted the post, and soon found that, though
                    nominally king, he was really but the viceroy of his brother. He introduced many
                    reforms, most of which were well conceived, but which did not at all meet the
                    wishes of Napoleon, who looked upon Naples merely as a province of France, and
                    thought it <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n37/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0037-0028"/> useful only in so far as it contributed to the
                    support of his own power. The Neapolitans soon discovered that their king was
                    but a mouth-piece, and learned to despise him; and his rule was disturbed by
                    constant insurrections. In the beginning of 1808 Napoleon began to communicate
                    with his brother regarding the affairs of Spain; and finally, on the 10th May,
                    wrote to him that the Spanish throne was vacant, and that he had destined it for
                    him. Joseph, with many forebodings, was obliged to accept; and for a short time
                    matters seemed sufficiently smooth. But the smouldering discontent soon broke
                    out into open flame over the land, and the Spaniards, assisted by the British
                    and Portuguese, made a struggle for freedom. Joseph’s influence in the kingdom
                    was a nullity; the people had never accepted him, and Napoleon, by giving
                    absolute command to his various marshals, robbed his brother of all real power.
                    Thrice the new king was compelled to fly from Madrid, and it was with difficulty
                    that he escaped after the final battle of Vittoria. During the great struggle of
                    1814 Joseph acted as lieutenant-general of the empire, and as adviser-in-chief
                    to the empress-regent. Under his brother’s orders he sent off Maria Louisa and
                    her son to Blois when the allied army approached Paris; and it was on his
                    authority that Marmont treated for the capitulation of the city. For these acts
                    he has sometimes been blamed, but with scant justice. While Napoleon was in Elba
                    Joseph took up his residence in Switzerland; but he rejoined his brother in
                    Paris during the Hundred Days. After the abdication he had an interview with the
                    fallen emperor at the Isle of Aix, and generously offered to give up to him his
                    cwn means of escape. The proposal not being accepted, he sailed for America and
                    settled near Philadelphia, at Point-Breeze, on the banks of the Delaware. Here
                    he lived for some years under the title of Comte de Survilliers, endeared to the
                    inhabitants by his liberality and gracious manners. After the July revolution of
                    1830 he wrote a long and eloquent letter, advocating the claims of his nephew,
                    the duke of Reichstadt, to the French throne. Two years later he visited
                    England, where he resided for some years, and to which he paid a second visit in
                    1839 In 1841 he was permitted to enter Genoa and Florence where his wife
                    resided. In the latter city he died on the 28th July 1844. Joseph Bonaparte was
                    of a handsome figure and commanding presence; his manners were peculiarly suave
                    and courteous. Of all the brothers he seems to have been the only one personally
                    loved by Napoleon. His wife, the daughter of a Marseilles merchant, died on the
                    7th April 1845. The elder of his two daughters, Zenaide Charlotte Julie (born
                    1801, died 1854), was married to her cousin Charles Bonaparte, son of Lucien;
                    the younger, Charlotte (born 1802, died 1839), was married to Napoleon Louis,
                    second son of Louis Bonaparte.</p>

                    >Napoleon</hi> I.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lucien,</hi> Prince of Canino, was born at Ajaccio,
                    21st March 1775. He was educated at Autun, Brienne’ and Aix, and rejoined his
                    family in Corsica in 1792. Already imbued with the principles of the Revolution
                    he turned against Paoli when the latter declared against France, and was
                    spokesman of the deputation sent to Marseilles to solicit aid from the republic.
                    He did not ι eturn to Corsica, as the whole Bonaparte family soon afterwards
                    emigrated to France, and he obtained employment in the commissariat at Saint
                    Maximin. Here he married Mlle. Christine Boyer, of poor but good family, and
                    began to take the leading part in the popular meetings of the place. He was
                    elected president of the Republican committee of the town, and, by his
                    moderation and firmness, prevented excesses such as occurred in other parts of
                    the country. After the fall of Robespierre he was in danger of being taken for
                    one of his partisans, but resolutely maintained his ground, and declined to take
                    refuge in flight. In 1795 he left Saint Maximin for Saint Chamans, where he had
                    been appointed inspector of military stores, and where he was arrested and
                    confined for six months. His release was obtained through his brother’s
                    influence with Barras, and he retired for a time to Marseilles. In 1795 he was
                    made commissary to the army of the north, and spent some time at Brussels and in
                    Holland; but his heart was in the political warfare of Paris, and in 1796 he
                    obtained permission to resign. He had a short interview with Napoleon in Italy,
                    and spent the two succeeding years in Corsica. In 1798 he was elected deputy to
                    the Council of Five Hundred, and at once set off for Paris. He was an ardent
                    adherent of the constitution of 1795 (the year HI.), and sympathized rather with
                    the Abbé Sieyès than with the extreme party. His abilities were soon recognized:
                    he was an able and powerful speaker, with a calm courage that defied all popular
                    tumult. His house, also, was the resort of the best literary society of Paris.
                    It gradually became clear to him that the power of tlιe Directory was divided
                    and broken, and that a <hi rend="italic">couj) d’etat</hi> was required to
                    prevent another sanguinary revolution. There was but one man in a position to
                    effect this change—his brother Napoleon, whose unexpected arrival on the 10th
                    October 1799 was received with the utmost joy. A week after, Lucien was elected
                    president of the Council of Five Hundred. Careful preparations were made, and on
                    the 19th Brumaire the principles of the Revolution ceased to have a living
                    power. On that day the coolness, promptitude, and courage of Lucien alone
                    preserved Napoleon from destruction. He took part in preparing the new scheme of
                    government, and was appointed to succeed La Place as minister of the interior.
                    His competency for the post was undoubted, but differences with his brother had
                    already begun, and these were fomented by the treacherous Fouché; so that, in
                    little more than a year, he gave up office, and was sent as ambassador to Spain.
                    He succeeded in his negotiations, though not entirely to Napoleon’s
                    satisfaction, and after his return to Paris took an active part in the
                    arrangement of the Concordat and the establishment of a legion of honour. After
                    the consulate had been settled on Napoleon for life Lucien was made a senator,
                    and received the estate of Seppelsdorf. But his marriage in 1803 with the
                    beautiful Mme. Jouberthon w as displeasing to the First Consul, who already
                    contemplated royal alliances for his brothers. Lucien, who did not approve the
                    project of making the consulate hereditary, thought it advisable to leave
                    France, and settled first at Milan, but finally at Rome. He lived in great
                    magnificence, indulging his literary tastes, and apparently indifferent to the
                    growth of the imperial power. After the peace of Tilsit Napoleon had an
                    interview with him, and offered him a kingdom provided he would look upon it as
                    in all respects a province of the empire. Lucien refused, and his brother then
                    gave him to understand that he must quit the Continent. He withdrew from Rome,
                    and settled on the estate of Canino, whence he took his title of prince, but
                    soon came to the resolution of sailing for America. He embarked on the 1st
                    August 1810, was captured by an English cruiser, and was carried to England,
                    where for some time he was kept under surveillance in Ludlow Castle. He
                    afterwards purchased a house near London, in which he resided till 1814, when he
                    returned to Rome. In two letters to Elba he offered assistance to his brother;
                    and during the Hundred Days he sat in the Chamber of Peers as a French prince.
                    After Waterloo he advised Napoleon to dissolve the assemblies and proclaim
                    himself dictator, and it was on his recommendation that the second abdication
                    was made in favour of Napoleon’s son. All his efforts to obtain a <pb break="no"

                    from his brother on the 29th June, he left France. Arrested at Turin he was kept
                    for three months in confinement before he was suffered to settle again at Rome.
                    He passed the remainder of his life in Italy, surrounded by his family and
                    busily engaged in literary and antiquarian labours. The grounds around Canino
                    proved unusually rich in gems and Etruscan curiosities, of which a valuable
                    cabinet was formed. He died at Viterbo, 29th June 1840 Lucien was a man of high
                    abilities, resolute to his purpose, and of great courage and presence of mind He
                    was throughout his whole life a moderate or constitutional republican. As a
                    literary man he enjoys considerable distinction, though his great epic, <hi
                    rend="italic">Charlemagne (2</hi> vols. 4to, London, 1814), was a failure. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> unfortunately, have not been completed He was
                    twice married. By his first wife he had two daughters; by his second, four
                    daughters and four sons. Of the sons the eldest, Charles Lucien Jules Laurent
                    (born 1803, died 1857), prince of Canino, is distinguished as a naturalist, and
                    takes rank along with Wilson and Audubon. In 1822 he married his cousin,
                    Zenaide, daughter of Joseph Bonaparte, whom he joined in America. He remained
                    there till 1828, and gained high reputation by his works on American
                    ornithology. After his return to Italy he began the publication of a magnificent
                    work, <hi rend="italic">Iconografia della Fauna</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Italica,</hi> 3 vols., 1833-41. On his father’s death in 1840 he succeeded to
                    the title, and in 1847 began to interest himself in politics. He was ordered to
                    leave the Austrian territories for having introduced political matter into a
                    scientific congress, and in 1848-49 he took part on the Radical side in the
                    disturbances at Rome. Driven from that city by the arrival of French troops he
                    landed at Marseilles, but received an order to quit French territory. Not having
                    paid any attention to this he was seized and conducted under escort to Havre,
                    whence he was compelled to take ship for England. He returned once more to
                    Paris, but did not again interfere in politics. Of the other sons of Lucien,
                    Louis Lucien (born in 1813) has distinguished himself as a philologist, and is
                    known by his writings on the Basque language as well as on the dialects of Italy
                    and England; and Pierre Napoleon, commonly called Prince Pierre (born 1815), has
                    lived a troubled life of adventure in Italy, America, and France. In January
                    1870 he shot and mortally wounded the journalist Victor Noir, who had called
                    upon him to arrange preliminaries for a duel with Μ. Paschal Grousset. This
                    unfortunate affair did inconceivable harm to the Napoleonic cause. The prince
                    was found not guilty, but was ordered to indemnify the family of Noir. From that
                    time he took up his residence in London.</p>

                    1777. She married in 1797 Felix Bacciochi, captain of infantry, who was poor but
                    of good family. In 1805 Lucca and Piombino were erected into a principality for
                    her, and she gave such proofs of administrative ability as to be named the
                    Semiramis of Lucca. After the fall of Napoleon she lived for some time at Brunn,
                    and latterly at Santo Andrea near Trieste, where she died in 1820.</p>
                <p>V. Louis, the father of Napoleon III., was born at Ajaccio in 1778. He received
                    the greater part of his military education at the school of Chalons, and
                    accompanied his brother throughout the famous Italian campaigns. He
                    distinguished himself in various engagements, particularly at the battle of
                    Arcola, but manifested little enthusiasm for a military career. He took part in
                    the Egyptian expedition, and was sent back from Cairo to report the state of
                    affairs and solicit reinforcements. In 1802, with the greatest reluctance, for
                    ho was enamoured of another, he was prevailed on to marry Hortense Beauharnais.
                    J osephine’s daughter. The forced marriage proved exceedingly unhappy. After the
                    consulate he became geueral, and in 1804 was raised to the dignity of prince. He
                    was commissioned to organize the army of the north in 1805, and performed his
                    task to the complete satisfaction of Napoleon. Soon afterwards the
                    States-general of Holland sent a deputation to the emperor praying that one of
                    his brothers might be made their king. Louis, who was selected for this dignity,
                    consented with considerable reluctance, and was proclaimed on the 6th June 1806.
                    But when he had assumed the reins of government he manifested the warmest
                    interest in his new subjects. He procured the withdrawal of the French troops
                    from Holland, and formed a cabinet consisting almost entire! y of Dutch
                    notables. The decree blockading the British Isles was extremely offensive to him
                    in his new position, and he evaded it so far as possible. In 1807 the death of
                    his eldest son caused him to withdraw for a time to the south of France, and on
                    his return Hortense did not accompany him. The relations of the king with
                    Napoleon were anything but satisfactory. The emperor complained of not receiving
                    due assistance from Holland, and in 1809 sent Bernadotte to take command of the
                    army in that country. At the meeting of the two brothers in December 1809 there
                    was a bitter quarrel; and Louis, who felt that his country was looked on as
                    merely a province of the empire, was detained as a prisoner, while Holland was
                    overrun with French troops. Before obtaining his release he was compelled to
                    sign a new treaty with the emperor, which greatly curtailed his power. Matters
                    were not improved after his return to Amsterdam, and on the 1st July 1810 he
                    abdicated at Haarlem in favour of his elder son Napoleon Louis. He then set out
                    for Töplitz, where he resided with the assumed title of Comte de St Leu. His
                    kingdom was soon united to the empire, and no attention was paid to the
                    arrangement he had made. After the Russian campaign he offered his services to
                    his brother, and tried again, but in vain, to resume his power in Holland. In
                    1815 he instituted proceedings against his wife to obtain from her the custody
                    of his elder son, and gained his cause. He refused to take any part in the
                    Hundred Days, and settled in Rome, where he passed most of the remainder of his
                    life. His wife was reunited to him, but the death of his elder son, in 1831, was
                    a blow from which he never recovered. The unfortunate attempts of Louis Napoleon
                    at Strasburg and Boulogne also affected him deeply; and he in vain attempted to
                    procure his son’s liberation from the prison of Ham. After the escape of the
                    prince his father earnestly desired to see him, but passports for Italy could
                    not be granted. The disappointlnent was too much for Louis, who was seized with
                    apoplexy, and died on the 25th July 1846. His remains were conveyed to Saint Leu
                    in 1847. Louis was of a somewhat retiring and philosophic disposition, inclined
                    to rule well had he been permitted, and of decided literary tastes. He published
                    several works— <hi rend="italic">Marie,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou les

                    was married to General Leclerc, whom she accompanied in the same year to St
                    Domingo. Her husband died there of yellow fever in 1802, and she returned to
                    France. On the 28th August 1803 she was married, through her brother’s
                    influence, to Camillo, Prince Borghese, a wealthy Italian nobleman. It was not
                    long before they separated; and Pauline, with the rank of duchess of Guastalla,
                    lived in a style of easy magnificence. She was good tempered, <pb break="no"

                    although he had a great affection for her, banished her from court for her
                    insulting behaviour to Maria Louisa, Yet she joined him in the Isle of Elba in
                    1814, and would fain have accompanied him in his exile at St Helena. She was
                    reconciled to her husband shortly before her death on 9th June 1825 Pauline was
                    Napoleon’s favourite sister. She was extremely beautiful, and her statue as
                    Venus Victrix, by Canova, is a well-known work of art.</p>
                <p>VII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Marie Annonciade Caroline,</hi> born at Ajaccio 1782.
                    In 1800 she was married to Murat; in 180G she became grand-duchess of Berg and
                    of Cleves, and in 1808 queen of Naples. In 1815, after the flight of her
                    husband, she was compelled to leave the capital, and surrendered to the
                    Austrians. She was for a short time imprisoned at Trieste, and was then
                    permitted to reside at Haimburg near Vienna. She afterwards obtained leave to
                    take up her abode at Trieste with her sister Elisa. In 1838 she obtained a
                    pension from the French Government, but did not enjoy it long. She died on 18th
                    May 1839.</p>
                <p>VIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Jérôme,</hi> the youngest brother of Napoleon, was
                    born at Ajaccio in 1784. In 1800 he entered the navy, and served in the
                    Mediterranean, and under Villaret Joyeuse in the West Indies. In 1802-3 he was
                    recalled; but tne port in which his vessel lay being blockaded by the English
                    cruisers, he made his way to Boston, whence he intended to take a passage to
                    France. He was well received in the United States, and fell violently in love
                    with a beautiful young American, Miss Elizabeth Paterson, daughter of a
                    Baltimore merchant, whom he married on the 24th December 1803. He remained in
                    America till 1805. Meanwhile Napoleon, excessively displeased, had passed a
                    decree annulling the marriage, and declined to allow the lady to enter France
                    Jérôme’s submission was rewarded by high command in the navy, in which he showed
                    himself a competent officer. In 1806 he was made brigadier-general in the army,
                    and distinguished himself in Silesia. On the 8th July of the following year he
                    was made king of Westphalia; and, on the 22d August, he married the daughter of
                    Frederick king of Würtemberg. He accompanied Napoleon on the Russian campaign,
                    but was disgraced for apparent want of success in some engagement, and retired
                    to his kingdom. After the first abdication he lived for some time at Trieste,
                    but at once rejoined the emperor in 1815, and took a conspicuous part in the
                    hurried events of the Hundred Days. After Waterloo and the second abdication,
                    Jérôme retired to the kingdom of his father-in-law, where he lived in a species
                    of imprisonment. He moved afterwards to Trieste, Rome, Florence, and Lausanne,
                    and in 1847 was permitted to visit Paris. In the following year he was made
                    governor of the Invalides, and in 1850 marshal of France. In 1852 he was
                    president of the senate, but after that time he took no active part in politics,
                    He died on the 24th June 1860. Of his children the only one famous is Joseph
                    Charles Paul, commonly known as Prince Napoleon, born in 1822.</p>
