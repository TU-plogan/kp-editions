                    St Malo in 1772. From his father, who was also a physician, he received his
                    first instructions in medicine, and he studied for some years at the college of
                    Dinan. At the age of seventeen he entered one of the newly-formed republican
                    regiments, but ill health compelled him to withdraw after about two years. He
                    resumed his medical studies, and after passing some time in the hospitals of St
                    Malo and Bryt, obtained an appointment as surgeon in the navy. In 1799 he
                    proceeded to Paris, where in 1803 he graduated as M.D. In 1805 he again joined
                    the army in a professional capacity, and served in Germany, Holland, Italy, and
                    Spain. In 1814 he returned to Paris, and was appointed assistant-professor to
                    the Military Hospital of the Val-de-Grace, where he first promulgated his
                    peculiar doctrines. His theory, which strongly resembles that of John Brown,
                    points to excitation or irritation as the fundamental fact in life. He found the
                    principal cause of disease in over-irritation, which, primarily local, extends
                    itself through sympathy to the other organs of the body, as in fever. His
                    lectures were attended by great numbers of students, who received with the
                    utmost enthusiasm the new theories which he propounded. In 1816 he published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Examen</hi><hi rend="italic">de la doctrine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">médicale généralement adoptée,</hi> which drew down upon its
                    author the hatred of the whole medical faculty of Paris. By degrees his
                    doctrines triumphed; and were adopted in the writings and practice of the best
                    physicians, and even in the medical school itself, long before their propounder
                    held office in that institution. In 1831 he was appointed professor of general
                    pathology in the academy of medicine, and taught with great applause till his
                    death in 1838. The recent development of physiological science has shown that
                    his theories are but partially true, and are of little value as a general
                    explanation of disease. Of his works, which are very numerous, the most
                    important are the <hi rend="italic">Examen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De l</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">Irritation</hi><hi rend="italic">et de la Folie.</hi></p>
