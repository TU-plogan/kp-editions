                <p><label type="entry">BOTHWELL, <hi rend="smallcaps">James Hepburn, Earl
                    of</hi></label>, in the peerage of Scotland, only son of Patrick, third earl of
                    Bothwell, was born about 1526. Nothing is known of his life up to the date of
                    his father’s death, 1556, when he was served heir to his vast estates. For the
                    next few years notices of his doings are few and obscure; he undoubtedly held
                    posts of high dignity, such as the wardenship of the Scottish Borders, and the
                    office of Lord Admiral; and it is certain that he was a vigorous opponent αf the
                    “lords of the congregation.” In the end of 1560 he appears to have been one of
                    the lords who went over to France to meet their new queen (Mary). In 1562
                    occurred the singular and obscure episode of the conspiracy between Bothwell and
                    Arran to carry off the queen. Arran was well known to be deeply enamoured of
                    Mary, and Bothwell apparently intended to use this passion as a means of
                    furthering his own designs against Murray. The plot, or the germ of it was
                    discovered; Arran was found to be all but insane, and an indictment was laid
                    against Bothwell, who fled to France and remained there till 1565, when he
                    returned to Scotland. The charge, however, was not forgotten; it was renewed by
                    the earl of Murray, and the day of trial was fixed. But Murray’s forces were too
                    numerous to make it safe for Bothwell to make his appearance, and he again fled.
                    He reappeared at court in a short time after the marriage of the queen with
                    Darnley, and began to rise rapidly into favour. He escaped from the palace after
                    the murder of Rizzio, and with great promptitude drew together some forces for
                    the queen’s defence. From this time onwards he was in the highest favour with
                    the queen, and all powerful at court. In 1566 he was dangerously wounded when on
                    a judicial tour in Liddesdale. Here the queen paid him a visit, riding all the
                    way from Jedburgh, where she was holding a justice eyre. The fatigues of this
                    ride of forty miles brought on a severe illness, during which her life was
                    despaired of. After her recovery the project of a divorce from Darnley was
                    mooted, but was declined by her, and Bothwell seems then to have resolved on the
                    removal of her husband by any mea∩3. On the evening of the 9th of February the
                    famous crime was committed of Darnley’s murder. Public opinion, expressing
                    itself in placards and outcries, fastened the guilt upon Bothwell and his
                    associates, but he was too powerful to be dealt with by the law. On the 24th
                    April he played his last move, carrying off Mary to Dunbar Castle, which had
                    been granted him by the Queen. A divorce from his former wife was easily
                    procured, the dispensation in their favour not being produced at the trial, and
                    on the 15 th May the royal marriage was completed. Mary had a few days
                    previously pardoned Bothwell for his abduction of her, and had raised him to the
                    rank of duke of Orkney. The fancied security in which they passed the few days
                    after their marriage was soon and rudely dispelled. The great lords collected
                    their forces and seized Edinburgh, Bothwell and the queen escaping with the
                    greatest difficulty to Dunbar. At Carberry Hill the opposing parties met; Mary
                    surrendered to the lords, and Bothwell fled to Dunbar and thence to Orkney.
                    Being cloeely pursued he took ship, was captured by a Danish cruiser, and
                    confined for a time at Copenhagen. He was removed to Malmö and afterwards to
                    Draxholm Castle, where he died in 1575. He is said to have made a death-bed
                    confession exonerating the queen, but the authenticity of the report is more
                    than doubtful. There is hardly a redeeming point in Bothwell’s character; he was
                    utterly selfish and brutal, and did not even treat with courtesy or kindness the
                    woman who had risked so much for his sake. (See Tytler and Burton’s histories of
