                    exhibited. The more simple the system the better; but care must be taken that
                    the plan adopted is sufficiently comprehensive and explanatory, to satisfy not
                    only the person keeping the books, but those who may have occasion to refer to
                    them; for, however satisfactory it may be to a trader to follow a system which
                    is intelligible to himself alone, circumstances might arise to render the
                    inspection of others necessary, and from their inability to follow out
                    transactions in the books, suspicions would probably be engendered for which
                    there was no real foundation. Hence the necessity for the adoption of certain
                    recognized and approved systems, which, being plain and easily understood, must
                    prove satisfactory to all concerned.</p>
                <p>Book-keeping, when conducted upon sound principles, is invaluable; it not only
                    shows the general result of a commercial career, but admits of analysis, by
                    which the success or failure, the value or utter worthlessness of its component
                    parts, or each particular transaction, can be easily ascertained. In a word, on
                    the one baud it promotes order, regularity, fair dealing, and honourable
                    enterprise; on the other, it defeats dishonesty, and preserves the integrity of
                    man when dealing with his fellows.</p>
                <p>It would be difficult, and perhaps of little importance, to trace the origin of
                    book-keeping. It was certainly known to the ancients (see Pliny, lib. ii. cap.
                    7); and Cicero seems to have had bill transactions between Rome and Athens when
                    he arranged for his son’s education without the necessity of having to remit
                    money (see <hi rend="italic">Epis,</hi><hi rend="italic">ad Att.</hi> xii. 24;
                    xv. 25), which infers some kind of bookkeeping. Kelly, however, who wrote on the
                    subject in 1805, asserts, and it is not disputed, that a friar, named Lucas di
                    Borgo, whose work on algebra was the first to appear in print, was the first to
                    write a treatise upon book-keeping, and this was published at Venice in
                    1495.</p>
                <p>This work was followed by many others, possessing considerable merit, but so
                    complex as to make them useless. After a time the mercantile community became
                    alive to the fact that a practical system would be preferable to the theoretical
                    suggestions of writers who were utterly ignorant of commercial matters; and men,
                    more or less connected with trade, began to write on the subject. The incubus of
                    prolixity, however, still clung to them, conciseness of style seeming an
                    impossibility, and the great fundamental principles of the art were so smothered
                    by rules and explanations—the volumes sometimes containing 500 or 600 pages—that
                    the difficulty was how to apply them; hence the need of still greater simplicity
                    and improvement.</p>
                <p>In 1796 Mr E. T. Jones of Bristol devised a plan “for keeping books correctly,”
                    breaking the ice with a treatise which is still held in very high estimation.
                    After that a great improvement is visible in the writings of authors on this
                    important subject, as in those of Benjamin Booth (1789), Hamilton (1820), Jones
                    (2d treatise, 1821, 3d treatise, 1831), C. Morrison (1823), W. and R. Chambers,
                    Edinburgh,—the most of them, those of Jones excepted, being elementary works,
                    more particularly adapted to schools, and illustrating the principles of the
                    science by the example of one set of books adapted to foreign trade. In F. H.
                    Carter’s <hi rend="italic">Practical Book-keeping, adapted to Commercial and
                    Judicial Accounting</hi> (3d ed. 1875), which gives a great variety of forms and
                    sets of books, the recognized <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0054-0045"/> systems of book-keeping are practically applied,
                    so as to enable any one, without difficulty, to acquire a thorough knowledge of
                    the science.</p>
                <p>The questions to which a satisfactory system of bookkeeping gives the trader
                    ready and conclusive answers are such as relate—1. To the extent to which his
                    capital and credit will entitle him to transact business; 2. To the assurance he
                    has that all his obligations are honestly fulfilled; 3. To the ascertainment of
                    the success or failure of his commercial dealings, and the position of his
                    affairs from time to time.</p>
                <p>There are three recognized systems of book-keeping, namely, by “single entry,”
                    “double entry,” and the “mixed method.”</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Single Entry.</hi> —This system is denoted by its name,
                    transactions being posted singly, or only once, in the ledger. Three books are
                    generally kept—the cash book, day book, and ledger, although the first-named is
                    not essential, the cash entries being passed through the day book. Tts only use
                    is to check the balance of cash in hand. In the day book are entered daily all
                    the purchases and sales, whether for cash or credit; and all the credit entries
                    arc then transferred to accounts opened in the ledger, that is, all goods sold
                    on credit are charged against the customers, and what are purchased are carried
                    to the credit of parties supplying them. In the same way, when cash is received
                    from a customer for goods sold on credit, it is posted to his account, and the
                    reverse entry is made when a trader pays for the goods he has bought. Thus it
                    will be seen that only personal accounts are entered in the ledger.</p>
                <p>To frame a balance sheet, or state of affairs, on this system, the book-keeper
                    brings down the balances due by customers to him, also his stock of goods as
                    valued, and the cash he may have in hand, on the <hi rend="italic">left-hand
                    side</hi> of the sheet; whilst on the <hi rend="italic">right-hand. side</hi> he
                    enters the balances still due by him for goods supplied, or money lent to him,
                    and the capital, if any, with which he commenced business. The difference
                    between the amounts of the two columns is either profit or loss; if profit, the
                    merchant’s capital is increased to that extent, and if loss, then he is so much
                    the poorer.</p>
                <p>The following skeleton balance sheet will give a better idea of the working and
                    ultimate results of the system :—</p>

                <p>It will be observed that as the assets exceed the liabilities (including capital)
                    by .£49-, 16s. 7d., that sum, being profit, must be added to capital; if, in the
                    next or following years, any loss should emerge, as a matter of course such
                    deficiency must be deducted from the trader’s capital The advantages of single
                    entry are simplicity and easy adaptation to small retail trades, as the ledger
                    contains only outstanding debts due to or by the trader. The disadvantage is in
                    the difficulty of ascertaining the profits or losses on various goods, or on the
                    several departments of a business.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Double Entry.</hi> —It is now universally admitted that
                    this system is the best adapted for heavy, responsible, or speculative trades,
                    for foreign trade especially, and for extensive mercantile concerns. As its name
                    implies, it so far differs from the system already described, that every
                    transaction must be recorded doubly in the ledger, that is to say, accounts must
                    be opened in that book, to which all entries in the subsidiary books, after
                    being journalized, are twice carried, to the debit of one account and the credit
                    of another. To illustrate this, let us assume that a merchant speculates in
                    cotton, and purchases so many bales from John Bevan and Co. upon credit ∙ he
                    debits “Cotton account,” and credits “John Bevan and Co.” He does not pay for it
                    in cash, but gives his bill at three months for the amount; John Bevan and Co.
                    are debited with the bill, and “Bills Payable” are credited. He then sells the
                    whole lot of cotton for cash to Cairns, Brown, and Co., debiting “Cash” and
                    crediting “Cotton account.” Lastly, he retires or pays the bill granted to John
                    Bevan and Co., debits “Bills Payable,” and credits “Cash.” We will now put all
                    these transactions into a “journal,” posting therefrom to a “ledger,” and so
                    illustrate book-keeping by double entry.</p>

                    entry is evident. For instance, “Cotton” account shows the actual result of the
                    speculation per “Mary Jane;” “John Bevan and Co.’s” account exhibits the whole
                    transaction with them, and how it was settled; “Bills Payable” account at once
                    shows that the cotton bill is retired or paid; and “Cash” account declares a
                    balance of £851 in cashier’s hands, being the actual profit on the cotton, as
                    further shown in “Profit and Loss” account.</p>
                <p>An infinity of examples might be given, but the above will be a sufficient
                    illustration. A brief outline, however, of the principal books required in this
                    system may be introduced.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Cash Book.</hi> —In this most important book every
                    cash transaction must be entered of its proper date, and under its distinctive
                    ledger heading, so as to give facility in journalizing; any balance thereon must
                    be cash in hand, and should agree with the balance on “Cash account” in the
                    ledger.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">2.</hi> The <hi rend="smallcaps">Day</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Waste Book.</hi> —This book records the daily transactions of
                    every description in the rough, which, when properly arranged and classified,
                    are written into the journal, and posted from thence to the ledgers.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Journal.</hi> —This may be called the mainspring of
                    the system, and is sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">‘‘posting
                    medium/’</hi> as in it every transaction of the business is properly recorded
                    before being again distributed into the ledger. There are several forms of
                    journal, but the simplest and best is that of which a specimen has been given,
                    with the addition of a column for the insertion of ledger folios when posted. It
                    will be observed that the debit entries are in one column and the credit entires
                    in another; if, therefore, the summations of these agree, and the entries
                    therein embraced are correctly posted to the debit and credit of accounts in the
                    ledger, the double entry is correct, and the books of the concern, no matter how
                    multitudinous the entires may be, must come to a true balance.</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Ledgers.</hi> —These are important books, as they arc
                    the final recipients of every transaction of the concern, branched out or
                    distributed into certain heads or accounts which tell their own history; and if
                    unbalanced, must exhibit a difference either in favour of the business as an
                    “Asset,” or against it as a “Liability.” The usual plan is to have only one
                    ledger, embracing every account, but in large concerns there are debit and
                    credit ledgers, and generally a private ledger, which is accessible to partners
                    only.</p>
                <p>The advantages of double entry are many—(l.) Unless the debit balances exactly
                    correspond w ith the credits the books are wrong, and the error must be
                    discovered by comparison; (2.) The discovery of such errors is more easily
                    accomplished than in any other system; (3.) Accounts can be readily analyzed;
                    and (4.) The profit or loss on distinct transactions can be ascertained without
                    difficulty. The disadvantages are—(1.) More manual labour required in
                    transcribing the journal and posting therefrom than in other systems; and (2.)
                    There is not the same privacy, as profits and losses can be seen at a glance by
                    any one having access to the ledger. Nevertheless, no other system as yet
                    devised can at all compare with that by double entry.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mixed Method.</hi> —This system is now extensively
                    adopted by such companies and firms as begrudge the time expended in
                    journalizing, and are of opinion that double entry is too elaborate, when the
                    same results can be arrived at by a more direct and less laborious plan. There
                    is this identity, however, between the systems, that every transaction must be
                    recorded somewhere, and eventually twice posted, as in double entry, but without
                    the medium of a journal; moreover, the entries are fewer, summations and not
                    specific items being posted, and what would be the daily labour under one system
                    is reserved under this for a monthly or perhaps longer period. There are only
                    three books required for this system to which we need draw attention, and in
                    doing so we will point out in what respect they differ from those kept in single
                    and double entries.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n56/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0056-0047"/>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cash Book.</hi> —Every entry is posted from this book,
                    but not all to the ledger as in double entry—“Charges” being posted to the day
                    book. It is not journalized, and is in itself a ledger, as it contains the bank
                    account, and reports its own cash balance. On the other hand, it is unlike the
                    “Cash” of single entry, because every entry is posted somewhere, whereas by the
                    latter system only personal accounts are carried to the ledger.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Day Book.</hi> —This book also exhibits a marked
                    difference between the journal of double entry and the day book of single entry.
                    The journal is simply a posting medium, and when its use is served is almost
                    valueless. The single entry day book, on the other hand, is only a posting
                    medium to a certain extent, as it does not embrace all transactions; but in this
                    system the day book unites the characteristics of journal and ledger, and also
                    becomes in itself a profit and loss account, as by deducting the amount of
                    charges from the amount of the business fees (say for solicitors’ books) the
                    profit on said business is shown.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Ledgers.</hi> —These books also lose their
                    completeness under the mixed method. It has already been shown that in double
                    entry every amount must appear in the ledger, and in single entry that only
                    personal accounts are posted in it. By this system not only are all personal
                    accounts included, but those applicable to “Capital,” to “Banks,” “Bills,”
                    &amp;c.; whilst, on the other hand, such accounts as “Profit and Loss,”
                    “Charges,” and “Cash” are excluded.</p>
                <p>It would be out of place here to dwell on the many intricacies of this subject,
                    or on the difficulties which are constantly presenting themselves even to the
                    most practical men. With a thorough knowledge of the art, however, and that
                    patience and perseverance so essential to the calling of a book-keeper, the
                    gravest impediments are overcome, and everything becomes simple and plain. Our
                    sole object having been to show the utility of book-keeping as a science, and
                    the peculiar features of existing systems with their advantages and
                    disadvantages, it is unnecessary to enter more minutely into details by
                    describing subsidiary books or forms of accounts, as these are only so many
                    materials out of which the fabric of. book-keeping is erected, and can be seen
                    in any counting-house or mercantile establishment where regular systems are
                    adopted, <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. h. c.)</hi></p>
