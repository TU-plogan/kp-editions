                <p>IN’ presenting an account of this extensive and important country, the only
                    American monarchy we shall give, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> a condensed view
                    of its physical geography, meteorology, and natural products; <hi rend="italic"
                    >secondly,</hi> a brief historical sketch of the progressive discovery of its
                    coasts and interior, of its gradual settlement, and of the auspices under which
                    its social institutions have developed themselves; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >thirdly,</hi> an account of its existing political and social condition.</p>
                <p>Brazil is bounded on the N. by Columbia or New Granada, Venezuela, and the
                    Guianas, British, French, and Dutch; on the E. by the Atlantic; on the S. by the
                    republics of Uruguay and the Argentine Confederation; and on the W. by Paraguay,
                    Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. It extends from about 4° N. lat. to 33° 41' <hi
                    rend="italic">S.</hi> lat., and from 35° to 70° W. long. Its greatest length is
                    about 2600 British miles, its greatest breadth about 2500; and it has a seaboard
                    of about 4000 miles.</p>
                <p>The original line of demarcation between the Portuguese and Spanish possessions
                    was fixed by two bulls of Pope Alexander VI., the one of the 2d, the other of
                    the 3d of May 1493. The kings of Castile and Portugal afterwards concluded the
                    treaty of Torrizillas, which was approved by the Pope in 1529. The reunion of
                    the two crowns in 1580 suspended all discussions about the boundaries. They,
                    however, recommenced after the revolution and independence of Portugal. The
                    treaty of Utrecht in 1777 regulated many points, but the treaties always
                    referred to rivers, mountains, and other positions passing through deserts, the
                    names of which were not well established. For sometime past the Government of
                    Brazil has taken great pains to establish amicably with the neighbouring states
                    the boundary lines of the empire. In 1851 these were established with the
                    republic of Uruguay, in 1857 with the Argentine Republic, in 1858 with Peru, in
                    1859 with Venezuela, in 1867 with Bolivia, and in 1872 with Paraguay; the lines
                    determined on have in some cases been already surveyed and marked out on the
                    actual frontier, while at present mixed commissions from Brazil and each
                    neighbouring country are employed in tracing out the other lines agreed
                    upon.</p>
                <p>With Uruguay the frontier has been marked out along a line passing from the coast
                    in 33° 4Γ S. lat., through the southern portion of Lake Mirim and along the
                    River Jaguarào, which falls into it, to its most southerly source stream, thence
                    by a line crossing the head of the Rio Negro to the dividing ridge called the
                    Cuchilla Sta. Anna, and afterwards down the stream of the Cuarein or Quarahim to
                    the River Uruguay.</p>
                <p>The Uruguay River, from the mouth of the Quarahim upwards to the confluence of
                    the Pepiry on its right bank in 27° 10' lat. divides Brazil from the Argentine
                    Republic, the remainder of the mutual frontier of these countries being formed
                    by the Pepiry to its source and the Sào Antonio from its rise to its union with
                    the Y-Guasu or Curityba, which river marks the boundary to the ParanA.</p>
                <p>Between Paraguay and Brazil the frontier runs from the mouth of the Υ-Guasù up
                    the Alto ParanA to the great fall of GuayrA, called Sete Quedas by the
                    Brazilians, and from that westward along the water-parting of the' Cordillera of
                    Maracajù, southward of the basin of the Igatimi, to the heights of Amambahy, and
                    along these to the source of the Rio Apa-Estrella, following it down hence to
                    the Paraguay.</p>
                <p>With Bolivia the boundary lies along the Rio Paraguay from the mouth of the Apa
                    in 22°, upwards to 20° 1 Γ, where the Bahia Negra joins it; along the Bahia
                    Negra, and thence in a line to the lake of CAceres, cutting through the midst of
                    this lagoon, and passing onward to Lakes Mandioré, Gaiba, and Uberaba, and from
                    the last to the south end of the ridge called Corixa Grande; from this in a
                    direct line to Morro de Buenavista (Boavista), and to the sources of the Rio
                    Verde; along the middle of that stream to its mouth in the Guapore, and along
                    that river and the Mamore to the Beni, where the Madeira begins in 10° 20' S.; a
                    direct line thence to the source of the Yavari River (found by Chandless in 1867
                    to be a little south of 7° S. lat.), forms the limit of Brazil with Northern
                    Bolivia and Central Peru. The Yavari continues the boundary between Brazil and
                    Peru down its channel to the confluence with the Amazon at Tabatinga, and the
                    limits commission has been at work during 187 4 and 1875 in determining the
                    position of this line. Farther on, the boundary of Brazil with Northern Peru has
                    been described as a line passing northward from Tabatinga towards the mouth of
                    the Rio Apaporis in the River Japura, the frontier with Peru terminating on this
                    line where it intersects the Rio Putumayo, and that with Ecuador beginning
                    there. From the mouth of the Apaporis the continuation of the limit with
                    Columbia or New Granada to that with Venezuela follows a line drawn along the
                    waterparting of the range called the Collina do Guaicia or Serra Aracuara, which
                    divides the streams flowing to the Guainia, or Rio Negro, above the CasiquiAre,
                    from those which join it below the anastomosis of that natural canal. This line
                    meets the Rio Negro about 20 miles below the separation of the CasiquiAre. From
                    the Sierra Cucuhy, or Pao d’Azucar, on the opposite or left bank of the Rio
                    Negro, the limit continues eastward over the level ground to the middle of the
                    natural canal called the MaturacA, which in times of flood unites the Cababoris
                    tributary of the Rio Negro with the Barria, a sub-tributary of the CasiquiAre
                    channel. Hence the limit is drawn from the MaturacA to the hill of Cupi, the
                    first of the long range of Serras which divide the waters flowing to the Amazon
                    from those tributary to the Orinoco, and those passing through British, Dutch,
                    and French Guiana to the Atlantic. This boundary follows the curves of the
                    water-parting eastward along the Serras named Guahy and Ucuruciro; northward on
                    those of Tapirapecô and Parima; eastward again along the Merevary and Pacaraima
                    heights; southward between the rivers Tacutu and Rupununy, and again generally
                    eastward along the Serras of Acarahy and Tucumuraque to the source of the River
                    Oyapok. This river, from its source to the Atlantic in 4° 22' N. lat., is the
                    present eastward limit of French Guiana. Several islets in the Atlantic belong
                    to Brazil; among them that of Fernando Noronha, 250 miles from Cape S. Roque,
                    high, and having about 6 square miles of area, is important as a penal
                    settlement of the empire.</p>
                <p>The immense territory comprised within the line just described and the Atlantic
                    is upwards of 3,288,000 English square miles in area, or not far short of the
                    extent of Europe.</p>
                <p>The great river of the lowlands of Brazil, the Amazon, has been called the
                    Mediterranean of South America, and is the largest stream <hi rend="superscript"
                    > -</hi> of the globe in every respect, affording, with its great tributaries,
                    free navigation over not less than 30,000 miles within Brazilian territory (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Amazon).</hi></p>
                <p>After the Amazon the Tocantins is the great river of the northern watershed of
                    Brazil. Rising in the Serra das Vertentes in Central Brazil, the Araguaya, its
                    longer head stream, and the Tocantins flow northward for 900 miles, separated by
                    the Cordillera Grande of Goyaz, and unite at about 300 miles from their wide
                    estuary, called the Rio ParA, formed between the island of Marajo and the
                    mainland<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n265/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0265-0222"/>. Midway in its course the Araguaya forms the
                    remarkable island called the Ilha Bananal or Santa Anna, which is encompassed by
                    branches of the river 220 miles in length, and contains a central lake of 80
                    miles in extent. The Araguaya is navigable, but the upper Tocantins is barred by
                    falls, and there is a rapid' at some distance below their confluence round which
                    a road has been recently made to unite the navigable portions.</p>
                <p>The Turyassù, Maranhao, and Paranahyba are the largest of the other rivers of the
                    north-eastern slope. The last named flows for the greater part of its course of
                    700 miles through level swampy lands, receiving many tributaries from eastward,
                    but few from the west; it is without obstructions, and navigable for a great
                    distance.</p>
                <p>The Säo Francisco occupies a wide enclosed basin of the eastern highland. Rising
                    in the Serra do Espinhaço and the Vertentes of Minas Geraes, it flows north and
                    eastward in a course of 1800 miles. But for a few obstacles the greater part of
                    the river would be navigable, since it has great volume. The chief barrier is in
                    the Falls of Paulo Affonso, about 168 miles from the sea, where the river is
                    contracted between rocks, and plunges in a series of cascades into a narrow
                    rock-impeded channel. Immediately below this, however, it spreads out as a broad
                    calm river, which is regularly navigated by steamers from the Porto das Piranhas
                    to the sea.</p>
                <p>Among the rivers of the coast slope south of the Sào Francisco the chief are the
                    Paraguasù, the largest stream of the province of Bahia, obstructed by many
                    falls; the Rio de Contas or Jussiapé, a considerable river in the south of the
                    province, also innavigable; the Belmonte or Jequitinhonlιa from the high
                    mountains of Minas Geraes, interrupted by many rapids and cascades, and forming
                    a series of magnificent falls over the eastern edge of the plateau, in which it
                    descends at least 300 feet; the Rio Doce or Chopotô in the province of Espiritu
                    Santo, affording a considerable length of navigation, with portages at its
                    reefs; and the Parahyba do Sul, flowing between the Serra da Mantiqueira and the
                    coast range of Rio de Janeiro, navigated regularly by steamers from its mouth
                    for 60 miles to Säo Fidelio. Though these coast streams are among the little
                    rivers of Brazil, every one of them is two or three times the length of the
                    Thames.</p>
                <p>The great rivers of the southern watershed are the ParanA and Paraguay. The
                    former has its rise in a broad basin, extending for a width of nearly 700 miles
                    across southern Brazil, enclosed by the coast range of the south, the Serra da
                    Mantiqueira, the Vertentes, and its southward interior branch running down into
                    Paraguay. The main and longest head stream of the ParanA is called the Rio
                    Grande or ParA, which rises in the Serra da Mantiqueira, one of its sources
                    being on the slope of Itatiaiossù, the highest point of the whole empire, 110
                    miles north-west of Rio de Janeiro. The Paranahyba joins the Grande on the right
                    from the Pireneos range in the north, and further on the ParanA-Panema, with its
                    tributary the Tibagy, comes in on the left bank from the inner slopes of the
                    south coast range; the Rio Pardo, Ivinhima, and Igatimi are smaller tributaries
                    on the left bank from the interior ranges. After the confluence of the Grande
                    and Paranahyba the ParanA takes its proper name and flows southward out of
                    Brazil in forming the limit between the empire and the republic of Paraguay. The
                    fall of Urubupunga, 40 miles below the confluence of the Grande and Paranahyba,
                    is an obstacle to the navigation of the upper river; but thence to the great
                    “salto” of GuayrA on the frontier of Paraguay, in 24° S., it is freely
                    navigable. The fall of GuayrA, Sete-quedas, or »Seven Falls, is the greatest
                    cataract of Brazil. Immediately above it and below the large island which the
                    ParanA towns between 23° and 24° the river is about 2∣ miles in width; its
                    channel is contracted first in passing through a diagonal line of seven islands
                    which stretches across it, and then between the walls of a rocky gorge only 65
                    yards in breadth, into which the whole mass of water plunges with terrific fury,
                    descending over a slope inclined about <hi rend="italic">50°,</hi> and for a
                    perpendicular height of about 60 feet. The roaring of the cataract may be heard
                    for many leagues round. Below the fall, the river rushes down in a narrow bed
                    with high cliff-like banks, only becoming less rapid and navigable with
                    difficulty as it leaves the Brazilian frontier at the confluence of the Y-Guasù.
                    This tributary, also named the Curityba, has a westward course to the ParanA,
                    from many heads in the inner side of the south coast range, and like all the
                    tributaries of the ParanA between it and the great fall, descends into the deep
                    gorge of the main river by a fine waterfall of 66 feet.</p>
                <p>The River Paraguay, the upper basin of which lies in a much lower region of the
                    continent, in the south-western interior of Brazil, is far superior to the
                    ParanA in respect of its navigable qualities, and in the grand natural outlet it
                    affords to the southward. Its sources are in several small lakes on the southern
                    slope of the Serra das Vertentes, between 13° and 14° S., immediately opposite
                    the head streams of the Tapajos, and it flows thence southward, fed by many
                    lateral streams from the range. Its important tributary the CuyabA, or Sào
                    Lourenço, rises not far east of the Paraguay, but does not join it until both
                    have passed about 400 miles south. The Taquari, the Mondego, and the Apa, the
                    boundary river of Brazil and Paraguay, are important tributaries from the range
                    which divides the basins of the Paraguay and ParanA; and from the hills of
                    eastern Bolivia the San Juan and Bahia Negra join the Paraguay on the right
                    bank. Throughout its course the Paraguay affords uninterrupted navigation, and
                    is regularly traversed by large Brazilian steamers from the Rio de la Plata to
                    CurumbA, in the province of Matto Grosso, a distance of about 1000 miles in a
                    direct line from Buenos Ayres. Thence smaller vessels carry on a regular traffic
                    for 300 miles further, by the Sào Lourenço tributary, to CuyabA in the very
                    heart of inner Brazil. An immense tract of the low country on each side of the
                    upper Paraguay, called the Xarayes, between 17° and 19° lat., is subject to
                    inundation in times of flood. j</p>
                <p>While the Amazon begins to rise in February or March, and is at its highest flood
                    in June, the ParanA is irregular in its risings, but has its greatest volume in
                    December, and the Paraguay again, regularly swelling and falling, is highest in
                    June.</p>
                <p>The surface of Brazil in respect to its elevation is divided into the <hi
                    rend="italic">higher region</hi> of plateaus, ridges, and broad open valleys,
                    occupying the whole of the country south of the parallel of Cape S. Roque, and
                    the vast <hi rend="italic">lowland plain</hi> of the Amazon, extending inland to
                    the base of the Andes of Peru, Equador, and Columbia, and rising again in the
                    extreme north to the ranges which form the boundary with Venezuela and
                    Guiana.</p>
                <p>The nucleus of the mountains and plateaus ot southern Brazil is not centrally
                    placed, but is formed by the chains named the Serra da Mantiqueira and Serra do
                    Espinhaço, which extend between 18° and 23° south lat., at a varying distance of
                    from 100 to 200 miles from the south-east coast. These are the highest and most
                    important mountains of Brazil, from which the other ranges and plateaus radiate
                    outwards north, west, and south; one of the summits of the Serra da Mantiqueira
                    is the Pico do Itatiaiossü, which is almost certainly the culminating point of
                    Brazil, but the elevation of its peak has been very variously estimated and
                    measured at from 6250 to 8900 and 10,300 feet. Itacolumi, near the town of Ouro
                    Preto, reaching about 5700 feet, and Itambe in the north of thé Serra do

                    The southern coastal range, or the Serra do Mar, begins immediately north of the
                    Bay of Rio de Janeiro, where the Oràgos or Organ Mountains, with sharp peaks,
                    rise to perhaps 7500 feet, and follows the line of the shore southward at
                    varying distances from it to near the 30th parallel. The line of the Serra do
                    Espinhaço is prolonged northward by another maritime chain or plateau edge, more
                    distant from the ocean, forming the eastern barrier of the great valley of the
                    Rio Sào Francisco, and terminating where the river turns eastward to reach the
                    sea.</p>
                <p>A range of high plateaus, probably from 3000 to 4000 feet in general elevation,
                    and named collectively the Serra das Vertentes, or the range of the watersheds,
                    but bearing a multitude of different names in its local sections and branches,
                    extends westward from the Serra do Espinhaço, nearly at right angles to its
                    direction, traversing the entire country in curving lines inland for upwards of
                    2000 miles to where the plateaus of Brazil terminate on the great bend, and the
                    cataracts, of the Rio Madeira. This very extensive range divides the waters
                    flowing northward to the lower Amazon and to the Atlantic shores of the
                    north-east, from those tributary to the great basins of the Paraguay and
                    Paran&lt;i in the south Its highest known portion is that called the Montes
                    Pyreneos, between the heads of the Tocantins and Paranahyba in the province of
                    Goyaz, one of the summits of which has been found to be perhaps 9600 feet above
                    the sea (H. R. Dos Genettes, 1868). Long branches ramify northward and southward
                    from the Vertentes; the principal of those trending northward is that which,
                    leaving the main line of division at the Pyreneos, curves round the basin of the
                    Sào Francisco, terminating in many minor branches on the coast on each side of
                    Cape S. Roque. A lateral branch from this divides the streams of the Tocantins
                    and of the northern Paranahyba. Farther west the Cordillera Graude of Goyaz runs
                    north from the Vertentes, separating the Araguaya and Tocantins, and still more
                    inland minor ranges mark out the basins of the Xingu and Tapajos. A southward
                    arm of the Vertentes, or rather a series of plateaus extending from it, divide
                    the Paraguay from the Alto Paranâ, and run into Paraguay as the heights of
                    Amambahy, which have an elevation of little over 2000 feet above the sea where
                    they cross the frontier. These are the main lines of height, but over the whole
                    of the plateau of Southern Brazil a great number of lesser ridges run out from
                    these between each of the tributary river basins.</p>
                <p>The extremely level character of the great northern lowlands may be judged of by
                    this, that the banks of the Amazon where it enters Brazil at Tabatinga, more
                    than 1500 miles in a direct line from the sea, are not more than 250 feet above
                    the ocean level, and a continuous navigation is afforded by its tributary the
                    Rio Negro, the Casiquiarc, and the Orinoco, to the northern coast of the
                    continent.</p>
                <p>The great constituent of all the mountain ranges of the southern highlands of
                    Brazil appears to be gneiss, varying from schistose to coarse-grained and
                    porphyritic, or homogeneous and granitic; and though much of it if seen in a
                    small specimen would be and has been described as granite, the larger masses are
                    always stratified. These rocks are of great thickness in the province of Rio,
                    and the Serra do Mar and Serra daMantiqueira are wholly composed of them; not
                    only does gniess form the great coast belt from Maranhao to the mouth of the Rio
                    de la Plata, but it sends off a band into Minas Geraes and Goyaz, where the
                    Pyreneos range and a great part of the mountain region are composed of it. The
                    same rock shows itself in the cataracts of the Tocantins, Xingu, Tapajos, and
                    Madeira, as well as in the Pariina Mountains north of the Amazon basin, showing
                    that the high land of Brazil is probably everywhere underlaid by it. Clay-slates
                    with auriferous veins occur in Alinas Geraes and in the vicinity of Cuyabâ, in
                    Matto Grosso, everywhere so metamorphosed that all trace of fossils has been
                    obliterated. True Carboniferous strata occur iu Brazil, the coal basins lying
                    just south of the tropic, and being a coast÷formation not known northward of
                    Rio. Carboniferous rocks also occur on the Guapore, a tributary of the Madeira
                    on the Bolivian frontier. Red sandstones occupy, a large area in the province of
                    Serigpe, underlying the Cretaceous formation. The Jurassic rocks, which extend
                    on the Andes from Chili to Peru, appear to be altogether wanting in Brazil.
                    Cretaceous rocks very probably underlie the great plain of the Amazon; they do
                    not appear on the coast south of the Abrolhos rocks in 18° S., but they occur at
                    intervals northward, and have been examined on an affluent of the River Purus in
                    the upper basin of the Amazon. These appear to have been deposited at a period
                    when the northern part of Brazil was more depressed, while the southern may have
                    been higher than it is now. Tertiary clays and ferruginous sandstone, in
                    horizontal and undisturbed beds, overlie the Cretaceous rocks unconformably on
                    the coast plains outside the plateaus and in the Sào Francisco valley; the
                    horizontal deposits of the plateau of Sào Paulo evidently belong to the same
                    group.</p>
                <p>Surface “drift” deposits, ascribed with the greater amount of probability to the
                    agency of glacial ice, though the hypothesis has been much disputed, occur as a
                    great sheet of pebbles and overlying clay, extending over an immense area of the
                    empire,—over the whole of the provinces south of Rio, over Alinas Geraes in the
                    north-eastern coast provinces, and in the valley of the Amazon westward to the
                    confines of Peru, and not only on the hills but over the lower “campos.”
                    Deposits of immense boulders of trap and gneiss, evidently the moraines of
                    former local glaciers, were first described by Professor Agassiz, who found them
                    at many points along the coast land.</p>
                <p>True coral reefs occur at irregular intervals along the northern Brazilian coast
                    from the Abrolhos islets, which rise on the submerged border of the continent
                    from a less depth than 100 feet, as far as the shores of Maranhào. They lie in
                    patches at short distances from the coast, leaving navigable channels between
                    them and the mainland. Another class of reefs, also termed “recifes,” but of
                    totally different origin, are the consolidated stone beaches, such as those seen
                    at Porto Seguro, Bahia, and Pernambuco (where the reef forms the breakw ater of
                    the harbour); these are of precisely uniform character, and have been described
                    by Professor Hartt as the consolidated cores of an ancient beach which has been
                    separated from the mainland by the encroachment of the sea. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Geology and Physical Geography of Brazil,</hi> by Ch. Fred. Hartt, 1870.) The
                    limestones of the upper Sào Francisco basin have celebrated bone caverns, which
                    have been made a special object of study by the Danish naturalist Lund. In some
                    of these the remains of extinct animals of high antiquity have been found, such
                    as those of the mastodon, glyptodon, mylodon, toxodon, and megatherium; and with
                    these the stone implements and remains of man, so buried with the bones of the
                    extinct fauna as to leave no doubt that man was contemporaneous with them.</p>
                <p>No volcanic appearances have been observed in Brazil. Warm springs occur in
                    several provinces; those of Itapi <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> curù in the
                    province of Bahia have temperatures varying from 88° to 106° Fahr, and are
                    saline; the hot springs of pure water in Santa Catharina range from 96° to 113°
                    Fahr., and there are a great number of alkaline springs about the district of
                    Santa Cruz, in the province of Goyaz, ranging up to 119° in temperature. Near
                    the village of Caldas in Alinas Geraes the hot wells are very voluminous, and
                    their somewhat sulphurous waters have tempera turei between <pb break="no"

                    about 6000 feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>The metallic and mineral products which occur in the geological formations above
                    described are very various. Diamonds λvere first discovered in the Serra do
                    Espinhaço, in the vicinity of Diamantina, about 300 miles north of Rio, in 1786.
                    In this neighbourhood there are shales, sandstones, and conglomerates; upon the
                    sandstone there is or was a stratum of quartzite, still very distinct in many
                    places, and among the sands created by the disintegration of this rock, diamonds
                    are found. This district is named the <hi rend="italic">Chapada</hi> of
                    Diamantina, a term applied to small elevated plateaus, usually consisting of
                    horizontal deposits, and separated by deeply eroded valleys. The
                    diamond-producing soil extends along the Serra do Espinhaço as far as the
                    northern borders of the province of Minas, along the valley of the upper
                    Belmonte, and in the interior of the province of Bahia, as well as in the
                    mountains that lie south-west of the sources of the Sào Francisco. Diamonds of
                    smaller value have also been found in the province of Goyaz (on the Rio Claro);
                    in Matto Grosso, where the valley of the Paraguay about Cuyabâ and Diamantino
                    has diamonds in considerable abundance; in Paranâ, on the Rio Tibagy, a
                    tributary of the Paranâ-Panema; in Sào Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul; and in Sào
                    Paulo;—but the area of their distribution is far from being well ascertained.
                    The diamonds are generally obtained by washing; an excavation is made to reach
                    the stratum called <hi rend="italic">cascalho,</hi> a gravel composed
                    principally of quartz and fragments of different rocks of the neighbourhood, and
                    mixed with a reddish clay. The washers are seated either by a pond or running
                    stream, and a portion of the gravel, being thrown into a large shallow wooden
                    pan, is mixed with water and stirred about in the current, so that the muddy
                    water escapes and the gravel and sand remain. This is now passed through a
                    sieve, which separates the larger gravel from the smaller; the pebbles are then
                    picked out, and the overseer examining the sand easily selects any diamonds that
                    may be present. The diamonds are often of considerable size. Burton mentions one
                    found in the Chapada of Bahia weighing 76∣ carats, which when cut into a
                    dropshaped brilliant proved to possess extraordinary play and lustre. Emeralds,
                    sapphires, rubies, topazes, beryls, tourmalines (black, blue, or green), and
                    amethysts are found, especially in the provinces of Minas Geraes. Garnets occur
                    in great profusion, though of inferior quality. Rock crystals, perfectly pure
                    and of large size, are obtained in Minas, Goyaz, Sào Paulo, and Paranâ; opals,
                    chalcedonies, agates, and carnelians are found nearly throughout the country,
                    but have become an article of export chiefly from the banks of the Uruguay, in
                    the province of Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
                <p>One of the Brazilian coal basins lies in the province of Santa Catharina, between
                    the plateau and the sea; and along the banks of the Tubarào, beds of bituminous
                    coal of fair quality are exposed, and were first noticed in 1841. Three separate
                    coal-fields have been traced in the province of Rio Grande do Sul: the largest
                    is situated in the valley of the Jaguarào (the boundary river with Uruguay), and
                    in that of the Candiota, covering an area of about 50 miles by 30 miles; the
                    second occurs in the valley of a tributary of the Rio Jacuaby, near the centre
                    of the province; and a third near the village of Sào Jeronymo, on the bank of
                    the Jacuahy. The Candiota field is now being worked by an English company. At
                    the Arroyo dos Ratos in the same province, mines have been worked on a small
                    scale, the coal from which is used by the steam-boats which ply on the Lagoa dos
                    Patos, or on the rivers. Bitumen is found in most of the provinces, and is
                    worked near the south coast of the province of Bahia.</p>
                <p>Sulphur exists in a native state in the province of Rio Grande do Norte, and in
                    small quantity in Rio Grande do Sul, as well as at Furquim and Corrego do Ouro,
                    in the district of Minas Novas in Minas Geraes. Saltpetre occurs with salt over
                    a large area of Minas Geraes and Bahia, but is also abundantly formed in the
                    floors of the calcareous caves of the Rio Sào Francisco valley from lhe city of
                    Ouro Preto downwards. Saline efflorescence is observed at innumerable localities
                    in the drier portions of the Brazilian plateau; efflorescences of nearly pure
                    sulphate of magnesia are also to be found in the valley of the Rio das Velhas in
                    the Sào Francisco basin, and in the province of Cearâ, where chloride of sodium
                    also appears.</p>
                <p>Gold in Brazil is found in quartz veins traversing the old metamorphic rocks,
                    such as clay-slate, mica-slate, or iron schist, in drift gravels and clays, and
                    in alluvial sands and gravels derived from the wear of these. Most gold is
                    afforded by the clay-slates traversed by auriferous quartz lodes, by the rock
                    called Itacolumite (metamorphic rock of Lower Silurian age), and by certain iron
                    ores known as Itabirite and Jacutinga, the latter described by Burton as a
                    substance composed of micaceous iron schist and friable quartz, mixed with
                    specular iron oxide of manganese and fragments of talc. Over a very large area
                    of the province of Minas Geraes, in the vicinity of Ouro Preto, the country is
                    auriferous, and here are the richest gold mines of Brazil. The celebrated Morro
                    Velho mine is situated on the western side of the valley of the Rio das Velhas,
                    not far from Sabarâ, and was at first worked by native miners, but afterwards
                    with great success by a company. The mines of Gongo Soco lie about 20 miles east
                    of Morro Velho, on the opposite side of the Velhas, and were at one time very
                    productive. Another company owns a tract of 21 square miles, not far from the
                    Morro Velho. Other mines have been worked in this neighbourhood at the Morro de
                    Sta Anna, at Maquiné near it, and in the Serra of Cata Branca, 2 miles east of
                    the village of Corrego Seco. These mines with two exceptions have proved
                    failures in working, after a period of success, and this notoriously from bad
                    management. The mines, however, are very far from being exhausted; indeed the
                    underground wealth of the country is as yet almost untouched. Much of the
                    remaining portion of the province of Minas, and especially the upper basin of
                    the Sào Francisco, is auriferous, in Northern Brazil the only gold mine yet
                    opened is that of Tury-assù in the province of Maranhào; but concessions for
                    working gold have been granted by Government in many parts of the provinces of
                    Bahia, Pernambuco, Parahyba, Piauhy, Goyaz, Cearâ, and S. Paulo. In southern
                    Brazil gold is known at Caçapava, Rio Pardo, Sta. Maria, and Cruz Alta, in the
                    province of Rio Grande do Sul; and at the first-named locality a Brazilian
                    company is carrying on the work of mining. Gold washings occur in almost every
                    province, but especially in the district of Minas Novas, 200 miles north of Ouro
                    Preto, where the metal is found in grains or nuggets in a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cascalho</hi> of quartz pebbles, often cemented into a conglomerate by iron
                    oxide. They aro carried on, however, in the rudest and most irregular way, and
                    with more modern appliances might prove very remunerative.</p>
                <p>The gold of Brazil is always alloyed with silver, and this metal is present in
                    many of the galenic formations which are known in almost every province, as well
                    as with the copper in the mines of Rio Grande do Sul. At the hill of Araçoiva,
                    in the municipality of Sorocaba in Sào Paulo, silver was extracted nearly two
                    centuries ago. Rich mines' of mercury occur in the province of Paranâ not far
                    from the capital. Copper is abundant in the provinces of Matto Grosso, Goyaz,
                    and Minas, near the capital of Bahia, in Maranhao and Cearâ, but chiefly in Rio
                    Grande do Sul, where at Santo Antonio das Lavras, in the municipality of <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0268-0225"/> Caçapava, there are the richest copper mines of
                    Brazil, the mineral from which yields 60 per cent, of pure metal.</p>
                <p>Manganese exists in abundance in the vicinity of Nazareth, at the head of the
                    estuary of the Jaguaripe, adjoining the bay of Bahia. Galena mines are in
                    operation in many parts of the empire; the chief are those of Iporanga,
                    Sorocaba, Iguapé in the province of Sào Paulo, and those of the Rio Abaeté and
                    Sete Lagδas, the most productive of all, in the province of Minas. Lead mines
                    also exist along the whole coastal region from Santa Catharina to Maranhao,
                    those of the hill chain of Ibiapaba on the borders of Cearâ and Piauhy being
                    important.</p>
                <p>Every part of Brazil contains iron, in ore or in other forms, and an almost
                    unlimited quantity appears to exist in the mountains of Minas Geraes. At Sào
                    Joào de Ipanéma, in S. Paulo, there are heavy deposits of magnetic iron, which
                    are mined and smelted almost on the spot; and other seams of like character
                    appear in the provinces of Alagoas, Cearâ, Rio Grande do Norte, and Parahyba.
                    Some of the Brazilian mines are quite free from pyrites. In 1810 a company of
                    Swedish miners and founders settled at Ipanéma, and erected two small refining
                    furnaces. In 1817 they produced nearly 4000 arrobas of iron, which was
                    manufactured on the spot into horses’ shoes, nails, locks, and other articles.
                    There is now a very considerable establishment, at which moulding and refining
                    is carried on, the woods of the neighbourhood furnishing an abundant supply of
                    charcoal. A railway is projected to unite the works with S. Paulo and its port.
                    Not far from these mines there are extensive quarries of marble of valuable
                    sorts.</p>
                <p>A country so extensive as Brazil, and so diversified in its surface, necessarily
                    exhibits a considerable variety of climate. The great northern lowland lying
                    entirely within the tropics has great heat, and its year is divided between the
                    simple wet and dry seasons. The elevation of the central and southern highland
                    of Brazil introduces great variety in the seasons and climates of the
                    intertropical portion of that region; and towards the south beyond the tropic a
                    temperate zone is reached in which four seasons are marked, though not so
                    distinctly as in central Europe. The whole wide plain of the Amazon basin has
                    its rainy season from January or December till May or June, the remaining half
                    of the year being dry, though intervals of fine weather may occur within the wet
                    period, and of showers in the dry season. The fall during the rainy months is
                    excessive, raising the level of the great river full 40 feet, and much thunder
                    and lightning always accompanies the heavy rain. This belt of single rainy and
                    dry season appears to terminate about the line of the River Paranahyba, between
                    the provinces of Maranhao and Piauhy; at the town of Maranhao the annual fall
                    has been found to be on an average 280 inches. Inland, across the higher
                    southern watershed of the Amazon, from the interior of the provinces of Maranhao
                    and Piauhy, over Goyaz and northern Matto Grosso as far as the falls of the
                    Madeira, the rainy seasons follow the passage of the sun towards and away from
                    the southern tropic, and occur from October or November to March or April, with
                    more or less marked intervals of drier weather.</p>
                <p>In lower Maranhao showers also occur in October, and are called the ‘ Cashew
                    rains.’ On the north-east coast slope, in the provinces of Cearâ, Rio Grande do
                    Norte, and northern Bahia, the rains appear to be governed by the prevalence of
                    the north-east winds from the Atlantic, and occur from March or April to June,
                    July, or August. The coastal region from southern Bahia to Sào Paulo and the Sào
                    Francisco valley have again a more or less marked double rainy season between
                    October and April or May; the heaviest rains occur in the Sào Francisco valley
                    from January to May, the highest freshets of the river being in March; the coast
                    rivers, such as the Rio Doce, rise first in December, and again to an almost
                    equal swelling in March. At Pernambuco the amount of the annual rainfall is up
                    wards of 100 inches; at Rio de Janeiro it has decreased to 59 inches, and a
                    gradual diminution of the quantity is observed from the Amazon southward. In Sào
                    Paulo the rainy season is, in summer, from November till April, the greatest
                    quantity of rain falling in January. In Sta. Catharina the rains begin to be
                    irregular, and from this to the southward over Rio Grande do Sul the four
                    seasons of the temperate zone begin to be distinguishable. The whole country is,
                    as a rule, abundantly watered, the only portion which may suffer from drought
                    being that of the interior between the Sào Francisco and the Paranahyba, where
                    extraordinary dryness has sometimes prevailed.</p>
                <p>In temperature the vast Amazon basin is remarkable for the small seasonal
                    variation of heat, accounted for by its equatorial position and immense surface
                    of water and forest; within its limits the thermometer at its highest readings
                    averages 90° and the lowest 75°. At Parâ the register kept by Costa Azevedo
                    between 1861 and 1867 gave a mean temperature of 80°, a maximum of 95°, and a
                    minimum of 68°. Observations are very deficient for the greater portion of the
                    empire. About the Falls of the Madeira, Keller estimates the mean annual
                    temperature at 77°, with but small variation in the seasons. In the latitude of
                    Rio de Janeiro the summer or January temperature near the sea-level has an
                    average of about 75°, that of July descending to about 65°; and in the extreme
                    southern provinces the corresponding figures may fall to 70° and 50° Fahr, in
                    summer and winter. But an immense variety of temperature and climatic condition
                    are found on the central and southern table-lands and mountain ranges of Brazil,
                    from the hot and humid air of the coast to the mountains where in winter it
                    frequently snows, and where lakes may be covered with a coating of ice. In the
                    high plains of Rio Grande and Sào Paulo the thermometer may also fall to below
                    the freezing point.</p>
                <p>The prevalent winds of the greater portion of Brazil are the trade-winds from the
                    east, which, gathering the vapours from the whole breadth of the equatorial
                    Atlantic, give out their excessive moisture over the northern forest plains of
                    the Amazon, reaching inland as far as the high wall of the Andes. The east winds
                    are strongest in the Amazon valley from July till November, mitigating the heat
                    of the dry season. On the maritime regions of central Brazil the north-east or
                    south-east trades prevail according to season. In the far interior the general
                    winds take a more north and south direction, blowing usually from the south when
                    the sun is in the northern tropic and from the north during summer. Land and sea
                    breezes are very constant along the coasts. At the mouth of the Sào Francisco,
                    for example; the morning is still and calm; about nine o’clock a breeze steals
                    over the water, rippling its surface and gradually increasing to a stiff wind
                    about noon; the breeze continues steadily till night-fall, when it again falls
                    calm.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the marshy banks of some of the rivers and the lowlands and
                    swamps, where intermittent fevers are very prevalent, the country is generally
                    healthy. On the sea-coast and inland in some of the maritime provinces,
                    epidemics of yellow fever and cholera morbus have been experienced since 1850.
                    The mortality in the most populous towns of Brazil is not, however, above but
                    rather below that of the large cities of Europe.</p>
                <p>The broadly-marked features given to the landscape by the vegetations of
                    different characters in Brazil are distinguished by several names. <hi
                    rend="italic">Mattas</hi> or heavy forests cover the immense northern lowland
                    which is watered by excessive rains, and these occur also in belts of greater or
                    less width over the lower portions of the central and southern <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n269/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0269-0226"/> region. <hi rend="italic">Catinga</hi> is the
                    general name applied to the lower growing and open woods of the slopes of the
                    Brazilian highland which lose their leaves in the dry season. These merge into
                    the wide open plains or gently rounded hills and ridges, covered with grass or
                    scattered bushes, which are called the <hi rend="italic">Campos geraes.</hi> The
                    systematic burning over of these great grass lands, to allow the young crop to
                    appear, has completely destroyed in them all trees and shrubs which cannot bear
                    the scorching, and so has wrought a great alteration in the flora of these
                    regions. The name <hi rend="italic">Sertäo,</hi> meaning originally the interior
                    as distinguished from the maritime country, has come to be applied to dry,
                    hilly, and stony districts of the campos only suited for pasture. To the
                    agricultural coast belt of the eastern provinces the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beira mar</hi> is given.</p>
                <p>Except on the loftiest mountains, and on the wide <hi rend="italic">sertäos,</hi>
                    the vegetation of Brazil is luxuriant beyond description. In the mountain passes
                    in the neighbourhood of the sea-shore, the conjoint effects of heat and moisture
                    produce a superfluity of vegetable life, which man’s utmost efforts cannot
                    restrain. Trees split for paling in the neighbourhood of Rio Janeiro send forth
                    shoots and branches immediately, and this whether the position of the fragments
                    be that in which they originally grew, or inverted. On the banks of the Amazons
                    the loftiest trees destroy each other by their proximity, and are bound together
                    by rich and multiform lianes. In the province of Maranhao, the roots, grasses,
                    and other plants extending from the shores of pools, weave themselves in time
                    into a kind of vegetable bridge, along which the passenger treads, unaware that
                    he has left the firm earth, until the jaws of a cayman protrude through the
                    herbage before him. The vegetable productions of Brazil have a strong analogy
                    with those of Guiana. The most common are the <hi rend="italic">Compositae,
                    Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae, liubiaceae, Aroideae,</hi> and ferns of the most
                    varied forms. The vegetation of the valleys differs from that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">campos,</hi> as it again does from that which occurs in the <hi
                    rend="italic">sertäos.</hi> Along the coast, the mangroves are the most numerous
                    and prominent species. The most marked peculiarity of this class of plants is,
                    that the seeds begin to shoot before they drop from the parent plant, and that
                    the drooping branches strike roots into the soil. They are never found inland
                    except where the surface is scarcely elevated above the level of the sea. They
                    flourish from Rio Grande do Sul to Maranhao, converting the land into a morass
                    wherever they are allowed to flourish unmolested. Immediately behind them
                    numerous families of palms raise their graceful heads. The underwood in the
                    neighbourhood of Rio Janeiro consists principally of crotons. Every large river
                    of Brazil has its own appropriate form of vegetable life, giving a peculiar
                    character to its banks. The vegetation of the Amazon may be divided into three
                    classes;—(1) that which we find on the islands, (2) the vegetation upon the
                    banks overflowed at regular intervals by the stream, and (3) that which stands
                    high and dry. The difference between them consists in the character of the bark
                    and the species of the plants. Brushwood and herbage are nowhere to be seen;
                    everything tends to the gigantic in size. The most various forms group awkwardly
                    together, crossed and intertwined with leaves. The preponderance of trees with
                    feathery foliage, and with glossy, fleshy leaves, lends alternately a tender and
                    a luxuriant character to the scene, which is in every other respect painful from
                    its monotony. Representatives of the most estranged natural families grow side
                    by side. It is only on the islands, where the willow and some other plants are
                    found in numbers, that we are reminded of the uniformity of our northern
                    vegetation. Cocoa trees and the vanilla, <hi rend="italic">Capsicum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">frutescens,</hi> and different kinds of pepper, the cinnamon tree,
                    and Brazilian cassia abound. The flora of all the tributaries of the Amazon is
                    similar to what we have described, until the traveller ascends above the falls,
                    and finds himself in another region. The sources of the Madeira alone offer a
                    partial exception, retaining a vegetation indicative of extensive plains, lakes,
                    and morasses. The vegetation of the southern <hi rend="italic">campos</hi>
                    (corresponding to the North American <hi rend="italic">prairies)</hi> is widely
                    different. On the plains of the southern provinces we find scattered about
                    strong tufts of greyish-green and hairy grasses, springing from the red clay.
                    Mingled with these are numerous herbaceous flowers, of the most varied colours
                    and elegant forms. At intervals small groves of trees, seldom exceeding 20 feet
                    in height, so distant that the individual form of each is easily recognized,
                    with spreading fantastic branches and pale green leaves, break the monotony of
                    the scene. Solitary myrtles, numerous varieties of pleasing fruits, and now and
                    then a cactus, add to the variety. A similar vegetation, but with a richer
                    variety of plants, occurs in the diamond district. On the western declivity of
                    the Serra do Mar, and along the upper banks of the Rio Sào Francisco, extends a
                    wooded “catinga” country, of a character entirely different from that which is
                    found in the valleys below. <hi rend="italic">Malvoe, Euphorbiaceae,
                    Mimosae,</hi> and the like, are the prevailing types on the Rio Francisco;
                    cactuses, palms, and ferns abound on the Serra do Mar. In this latter district
                    the ipecacuanha flourishes best. It is, however, in the glowing steppes of
                    Pernambuco that we find the cactus predominant. In the valley of the Paraguay
                    the most striking feature is presented by the water plants, which in one river
                    are sufficiently strong to impede the navigation of a stream both deep and
                    broad.</p>
                <p>The forests of Brazil contain almost every species of useful and ornamental wood.
                    The cocoa-tree is found in great quantities in the provinces on the sea-shore,
                    and furnishes one of the most important items of internal commerce. A
                    considerable surplus of cocoa is annually exported. One of the most valuable
                    sorts of timber is furnished by the Ibiripitanga or Brazil-wood <hi
                    rend="italic">(Caesalpinia</hi><hi rend="italic">brasiliensis),</hi> which
                    yields a fine red dye. The wood itself is very hard and heavy, and takes a
                    beautiful polish. It grew at one time in great abundance along the coast; but
                    being a Government monopoly (thence called <hi rend="italic">pao da rainho,</hi>
                    Queen’s wood), it was cut down in a reckless manner, and is now by no means so
                    abundant as it once was. The other trees most worthy of meution are the <hi
                    rend="italic">jaracanda</hi> or rosewood tree, the trumpet-tree <hi
                    rend="italic">(Secropia</hi><hi rend="italic">peltata),</hi> the laurel, the
                    soap-tree, the tapia or garlic pear-tree, and the whole family of palms. Of
                    these the Carnauba Palm <hi rend="italic">(Copernicia cerifera),</hi> which
                    grows in the north-east coastal province, is perhaps the most useful tree of
                    Brazil; every part of it is valuable, and the wax yielded by its leaves is now a
                    considerable article of trade. Not least important is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siphonia</hi><hi rend="italic">elastica,</hi> or caoutchouc tree, which during
                    the season is tapped every day, and furnishes in considerable quantities a gum
                    which is poured into moulds; the export of this product from Brazil averages a
                    value of more than £1,000,000 annually. The banana is one of the most useful of
                    all the trees that grow in Brazil, and its fruit is the chief food of the native
                    Indians. The fruits of Brazil are numerous and excellent. The best of these are
                    the pine-apple, the mango, the custard-apple, the guava, and the various kinds
                    of melons and nuts.</p>
                <p>In an empire of such vast extent as Brazil, embracing as it does every variety of
                    temperature and elevation, the value and importance of the agricultural products
                    cannot fail to be very great. So small, however, is the number of farmers,
                    compared with the extent of the soil, that it is believed that not one acre in
                    200 is under cultivation. In some provinces, especially those near the sea, the
                    quantity of grain raised is not sufficient to supply the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n270/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0270-0227"/> demand, and thus large quantities of wheat are
                    annually imported from the United States. The reason of this is that the soil
                    under tillage is occupied in the production of articles for foreign markets. The
                    chief products of Brazil are coffee, sugar, cotton, manioc or cassava flour,
                    tobacco, rice, maize, fruits, and spices. Of these by far the most important now
                    is coffee, while sugar ranks next in value, and cotton after sugar. The coffee
                    plant, introduced from Arabia into the French colony of Cayenne in 1722, was
                    soon after brought to Brazil; but it was not until 1810 that Brazilian coffee
                    came to be highly valued in the European markets. In that year, however, Dr
                    Lecesne, a planter, expelled by the revolution from San Domingo, settled near
                    Rio, and introduced the most improved methods of rearing the coffee-plant. So
                    successful has the result of the new system been, that its cultivation now
                    extends from the Amazon to Sào Paulo; and whereas in 1818 the annual exports of
                    coffee did not amount in value to £240,000, in 1873 the exports were worth
                    nearly £13,000,000. The cultivation of sugar has not increased nearly in the
                    same proportion as that of coffee, and in recent years a disease of the cane has
                    affected the cultivation seriously. It is produced in greatest quantity in the
                    districts adjoining Bahia. The quantity of sugar exported in 1850 was 16,200
                    bales, representing a value of about £1,700,000; in 1873 the value of the
                    exports was £3,120,000. Cotton is found to thrive best in the dry table-lands of
                    the northern provinces, especially in Maranhao and Pernambuco. Its quality is
                    considered excellent; but the rude and expensive method of its culture, and the
                    high rates of carriage in these inland districts, operate very unfavourably for
                    this branch of traffic. The annual value of cotton exported is not much above
                    £3,000,000. The <hi rend="italic">Ilex curitibensis,</hi> and other varieties of
                    the holly, which yields the yerba maté, or Paraguay tea, are indigenous to the
                    southern provinces of Rio Grande, Santa Catharina, and Parana. Some attempts
                    have been made towards the cultivation of this product, but the greater part of
                    the tea is rudely made from the tree in its wild state in the woods. The amount
                    annually exported to the River Plate averages between £300,000 to £400,000 in
                    value. Tobacco is chiefly cultivated in the provinces of Bahia, Minas, S. Paulo,
                    and Paré., and in some localities of Rio de Janeiro. Though it is inferior in
                    quality to that of the West Indies, it is exported to the value of between
                    £700,000 and £800,000 annually. The cultivation of cocoa, hitherto obtained from
                    the valleys of the Amazon and Tocantins, is increasing in the provinces of Bahia
                    and Cearâ. Rice grows in considerable quantities, and not being much used by the
                    natives for food, a large surplus remains for exportation. The cassava or manioc
                    is extensively grown and forms the staple food of the lower classes The root,
                    which is the part of the plant used for this purpose, contains a deadly poison.
                    It is easily expelled, however, by the action of fire, and the residuum is
                    ground into a wholesome and nutritious flour or farina Tapioca, which is
                    extensively used in Europe, is a preparation of the starch from the root of the
                    cassava.</p>
                <p>The varieties of animated life in Brazil are more numerous perhaps than in any
                    other region in the world. Of beasts of prey, the most formidable are the jaguar
                    or South American tiger, the ocelot, the tiger-cat, the puma, the guarâ or red
                    wolf, and the Brazilian fox or wild dog. Large herds of the peccary roam in the
                    forests, in which also is to be found the tapir or <hi rend="italic">anta,</hi>
                    the largest South American mammal. The <hi rend="italic">capivara,</hi> or water
                    hog, abundant on the river banks, is the largest known rodent. Diverse species
                    of deer inhabit the campos; representing the Edentata there are several species
                    of armadillos and ant-eaters, and the sloths; and of the Marsupialia, several
                    species of opossum occurring over the whole of Brazil. The varieties of the
                    monkey tribe that abound in the forests appear to be almost infinite. The
                    largest belong to the genus <hi rend="italic">Stentor,</hi> including the
                    guaribas or howling monkeys. The <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >jacchus</hi> has never been seen elsewhere. There are several varieties of
                    bats, of which the <hi rend="italic">Vespertilio leporinus</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">V. spectrum</hi> are the largest. No less immense is the variety
                    of birds, from the <hi rend="italic">ouira,</hi> an eagle far larger than our
                    most powerful birds of prey, to the humming-bird, no larger than a bee. The
                    rhea, a species of ostrich, is found in Brazil. The Brazilian birds are
                    celebrated for the beauty of their plumage. “Red, blue, and green parrots,” says
                    Malte-Brun, “frequent the tops of trees. The gallinaceous <hi rend="italic"
                    >jacûs,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">hoccos,</hi> and different kinds of pigeons,
                    haunt the woods. The orioles resort to the orange groves; and their sentinels,
                    stationed at a distance, announce with a screaming noise the approach of man.
                    Chattering manakins mislead the hunter; and the metallic tones of the uraponga
                    resound through the forest like the strokes of a hammer on an anvil. The toucan
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ramphastos)</hi> is prized for its feathers, which are of a
                    lemon and bright red colour, with transverse stripes reaching to the extremities
                    of the wings. The different species of humming birds are more numerous in Brazil
                    than in any other country of America. One sort is called by the people the <hi
                    rend="italic">Qnanthe engera</hi> or winged flower.” Snakes of every kind abound
                    in the marshy districts, some of which, such as the rattlesnake and the
                    jararaca, are remarkably venomous; while others, such as the boas, attain an
                    enormous size and strength. A vast number of troublesome insects infest the
                    margins of all the great rivers. Of these the most formidable is the <hi
                    rend="italic">puim,</hi> which is so small as to be scarcely visible, and
                    inflicts a most painful and even dangerous bite. The red ant is peculiarly
                    destructive to vegetation, and whole districts are sometimes laid waste by its
                    ravages. The spider here attains an enormous size, but is not so venomous as
                    might be expected from its appearance. The gayest butterflies flutter through
                    the air,— the blue shining Menelaus, the Adonis, the Nestor, and the Laertes.
                    More than ten species of wild bees have been observed in the woods, and the
                    greater number produce honey. The <hi rend="italic">Cactus coccinellifer,</hi>
                    and the insect peculiar to it, are found in the province of S. Paulo. Lizards
                    and caymans abound. The quantity of turtle in the Amazon and its principal
                    tributaries is almost incredible. The waters swarm with fish in thousands of
                    species, many of which have not yet been described. Among the largest is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pira rued,</hi> the principal food of large numbers of the people
                    of Para and Amazonas. Of domestic animals, the most important are the horse, the
                    ox, and the sheep. Vast numbers of horses, sprung from the original European
                    stock, roam at large over the extensive plains of the southern provinces. They
                    are generally found in droves of twenty or thirty. Oxen are also allowed to
                    wander half wild. They are hunted down with the <hi rend="italic">lasso</hi> in
                    great numbers, and are valued chiefly on account of their hides, horns, and
                    tallow, which are exported in immense quantities. The chief cattle-breeding
                    districts of Brazil are the island of Marajo in Parâ, Goyaz, Matto Grosso,
                    Piauhy, S. Paulo, Minas, Paranâ, and Rio Grande do Sul. Sheep do not thrive in
                    Brazil at all so well as the larger kinds of cattle.</p>
                <p>Brazil was discovered in 1499 by Vincent Yanez Pinçon, a companion of Columbus.
                    He descried the land near Cape St Augustine, and sailed along the coast as far
                    as the River Amazon, whence he proceeded to the mouth of the Orinoco. He made no
                    settlement, but took possession of the country in the name of the Spanish
                    Government, and carried home, as specimens of its natural productions, some
                    drugs, gems, and Brazil-wood. Next year the Portuguese commander, Pedro Alvarez
                    Cabral, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n271/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0271-0228"/> appointed by his monarch to follow the course of
                    Vasco de Gama in the East, was driven by adverse winds so far from his track,
                    that he reached the Brazilian coast, April 24, and anchored in Porto Seguro (16°
                    S. lat.) on Good Friday. On Easter day an altar was erected, mass celebrated in
                    presence of the natives, the country declared an apanage of Portugal, and a
                    stone cross erected in commemoration of the event. Cabral despatched a small
                    vessel to Lisbon to announce his discovery, and, without forming any settlement,
                    proceeded to India on the 3d of May. On the arrival of the news in Portugal,
                    Emanuel invited Amerigo Vespucci to enter his service, and despatched him with
                    three vessels to explore the country. This navigator’s first voyage was
                    unsuccessful; but in a second he discovered a safe port, the site of which is
                    not accurately known, to which he gave the name of All-Saints. He remained there
                    five months, and maintained a friendly intercourse with the natives. Some of the
                    party travelled forty leagues into the interior. Vespucci erected a small fort,
                    and leaving twelve men, with guns and provisions, to garrison it, embarked for
                    Portugal, having loaded his two ships with Brazil-wood, monkeys, and
                    parrots.</p>
                <p>The poor and barbarous tribes of Brazil, and their country, the mineral riches of
                    which were not immediately discovered, offered but few attractions to a
                    Government into the coffers of which the wealth of India and Africa was flowing.
                    Vespucci’s settlement was neglected. For nearly thirty years the kings of
                    Portugal paid no further attention to their newly-acquired territory than what
                    consisted in combating the attempts of the Spaniards to occupy it, and
                    dispersing the private adventurers from France who sought its shores for the
                    purposes of commerce. The colonization of Brazil was prosecuted, however, by
                    subjects of the Portuguese monarchy, who traded thither chiefly for Brazilwood.
                    The Government also sought to make criminals of some use to the state, by
                    placing them in a situation where they could do little harm to society, and
                    might help to uphold the dominion of their nation.</p>
                <p>The first attempt on the part of a Portuguese monarch to introduce an organized
                    government into his dominions was made by Joäo III. He adopted a plan which had
                    been found to succeed well in Madeira and the Azores,— dividing the country into
                    hereditary captaincies, and granting them to such persons as were willing to
                    undertake their settlement, with unlimited powers of jurisdiction, both civil
                    and criminal. Each captaincy extended along fifty leagues of coast. The
                    boundaries in the interior were undefined. . The first settlement made under
                    this new system was that of S. Vincente Piratininga, in the present province of
                    S. Paulo. Martim Affonso de Sousa, having obtained a grant, fitted out a
                    considerable armament, and proceeded to explore the country in person. He began
                    to survey the coast about Rio de Janeiro, to which he gave that name, because he
                    discovered it on the first of January 1531. He proceeded south as far as La
                    Plata, naming the places he surveyed on the way from the days on which the
                    respective discoveries were made. He fixed upon an island, in 24 j <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> S. lat., called by the natives Guaibe, for his
                    settlement. The Goagnazes, or prevailing tribe of Indians in that neighbourhood,
                    as soon as they discovered the intentions of the new comers to fix themselves
                    permanently there, collected for the purpose of expelling them. Fortunately,
                    however, a shipwrecked Portuguese, who had lived many years under the protection
                    of the principal chief, was successful in concluding a treaty of perpetual
                    alliance between his countrymen and the natives. Finding the spot chosen for the
                    new town inconvenient, the colonists removed to the adjoining island of S.
                    Vincente, from which the captaincy derived its name. Cattle and the sugarcane
                    were at an early period introduced from Madeira, and here the other captaincies
                    supplied themselves with both.</p>
                <p>Pero Lopes de Sousa received the grant of a captaincy, and set sail from Portugal
                    at the same time as his brother, the founder of S. Vincente. He chose to have
                    his fifty leagues in two allotments. That to which he gave the name of S. Amaro
                    adjoined S. Vincente, the two towns being only three leagues asunder. The other
                    division lay much nearer to the line between Paraiba and Pernambuco. He
                    experienced considerable difficulty in founding this second colony, from the
                    strenuous opposition of a neighbouring tribe, the Petiguares; but at length he
                    succeeded in clearing his lands of them; and not long afterwards he perished by
                    shipwreck.</p>
                <p>Rio de Janeiro was not settled till a later period; and for a considerable time
                    the nearest captaincy to S. Amaro, sailing along the coast northwards, was that
                    of Espiritu Santo. It was founded by Vasco Fernandes Coutinho, who having
                    acquired a large fortune in India, sunk it in this scheme of colonization. He
                    carried with him no less than sixty fidalgos. They named their town by
                    anticipation, Our Lady of the Victory; but it cost them some hard fighting with
                    the Goagnazes to justify the title.</p>
                <p>Pedro de Campo Tourinho, a nobleman and excellent navigator, received a grant of
                    the adjoining captaincy of Porto Seguro. This, it will be remembered, is the
                    spot where Cabral first took possession of Brazil· The Tupinoquins at first
                    offered some opposition; but having made peace, they observed it faithfully,
                    notwithstanding that the oppression of the Portuguese obliged them to forsake
                    the country. Sugar-works were established, and considerable quantities of the
                    produce exported to the mother country.</p>
                <p>Jorge de Figueiredo, <hi rend="italic">Escrivam da Fazenda,</hi> was the first
                    donatory of the captaincy of Ilhéos, 140 miles S. of Bahia. His office
                    preventing him from taking possession in person, he deputed the task to
                    Francisco Romeiro, a Castilian. The Tupinoquins, the most tractable of the
                    Brazilian tribes, made peace with the settlers, and the colony was founded
                    without a struggle.</p>
                <p>The coast from the Rio S. Francisco to Bahia was granted to Francisco Pereira
                    Coutinho; the bay itself, with all its creeks, was afterwards added to the
                    grant. When Coutinho formed his establishment, where Villa Velha now stands, he
                    found a noble Portuguese living in the neighbourhood who, having been
                    shipwrecked, had, by means of his fire-arms, raised himself to the rank of chief
                    among the natives. He was surrounded by a patriarchal establishment of wives and
                    children; and to him most of the distinguished families of Bahia still trace
                    their lineage. The regard entertained by the natives for Caramaru (signifying

                    to his countrymen, and for a time everything went on well. Coutinho had,
                    however, learned in India to be an oppressor, and the Tupinambas were the
                    fiercest and most powerful of the native tribes. The Portuguese were obliged to
                    abandon their settlement; but several of them returned at a later period, along
                    with Caramaru, and thus a European community was established in the
                    district.</p>
                <p>Some time before the period at which these captaincies were established, a
                    factory had been planted at Pernambuco. A ship from Marseilles took it, and left
                    seventy men in it as a garrison; but being captured on her return, and carried
                    into Lisbon, immediate measures were taken for reoccupying the place. The
                    captaincy of Pernambuco was granted to Don Duarte Coelho Pereira as the reward
                    of his services in India. It extended along the coast from the Rio S. Francisco,
                    northward to the Rio de Juraza. Duarte sailed with his wife and children, and
                    many of his kinsmen, to take possession of his new colony, and landed in the
                    port of Pernambuco. To the town which was there founded he gave the name of <pb

                    fierce and pertinacious; and, assisted by the French, who traded to that coast,
                    Coelho had to gain by inches what was granted him by leagues. The Portuguese
                    managed, however, to beat off their enemies; and, having entered into an
                    alliance with the Tobayanes, followed up their success.</p>
                <p>Attempts were made about this time to establish two other captaincies, but
                    without success. Pedro de Goes obtained a grant of the .captaincy of Paraiba
                    between those of S. Vincente and Espirito Santo; but his means were too feeble
                    to enable him to make head against the aborigines, and the colony was broken up
                    after a painful struggle of seven years. Joäo de Barros, the historian, obtained
                    the captaincy of Maranhao. For the sake of increasing his capital, he divided
                    his grant with Fernan Alvares de Andrada and Aires da Cunha. They projected a
                    scheme of conquest and colonization upon a large scale. Nine hundred men, of
                    whom one hundred and thirteen were horsemen, embarked in ten ships under the
                    command of Aires da Cunha. But the vessels were wrecked upon some shoals about
                    one hundred leagues to the south of Maranhao; the few survivors, after suffering
                    immense hardships, escaped to the nearest settlements, and the undertaking was
                    abandoned.</p>
                <p>By these adventurers the whole line of Brazilian coast, from the mouth of La
                    Plata to the mouth of the Amazon, had become studded at intervals with
                    Portuguese settlements, in all of which law and justice were administered,
                    however inadequately. It is worthy of observation, that Brazil was the first
                    colony founded in America upon an agricultural principle, for until then the
                    precious metals were the exclusive attraction. Sufficient capital was attracted
                    between the year 1531 (in which De Sousa founded the first captaincy) and the
                    year 1548 to render these colonies an object of importance to the mother
                    country. Their organization, however, in regard to their means of defence
                    against both external aggression and internal violence, was extremely defective.
                    Their territories were surrounded and partly occupied by large tribes of
                    savages. Behind them the Spaniards, who had an establishment at Asuncion, had
                    penetrated almost to the sources of the waters of Paraguay, and had succeeded in
                    establishing a communica tion with Peru. Orellana, on the other hand, setting
                    out from Peru, had crossed the mountains and sailed down the Amazon. Nor had the
                    French abandoned their hopes of effecting an establishment on the coast.</p>
                <p>The obvious remedy for these evils was to concentrate the executive power, to
                    render the petty chiefs amenable to one tribunal, and to confide the management
                    of the defensive force to one hand. In order to this the powers of the several
                    captains were revoked, whilst their property in their grants was reserved to
                    them. A governor-general was appointed, with full powers, civil and criminal.
                    The judicial and financial functions in each province were vested in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ouvidor,</hi> whose authority in the college of finance was second
                    only to that of the governor. Every colonist was enrolled either in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Milιcias</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ordenanzas.</hi> The former
                    were obliged to serve beyond the boundaries of the province, the latter only at
                    home. The chief cities received municipal constitutions, as in Portugal. Thome
                    de Sousa was the first person nominated to the important post of
                    governor-general. He was instructed to build a strong city in Bahia and to
                    establish there the seat of his government. In pursuance of his commission he
                    arrived at Bahia in April 1549, with a fleet of six vessels, on board of which
                    were three hundred and twenty persons in the king’s pay, four hundred convicts,
                    and about three hundred free colonists. Care had been taken for the spiritual
                    wants of the provinces by associating six Jesuits with the expedition.</p>
                <p>Old Caramaru, who still survived, rendered the governor essential service by
                    gaining for his countrymen the good will of the natives. The new city was
                    established where Bahia still stands. Within four months one hundred houses were
                    built, and surrounded by a mud wall. Sugar plantations were laid out in the
                    vicinity. During the four years of Sousa’s government there were sent out at
                    different times supplies of all kinds, female orphans of noble families, who
                    were given in marriage to the officers, and portioned from the royal estates,
                    and orphan boys to be educated by the Jesuits. The capital rose rapidly in
                    importance, and the captaincies learned to regard it as a common head and centre
                    of wealth. Meanwhile the Jesuits undertook the moral and religious culture of
                    the natives, and of the scarcely less savage colonists. Strong opposition was at
                    first experienced from the gross ignorance of the Indians, and the depravity of
                    the Portuguese, fostered by the licentious encouragement of some abandoned
                    priests who had found their way to Brazil. Over these persons the Jesuits had no
                    authority; and it was not until the arrival of the first bishop of Brazil in
                    1552, that anything like an efficient check was imposed upon them. Next year
                    Sousa was succeeded by Duarte da Costa, who brought with him a reinforcement of
                    Jesuits, at the head of whom was Luis de Gran, appointed, with Nobrega the chief
                    of the first mission, joint provincial of Brazil.</p>
                <p>Nobrega’s first act was one which has exercised the most beneficial influence
                    over the social system of Brazil, namely, the establishment of a college on the
                    then unreclaimed plains of Piratininga. It was named S. Paulo, and has been at
                    once the source whence knowledge and civilization have been diffused through
                    Brazil, and the nucleus of a colony of its manliest and hardiest citizens, which
                    sent out successive swarms of hardy adventurers to people the interior. The good
                    intentions of the Jesuits were in part frustrated by the opposition of Duarte
                    the governor; and it was not until 1558, when Mem de Sa was sent out to
                    supersede him, that their projects were allowed free scope.</p>
                <p>Rio de Janeiro was first occupied by French settlers. Nicholas Durand de
                    Villegagnon, a bold and skilful seaman, having visited Brazil, saw at once the
                    advantages which might accrue to his country from a settlement there. In order
                    to secure the interest of Coligny, he gave out that his projected colony was
                    intended to serve as a place of refuge for the persecuted Huguenots. Under the
                    patronage of that admiral, he arrived at Rio de Janeiro in 1558 with a train of
                    numerous and respectable colonists. As soon, however, as he thought his power
                    secure, he threw off the mask, and began to harass and oppress the Huguenots by
                    every means he could devise. Many of them were forced by his tyranny to return
                    to France; and ten thousand Protestants, ready to embark for the new colony,
                    were deterred by their representations. Villegagnon, finding his force much
                    diminished in consequence of his treachery, sailed for France in quest of
                    recruits; and during his absence the Portuguese governor, by order of his court,
                    attacked and dispersed the settlement. For some years the French kept up a kind
                    of bush warfare; but in 1567 the Portuguese succeeded in establishing a
                    settlement at Rio.</p>
                <p>Mem de Sa continued to hold the reins of government in Brazil upon terms of the
                    best understanding with the clergy, and to the great advantage of the colonies,
                    for fourteen years. On the expiration of his power, which was nearly
                    contemporary with that of his life, an attempt was made to divide Brazil into
                    two governments; but this having failed, the territory was reunited in 1578, the
                    year in which Diego Laurenço da Veiga was appointed governor. At this time the
                    colonies, although not yet independent of supplies from the mother country, were
                    in a flourishing condition: but the usurpation of the crown <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n273/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0273-0230"/> of Portugal by Philip II. changed the aspect of
                    affairs. Brazil, believed to be inferior to the Spanish possessions in mines,
                    was consequently abandoned in comparative neglect for the period intervening
                    between 1578 and 1640, during which it continued an apanage of Spain.</p>
                <p>No sooner had Brazil passed under the Spanish crown, than English adventurers
                    directed their hostile enterprises against its shores. In 1586 Witherington
                    plundered Bahia; in 1591 Cavendish burned S. Vincente; in 1595 Lancaster took
                    Olinda. These exploits, however, were transient in their effects. In 1612 the
                    French attempted to found a permanent colony in the island of Marajô, where they
                    succeeded in maintaining themselves till 1618. This attempt led to the erection
                    of Maranhao and Parâ into a separate <hi rend="italic">Estado.</hi> But it was
                    on the part of the Dutch that the most skilful and pertinacious efforts were
                    made for securing a footing in Brazil; and they alone of all the rivals of the
                    Portuguese have left traces of their presence in the national spirit and
                    institutions of Brazil.</p>
                <p>The success of the Dutch East India Company led to the establishment of a similar
                    one for the West Indies, to which a monopoly of the trade to America and Africa
                    was granted. This body despatched in 1624 a fleet against Bahia. The town
                    yielded almost without a struggle. The fleet soon after sailed, a squadron being
                    detached against Angola, with the intention of taking possession of that colony,
                    in order to secure a supply of slaves The Portuguese, in the meanwhile, began to
                    collect for the purpose of expelling the permanent intruders, and the hearty
                    co-operation of all the natives against the invaders having been obtained
                    through the descendants of Caramaru, the Dutch were obliged to capitulate in May
                    1625. The honours bestowed upon the Indian chiefs for their assistance in this
                    war broke down in a great measure the barrier between the two races; and there
                    is at this day a greater admixture of their blood among the better classes in
                    Bahia than is to be found elsewhere in Brazil.</p>
                <p>In 1630 the Dutch attempted again to effect a settlement; and Olinda yielded
                    after a feeble resistance. They were unable, however, to extend their power
                    beyond the limits of the town, until the arrival of Count Maurice of Nassau in
                    1630. His first step was to introduce a regular government among his countrymen;
                    his second, to send to the African coast one of his officers, who took
                    possession of a Portuguese settlement, and thus secured a supply of slaves. In
                    the course of four years, the limited period of his government, he succeeded in
                    confirming the Dutch supremacy along the coast of Brazil from the mouth of the
                    S, Francisco to Maranhao. He promoted the amalgamation of the different races,
                    and sought to conciliate the Portuguese by the confidence he reposed in them.
                    His object was to found a great empire; but this was a project at variance with
                    the wishes of his employers—an association of merchants, who were dissatisfied
                    because the wealth which they expected to see flowing into their coffers was
                    expended in promoting the permanent interests of a distant country. Count
                    Maurice was recalled in 1644. His successors possessed neither his political nor
                    his military talents, and had to contend with more energetic enemies.</p>
                <p>In 1640 the revolution which placed the house of Bragança on the throne of
                    Portugal restored Brazil to masters more inclined to promote its interests and
                    assert its possession than the Spaniards. It was indeed high time that some
                    exertion should be made. The northern provinces had fallen into the power of
                    Holland; the southern, peopled in a great measure by the hardy descendants of
                    the successive colonists who had issued on all sides from the central
                    establishment of S. Paulo, had learned from their habits of unaided and
                    successful enterprize to court independence. They had ascended the waters of the
                    Paraguay to their sources. They had extended their limits southwards till they
                    reached the Spanish settlements on La Plata. They had reduced to slavery
                    numerous tribes of the natives. They were rich in cattle, and had commenced the
                    discovery of the mines. When, therefore, the inhabitants of S. Paulo saw
                    themselves about to be transferred, as a dependency of Portugal, from one master
                    to another, they conceived the idea of erecting their country into an
                    independent state. Their attempt, however, was frustrated by Amador Bueno, the
                    person whom they had selected for their king. When the people shouted “Long live
                    King Amador,” he cried out “Long live Joäo IV.,” and took refuge in a convent.
                    The multitude, left without a leader, acquiesced, and this important province
                    was secured to the house of Bragança.</p>
                <p>Rio and Santos, although both evinced a desire of independence, followed the
                    example of the Paulistas. Bahia, as capital of the Brazilian states, felt that
                    its ascendency depended upon the union with Portugal. The Government thus left
                    in quiet possession of the rest of Brazil, had time to concentrate its attention
                    upon the Dutch conquests. The crown of Portugal was, however, much too weak to
                    adopt energetic measures. The tyranny of the successors of Nassau, by alienating
                    the minds of the Portuguese and natives, drove them to revolt before any steps
                    were taken in the mother country for the reconquest of its colonies. Joao
                    Fernandes Vieyra, a native of Madeira, organized the insurrection which broke
                    out in 1645. This insurrection gave birth to one of those wars in which a whole
                    nation, destitute of pecuniary resources, military organization, and skilful
                    leaders, is opposed to a handful of soldiers advantageously posted and well
                    officered. But brute force is unable to contend with scientific valour. Vieyra,
                    who had the sense to see this, repaired to the court of Portugal, and
                    discovering the weakness and poverty of the executive, suggested the
                    establishment of a company similar to that which in Holland had proved so
                    successful. His plan, notwithstanding the opposition of the priests, was
                    approved of, and in 1649 the Brazil Company of Portugal sent out its first
                    fleet. After a most sanguinary war, Vieyra was enabled in 1654 to present the
                    keys of Olinda to the royal commander, and to restore to his monarch the
                    undivided empire of Brazil. After this, except some inroads on the frontiers,
                    the only foreign invasion which Brazil had to suffer was from France. In 1710 a
                    squadron, commanded by Duclerc, disembarked 1000 men, and attacked Rio de
                    Janeiro. After having lost half of his men in a battle, Duclerc and all his
                    surviving companions were made prisoners. The governor treated them cruelly. A
                    new squadron with 6000 troops was intrusted to the famous admiral Duguay Trouin
                    to revenge this injury. They arrived at Rio on the 12th September 1711. After
                    four days of hard fighting the town was taken. The governor retreated to a
                    position out of it, and was only awaiting reinforcements from Minas to retake
                    it; but Duguay Trouin threatening to burn it, he was obliged on the 10th October
                    to sign a capitulation, and pay to the French admiral 610,000 crusados, 500
                    cases of sugar, and provisions for the return of the fleet to Europe. Duguay
                    Trouin departed to Bahia to obtain fresh spoils; but having lost in a storm two
                    of his best ships, with an important part of the money received, he renounced
                    this plan and returned directly to France.</p>
                <p>After this the Portuguese governed undisturbed their colony. The approach of
                    foreign traders was prohibited, while the regalities reserved by the crown
                    drained the country of a great proportion of its wealth.</p>
                <p>The important part which the inhabitants of Säo Paulo have played in the history
                    of Brazil has been already adverted to. The establishment of the Jesuit college
                    had attracted settlers to its neighbourhood, and frequent <pb break="no"

                    the district and the colonists. A hardy and enterprising race of men had sprung
                    from this mixture, who, first searching whether their new country were rich in
                    metals, soon began adventurous raids into the interior, making excursions also
                    against the remote Indian tribes with a view to obtaining slaves, and from the
                    year 1629 onwards repeatedly attacked the Indian reductions of the Jesuits in
                    Paraguay, although both provinces were then nominally subject to the crown of
                    Spain. Other bands penetrated into Minas and still farther north and westward,
                    discovering mines there and in Goyaz and Cuyabâ. New colonies were thus formed
                    round those districts in which gold had been found, and in the beginning of the
                    18th century five principal settlements in Minas Geraes had been elevated by
                    royal charter to the privileges of towns. In 1720 this district was separated
                    from Sâo Paulo, to which it had previously been dependent. As early as 1618 a
                    code of laws for the regulation of the mining industry had been drawn up by
                    Philip III., the executive and judicial functions in the mining districts being
                    vested in a <hi rend="italic">}τroυedor,</hi> and the fiscal in a treasurer, who
                    received the royal fifths and superintended the weighing of all the gold,
                    rendering a yearly account of all discoveries and produce. For many years,
                    however, these laws were little more than a dead letter. The same infatuated
                    passion for mining speculation which had characterized the Spanish settlers in
                    South America now began to actuate the Portuguese; labourers and capital were
                    drained off to the mining districts, and Brazil, which had hitherto in great
                    measure supplied Europe with sugar, sank before the competition of the English
                    and French. A new source of wealth was now opened up; some adventurers from
                    Villa do Principe in Minas, going north to the Seria Frι&lt;√, made the
                    discovery of diamonds about the year 1710, but it was not till 1730 that the
                    discovery was for the first time announced to the Government, which immediately
                    declared them <hi rend="italic">regalia.</hi> While the population of Brazil
                    continued to increase, the moral and intellectual culture of its inhabitants was
                    left in great measure to chance; they grew up with those robust and healthy
                    sentiments which are engendered by the absence of false teachers, but with a
                    repugnance to legal ordinances, and encouraged in their ascendency over the
                    Indians to habits of violence and oppression. The Jesuits from the first moment
                    of their landing in Brazil had constituted themselves the protectors of the
                    natives, and though strenuously opposed by the colonists and ordinary clergy,
                    had gathered the Indians together in many <hi rend="italic">aldeas,</hi> over
                    which officials of their order exercised spiritual and temporal authority. A
                    more efficacious stop, however, was put to the persecution of the Indians by the
                    importation of large numbers of negroes from the Portuguese possessions in
                    Africa, these being found more active and serviceable than the native
                    tribes.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese Government, under the administration of Carvalho, afterwards
                    marquis of Pombal, attempted to extend to Brazil the bold spirit of innovation
                    which directed all his efforts. The proud minister had been resisted in his
                    plans of reform at home by the Jesuits, and, determining to attack the power of
                    the order, first deprived them of all temporal power in the state of Maranhfco
                    and Para. These ordinances soon spread to the whole of Brazil, and a pretext
                    being found in the suspicion of Jesuit influence in some partial revolts of the
                    Indian troops on the B,io Negro, the order was expelled from Brazil under circum
                    stances of great severity in 1760. The Brazilian Company founded by Vieyra,
                    which so materially contributed to preserve its South American possessions to
                    Portugal, had been abolished in 1721 by Joào V.; but such an instrument being
                    well suited to the bold spirit of Pombal, he established a chartered company
                    again in 1755, to trade exclusively with Maranhäo and Parâ; and in 1759, in
                    spite of the remonstrance of the British Factory at Lisbon, formed another
                    company for Paraiba and Pernambuco. Pombal’s arrangements extended also to the
                    interior of the country, where he extinguished at once the now indefinite and
                    oppressive claims of the original donatories of the captaincies, and
                    strengthened and enforced the regulations of the mining districts. The policy of
                    many of Pombal’s measures is more than questionable; but his admission of all
                    races to equal rights in the eye of the law, his abolition of feudal privileges,
                    and the firmer organization of the powers of the land which he introduced,
                    powerfully co-operated towards the development of the capabilities of Brazil.
                    Yet on the death of his king and patron in 1777, when court intrigue forced him
                    from his high station, he who had done so much for his country’s institutions
                    was reviled on all hands.</p>
                <p>The most important feature in the history of Brazil during the first thirty years
                    following the retirement of Pombal was the conspiracy of Minas in 1789. The
                    successful issue of the recent revolution of the English colonies in North
                    America had filled the minds of some of the more educated youth of that
                    province; and in imitation, a project to throw off the Portuguese yoke was
                    formed,—a cavalry officer, Silva Xavier, nicknamed Tira-dentes (toothdrawer),
                    being the chief conspirator. But the plot being discovered during their
                    inactivity, the conspirators were banished to Africa, and Tira-dentes, the
                    leader, was hanged. Thenceforward affairs went on prosperously; the mining
                    districts continued to be enlarged; the trading companies of the littoral
                    provinces were abolished, but the impulse they had given to agriculture
                    remained.</p>
                <p>Removed from all communication with the rest of the world except through the
                    mother country, Brazil remained unaffected by the first years of the great
                    revolutionary war in Europe. Indirectly, however, the fate of this isolated
                    country was decided by the consequences of the French Revolution. Brazil is the
                    only instance of a colony becoming the seat of the Government of its own mother
                    country, and this was the work of Napoleon. When he resolved upon the invasion
                    and conquest of Portugal, the Prince Regent, afterwards Dorn Joâo VI., having no
                    means of resistance, decided to take refuge in Brazil. He created a regency in
                    Lisbon, and departed for Brazil on the 29th November 1807, accompanied by the
                    Queen Donna Maria I., the royal family, all the great officers of state, a large
                    part of the nobility, and numerous retainers. They arrived at Bahia on the 21st
                    January 1808, and were received with enthusiasm. The regent was requested to
                    establish there the seat of his government, but a more secure asylum presented
                    itself in Rio de Janeiro, where the royal fugitives arrived on the 7th of March.
                    Before leaving Bahia Don John took the first step to emancipate Brazil, opening
                    its ports to foreign commerce, and permitting the export of all Brazilian
                    produce under any flag, the royal monopolies of diamonds and Brazil-wood
                    excepted. Once established in Rio de Janeiro, the government of the regent was
                    directed to the creation of an administrative machinery for the dominions that
                    remained to him as they existed in Portugal. Besides the ministry which had come
                    with the regent, the council of state, and the departments of the four
                    ministries of home, finances, war, and marine then existing, there were created
                    in the course of one year a supreme court of justice, a board of patronage and
                    administration of the property of the church and military orders, an inferior
                    court of appeal, the court of exchequer and royal treasury, the royal mint, bank
                    of Brazil, royal printing-office, powder-mills on a large scale, and a supreme
                    military court. The maintenance of the court, and the salaries of so large a
                    number of high officials, entailed the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n275/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0275-0232"/> imposition of new taxes to meet these expenses.
                    Notwithstanding this the expenses continued to augment, and the Government had
                    recourse to the reprehensible measure of altering the money standard, and the
                    whole monetary system was soon thrown into the greatest confusion, a state of
                    things from which the country suffers even at the present day. The bank, in
                    addition to its private functions, farmed many of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >regalia,</hi> and was in the practice of advancing large sums to the state,
                    transactions which gave rise to extensive corruption, and terminated some years
                    later in the breaking of the bank.</p>
                <p>Thus the Government of the prince regent began its career in the new world with
                    dangerous errors in the financial system; yet the increased activity which a
                    multitude of new customers and the increase of circulating medium gave to the
                    trade of Rio, added a new stimulus to the industry of the whole nation. Numbers
                    of English artisans and shipbuilders, Swedish iron-founders, German engineers,
                    and French manufacturers sought fortunes in the new country, and diffused
                    industry by their example.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 1809, in retaliation of the occupation of Portugal, an
                    expedition was sent from Parâ to the French colony of Guiana, and after some
                    fighting this part of Guiana was incorporated with Brazil. This conquest was,
                    however, of short duration; for, by the treaty of Vienna in 1815, the colony was
                    restored to France. Its occupation contributed to the improvement of agriculture
                    in Brazil; it had been the policy of Portugal up to this time to separate the
                    productions of its colonies, to reserve sugar for Brazil, and spices to the East
                    Indies, and to prohibit the cultivation of these in the African possessions.
                    Now, however, many plants were imported not only from Guiana but from India and
                    Africa, cultivated in the Royal Botanic Garden, and thence distributed. The same
                    principle which dictated the conquest of French Guiana originated attempts to
                    seize the Spanish colonies of Monte Video aud Buenos Ayres, Portugal being also
                    at war with Spain. The chiefs of these colonies were invited to place them under
                    the protection of the Portuguese crown, but these at first affecting loyalty to
                    Spain declined the offer, then threw off the mask and declared themselves
                    independent, and the Spanish governor, Elio, was afterwards defeated by Artigas,
                    the leader of the independents.</p>
                <p>The inroads made on the frontiers of Rio Grande and Sâo Paulo decided the court
                    of Rio to take possession of Monte Video; a force of 5000 troops was sent
                    thither from Portugal, together with a Brazilian corps; and the irregulars of
                    Artigas, unable to withstand disciplined troops, were forced, after a total
                    defeat, to take refuge beyond the River Uruguay. The Portuguese took possession
                    of the city of Monte Video in January 1817, and the territory of Missiones was
                    afterwards occupied. The importance which Brazil was acquiring decided the
                    regent to give it the title of kingdom, and by decree of the 16th January 1815,
                    the Portuguese sovereignty thenceforward took, the title of the United Kingdom
                    of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Thus the old colonial government disappeared
                    even in name. In March 1816 the Queen Donna Maria I. died, and the prince regent
                    became king under the title of Dorn Joâo VI.</p>
                <p>Although Brazil had now become in fact the head of its own mother country, the
                    government was not in the hands of Brazilians, but of the Portuguese, who had
                    followed the court The discontent arising among Brazilians from this cause was
                    heightened by a decree assigning a heavy tax on the chief Brazilian custom
                    houses, to be in operation for forty years, for the benefit of the Portuguese
                    noblemen who had suffered during the war with France. The amiable character of
                    the lang preserved his own popularity, but the Government was ignorant and
                    profligate, justice was ill administered, negligence and disorder reigned in all
                    its departments. Nor was the discontent less in Portugal on account of its
                    anomalous position. These causes and the fermentation of liberal principles
                    produced by the French Revolution originated a conspiracy in Lisbon in 1817,
                    which was, however, discovered in time to prevent its success. A similar plot
                    and rebellion took place in the province of Pernambuco, where the inhabitants of
                    the important commercial city of Recife were jealous of Rio and the sacrifices
                    they were compelled to make for the support of the luxurious court there.
                    Another conspiracy to establish a republican government was promptly smothered
                    in Bahia, and the outbreak in Pernambuco was put down after a republic had been
                    formed there for ninety days. Still the progress of the republican spirit in
                    Brazil caused Dorn Joâo to send to Portugal for bodies of picked troops, which
                    were stationed throughout the provincial capitals. In Portugal the popular
                    discontent produced the revolution of 1820, when representative government was
                    proclaimed—the Spanish constitution of 1812 being provisionally adopted. In Rio,
                    the Portuguese troops with which the king had surrounded himself as a defence
                    against the liberal spirit of the Brazilians, took up arms on the 26th February
                    1821, to force him to accept the system proclaimed in Portugal. The prince Dorn
                    Pedro, heir to the crown, who now for the first time took part in public
                    affairs, actively exerted himself as a negotiator between the king and the
                    troops, who were joined by bodies of the people. After attempting a compromise
                    the king finally submitted, took the oath, and named a new ministry. The idea of
                    free government filled the people with enthusiasm, and the principles of a
                    representative legislature were freely adopted, the first care being for the
                    election of deputies to the <hi rend="italic">Cortes</hi> of Lisbon to take part
                    in framing the new constitution. As the king could not abandon Portugal to
                    itself he determined at first to send the prince thither as regent, but Dorn
                    Pedro had acquired such popularity by his conduct in the revolution, and had
                    exhibited such a thirst for glory, that the king feared to trust his adventurous
                    spirit in Europe, and decided to go himself. The Brazilian deputies on arriving
                    in Lisbon expressed dissatisfaction with the Cortes for having begun the framing
                    of the constitution before their arrival, for Brazil could not be treated as a
                    secondary part of the monarchy. Sharp discussions and angry words passed between
                    the Brazilian and Portuguese deputies, the news of which excited great
                    discontent in Brazil. An insulting decree was passed in the Cortes, ordering the
                    prince Dorn Pedro to come to Europe, which filled the Brazilians with alarm;
                    they foresaw that without a central authority the country would fall back to its
                    former colonial state subject to Portugal. The Provisional Government of Sâo
                    Paulo, influenced by the brothers Andradas, began a movement for independence by
                    asking the prince to disobey the Cortes and remain in Brazil, and the council of
                    Rio de Janeiro followed with a similar representation, to which the prince
                    assented. The Portuguese troops of the capital at first assumed a coercive
                    attitude, but were forced to give way before the ardour and military
                    preparations of the Brazilians, and submitted to embark for Portugal. These
                    scenes were repeated in Pernambuco, where the Portuguese, after various
                    conflicts, were obliged to leave the country; in Bahia, however, as well as in
                    Maranhao and Parâ, the Portuguese prevailed. In Rio the agitation for
                    independence continued. The two brothers Andradas were called to the ministry;
                    and the municipal council conferred upon the prince regent the title of
                    Perpetual Defender of Brazil. With great activity he set off to the central
                    provinces of Minas and Säo Paulo to suppress disaffected movements and direct
                    the revolution. In Sâo Paulo, on the 7th of September 1822, he proclaimed the
                    independence of Brazil On his return to Rio de <pb break="no"

                    constitutional emperor with great enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>The Cortes at Lisbon chose Bahia as a centre for resisting the independence, and
                    large forces were sent thither. But the city was vigorously besieged by the
                    Brazilians by land, and finally the Portuguese were obliged to re-embark on the
                    2d of July 1823. A Brazilian squadron, under command of Lord Cochrane, attacked
                    the Portuguese vessels, embarrassed with troops, and took several of them.
                    Taylor, another Englishman in Brazilian service, followed the vessels across the
                    Atlantic, and even captured some of the ships in sight of the land of Portugal.
                    The troops in Monte Video also embarked for Portugal, and the Banda Oriental
                    remained a part of Brazil with the title of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Provincia</hi><hi rend="italic">Cisplatina.</hi> Before the end of 1823 the
                    authority of the new emperor and the independence of Brazil were undisputed
                    throughout the whole country.</p>
                <p>Republican movements now began to spread, to suppress which the authorities made
                    use of the Portuguese remaining in the country; and the disposition of the
                    etnperor to consider these as his firmest supporters much influenced the course
                    of his Government and his future destiny. The two Andradas, who imagined they
                    could govern the young emperor as a sovereign of their own creation, encountered
                    great opposition in the constitutional assembly, which had been opened in Rio in
                    May 1823, to discuss the project of a new constitution. In July the emperor
                    resolved to dismiss them and form a new ministry, but against this the brothers
                    raised a violent opposition. In November the emperor put an end to the angry
                    debates which ensued in the assembly by dissolving it, exiling the Andradas to
                    France, and convoking a new assembly to deliberate on a proposed constitution
                    more liberal than the former project. The proclamation of a republic in the
                    provinces of Pernambuco and Cearà, with the rebellion cf the Cisplatina
                    province, favoured by Buenos Ayres and its ultimate loss to Brazil, were the
                    result of the <hi rend="italic">coup</hi><hi rend="italic">d'état</hi> of
                    November 1823. The Brazilians were universally discontented,—on one side fearing
                    absolutism if they supported the emperor, on the other anarchy if he fell.
                    Knowing the danger of an undefined position, the emperor caused the councils to
                    dispense with their deliberations, and adopt, as the constitution of the empire,
                    the project framed by the council of state. Accordingly, on March 25, 1824, the
                    emperor swore to the constitution with great solemnity and public rejoicings. By
                    this stroke of policy he saved himself and Brazil. Negotiations were opened in
                    London between the Brazilian and Portuguese plenipotentiaries, treating for the
                    recognition of the independence of Brazil; and on the 25th of August 1825 a
                    treaty was signed by which the Portuguese king, Dom Joäo VI., assumed the title
                    of Emperor of Brazil, and immediately abdicated in favour of his son,
                    acknowledging Brazil as an independent empire , but the treaty obliged Brazil to
                    take upon herself the Portuguese debt, amounting to nearly two millions
                    sterling.</p>
                <p>The rebellion of the Banda Oriental was followed by a declaration of war with
                    Buenos Ayres which had supported it, and operations by sea and land were
                    conducted against that republic in a feeble <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> way.
                    Meanwhile the well-deserved popularity of the emperor began to decline. He had
                    given himself up to the influence of the Portuguese; the most popular men ∙who
                    had worked for the independence were banished; and a continual change of
                    ministry showed a disposition on the part of the sovereign to prosecute
                    obstinately measures of which his advisers disapproved. His popularity was
                    regained, however, to some extent, when, on the death of his father, he was
                    unanimously acknowledged king of Portugal, and especially when he abdicated that
                    crown in favour of his daughter, Donna Maria; but his line of policy was not
                    altered, and commercial treaties entered into with European states conceding
                    them favours, which were popularly considered to be injurious to Brazilian
                    trade, met with bitter censure.</p>
                <p>During the year 1827 the public debt was consolidated, and a department was
                    created for the application of a sinking fund.</p>
                <p>The year 1828 was a calamitous one for Brazil. It began with the defeat of the
                    Brazilian army by the Argen tine forces, and this entirely through the
                    incapacity of the commander-in-chief; and misunderstandings, afterwards
                    compensated by humbling money-payments on the part of Brazil, arose with the
                    United States, France, and England, on account of merchant vessels captured by
                    the Brazilian squadron blockading Buenos Ayres. Financial embarrassments
                    increased to an alarming extent; the emperor was compelled by the British
                    Government to make peace with Buenos Ayres and to renounce the Banda Oriental;
                    and to fill the sum of disasters Don Miguel had treacherously usurped the crown
                    of Portugal. It was under these unlucky auspices that the elections of new
                    deputies took place in 1829. As was expected the result was the election
                    everywhere of ultra-liberals opposed to the emperor, and in the succeeding year
                    people everywhere exhibited their disaffection. During the session of 1830 the
                    chambers adopted a criminal code in which punishment by death for political
                    offences was abolished. It was openly suggested in the journals to reform the
                    constitution by turning Brazil into independent federal provinces, governed by
                    authorities popularly elected, as in the United States. Alarmed at length at the
                    ground gained by this idea in the provinces, the emperor set off to Minas to
                    stir up the former enthusiasm in his favour from recollections of the
                    independence, but was coldly received. On his return to Rio in March 1831 scenes
                    of disorder occurred, and great agitation among the Liberal party. Imagining
                    himself sure of a brilliant destiny in Europe if he lost his Brazilian crown,
                    the emperor attempted to risk a decisive attack against the Liberals, and to
                    form a new ministry composed of men favourable to absolutism. This step caused
                    excited public meetings in the capital, which were joined in by the troops, and
                    deputations went to ask the emperor to dismiss the unpopular ministry. He
                    replied by dissolving the ministry without naming another, and by abdicating the
                    crown in favour of the heir apparent, then only five years of age. Dorn Pedro
                    immediately embarked in an English ship, leaving the new Emperor Dorn Pedro II.
                    and the princesses Januaria, Francisca, and Paula. The subsequent career of this
                    unfortunate prince belongs to the history of Portugal.</p>
                <p>A provisional and afterwards a permanent regency, composed of three members, was
                    now formed in Brazil, but scenes of disorder succeeded, and discussions and
                    struggles between the republican party and the Government, and a reactionary
                    third party in favour of the restoration of Dorn Pedro, occupied the succeeding
                    years. In 1834 a reform which was well received consisted in the alteration of
                    the regency, from that of three members elected by the legislative chambers, to
                    one regent chosen by the whole of the electors in the same manner as the
                    deputies; and the councils of the provinces were replaced by legislative
                    provincial assemblies, Virtually, this was a republican government like that of
                    the United States, for no difference existed in the mode of election of the
                    regent from that of a president. The ex-minister Feijoô was chosen for this
                    office. With the exception of Parà and Rio Grande the provinces were at peace,
                    but these were in open rebellion; the former was reduced to obedience, but in
                    the latter, though the imperial troops occupied the town, the country <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n277/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0277-0234"/> was ravaged by its warlike inhabitants. The
                    regent was now accused of conniving at this rebellion, and the opposition of the
                    Chamber of Deputies became so violent as to necessitate his resignation. Araujo
                    Lima, minister of the home department, who strove to give his government the
                    character of a monarchical reaction against the principles of democracy, was
                    chosen by a large majority in his stead. The experiment of republican government
                    had proved so discreditable, and had so wearied the country of cabals, that men
                    hitherto known for their sympathy with democratic principles became more
                    monarchical than the regent himself; and under this influence a movement to give
                    the regency into the hands of the Princess Donna Januaria, now in her 18th year,
                    was set on foot. It was soon perceived, however, that if the empire could be
                    governed by a princess of eighteen it could be managed better by the emperor
                    himself, who was then fourteen.</p>
                <p>A bill was accordingly presented to legislature dispensing with the age of the
                    emperor and declaring his majority, which after a noisy discussion was carried.
                    The majority of the Emperor Dorn Pedro II. was proclaimed on the 23d July 1840.
                    Several ministries, in which various parties predominated for a time, now
                    governed the country till 1848, during which period the rebellious province of
                    Rio Grande was pacified, more by negotiation than force of arms. In 1848
                    hostilities were roused with the British Government through the neglect shown by
                    the Brazilians in putting in force a treaty for the abolition of the slave
                    trade, which had been concluded as far back as 1826; on the other hand the
                    governor of Buenos Ayres, General Rosas, was endeavouring to stir up revolution
                    again in Rio Grande. The appearance of yellow fever in 1849, until then unknown
                    in Brazil, was attributed to the importation of slaves. Public opinion declared
                    against the traffic; severe laws were passed against it, and were so firmly
                    enforced that in 1853 not a single disembarkation took place. The ministry of
                    the Visconde de Olinda in 1849 entered into alliances with the governors of
                    Monte Video, Paraguay, and the states of Entre Rios and Corrientes, for the
                    purpose of maintaining the integrity of the republics of Uruguay and Paraguay,
                    which Rosas intended to re-unite to Buenos Ayres, and the troops of Rosas which
                    besieged Monte Video were forced to capitulate. Rosas then declared war formally
                    against Brazil. An army of Correntine, Uruguayan, and Brazilian troops, under
                    General Urquiza, assisted by a Brazilian naval squadron, advanced on Buenos
                    Ayres, completely routed the forces of Rosas, and crushed for ever the power of
                    that dictator. From 1844 Brazil was free from intestine commotions, and had
                    resumed its activity. Public works and education were advanced, and the finances
                    rose to a degree of prosperity previously unknown.</p>
                <p>In 1855 the emperor of Brazil sent a squadron of eleven men-of-war and as many
                    transports up the ParanA to adjust several questions pending between the empire
                    and the Republic of Paraguay, the most important of which was that of the right
                    of way by the Paraguay River to the interior Brazilian province of Matto Grosso.
                    This right had been in dispute for several years. The expedition was not
                    permitted to ascend the River Paraguay, and returned completely foiled in its
                    main purpose. Though the discord resulting between the states on account of this
                    failure was subsequently allayed for a time by a treaty granting to Brazil the
                    right to navigate the river, every obstacle was thrown in the way by the
                    Paraguayan Government, and indignities of all kinds were offered not only to
                    Brazil but to the representatives of the Argentine and the United States. In
                    1864 the ambitious dictator of Paraguay, Francisco Solano Lopez, without
                    previous declaration of war, captured a Brazilian vessel in the Paraguay, and
                    rapidly followed up this outrage by an armed invasion of the provinces of Matto
                    Grosso and Rio Grande in Brazil, and that of Corrientes in the Argentine
                    Republic. A triple alliance of the invaded states with Uruguay ensued, and the
                    tide of war was soon turned from being an offensive one on the part of Paraguay
                    to a defensive struggle within that republic against the superior number of the
                    allies. So strong was the natural position of Paraguay, however, and so complete
                    the subjection of its inhabitants to the will of the dictator, that it was not
                    until the year 1870, after the republic had been completely drained of its
                    manhood and resources, that the long war was terminated by the capture and death
                    of Lopez with his last handful of men by the pursuing Brazilians. From its
                    duration and frequent battles and sieges this war involved an immense sacrifice
                    of life to Brazil, the army in the field having been constantly maintained at
                    between 20,000 and 30,000 men, and the expenditure in maintaining it was very
                    great, having been calculated at upwards of fifty millions sterling. Large
                    deficits in the financial budgets of the state resulted, involving increased
                    taxation and the contracting of loans from foreign countries.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this the sources of public wealth in Brazil were unaffected, and
                    commerce continued steadily to increase. A grand social reform was effected in
                    the law passed in September 1871, which enacted that from that date every child
                    born of slave parents should be free, and also declared all the slaves belonging
                    to the state or to the imperial household free from that time. The same law
                    provided an emancipation fund, to be annually applied to the ransom of a certain
                    number of slaves owned by private individuals. Since that time the emancipation
                    of slaves has gone on rapidly, the work having been promoted largely by the
                    slave owners and by private philanthropy. It is estimated that since the
                    cessation of the importing of slaves in 1853, and especially after the enactment
                    of 1871, not less than a million of slaves have obtained their freedom; and the
                    total extinction of slavery within the empire is not far distant. From the
                    extremely rapid progress of. this movement difficulties have been experienced in
                    a considerable degree in procuring a sufficient supply of labour for the
                    Brazilian plantations, but the general effect of the law has been to give new
                    directions to the employment of capital, and the construction of railroads and
                    telegraphs, and the improvement of internal communication by roads and rivers
                    have been largely promoted. Attention has also been strongly directed towards
                    the further development of the provinces by the increase of European
                    immigration. Enterprises of all kinds have multiplied, and public instruction
                    has received a vigorous impulse.</p>
                <p>The Emperor Dorn Pedro II. and the empress, a sister of the king of Naples, are
                    universally beloved and respected for their intellectual and moral endowments,
                    and their affectionate interest in the welfare of their subjects. Princess
                    Isabel, born in July 1846, and her son born in October 1875, are their only
                    surviving offspring.</p>
                <p>Until after the year 1872, when a complete census of the empire was begun, every
                    estimate of the population of Brazil was based upon the official returns of
                    1817-18, and these have consequently been mere approximations, varying very
                    considerably in the hands of different authors. In the first census referred to
                    the whole number of people was 4,396,000, including an estimated number of
                    800,000 Indians; in 1850 the total was reckoned roundly at 7,000,000; andin 1860
                    at 8,000,000.</p>
                <p>In the following table the results of the census of 1872 have been incorporated,
                    as far as these have yet been published, the remaining figures being made up

                <p>* The population figures marked thus are the results of the census begun in 1872;

                <p>The population of Brazil presents a number of distinct types as well as many
                    varieties blended from these. The aboriginal Indians of the country have to a
                    large extent become amalgamated with the settled population, especially in the
                    eastern or maritime provinces; but in the vast forests and grass plains of the
                    interior they remain in a more or less completely savage condition. In general
                    description the Indians are of copper colour, of middle height, thick-set,
                    broad-chested, and muscular, with wellshaped limbs and small hands and feet. The
                    hair is black, thick, and straight; the features broad, cheek bones not
                    generally prominent, eyes black and sometimes oblique, like those of the Tatar
                    races of Eastern Asia; they are of apathetic and undemonstrative nature. Their
                    tribes and subdivisions, scattered over the enormous interior area, are
                    countless; though these may vary somewhat in physical characteristics, in
                    language, and customs, they belong apparently to one original stock, called by
                    ethnographers, the Tupi-Guarani. Most of the semi-civilized Indians of Brazil,
                    especially those of the eastern provinces, speak the Lingoa-Geral, a language
                    adapted by the Jesuit missionaries from the original idiom of the Tupinambaras,
                    one of the larger eastern tribes. The less civilized and savage Indians are
                    termed collectively Gentios (heathens) by the Brazilians. The only tribe of the
                    eastern coastlands which has resisted civilization in some portion of its
                    numbers is that of the Botocudos, inhabiting the forests between the Rio Doce
                    and Rio Pardo, sunk in the lowest barbarism and fast disappearing. From the
                    European— chiefly Portuguese—immigrants, by mixture with the native Indians, are
                    descended the Mamelucos, a variety which first made itself prominent in inland
                    raids and conquests in the southern provinces, especially from the neighbourhood
                    of Säo Paulo, whence they were named Paulistas. The negroes, introduced from
                    Africa in immense numbers, constitute one of the largest elements of population.
                    From these, by intercourse with the white race, have sprung the mulattoes, and
                    the descendants of these, becoming progressively whiter. The Brazilian creoles,
                    who call themselves Brazileiros, descendants of these mixed races, prove little
                    inferior in capacity, physical strength, or intelligence to the pure race of
                    Portuguese. The rapidly progressing emancipation of the African slaves in Brazil
                    has been referred to previously. A strong desire pervades those of the slaves
                    not born in Brazil, even though they may have been made captives when mere
                    infants, to return to Africa. Associations have been formed among them in many
                    parts, both for the purchase of the freedom of those still in bondage and for
                    sending the freedmen back to their native country, a movement which has actually
                    taken place to a considerable extent. A result of the emancipation and
                    consequent deficiency of labour, chiefly felt in the neighbourhood of Rio and
                    the provinces to the south of it, has been the deportation of large numbers of
                    slaves from the northern to the more southerly provinces.</p>
                <p>An increase in the population of Brazil being one of the prime requisites for the
                    advancement of the country, the state encourages immigration by every possible
                    means, and especially of late years, since the labour question began to be
                    serious, has made great efforts to entice European colonists. For this end an
                    official agency was established at Rio de Janeiro in 1864, to provide for the
                    conveyance and landing of colonists and for forwarding these to the various
                    localities. The passage from whatever country to Brazil, and thence to the
                    special colony inland, is also defrayed by Government, and other advantages are
                    held out. Notwithstanding the zeal with which the many schemes of state or
                    private colonization in Brazil have been promoted, the results have been far
                    from satisfactory; as far as British, German, and Swiss experience goes these
                    have been in many instances very disastrous; and whatever seductive
                    representation of advantages may be held out, any scheme for the introduction of
                    north European colonists into Brazil cannot be too strongly deprecated. Not only
                    is the climate and soil, except perhaps of the extreme southern province,
                    unsuited to the Anglo-Saxon race, but the abandonment of nationality and of
                    language, of customs and laws, and the obnoxious surroundings, prove fatal to
                    success.</p>
                <p>The chief state colonies are at the following places. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Santa</hi><hi rend="italic">Leopoldina,</hi> thirty-three miles distant from
                    the capital of the province of Espiritu-Santo, having free access to it by the
                    Sta. Maria River,—is chiefly a German, Swiss, and Dutch colony. <hi
                    rend="italic">Rio Novo</hi> is in the same province. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mucury,</hi> in the province of Minas Geraes, is also a German colony. <hi
                    rend="italic">Canarea</hi> in the province of Sào Paulo, 14 miles from the
                    sea-coast and near the town of the same name, is mainly English. <hi
                    rend="italic">Λssungay,</hi> 62 miles from the capital of the province of
                    Paranâ, <hi rend="italic">Itajahy,</hi> 29 miles from the port of the same name
                    in the province of Sta. Catharina, and <hi rend="italic">Blumenau,</hi> also in
                    that province on the navigable River Itajahy, are chiefly German. <hi
                    rend="italic">Sta. Maria de Soledade,</hi> near Sào Leopoldo, in Rio Grande do
                    Sul, is also a · state colony. Several places long colonized have passed out of
                    the colonial régime, and have been formed into municipalities. Such are <hi
                    rend="italic">Säo</hi><hi rend="italic">Leopoldo</hi> in Rio Grande, <hi
                    rend="italic">Santa Isabel</hi> in the province of Sta. Catharina, <hi
                    rend="italic">Nova Friburgo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Petropolis</hi> in
                    elevated districts of the Organ Mountains in Rio de Janeiro,</p>
                <p>Private and provincial colonies are rather numerous. Of these there are eight in
                    Rio Grande do Sul, the chief being that of <hi rend="italic">Sta Cruz;</hi> Sta
                    Catharina has two; Minas Geraes and Bahia, each one. Taken together the state,
                    provincial, and private colonies embraced, in 1873, upwards of 40,000 people.
                    During the past two years the unsettled condition and financial difficulties of
                    the La Plata states have thrown large numbers of foreign—chiefly Italian—
                    settlers into destitution, and many hundreds of these have been induced, by the
                    offer of free passage and land, to seek a new home in Brazil.</p>
                <p>The Brazilian monarchy derives from the ancient monarchy of Portugal the
                    principle of hereditary succession to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n279/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0279-0236"/> the crown. The laws of succession are defined
                    with great distinctness in the constitution, and are the same as in England.</p>
                <p>In Brazil there is no privileged aristocracy, but descent from the noble families
                    of Portugal, length of time in the service of the country, or large fortune,
                    gives a certain claim to the privileges of aristocracy readily admitted by the
                    Brazilians. The emperor rewards services, according to their difficulty or
                    importance, with the titles of marquis, count, baron, or knight (moços
                    fidalgos). Titles are not hereditary, but if a son prove himself worthy of his
                    father, he inherits his title. There are in the empire six orders of chivalry;
                    those of the Southern Cross, the order of Dorn Pedro I., and of the Rose,
                    created by the first emperor between 1822 and 1829; and those of Christ, St
                    Benoit of A viz, and St Theodoric, adopted by Dorn Pedro II. The senate
                    represents the only element of aristocracy recognized by the constitution, and
                    the democratic element preponderates, but its action is modified by the
                    complicated system of election. The constitution established four powers,— the
                    moderating, the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">moderating</hi> power is vested exclusively in the cmpèror
                    as chief representative of the nation, that he may maintain the equilibrium and
                    harmony of the other powers, He exercises this function with regard to the
                    legislature by being empowered to choose the senators, to convoke or adjourn the
                    general assembly, to dissolve the chamber of deputies, and to sanction the
                    decrees of the assembly; as regards the executive, by appointing or dismissing
                    at will the ministers of state; and over the judicial power, by suspending the
                    magistrates, pardoning or commuting penalties, and granting amnesties. The
                    person of the emperor is sacred, inviolable, and irresponsible.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">legislative</hi> power is vested, for the affairs of the
                    empire, in the general legislative assembly with the sanction of the emperor,
                    and for the provincial affairs in the provincial assemblies with the sanction of
                    the president (governor) of the province. The general legislative assembly
                    consists of two chambers, that of deputies and that of senators. The deputies
                    are nominated by indirect election. Citizens, and even manumitted slaves, born
                    in the empire, who possess an income of <hi rend="italic">£22,</hi> 10s., choose
                    the electors in parochial assemblies, and these electors nominate the deputies.
                    The .qualification for an elector is an annual income of <hi rend="italic"
                    >£45;</hi> that of a deputy an income of £90. Minors, monks, and servants, are
                    debarred from voting; naturalized foreigners, and persons not professing the
                    religion of the state, are incapable of being elected deputies, but they can be
                    senators. The deputies to the number of 122 are elected for four years, and must
                    hold an annual session of four months, opening on the 3d of May. The senators
                    (58 in number) are elected for life. Every province has a number of senators,
                    equal to half its number of deputies; but they are nominated in triple lists,
                    from which the emperor selects one-third. A senator must be forty years of age,
                    and must possess a clear annual income of £180. The allowance of a senator is
                    one-half more than that of a deputy. Each house nominates its own officers. When
                    the two houses sit in general assembly, as at the opening and close of the
                    session, to hear the emperor’s speech, &amp;c., the president of the senate
                    presides, and the senators and deputies sit promiscuously. They sit apart and
                    proceed by way of bill, when they make laws, interpret, and suspend them; they
                    determine the public charges, and assess the contributions, &amp;c. The chamber
                    of deputies has the initiative in taxes, in recruiting, and in the choice of a
                    new dynasty. The senate has the exclusive privilege of taking cognizance of
                    offences committed by members of the imperial family, councillors of state,
                    senators, and deputies, during the session; of enforcing the responsibility of
                    secretaries and councillors of state; of convoking the assembly in case the
                    emperor fail to do so within two months after the period fixed by law; and also
                    of calling it together on the death of the emperor.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">executive</hi> power is vested in the emperor, assisted by
                    his ministers and secretaries of state, who are responsible for treason,
                    corruption, abuse of power, acts contrary to the liberty, security, or property
                    of the citizens, and waste of public property. From this responsibility they
                    cannot escape upon the plea of orders from the emperor. The executive functions
                    are such as the convocation of the general ordinary assembly; the nomination of
                    bishops, presidents, governors of provinces; commanders by sea and land, and
                    ambassadors; the formation of alliances, and all foreign negotiations; the
                    declaration of peace and war; and the granting letters of naturalization.</p>
                <p>The ministers are seven, one for each of the departments of the empire and
                    ecclesiastical affairs; justice; war; marine; finances; foreign affairs; and
                    agriculture, commerce, and public works. One of these is president or premier.
                    To these is superadded a council of state composed of twelve ordinary members,
                    besides which it may have as many as twelve extraordinary members, all of them
                    appointed for life. The council is divided into sections corresponding to the
                    seven ministries, or sits in full meeting, presided over by the emperor. The
                    prince or princess imperial, on attaining the age of eighteen, has a seat in
                    this assembly. The council is merely consultative, and though its use is
                    optional it is always heard on any important public question or appeal to the
                    crown. The provincial governments are entrusted to a president in each,
                    appointed by the executive power and immediately under its control: he is the
                    supreme representative of government in the province, sanctions the resolutions
                    of the provincial assemblies, and appoints provincial functionaries. The
                    provincial assemblies, elected every two years by the same citizens who elect
                    members of the chamber of deputies, deal only with matters immediately relating
                    to the private or local interests of the province.</p>
                <p>Every city, town, and village, with the surrounding district, has a municipal
                    council composed of nine or seven members, elected directly by the citizens who
                    possess an annual income of £22, 10s. This council is charged with all that
                    concerns the good of the district, meets four times a year, besides
                    extraordinary sessions, and every meeting may last as many days as may be found
                    necessary for the expedition of business. They impose fines to a certain amount,
                    and even enforce their decrees by a penalty of thirty days’ imprisonment. They
                    annually draw up a municipal budget, which is submitted to the provincial
                    legislative assembly for approval. If their revenue and the produce of fines be
                    not sufficient to defray expenses, an allowance from the provincial treasury is
                    granted. Their decrees are called <hi rend="italic">posturas,</hi> and the
                    penalties imposed by them are enforced by the justices of peace. Their
                    enactments can be annulled by the provincial legislative assembly.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">judicial</hi> power is independent; the judges hold their
                    offices for life, and cannot lose them except by a condemnatory sentence. They
                    are, however, responsible for any abuse of authority, and may be summoned before
                    a supreme court of judicial ministers. In criminal cases all proceedings are
                    public after the indictment. In civil cases arbitrators may be appointed, whose
                    decisions are without appeal, and no civil lawsuit can be carried on without
                    previous declaration that conciliatory means were tried in vain.</p>
                <p>The constitution guarantees the inviolability of the liberty, safety, and
                    property of Brazilian citizens, and of their civil <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n280/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0280-0237"/> and political rights. Individual liberty is
                    subject only to law, and in the same way liberty of thought and of the press are
                    guaranteed. No one may be persecuted on account of religious belief, and every
                    kind of labour or industry is free which does not interfere with public
                    well-being. No one can be arrested without written orders from lawful
                    authority.</p>
                <p>For purposes of election the empire is divided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >districts,</hi> each of which elects a fixed number of deputies for the general
                    and provincial assemblies. These aro again divided into colleges and parish
                    assemblies. There are 46 electoral districts, 408 colleges, and 1451 parish
                    assemblies. For administrative purposes the Brazilian territory is separated
                    into 20 <hi rend="italic">provinces,</hi> comprising 642 municipalities,
                    including that of the capital; from various causes the number of municipalities
                    is fluctuating. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction is exercised in 12 <hi
                    rend="italic">dioceses,</hi> one of which, that of Sào Salvador, comprehending
                    the province of Bahia and Serigpe, is a metropolitan archbishopric. The whole of
                    the dioceses are divided into 1473 parishes and 28 curacies. The diocese of Sào
                    Salvador is the seat of a metropolitan court of appeal (Relaçao), composed of
                    judges of appeal <hi rend="italic">(gdesembargadores),</hi> who decide clerical
                    matters finally. The diocese of Sào Sebastiào comprises the municipality of Rio
                    de Janeiro, its province, those of Espiritu Santo and Sta. Catharina, and tbe
                    eastern side of Miuas Geraes. The provinces of Alagoas, Pernambuco, Parahyba,
                    and Rio Grande do Norte form the bishopric of Olinda; Maranhao and Piauhy the
                    bishopric of the former name; Parâ and Amazonas the diocese of Belem do Parâ.
                    The diocese of Sào Paulo includes that province, Paranâ, and southern Minas
                    Geraes; that of Goyaz its province and western Miuas; the remainder of Minas
                    forms the bishoprics of Marianna in the central, and of Diamantina in the
                    northern part of the province. The diocese of Cuyabâ consists of the province of
                    Matto Grosso. The provinces of Sào Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul and of Cearâ
                    correspond to their respective bishoprics.</p>
                <p>The judicial division of the empire is into eleven districts, each having a court
                    of appeal competent to try all questions affecting the judges and military
                    commanders. From the sentences of these courts there is but one appeal to a
                    supreme court of justice, the members of which are denominated ministers, and by
                    the constitution are counsellors to the emperor: this highest court takes
                    cognizance of offences or errors committed by its ministers, by the judges of
                    appeal, or by archbishops or bishops in non-ecclesiastical matters.</p>
                <p>The districts of the Courts of Appeal are groups of provinces as follows :—·</p>

                <p>The civil laws, originally the same with those of Portugal, have been greatly
                    modified by a number of new ones A criminal code was organized in 1830 on the
                    principles of Jeremy Bentham, and is considered very perfect and clear. The new
                    form of procedure, and the new organization of justices, is embodied in a code
                    decreed in 1832. Finally, a new code of commerce, nearly copied from that of
                    France was decreed in 1850.</p>
                <p>To carry on the war of the Independence, and to crush a subsequent revolution in
                    the northern provinces, the Government contracted two loans in 1824-5, of the
                    nominal amount of &lt;£3,686,200; and on the recognition of its independence by
                    Portugal in 1825, it undertook the liability of a loan of .£1,500,000. The war
                    with Buenos Ayres, and the assistance rendered by Dorn Pedro to the
                    constitutional party of Portugal, led to two farther loans in 1829, of the
                    nominal amount of £769,200. Internal difficulties in 1839 compelled the regency
                    to contract another loan of the nominal amount of £411,200. The dissensions in
                    Portugal caused a temporary suspension in the payment of the dividends on the
                    Portuguese loan, and in 1842, £732,600 stock were delivered to the Portuguese
                    agente in settlement of this claim. The debt contracted and assumed by Brazil
                    between 1823 and 1843, therefore, amounted to £7,099,200 nominal; and throughout
                    all its difficulties and embarrassments the Imperial Government punctually and
                    honourably provided for the dividends as they became due.</p>
                <p>By the renewal in 1844 of the sinking fund, the operation of which had been
                    suspended since 1828, the Portuguese and other loans were becoming gradually
                    reduced. The long war with Paraguay from 1864 to 1870, however, very
                    considerably augmented the public debt, costing the empire more than 460,000
                    contos of reis, or nearly £52,000,000. The public debt is now divided into the
                    consolidated foreign and internal debts, and the floating debt. The foreign debt
                    proceeds from loans negotiated in the London Exchange in 1865, 1871, and 1875;
                    the internal debt from policies authorized in 1827, but mainly from a home loan
                    of 1868. The floating debt consists of the small remaining portion of that
                    contracted previously to 1827, of loans borrowed from various internal sources,
                    of exchequer bills, and paper money. Under these heads the debt of the empire
                    was officially stated on the 31st of March 1875 as follows :—</p>

                <p>For a few years previously to the declaration of the emperor’s majority, the
                    imperial expenditure had not been largely in excess of the revenue, and in
                    1836—37, the deficit only amounted to £53,600; but in 1840-41, the year of the
                    emperor’s majority, it rose to £408,000, and in consequence of a revolution in
                    Bio Grande do Sul it went on increasing till in 1845 it had reached nearly
                    treble that sum. But before 1850 the deficiency had not only been made good, but
                    a large surplus began to accumulate, which remained at about an annual sum of
                    £400,000 after 1853. On the outbreak of the war in 1864, increased taxation was
                    necessary to enable the exchequer to meet the extraordinary expenses, but on the
                    close of the ministerial accounts for 1870-71, a surplus of upwards of £900,000
                    remained. In amount the revenues of the empire have progressively ascended from
                    £1,380,000 in 1837 to upwards of £6,000,000.</p>
                <p>The financial account of the year 1872-73, presented to the Chambers in May 1875,

                <p>The effective strength of the army and navy is every year fixed by the general
                    legislative assembly, upon the data furnished by the ministers of the two
                    departments. The army was originally organized on the principles established by
                    Marshal Beresford when in the service of Portugal. It is principally from the
                    northern provinces that the infantry is recruited, and from the southern that
                    the best cavalry is obtained. A board, presided over by H. R. H. the Comte d’Eu,
                    marshal of the army, is charged with the reformation of military legislation,
                    and has been in session for some years. The actual army is thus composed, on a
                    peace footing</p>

                <p>On a war footing the army is raised to 32,000 men.</p>
                <p>Besides the regular army there is a national guard, which was organized in 1831,
                    and comprised nearly 750,000 men in the latest returns, in cavalry, artillery,
                    infantry, and reserve. This force has been disbanded for the present, to be
                    re-organized on the completion of the census begun in 1872.</p>
                <p>The police service of the empire is performed by city guards under military
                    organization, under the provincial legislatures. The provinces of Parâ,
                    Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio G"ande do Sul, and Matto Grosso possess military
                    arsenals, recently reorganized. Military colonies for disciplinary or
                    penitentiary objects, and also for protection of the frontiers, are dotted round
                    the outskirts of the empire.</p>
                <p>The navy is under the control of the minister of marine, assisted by a naval
                    council instituted in 1855, organized after the plan of the French admiralty.
                    There are six arsenals, and a pyrotechnical laboratory was established near Rio
                    in 1868</p>
                <p>The navy is principally manned by civilized aborigines and negroes, organized in
                    bodies called imperial sailors, with a certain military discipline. The
                    aborigines have a peculiar aptitude for a maritime life. Officers destined for
                    the Brazilian navy receive a suitable education in the naval school of Rio, and
                    for some years the Government introduced the practice of sending the more apt
                    scholars to serve in the British, French, and American navies. In this way a
                    body of efficient naval officers has been formed.</p>

                <p>These vessels were manned by 4136 seamen, including gunners and marines. One

                <p>The Roman Catholic is the established religion of the empire. All other forms of
                    worship are tolerated, but may only be practised privately. Dissenters enjoy all
                    political and civil rights, with the sole exception of being elected into the
                    chamber of deputies. The peculiarity of the ecclesiastical organization of the
                    Brazilian church is, that the clergy do not receive the tithes. As a conquest of
                    the military and religious order of Christ, all the churches of Brazil belonged
                    from the beginning to that order, whose grand-master appointed the bishops, and
                    submitted them directly to the approbation of the Pope. The order became so
                    powerful that the king obtained the union of the grandmastership to the crown,
                    and so disposed of all the livings and other benefices of the order, and paid
                    from his treasury the salaries of the clergy, receiving the tithes from the
                    people as a civil tax. The tithes were afterwards abolished as oppressive. This
                    organization is still recognized by the Holy See, and in the capacity of
                    grand-master of the order of Christ the emperor appoints all the bishops and
                    other ecclesiastical functionaries. There are convents of Franciscans,
                    Carmelites, and Benedictines. These are very rich, and generally very learned
                    men, who are usefully employed in teaching the sciences. They pay double annual
                    taxes as a compensation to the treasury for not paying taxes upon transfers of
                    property, as theirs is not transferable.</p>
                <p>Primary and public schools, supported by the state through the provincial and
                    municipal legislatures, for gratuitous instruction, have been established
                    throughout the empire, under the general control of the ministry of the
                    interior. In some of the provinces instruction has been made obligatory. Besides
                    these, in which the teaching is limited to moral and religious instruction,
                    reading and writing, the elements of grammar and arithmetic, there is a second
                    or higher order of schools in most of the provinces, either public or private,
                    in which such subjects as the elements of history and geography, especially that
                    of Brazil, the principles of the physical sciences, elementary mathematics,
                    drawing, Portuguese, French, and English are added. The Dorn Pedro II. Imperial
                    College of the capital has twenty-two professors, and provides a course of study
                    of seven years, at the termination of which a degree of B.A. may be gained. Each
                    diocese has a seminary for theological instruction, and these, with the
                    exception of that of S. José in the capital, are subsidized by Government.
                    Military training is under the care of the war department, and is carried on in
                    preparatory and regimental schools, and further in military academies in the
                    capital and in Rio Grande do Sul. A practical school of gunnery is established
                    in the Campo Grande, near the capital; a central college with eleven professors
                    also educates in the higher branches of military science and engineering.</p>
                <p>An imperial astronomical observatory has been appended to the central college for
                    the instruction of observers, and the recording of astronomical and

                    naval college is established on board a war vessel,— the cadets being drafted to

                    attached, and naval construction is taught in some of the higher national
                    schools; but students are also sent to the best European navy yards. There are
                    two faculties of medicine, one at Rio de Janeiro, and another at Bahia, each
                    having a curriculum of six years, and conferring degrees. The faculties of law
                    are seated at Säo Paulo and Recife in Pernambuco. An institute of commercial
                    instruction is presided over by a Government commissioner in Rio. Other
                    remarkable institutions are those for the education of the blind in Rio, and a
                    deaf and dumb institute. An academy of fine arts is established, with schools,
                    in Rio, as well as a conservatorium of music. A national museum of natural
                    history was created in Rio in 1817, and is the most important of South America.
                    Others of like character have been founded in Parâ, in Ouro Preto, and in Cearâ.
                    The national public library in Rio is the most important establishment of its
                    kind, having more than 100,000 volumes on all subjects. Extensive libraries are
                    also attached to all the colleges and academies; and popular libraries have been
                    created in each of the provincial capitals.</p>
                <p>The press is represented by six daily newspapers in the capital, of which the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diario</hi><hi rend="italic">do Dio</hi> is the oldest, having
                    been founded in 1817. The provincial towns together have nearly 200
                    newspapers.</p>
                <p>The most important of the scientific societies of the empire is the Historical,
                    Geographical, and Ethnographical Institute of Brazil, founded in 1838. There are
                    besides this twenty larger scientific associations in Rio and the provincial
                    capitals. With all these appliances, however, owing to the immense territory
                    over which the population is scattered, the spread of instruction is exceedingly
                    difficult, and the grossest ignorance yet abounds in the interior of almost
                    every province.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, from the insufficient establishments for general education, that
                    the intellectual development of individuals must have been for a long period
                    achieved in a great measure by unaided exertions. Now things are better, but in
                    the more thinly inhabited districts devotion to such pursuits must not be
                    expected in men exclusively occupied in procuring subsistence and securing
                    self-defence. Even where the population is more dense, a lazy feeling of animal
                    comfort represses the exertions of the majority. It is among the more aspiring
                    class, who aim at the learned professions or state employment, and who are
                    consequently obliged to cultivate their minds, that we must look for that
                    attachment to intellectual pursuits which is rarely acquired except from habit.
                    In the theological seminaries, established at the seat of each bishop, little
                    more was inculcated than a knowledge of the classics, an outworn scholastic
                    system of logic, and a knowledge of the routine duties of a priest. The schools
                    of medicine in Rio Janeiro and in Bahia, from the attention bestowed upon
                    practical surgery and anatomy, have done more to awaken the mind. The situations
                    under Government requiring a certain proficiency in practical mathematics and
                    natural history have also diffused a knowledge of and a taste for these
                    pursuits. The number of foreign engineers and naturalists encouraged to settle
                    in Brazil has rendered the natives in some measure acquainted with all that has
                    been of late achieved in Europe in the mathematical and experimental
                    sciences.</p>
                <p>In parliament and by the press the most delicate political questions have been
                    discussed with success, and the progress of the Government and of legislation
                    evinces a certain administrative foresight and prudence rarely displayed by
                    other new states.</p>
                <p>The Brazilians who frequent the university of Coimbra in Portugal often
                    distinguish themselves among their fellow-students; and notwithstanding the
                    difficulties they have to contend against, not unfrequently rise to the highest
                    offices of the state.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable writers in the Portuguese language on political economy and
                    commercial law were Couttinho, bishop of Pernambuco, and Silva Lisboa,
                    afterwards Viscount de Cayron, a senator of the empire, both Brazilians. Among
                    historians the Brazilian Rocha Pita is distinguished, and Moraes the
                    lexicographer of the Portuguese language belonged to Pernambuco. Portugal is
                    poor in dramatic literature, but one of her most distinguished comic poets was
                    the Brazilian Silva, who afterwards fell a victim to the inquisition of Lisbon.
                    In epic poetry, on the other hand, Portuguese literature is rich. Brazil claims
                    the authorship of two of its most beautiful poems of this class, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Caramuru</hi> of Durâo, and the <hi rend="italic">Uruguay</hi> of
                    Gama. The best of the minor poets is Gonzaga, whose collection of lyrics is well
                    known under the title of <hi rend="italic">Marilia</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Dircêo.</hi> Little inferior to him is Souza Caldas, whose translation of the
                    Psalms denotes a talent of the first order. Claudio, Avarenga, Gregorio de
                    Mattos, Euzebio de Mattos, Gusmâo, in former times; and more recently, Odorico,
                    Mendes, Borges de Barros, Domingos Magalhaës, Marquis of Paranaguâ, A. de
                    Macedo, Porto-Alegre, Barbosa, and others are well worthy of notice as lyric
                    poets.</p>
                <p>Religious eloquence was formerly much cultivated in Brazil, and Vieira is one of
                    the most original and eloquent preachers known. In more recent times Antonio
                    Carlos and Montalverne deserve particular notice. In the natural sciences Frei
                    Leandro, Arruda, Camara, and J osé Bonifacio de Andrada are known for their
                    works and discoveries.</p>
                <p>In sacred music José Mauricio, a mulatto, left compositions of merit that were
                    executed in the chapel of D. John VI.</p>
                <p>The Brazilians have a natural taste for music, and an Italian theatre, maintained
                    with but little interruption in Rio de Janeiro, has assisted in improving and
                    refining this taste. The old-fashioned Brazilian instrument, which was a
                    particular kind of guitar, has almost disappeared from the large cities, but is
                    still frequently employed in the provinces to accompany the <hi rend="italic"
                    >modinhas</hi> (romances) which are peculiar to Brazil, and which have a
                    particular style.</p>
                <p>The school of the fine arts of Rio de Janeiro has produced some good but no
                    remarkable painters. Of late, however, the most promising artists have been
                    annually sent to Italy at the public expense to prosecute their studies in that
                    country.</p>
                <p>The Brazilians are in general hospitable, generous, and charitable, endowed with
                    great pride and vanity, and susceptibility of character, and are easily led away
                    by flattery. The unlimited power they exercise over the African slaves, and the
                    colonial system from which they have but a short time been freed, the imperfect
                    religious education, the facility with which they can live in abundance at small
                    cost, while the climate enables them to dispense with many things necessary in
                    other countries, the enervating effects of the hot atmosphere, all combine to
                    stimulate the qualities and vices which we must expect in this people.</p>
                <p>There is in the Brazilian national character, with great mildness and generosity,
                    a certain tendency to vindictiveness. Homicides for the sake of vengeance alone
                    are proportionally as numerous in Brazil as in certain countries of Europe;
                    while the crimes against property are much fewer. The greatest number of
                    homicides, however, takes place in the most backward provinces of the centre and
                    north.</p>
                <p>The Roman Catholic religion predominates in Brazil, and although there are
                    enlightened men among the clergy, a great number of the priests are ill
                    educated, and the institution of celibacy keeps the members of the principal <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n283/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0283-0240"/> families from entering the profession. Such is
                    the want of priests that the Government finds itself obliged to send to Italy
                    for them. Among educated classes the spirit of materialism of the French writers
                    of the 18th century made great progress, but a considerable reaction has lately
                    taken place. The lower classes, above all in the interior, are still deplorably
                    superstitious.</p>
                <p>In several of the provinces contentions have arisen of late years between the
                    church and freemasonry, and the excommunication of the members of the craft and
                    the closing of the churches to which they belonged have awakened religious
                    discussions and agitations. The Jesuit priests were expelled from the province
                    of Pernambuco in 1875, and the bishop of that diocese, tried before the lay
                    tribunal, was condemned to fine and imprisonment.</p>
                <p>Brazil is not specially a manufacturing country, and its national industries of
                    mining (with smelting of the metals), collecting and polishing precious stones,
                    and salt making, already referred to, with tanning and hide working, have the
                    widest range. The state has, however, encouraged and in some cases subsidized
                    special manufactures which were of value in developing the resources of the
                    country. Among these seventeen foundries, manufacturing engines and agricultural
                    implements, have supplied a great national want. The home hat factories of
                    Brazil have now all but superseded the imported hats by their products. In
                    almost every city there are manufactories of soap, oil, and candles, which are
                    made, not only of stearine and tallow, but of wax, and in the north from the
                    valuable Carnauba palm. Hum distilling is largely carried on in the sugar
                    districts, and cigars are extensively made, especially at Bahia. Gold and silver
                    smiths and jewel workers are foremost among the delicate handicraftsmen, and
                    excel in their workmanship.</p>
                <p>There are now two cotton-cloth factories in Rio, five in Bahia, two in Minas, and
                    several in S. Paulo, and this branch of industry is extending.</p>
                <p>Ship-building is diligently prosecuted in many of the ports, and Rio has launched
                    several fine iron-clad vessels from the navy yard. A law passed in 1871 enabled
                    Government to subsidize companies for the construction of more commodious docks,
                    and these have been begun in Rio, Bahia, and Maranhao, at Santos in S. Paulo,
                    and at ParanaguA in ParanA.</p>
                <p>Whale-fishery is carried on to some small extent from the ports of Bahia and Sta.
                    Catharina. The fine coastal fisheries are not yet taken advantage of to nearly
                    their full power; on the other hand, large quantities of dried cod-fish are
                    imported. On the upper Amazon and its tributaries a considerable quantity of oil
                    is collected from the eggs of the turtle, and is sent down in earthen pots
                    containing 50 to 60 lb weight each.</p>
                <p>Jerked beef, an important article of general consumption, is chiefly prepared in
                    the “Charqueadas” of Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
                <p>The coastal and fluvial communications of the empire are maintained by eighteen
                    lines of steam-vessels, which receive an annual subsidy from the state
                    (amounting to £150,000 in 1875). A North American company, keeping up a regular
                    traffic between the ports of Brazil and the United States, is also aided by
                    Government. Besides these the ocean lines of large vessels from Britain,
                    Germany, aud France, touch regularly at the chief points in passing to the La
                    Plata. Almost all the navigable rivers of Brazil have now their regular steam
                    packets. The Amazon has been navigated by steam for nearly twenty years: and
                    since the passing of the decree of September 18G7, by which its waters were
                    opened to the trading ships of all nations, direct commerce from foreign
                    countries with the interior ports on its banks has begun to be developed.</p>
                <p>Within recent times the construction of railroads has been progressing very
                    rapidly under the Government and in private hands. In 1867 there were but six
                    short lines working; in 1873 there were fifteen distinct railways. Three main
                    trunk lines are being actively extended by the state: the first called the Dorn
                    Pedro II. line, passing from Rio de Janeiro to Minas Geraes, is being extended
                    thence to the head of the navigation of the Sâo Francisco, and is planned to
                    reach the valley of the Tocantins and ParA; the second trunk line is designed to
                    unite the navigation of the Amazon with that of the Paraguay, through the head
                    of the valley of the Tocantins and Araguaya; the third line, already partly
                    executed, beginning at Rio will pass through the capitals of S. Paulo and ParanA
                    to Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sid. Many other lines have been begun or are
                    projected under the superintendence of the provincial assemblies. The ordinary
                    roads are in an exceedingly backward condition throughout the empire, and those
                    which are more than rude tracks are of very small extent. A fine macadamized
                    road, however, called the “Union and Industry,” joins the capital with Minas
                    Geraes, and others extend for short distances from the chief towns. There are
                    also a few canals. It is but seventeen years since the first small line of
                    telegraph was stretched in Brazil within the capital, but now a double line
                    unites the maritime towns from Pernambuco to Rio Grande do Sul. Many other lines
                    are being constructed, and in June 1874 submarine telegraphic cable was
                    completed from Europe to the Brazilian ports.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Brazil, despite the disadvantages against which it has had at
                    various times to contend, has been on the whole uniformly progressive. These
                    disadvantages consisted chiefly in the restrictions originally imposed on the
                    young colony by the jealousy of the mother country, which refused to admit the
                    Brazilian products except at certain stated seasons of the year. The exportation
                    of native productions to the Old World was limited to the ports of Rio, Bahia,
                    Olinda, and Paraiba. These restrictions continued in force long after analogous
                    measures had been exploded in the commercial systems of other countries, and
                    were not repealed till the beginning of the present century. In 1810, all the
                    ports of Brazil were thrown open to British goods on the payment of duty at the
                    rate of 15 per cent., and though this rate has been greatly increased by the
                    tariff of 1844, the average annual value of manufactured goods imported into
                    Brazil from Great Britain alone, chiefly cotton, iron, woollen, and linen goods,
                    amounts to nearly ’ ⅛4,500,000.</p>
                <p>The value of the imports and exports of Brazil in 1SO8 was estimated at £2260; it
                    has gradually increased, with little fluctuation, till at the present time the
                    annual value of trade is not less than £40,000,000. The trade of the empire is
                    mainly with Great Britain (which sends more than a third of the imports, and
                    receives a great share of the exports), France, the United States, Portugal,
                    Germany, the Argentine Bepublic, and Belgium. In the order of their value the
                    chief exports are coffee, hides, sugar, cotton, india-rubber, tobacco,
                    yerba-matc, diamonds, and ram. Since 1853 the value ot the exports from the
                    country has in most years been somewhat in excess of that of the imports. The
                    whole number of ships entering and leaving the Brazilian ports in recent years
                    averages about 30,000.</p>
