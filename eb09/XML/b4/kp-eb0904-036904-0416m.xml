                    Sarawak, in the island of Borneo, and Governor of Labuan, was born at Coombe
                    Grove near Bath, April 29, 1803. It is sometimes erroneously stated that he was
                    born in Bengal, a mistake arising from the fact that his father a member of the

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0417-0370"/> of the East India Company, had long lived there.
                    His mother was a woman of superior understanding, and to her care he owed his
                    careful early training. He received the ordinary school education, entered the
                    service of the East India Company, and was sent out to India about 1825. On the
                    outbreak of the Burmese war, he was despatched with his regiment to the valley
                    of the Brahmaputra; and, being dangerously wounded in an engagement near
                    Rungpore, was compelled to return home (1826). After his recovery he travelled
                    on the Continent before going to India, and circumstances led him soon after to
                    leave the service of the Company. In 1830 he made a voyage to China, and during
                    his passage among the islands of the Indian Archipelago, so rich in natural
                    beauty, magnificence, and fertility, but occupied by a population of savage
                    tribes, continually at war with each other, and carrying on a system of piracy
                    on a vast scale and with relentless ferocity, he conceived the great design of
                    rescuing them from barbarism and bringing them within the pale of civilization.
                    His purpose was confirmed by observations made during a second visit to China,
                    and on his return to England he applied himself in earnest to making the
                    necessary preparations. Having succeeded on the death of his father to a large
                    property, he bought and equipped a yacht, the “Royalist/’ of 140 tons burden,
                    and for three years tested its capacities and trained his crew of twenty men,,
                    chiefly in the Mediterranean. At length, on October 27,, 1838, he sailed from
                    the Thames on his great adventure. On reaching Borneo, after various delays, he
                    found the Rajah Muda Hassim, uncle of the reigning sultan, engaged in war in the
                    province of Sarawak with several of the Dyak tribes, who had revolted against
                    the sultan. He offered his aid to the rajah; and with his crew, and some
                    Javanese who had joined them, he took part in a battle with the insurgents, and
                    they were defeated. For his services the title of Rajah of Sarawak was conferred
                    on him by Muda Hassim, the former rajah being deprived in his favour. It was,
                    however, some time before the sultan could be induced to confirm his title
                    (September 1841). During the next five years Rajah Brooke was engaged in
                    establishing his power, in making just reforms in administration, preparing a
                    code of laws, and introducing just and humane modes of dealing with the degraded
                    subjects of his rule. But this was not all. He looked forward to the development
                    of commerce as the most effective means of putting an end to the worst evils
                    that afflicted the archipelago; and in order to make this possible, the way must
                    first be cleared by the suppression, or a considerable diminution, of the
                    prevailing piracy, which was not only a curse to the savage tribes engagedin it,
                    but a standing danger to European and American traders in those seas. Various
                    expeditions were therefore organized and sent out against the marauders, Dyaks
                    and Malays, and sometimes even Arabs. Captain Keppel, and other commanders of
                    British ships of war, received permission to co-operate with Rajah Brooke in
                    these expeditions. The pirates were attacked in their strongholds, they fought
                    desperately, and the slaughter was immense. Negotiations with the chiefs had
                    been tried, and tried in vain. The capital of the sultan of Borneo was bombarded
                    and stormed, and the sultan with his army routed. He was, however, soon after
                    restored to his dominion. So large was the number of natives, pirates and
                    others, slain in these expeditions, that the “head-money” awarded by the British
                    Government to those who had taken part in them amounted to no less than £20,000.
                    In October 1847 Rajah Brooke returned to England, where he was well received by
                    the Government; and the Corporation of London conferred on him the freedom of
                    the city. The Island of Labuan, with its dependencies, having been acquired by
                    purchase from the sultan of Borneo, was erected into a British colony, and Rajah
                    Brooke was appointed Governor and commanderin-chief. He was also named
                    consul-general in Borneo. These appointments had been made before his arrival in
                    England. The university of Oxford conferred on him the honorary degree of
                    D.C.L., and in 1848 he was created K.C.B. He soon after returned to Sarawak, and
                    was carried thither by a British man-of-war. In the summer of 1849 he led an
                    expedition against the Seribas and Sakuran Dyaks, who still persisted in their
                    piratical practices and refused to submit to British authority. Their defeat
                    and. wholesale slaughter was a matter of course. At the time of this
                    engagα-πιent Sir James Brooke was lying ill with dysentery. He visited twice the
                    capital of the sultan of Sala, .and concluded a treaty with him, which had for
                    one of its objects the expulsion of the sea-gypsies and other tribes from his
                    dominions. In 1851 grave, charges with respect to the operations in Borneo were
                    brought against Sir James Brooke in the House of Commons by Joseph Hume and
                    other members, especially as to the “head-money” received. To meet these
                    accusations, and to vindicate his proceedings, he came to England. The evidence
                    adduced was so conflicting that the matter was at length referred to a Royal
                    Commission, to sit at Singapore. As the result of its investigation the charges
                    were declared to be “not proven.” Sir James, however, was soon after deprived of
                    the governorship of Labuan, and the head-money was abolished. In 1867 his house
                    in Sarawak was attacked and burnt by Chinese pirates, and he had to fly from the
                    capital, Kuching. With a small force he attacked the Chinese, recovered the
                    town, made a great slaughter of them, and drove away the rest. In the following
                    year he came to England, and remained there for three years. During this time he
                    was smitten with paralysis, a public subscription was raised, and an estate in
                    Devonshire was bought and presented to him. He made two more visits to Sarawak,
                    and on each occasion had a rebellion to suppress. He spent his last days on his
                    estate at Burrator in Devonshire, and died there, June 11, 1868. Notwithstanding
                    differences of opinion with regard to some of Sir James Brooke’s proceedings, it
                    is not to be denied that he was a man of the highest personal character. In his
                    public conduct he was undoubtedly actuated by a noble ambition, and he displayed
                    rare courage both in his conflicts in the East and under the charges advanced
                    against him in England. His <hi rend="italic">Private Letters</hi> (1838 to
                    1853) were published in 1853. Portions of his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>
                    have also been edited by Captains Mundy and Keppel.</p>
