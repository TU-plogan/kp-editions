                    rend="smallcaps">Victor Charles,</hi> Due <hi rend="smallcaps">de,</hi> peer of
                    France, was born in Paris 28th November 1785, and died 25th January 1870. The
                    family from which this eminent statesman descended was of Piedmontese origin,
                    but it won its honour in the service of France. The first Marshal de Broglie
                    (1639-1727) served with distinction under Louis XIV.; his son, known as the
                    Chevalier de Broglie (1671-1745), was raised to the highest grade in the French
                    peerage for his gallant military service at Guastalla and at Prague in 1742, but
                    he refused the rank of marshal of France, which was offered to him by the
                    regent, on the ground that his father, who was still alive, deserved it more
                    than he did. The next in descent was the second marshal (1718-1804), who
                    commanded the French armies in the Seven Years’ War, for which he was created a
                    prince of the empire, and though subsequently disgraced and exiled by the
                    intrigues of the Condés, he was recalled in 1789 by Louis XVI. to the office of
                    commander-in-chief. To stem the tide of the Revolution was impossible. The
                    marshal speedily fell from power, emigrated to Germany, refused the solicitation
                    of Napoleon to return to France, and died at Münster in 1804.</p>
                <p>The son of this veteran followed an opposite course and met with a more untimely
                    end. He adopted the liberal opinions of the time. He followed Lafayette and
                    Rochambeau to America. He sat in the Constituent Assembly, constantly voting on
                    the Liberal side. He served as chief of the staff to the Republican army on the
                    Rhine; but, like many other champions of the Revolution, he was denounced,
                    arrested, dragged to Paris, and executed on the 27th June 1794. The parting
                    injunction he left to his son, Victor de Broglie, the subject of this notice,
                    then a boy nine years old, was ever to remain faithful to the cause of liberty,
                    even though it were ungrateful and unjust. His father murdered, his mother
                    imprisoned, his property confiscated and plundered, the young de Broglie first
                    appears in life in wooden shoes and a red cap of liberty, begging an assignat
                    from the younger Robespierre. Yet he adhered to the cause for which his father
                    had died; he maintained through life the principles of 1789. He seemed to have
                    forgotten his own rank, until he was reminded of it at the Restoration by a writ
                    of summons to the Chamber of Peers, and in early life he served, not
                    unwillingly, as one of the officers of the council of state of the emperor
                    Napoleon I.</p>
                <p>In 1815, before he had completed his 30th year, the Due de Broglie was summoned
                    by Louis XVIII. to the Chamber of Peers. He combined, in a manner rare in
                    France, the qualities we are wont to respect in the most eminent members of the
                    British aristocracy,—high rank, independent fortune, unblemished integrity,
                    unflinching patriotism, and a sincere and consistent attachment to liberal
                    opinions. The first incident in his parliamentary life was the trial of Marshal
                    Ney, and on this occasion he had the courage to speak and vote alone for the
                    acquittal of the prisoner, on the ground that he was not guilty of deliberate
                    treason; no other peer of France supported his protest on that occasion. During
                    the Restoration he continued to take an active part in the defence of liberal
                    opinions and measures. He refused to take office in the cabinet of Μ. de Serre.
                    He opposed the reactionary policy of the court. He supported the short lived
                    administration of Μ. de. Martignac, and he acted with the party known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">doctrinaires, of</hi> which Μ. Royer-Collard was the founder, and
                    Μ. Guizot the ablest representative. Meanwhile, in 1816, he had married the
                    daughter of Madame de Stael, a union of unbroken domestic happiness; and he had
                    pledged himself to that sacred cause of Negro emancipation, in which he was the
                    worthy rival and ally of Clarkson, Buxton, Wilberforce, and Brougham. The
                    revolution of July 1830 imposed fresh duties on the Due de Broglie. Though
                    reluctant to take office from his cold, retiring, and unambitious temperament,
                    he consented to hold the ministry of public worship in the first cabinet of
                    Louis Philippe’s reign, and in 1832, after the death of Casimir Périer, he was
                    prevailed upon to take the more important department of foreign affairs. In this
                    function he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n407/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0407-0360"/> strengthened the alliance of France with England;
                    he negotiated the Quadruple alliance; he contributed to the settlement of the
                    Belgian and Greek questions; and he laboured with success to preserve the peace
                    of Europe. He was out of office from March 1834 to March 1835, but he returned
                    to power at the latter date, and this time as the head of the cabinet. He was
                    riding by the side of the king when Fieschi’s “infernal machine” was fired on
                    the royal cortege, and a bullet passed through the collar of his coat. In 1836
                    the Government was beaten on the question of the reduction of the five per
                    cents., and Μ. de Broglie retired permanently from official life. The king, it
                    must be said, had never found in him a congenial minister. His manner was dry
                    and somewhat harsh, his character unbending, and for the remainder of the reign
                    of Louis Philippe, Μ. de Broglie, though not in opposition, was the censor
                    rather than the servant of the crown. With Μ. Guizot, though not in office, he
                    preserved through life the relations of the closest personal friendship and
                    political union. The overthrow of the constitutional monarchy in 1848 was a
                    heavy blow to this parliamentary veteran, for he felt that the form and system
                    of government to which he was most attached were at an end for ever. He
                    consented, however, from patriotic motives to sit in the republican assemblies
                    of 1848, and as a member of the section known as the “Burgraves” he laboured to
                    counteract some of the evils of universal suffrage, and to avert the catastrophe
                    which he saw to be impending over France. He shared with his colleagues the
                    indignity of the <hi rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi> of December 2, 1851, and
                    remained for the remainder of his life one of the bitterest enemies of the
                    imperial régime, although he has been heard to remark with that caustic wit for
                    which he was famous, that the empire was “the government which the poorer
                    classes in France desired and the rich deserved.” The last twenty years of his
                    life were devoted chiefly to philosophical and literary pursuits. Having been
                    brought up by his stepfather, Μ. d’Argenson, in the sceptical opinions of the
                    time, he gradually arrived, by study and reflection, at a full and sincere
                    belief in the truth of the Christian religion. “I shall die,” said he, a
                    “penitent Christian and an impenitent Liberal.” His literary works, though few
                    of them have been published, were rewarded by a seat in the French Academy, and
                    he was also a member of another branch of the French Institute, the Academy of
                    Moral and Political Science. In the labours of those learned bodies he took an
                    active and assiduous part · and on his death, which took place at the advanced
                    age of 85, just before the lamentable events of 1870, he was followed to the
                    grave by representatives of all that is most illustrious in the political and
                    literary society of France, revered as one of the wisestand most upright men of
                    his age. He was succeeded in the honours of his house by Albert de Broglie, his
                    eldest son, also distinguished by his literary works, and who has since 1871
                    played no inconsiderable part in the political affairs of his country as a
                    leading member of the National Assembly, and for sometime head of the cabinet of
                    Marshal Macmahon. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. r.)</hi></p>
