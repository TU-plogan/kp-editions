                <p><label type="entry">BOUCHES-DU-RHONE</label>, a department of France, situated
                    along the south coast, and, as the name imports, at the mouth of the Rhone. It
                    is bounded on the N. by Vaucluse, from which it is separated by the Durance; on
                    the E. by Var, and W. by Gard; and its area is estimated at 1963 English square
                    miles. The western portion consists of a low and marshy plain, known as the
                    Camargue, which is remarkable for its unhealthiness; to the east of this is
                    situated the remarkable stretch of country called the Crau, which is strewn with
                    pebbles like the sea beach; and further east and north there are various ranges
                    of mountains of moderate elevation belonging to the Alpine system. A few small
                    tributaries of the Rhone and the Durance and a number of streams, such as the
                    Arc, the Touloubre, and the Huveaune, which find their way directly to the sea,”
                    are the only rivers that properly belong to the department. The proportion of
                    arable land is exceedingly small, though the quantity has been considerably
                    increased by artificial irrigation. Wheat is cultivated with success in some
                    parts of the Camargue, and, if labour were more easily obtainable, rice might
                    also be grown. Horses and cattle are reared in a half wild condition, and large
                    flocks of sheep are pastured during the winter on the herbage that springs up
                    among the pebbles of the Crau. The numbers of domestic animals in the department
                    were in 1872 as follows :— horses 20,665, cattle 2686, sheep 262,566, and goats
                    17,560. The only mineral furnished to any extent by the department is coal, in
                    the mining of which between 1000 and 2000 workmen are engaged, but there are
                    also quarries of limestone, sandstone, slate, gypsum, marl, and marble. The salt
                    marshes, which cover an area of 2290 acres, employ more workmen than the
                    coal-mines, and the amount of salt obtained exceeds in quantity the produce of
                    any other department in France. There are extensive manufactures of soaps,

                    and Ciotat. The department is divided into the three arrondissements of
