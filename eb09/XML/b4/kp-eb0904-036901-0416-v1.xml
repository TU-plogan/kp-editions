                <p><label type="entry">BROOCH, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Broach</hi></label>, (from
                    the French <hi rend="italic">broche},</hi> an awl or bodkin. A spit is sometimes
                    called a <hi rend="italic">broach,</hi> and hence the phrase “to broach a
                    barrel.” The term is now used to denote a clasp or fastener for the dress
                    provided with a pin, having a hinge or spring at one end, and a catch and loop
                    at the other. Brooches were universally used among the more civilized nations of
                    antiquity. They were made of many materials, and in innumerable varieties of
                    ornamental design, the forms varying according to the period of their
                    manufacture, or the taste and culture of the people using them. They are unknown
                    in the Swiss Lake settlements of the Bronze Age, though pins and bracelets are
                    abundant. Brooches of the Bronze Age are extremely rare in Britain, although
                    they occur in considerable numbers and of elegant forms in North Germany and
                    Scandinavia. The simplest is similar to that which has been reproduced in modern
                    times as the “patent safety-pin,” but having the ends prolonged into flat
                    spirals and the clasp flattened and engraved with ornamental designs. Another
                    characteristic form was produced by winding a long wire into a flat
                    double-spiral, of which one end formed the pin and the other the catch. A third
                    form consisted of two round ornamented plates connected by a bow-shaped centre
                    piece. In the early Iron Age the brooches of Central Europe exhibit an immense
                    variety of forms, which are for the most part bow-shaped or harp-shaped, with
                    spring-pins, akin to the types found in the Etruscan cemeteries of Certosa aud
                    Villanova recently explored. The Frankish group exhibits three well-defined
                    types, viz., an imitation of animal forms, a simple disc, and a cruciform type,
                    of which there are innumerable varieties of form. The Merovingian brooches were
                    made in gold, silver, or bronze, adorned with precious stones, filagree-work, or
                    enamel; but whatever the richness of the brooch, the pin was always of iron. The
                    Scandinavian or Northern group exhibits a similar cruciform variety more massive
                    in form and richly chased, the terminating knobs fashioned into the similitude
                    of animals’ heads. This form occurs also in Anglo-Saxon graves in England. The
                    Anglo-Saxon brooches were exquisite works of art, ingeniously and tastefully
                    constructed. In Kent the circular form predominates. They are often of gold,
                    with a central boss exquisitely decorated, the flat part of the brooch being a
                    mosaic of turquoises, garnets on gold-foil, mother of pearl, &lt;fcc., arranged
                    in geometric patterns, and the gold work enriched with filagree or decorated
                    with dragonesque engravings. Sometimes the brooch was cruciform and ornamented
                    with chased work and settings of paste or precious stones. The Scandinavian
                    brooches of the Viking time were oval and bowl-shaped, formed of an under shell
                    of impure bronze gilt on the convex side, and covered by an upper shell of open
                    chased-work ornamented with bosses, or open crown-like ornaments, or animals’
                    heads. The geographical distribution of these peculiar brooches indicates the
                    extent of the conquests of the Northmen. They occur in northern Scotland,
                    England, Ireland, Iceland, Normandy, and Livonia. The Celtic group is
                    characterized by the penannπlar form of the ring of the brooch and the greater
                    length of the pin. They are usually of bronze or silver, chased or engraved with
                    intricate designs of interlaced or dragonesque work in the style of the
                    illuminated Celtic manuscripts of the 7th, 8th, and 9th centuries. The
                    Hunterston brooch, which was found at Hawking Craig in Ayrshire, is a well-known
                    example of this style. Silver brooches of immense size, some having pins 15
                    inches in length, and the penannular ring of the brooch terminating in large
                    knobs resembling thistle heads, are occasionally found in Viking hoards of this
                    period, consisting of bullion, brooches, and Cufic and Anglo-Saxon coins buried
                    on Scottish soil. In mediaeval times the form of the brooch was usually a
                    simple, flat circular disc, with open centre, the pin being equal in length to
                    the diameter of the brooch. They were often inscribed with religious and
                    talismanic <hi rend="italic">formulae.</hi> The Highland brooches were commonly
                    of this form, but the disc was broader, and the central opening smaller in
                    proportion to the size of the brooch. They were ornamented in the style so
                    common on Highland powder-horns, with engraved patterns of interlacing work and
                    foilage, arranged in geometrical spaces, and sometimes mingled with figures of
                    animals.</p>
