                    (1506-1582), a celebrated Scottish historian and scholar, was born in February
                    1506. His father, a younger son of an old family, was the possessor of the farm
                    of Moss, in the parish of Killearn, Stirling shire, but he died at an early age,
                    leaving his widow and children in poverty. George, the third son, is said to
                    have attended Killearn school, but not much is known of his early education. In
                    1520 he was sent by his uncle to the university of Paris, where he prosecuted
                    his studies with great ardour, and especially trained himself in poetical
                    composition. In 1522 his uncle died, and Buchanan being thus unable to continue
                    longer in Paris, returned to Scotland. After recovering from a severe illness,
                    he joined the French auxiliaries who had been brought over by the duke of
                    Albany, and took part in an unsuccessful inroad into England. In the following
                    year he entered the university of St Andrews, where he graduated as B.A. in
                    1525. He had gone there chiefly for the purpose of attending the celebrated John
                    Major or Mair’s lectures on logic; and when that teacher removed to Paris
                    Buchanan accompanied him. In 1527 he became B.A., andin 1528 Μ. A. at Paris.
                    Next year he seems to have been appointed regent or professor in the college of
                    Ste Barbe, and taught there for upwards of three years. In 1532 he became the
                    friend and tutor of Gilbert Kennedy, earl of Cassilis, with whom he returned to
                    Scotland about the beginning of 1537.</p>
                <p>While residing at Paris Buchanan had been converted to the Protestant faith, and
                    his first production in Scotland was the poem <hi rend="italic">Somnium,</hi>
                    attacking with keen satire the Franciscan friars and monastic life generally.
                    This assault on the monks was not displeasing to James V., who engaged Buchanan
                    as tutor to one of his natural sons, and encouraged him to a still more daring
                    attack. Under these circumstances the <hi rend="italic">Franciscanus</hi> was
                    written, and it is not surprising that the author became an object of bitterest
                    hatred to all of the Boman Catholic faith. Nor was it yet a safe matter to
                    assail the church. In 1539 there was a bitter persecution of the Lutherans, and
                    Buchanan among others was arrested. He managed to effect his escape, and with
                    considerable difficulty made his way to London and thence to Paris. At Paris,
                    however, he found his resolute enemy, Cardinal Beaton, and on the invitation of
                    Andrew Govea, proceeded to Bordeaux. Govea was then principal of the
                    newly-founded college of Guienne at Bordeaux, and by his exertions Buchanan was
                    appointed professor of Latin. During his residence there several of his best
                    works, the translations of <hi rend="italic">Medea</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcestis,</hi> and his two great dramas <hi rend="italic">Jephthes</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Baptistes,</hi> were completed.</p>
                <p>After three years he returned to Paris, and in 1544 was appointed regent in the
                    college of Cardinal le Moine, a post he held till 1547. He then accepted Govea’s
                    invitation to a chair in the new Portuguese university of Coimbra, afterwards
                    one of the most celebrated seats of learning in Europe. But he had not been long
                    in Portugal when Govea’s death exposed him to the unwearied persecution of the
                    priests. Buchanan was several times examined by the officers of the Inquisition,
                    and finally was confined to a monastery, where he was condemned to hear edifying
                    lessons from the monks. During his imprisonment, which lasted several months, he
                    began his famous version of the Psalms. On his release he sailed for England,
                    but soon made his way to Paris, where, in 1553, he was appointed regent in the
                    College of Boncourt. He remained in that post for two years, and then accepted
                    the office of tutor to the son of the Marshal de Brissac.</p>
                <p>In 1560 or 1561 he returned to Scotland, and in April 1562 we find him installed
                    as tutor to the young queen Mary, who was accustomed to read Livy with him
                    daily. Buchanan now openly joined the Protestant or Reformed Church, and in 1566
                    was appointed by the earl of Murray principal of St Leonard’s College, St
                    Andrews. Two years before he had received from the queen the valuable gift of
                    the revenue resulting from Crossraguel Abbey. He wa3 thus in good circumstances,
                    and his fame was steadily increasing. So great, indeed, was his reputation <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n460/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0460-0413"/> for learning and administrative capacity that,
                    though a layman, he was made moderator of the General Assembly in 1567. He had
                    sat in the Assemblies from 1563.</p>
                <p>The part Buchanan took in the affairs of Queen Mary is well known. He accompanied
                    the Regent Murray into England, and his <hi rend="italic">Detection</hi>
                    (published in 1572) was produced to the commissioners at Westminster. In 1570,
                    after the assassination of Murray, he was appointed one of the preceptors of the
                    young king, and it was through his tuition that James acquired his great
                    scholarship. Buchanan was a strict and severe master, and kept his pupil in
                    salutary awe and obedie'nce. James long remembered the feelings of dread with
                    which he was accustomed to regard his formidable pedagogue.</p>
                <p>While discharging the functions of royal tutor he also held other important
                    offices. He was for a short time director of chancery, and then became lord
                    privy seal, a post which entitled him to a seat in the Parliament. He appears to
                    have continued in this office for some years, at least till 1579. He died on the
                    28th September 1582.</p>
                <p>His last years had been occupied with two of his most important works. The first
                    was the treatise <hi rend="italic">De Jure</hi><hi rend="italic">Regni apud
                    Scotos,</hi> published in 1579. In this famous work, composed in the form of a
                    dialogue, and evidently intended to instil sound political principles into the
                    mind of his pupil, Buchanan lays down the doctrine that the source of all
                    political power is the people, that the king is bound by those conditions under
                    which the supreme power was first committed to his hands, and that it is lawful
                    to resist, even to punish, tyrants. A theory such as this was not likely to be
                    palatable to James. The book was condemned in 1584, and again in 1664; while in
                    1683 it was burned by the loyal scholars of Oxford.</p>
                <p>The second of his large works was the history of Scotland, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rerum, Scoticarum Historia,</hi> completed shortly before his death and
                    published in 1582. It is of great value for the period personally known to the
                    author, which occupies the greater portion of the book. The earlier part is to a
                    considerable extent based on the work of Boece and repeats the legendary history
                    which was for so long an article of faith to every Scotchman.</p>
                <p>Buchanan is the greatest scholar that Scotland has produced. ’For mastery over
                    the Latin language he has never been surpassed by any modern writer. His style
                    is not rigidly modelled upon that of any classical author, but has a certain
                    freshness and elasticity of its own. He wrote Latin as if it had been his mother
                    tongue. But in addition to this perfect command over the instrument of
                    expression, Buchanan had a rich vein of poetical feeling, and great powers of
                    thought. His translations of the Psalms and of the Greek plays are more than
                    mere versions; they have a peculiar grace and felicity. The smaller satirical
                    poems are masterpieces of wit and expressive language, while the two tragedies,
                    <hi rend="italic">Baptistes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jephthes,</hi> are works
                    whose merits have not perhaps been generally recognized.</p>
                <p>There are two complete editions of Buchanan’s works, one by Ruddiman, 2 vols,
                    fo., 1715; the other by Burman, 2 vols. 4to, 1725. His life has been written by
                    Dr Irving, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of George
                    Buchanan,</hi> 2d edition, 1817. The <hi rend="italic">Jephthah</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Baptist</hi> have been translated by A. Gibbs, 1870.</p>
