                    manufacturer and practical engineer, was born at Birmingham on the 14th of
                    September 1728. He was called early into active life upon the death of his
                    father in 1745, and soon found ample scope for the exercise of his inventive
                    faculties in improving the manufactures of his native place. His first attempt
                    was a new mode of inlaying steel; and he succeeded in obtaining a considerable
                    demand for the products of his manufactory, which were principally exported to
                    the Continent, and not uncommonly re-imported for domestic use as of foreign
                    manufacture.</p>
                <p>In 1762, his fortune being already considerable, he purchased a tract of barren
                    heath in the neighbourhood of Birmingham, with a single house on it, and there
                    founded, at the expense of £9000, the manufactory which flourished so long and
                    was so well known under the name of Soho. His workmen were at first principally
                    employed in the imitation of ormolu, ard in copying oil paintings with great
                    accuracy, by means of a mechanical process which was invented by a Mr Eggington,
                    who afterwards distinguished himself by various works in stained glass. Boulton
                    finding the horse-power inadequate to the various purposes of his machinery
                    erected, in 1767, a steam-engine, upon the original construction of Savary,
                    which, notwithstanding the inconvenience of a great loss of steam from
                    condensation, by its immediate contact with the water raised, has still some
                    advantages from the simplicity of the apparatus it requires, and has been found
                    to succeed well upon a small scale. But Boulton’s objects required a still more
                    powerful machine, and he had the discernment to perceive that they might be very
                    completely attained by the adoption of the various improvements made in the
                    steam-engine by James Watt of Glasgow, who had obtained a patent for them in
                    1769, the privileges of which were extended in 1775, by an Act of Parliament, to
                    a term of twenty-five years. Boulton induced the great inventor to remove to
                    Birmingham. They commenced a partnership in business, and established a
                    manufactory of steam-engines, in which accurate execution kept pace so well with
                    judicious design, that its productions continued to be equally in request with
                    the public after the expiration of <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n214/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0214-0173"/> the term of that legal privilege which at
                    first gave the proprietors the exclusive right of supplying them, and which had
                    been confirmed in 1792 by a decision of the Court of King’s Bench against some
                    encroachment on the right of the patentee. It was principally for the purpose of
                    carrying on this manufactory with greater convenience, that the proprietors
                    established an iron-foundry of their own at Smethwick, in the neighbourhood of
                    Soho.</p>
                <p>In 1785 Boulton was made a fellow of the Royal Society, about the same time with
                    Withering, and several others of his scientific neighbours. In 1788 he turned
                    his attention to the subject of coining, and erected machinery for the purpose,
                    so extensive and complete, that the operation was performed with equal economy
                    and precision, and the coins could not be imitated by any single artist for
                    their nominal value,—each of the stamps coining, with the attendance of a little
                    boy only, about eighty pieces in a minute. The preparatory operation of
                    laminating and cutting out the metal was performed in an adjoining room; and all
                    personal communication between the workmen was rendered unnecessary by the
                    mechanical conveyance of the work from one part of the machinery to another. A
                    coinage of silver was executed at this mint for the Sierra Leone Company, and
                    another of copper for the East Indiee, besides the pence and half-pence at one
                    time in circulation throughout England, and a large quantity of money of all
                    kinds for Russia. In acknowledgment of Boulton’s services, and in return for
                    some specimens of his different manufactures, the Emperor Paul made him a
                    present of a valuable collection of medals and minerals.</p>
                <p>In 1797 he obtained a patent for a mode of raising water by impulse, the
                    specification of which is published in the ninth volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Repertory of Arts,</hi> p. 145. It had been demonstrated by Daniel
                    Bernouilli, in the beginning of the century, that water flowing through a pipe,
                    and arriving at a part in which the pipe is suddenly contracted, would have its
                    velocity at first very greatly increased; but no practical application of the
                    principle appears to have been attempted, until an apparatus was set up in 1792
                    by Mr Whitehurst for Mr Egerton of Oult∩n, in Cheshire, consisting of an
                    air-vessel communicating with a water-pipe by a valve, which was forced open by
                    the pressure or rather impulse of the water, when its passage through the pipe
                    was suddenly stopped by turning the cock in the ordinary course of domestic
                    economy; and although the pipe through which the water was forced up was of
                    moderate height, the air-vessel, which was at first made of lead, was soon burst
                    by the “momentous force,” as Whitehurst termed it. The apparatus had excited
                    much attention in France, under the name of Montgolfier’s hydraulic ram; and
                    Boulton added to it a number of ingenious modifications, some of which, however,
                    are more calculated to display the vivid imagination of a projector than the
                    sound judgment of a practical engineer, which had in general so strongly
                    characterized all his productions.</p>
                <p>He died, August 17,1809, after a long illness, in possession of considerable
                    affluence and of universal esteem. (See Smiles’s <hi rend="italic">Lives of
                        Boulton and Watt,</hi> 1865.)</p>
