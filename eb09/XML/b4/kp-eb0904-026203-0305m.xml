                    juridical treatises <hi rend="italic">(jura).</hi> From the circumstance that
                    the Breviarium has prefixed to it a royal rescript <hi rend="italic"
                    >(commonitorium)</hi> directing that copies of it, certified under the hand of
                    Anianus, should be received exclusively as law throughout the kingdom of the
                    Visigoths, the compilation of the code has been attributed to Anianus by many
                    writers, and it is frequently designated the Breviary of Anianus (Breviarium
                    Aniani). The code, however, appears to have been known amongst the Visigoths by
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">“Lex</hi> Romana,” or “Lex Theodosii,” and it was
                    not until the 16 th century that the title of “Breviarium” was introduced to
                    distinguish it from a recast of the code, which was introduced into Northern
                    Italy in the 9th century for the use of the Romans in Lombardy. This recast of
                    the Visigothic code has been preserved in a MS. known as the Codex Utinensis,
                    which was formerly kept in the archives of the cathedral of Udine, but is now
                    lost; and it was published in the last century for the first time by Canciani in
                    his collection of ancient laws entitled <hi rend="italic">Barbarorum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Leges Antiques.</hi> It has been published in the present century
                    by Walter in his <hi rend="italic">Corpτιs Juris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Germanici,</hi> Berolini, 1824. Another MS. of this Lombard recast of the
                    Visigothic code has lately been discovered by Hanel in the library of St Gall.
                    Neither of these MSS. comprises the whole of the Visigothic code, and it is the
                    opinion of very competent scholars that the Lex Romana of the Lombards did not
                    contain any portion of the Gregorian or Hemogenian code, nor the fragment of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Responsa</hi><hi rend="italic">Papiani.</hi> The chief value
                    of the Visigothic code consists in the fact, that it is the only collection of
                    Roman Law in which the five first books of the Theodosian code and five books of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sententioe Receptoe</hi> of Julius Paulus have been
                    preserved, and until the discovery of a MS. in the chapter library in Verona,
                    which contained the greater part of the Institutes of Gaius, it was the only
                    work in which any portion of the institutional writings of that great jurist <pb

                    the Breviarium will be found in the collection of Roman law published under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Jus Civile Ante-</hi><hi rend="italic"
