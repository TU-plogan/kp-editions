                <p><label type="entry">BREMER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Fredrika</hi></label>, the most
                    celebrated Swedish novelist, was born near Abo, in Finland, on the 17th August
                    1801. Her father, a descendant of an old German family, was a wealthy iron
                    master and merchant. He left Finland when Fredrika was three years old, and
                    after a year’s residence in Stockholm, purchased an estate at Arsta, about 20
                    miles from the capital. There, with occasional visits to Stockholm and to a
                    neighbouring estate, which belonged for a time to her father, Fredrika passed
                    her time till 1820. The education to which she and her sisters were subjected
                    was unusually strict; their parents, especially their father, were harsh and
                    took little or no pains to understand the temperaments of the children. The
                    constant repression, the sense of being misunderstood, and the apparent
                    aimlessness of such an existence told with greatest force upon Fredrika, who was
                    of a quick and eager disposition, fond of praise and conscious of powers which
                    it seemed to her must lie for ever unused. She felt as if her life were being
                    wasted; there was nothing on which she could expend her energy; no career was
                    open to a woman. Her health began to give way; and in 1821 the whole family set
                    out for the south of France. They travelled slowly by way of Germany and
                    Switzerland, and returned by Paris and the Netherlands. It was shortly after
                    this time that Miss Bremer became acquainted with Schiller’s poetical works,
                    which made a very deep impression on her. Her home life, however, was still
                    unsatisfying, and in her passionate longing for some work to which she could
                    devote herself, and through which she might do some good in the world, she for a
                    time resolved to join one of the Stockholm hospitals as a nurse. This plan was
                    given up on the entreaty of her sister. Meanwhile, she had found relief for her
                    pent-up feelings in writing, or rather in continuing to write, for she had been
                    an authoress of a sort from the age of eight. In 1828 she determined to attempt
                    publication, and succeeded in finding a publisher. The first volume of her <hi
                        rend="italic">Sketches of Every Day Life</hi> (1828) at once attracted
                    attention, and the second volume (1831), containing one of her best tales, <hi
                        rend="italic">The H Family,</hi> gave decisive evidence that a real novelist
                    had been found in Sweden. The Swedish Academy awarded her their smaller gold
                    medal, and the fortunate authoress became famous. From this time Miss Bremer had
                    found her vocation. Her father had died in 1830, and her life was thereafter
                    regulated in accordance with her own wishes and tastes. She lived for some years
                    in Norway with a friend, after whose death she resolved to gratify a
                    long-repressed desire for travel. Tn the autumn of 1849 she set out for America,
                    and after spending nearly two years there returned through England. The
                    admirable translations of her works by Mary Howitt, which had been received with
                    even greater eagerness in America and England than in Sweden, secured for her a
                    warm and kindly reception. Her impressions of America, <hi rend="italic">Homes
                        in the New World,</hi> were published in 1853, and were at once translated
                    into English. After her return Miss Bremer devoted herself to her great scheme
                    for the advancement or, one may say, emancipation of w omcn. On this subject she
                    had thought deeply, and her own experience was of value to her in shaping her
                    ideas of what the education and function of woman should be. “She wished,” says
                    her sister, “that women should, like men and togethtι∙ with them, be allowed to
                    study at the elementary schools and academies, in order to gain an opportunity
                    of obtaining suitable employments and situations in the service of the state. .
                    . . She said she was firmly convinced that women could acquire all kinds of
                    knowledge just as well as men, that they ought to stand on the same level, and
                    that they ought to prepare themselves in the public schools and universities to
                    become lecturers, professors, judges, physicians, and functionaries in the
                    service of the state” <hi rend="italic">{Life,</hi> Ac., pp. 81-2). Some of
                    these views were expounded in her later novels, <hi rend="italic">Hertha</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Father and Daughter,</hi> which naturally were not so
                    successful as her other works. Miss Bremer not only wrote of her plans, but
                    endeavoured, so far as she could, to induce women to devote themselves to some
                    kind of work. She organized a society of ladies in Stockholm for the purpose of
                    visiting the prisons, and during the cholera raised a society the object of
                    which <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n300/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0300-0257"/> was the care of children left orphans by the
                    epidemic. In 1856 she again travelled, and spent five years on the Continent and
                    in Palestine. Iler reminiscences of these countries have all been translated
                    into English. On her return she settled at Arsta, where, with the exception of a
                    visit to Germany, she spent the remaining years of her life. She died on the
                    31st December 1865. Miss Bremer has been called, and with justice, the Miss
                    Austen of Sweden. Her novels have the purity, simplicity, and love of domestic
                    life, which arc characteristic of the English writer. She is, however, inferior
                    to Miss Austen in construction of plot and in delineation of character. Some of
                    her best works show slight traces of overstrained sentiment, and the situations
                    are occasionally somewhat melo-dramatic. <hi rend="italic">The Neighbours</hi>
                    is the most popular and the best of her tales; it is an admirable picture of
                    Swedish home life, showing at times the quiet humour which is more prominent in
                        <hi rend="italic">The II Family.</hi> All the works have been translated
                    into</p>
                <p>German and English, and the greater number of them into French. In America they
                    have circulated very widely, and have been extremely popular.</p>
