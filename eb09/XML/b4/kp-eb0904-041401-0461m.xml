                    Bukorest</hi></label>, or, as it is called by the inhabitants, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bucuresci</hi> (that is, according to their own etymology, City
                    of Joy), is the capital of Roumania, the residence of the prince and the seat of
                    a bishop. It is situated in a hollow on the River Dimbovitza, a tributary of the
                    Danube, in 44° 25' 30" N. lat. and 26° 5' 24" E. long., and occupies an area of
                    more than 20 English square miles. The number of its cupolas and minarets, and
                    the profusion of acacia, poplar, and other trees that fill the numerous spaces
                    of unoccupied ground, give it a picturesque appearance from a distance. The
                    arrangement of its streets is very irregular, and in many districts it cannot be
                    said that there are streets at all. In general the roadways are either unpaved
                    or only laid with rough blocks of different sizes. A few streets, indeed (and
                    notably the Podo Mogo-choi, which is the most important), have been paved with
                    Aberdeen granite. The city is lighted with gas produced from English coal; and a
                    considerable but far from satisfactory supply of water is obtained from the
                    river and distributed partly by water-carts and partly by iron pipes. Of the
                    public buildings few are of much architectural importance; the national theatre
                    is one of the largest, and the “academy” one of the finest. The latter is
                    occupied by the university, a library of 26,000 volumes, a public museum of
                    antiquities and natural history, and a large theatre, which is used by the
                    senate during the parliamentary session. The palace, an insignificant building,
                    was founded by the Golesco family in the 18th century. There are 116 Greek
                    churches in the city, of which the most remarkable are the Metropolitan, St
                    George, St Spiridion, and Sarindar. The Roman Catholics have a parish-church in
                    the centre of the town and several chapels; there are Lutheran and Calvinistic
                    churches, with schools attached for both boys and girls; and the Jews, who
                    number about 15,000, have ten synagogues. There are about a score of conventual
                    establishments, the majority belonging to the Greek Church. The Brancovano
                    hospital, founded by the family of that name, has accommodation for between 200
                    and 300 patients, the military hospital for 300, the Culza for 200, the
                    Philanthropic for 100, and the Pantelemonu for 120. The Marcutza insane asylum
                    can receive 220; and the Helena asylum, founded by the Princess Helena in 1862,
                    has room for 220 orphan girls. There is also a children’s hospital for 100
                    patients, and a lying-in hospital for 40. In Bucharest there is always a
                    numerous garrison, and the arsenal and barracks on the plateau of Dealu and the
                    cavalry and infantry barracks at St George are both extensive establishments.
                    «Cafés and coffee-gardens abound, and are allowed to remain open all night.
                    There are two public gardens, the Cismegiu in the centre of the town, about a
                    mile in circumference, and the Kisilev on the outskirts, which is traversed by
                    the fashionable promenade known as the Chaussée. Public locomotion is
                    facilitated by about 500 droshkas in summer and as many sledges in winter; and a
                    tramway has recently been laid down by an English company. The monetary business
                    of the city is extensive,—its principal establishments being the Bank of
                    Roumania, founded in 1865, with a capital of one million sterling, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Société Financière de Roumanie,</hi> with a capital of six million
                    francs. The manufacturing industry is slight, the principal article being
                    Turkish cloth; but the trade both in foreign and native goods is of very
                    considerable extent. The mercantile portion of the community is largely composed
                    of foreigners—Germans, Greeks, Frenchmen, Swiss—who keep themselves very much
                    apart from each other. Division into classes and nationalities is a marked
                    feature of the whole Bucharest population. The Boyards, though their
                    aristocratic pretensions are no longer recognized by law, are as exclusive as
                    ever. There are about 20,000 Transylvanians who fill subordinate positions;
                    the.droshka-drivers are mainly Russians of the Lipovani sect; and Bulgarians,
                    Armenians, gypsies, and many others swell the motley multitude. In spite of the
                    fact that the number of deaths is frequently in excess of the number of births,
                    the increase of the population is rapid, and house-rents have become very high;
                    and that it is more the habits of the people than the unhealthiness of the city
                    that is to blame for the death-rate is shown by the steady internal increase of
                    the Jewish community. About eighteen newspapers are published in the city—three
                    daily and the others twice or thrice a week. The railway system, begun by the
                    opening of the line to Giurgevo on the Danube in 1869, is rapidly extending, and
                    there is direct communication with Western Europe by the line to Lemberg. The
                    population, which was 121,754 in 1859, had increased by 1870 to 200,000, and is
                    now stated at 251,000.</p>
                <p>Bucharest owes its foundation in the 13th century to Radel the Black of
                    Wallachia. Burnt in 1595 by Sinan Pusha it was soon afterwards restored, but it
                    was not till the 18th century that it appeared much in European history. It was
                    frequently of importance in the contests for the neighbouring provinces, which
                    so often broke out between the Turks and their northern rivals Austria and
                    Russia; and in 1812 it gave its name to the treaty by which Bessarabia and a
                    third of Moldavia were ceded to the latter power. In the war of 1828 it was
                    occupied by the Russians, who made it over to the prince of Wallachia in the
                    following year. A rebellion against Prince Bibesko in 1848 brought both Turkish
                    and Russian interference, aud the city was again held by Russian troops from
                    1853 to 1854. On their departure an Austrian garrison took possession and
                    remained till March 1857. In 1858 the international congress for the
                    organization of the Danubian principalities was held in the city; and in 1861
                    the union of Wallachia and Moldavia was proclaimed. Prince Couza, the first
                    ruler of the united provinces, was driven from his throne by an insurrection in
                    Bucharest in 1866.</p>
