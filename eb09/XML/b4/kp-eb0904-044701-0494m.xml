                <p><label type="entry">BUILDING</label></p>
                <p>THE art of building comprises the practice of civil architecture, or the
                    mechanical operations necessary to carry the designs of the architect into
                    effect. It is not unfrequently called <hi rend="italic">practical
                    architecture;</hi> but the adoption of this term would tend only to confuse, by
                    rendering it difficult to make the distinction generally understood between
                    architecture as a fine or liberal art and architecture as a mechanical art. The
                    execution of works of architecture necessarily includes building, but building
                    is frequently employed when the result is not architectural; a man may be a
                    competent builder without being an architect, but no one can be an accomplished
                    architect unless he be competent to specify and direct all the operations of
                    building. A scientific knowledge of the principles of masonry, carpentry,
                    joinery, &amp;c., and of the qualities, strength, and resistance of materials,
                    though of the utmost importance to an architect, must be attended by a minute
                    acquaintance with a great variety of less ambitious details. Such are those
                    which relate to the arrangement of a plan for the greatest possible degree of
                    convenience on the smallest space, and at the least expense; its transference to
                    the ground; the preparation and formation of foundations; the arrangement and
                    construction of drains, sewers, and vent-shafts; the varieties of walling with
                    stone, and of laying bricks in brickwork; the merit of the various modes of
                    bonding and tying walls, both lengthwise and across; the arrangement of gutters
                    on roofs, to get sufficient fall, and to conduct the water to the least
                    inconvenient places for fixing trunks to lead it down; the arrangement and
                    formation of flues; the protection of walls from damp, of timber from moisture
                    and stagnant air, and of metals generally from exciting causes; the cost of
                    materials and labour, and the quantity of each required to produce certain
                    results. Together with these, an architect ought to be practically acquainted
                    with all the modes of operation in all the trades or arts employed in building,
                    and to be able minutely io estimate beforehand the absolute cost involved in the
                    execution of a proposed structure. The power to do the latter necessarily
                    involves that of measuring work, and ascertaining the quantities done. These
                    things may certainly be referred to the surveyor or measurer, but they are not
                    the less incumbent on the architect, who cannot be said to be thoroughly master
                    of building, or the practice of his profession, unless he be skilled in these
                    operations.</p>
                <p>Building includes what is called construction, which is the branch of the science
                    of architecture relating to the practical execution of the works required to
                    produce any structure; it will therefore be necessary to explain the subject in
                    a general manner before entering upon building in detail.</p>
                <p>It may, perhaps, be useful to premise that, should it occur to some readers that
                    the present article has too great a tendency to supply information on the manner
                    of building in a modern style, and that the earlier method is not elaborated, it
                    must be remembered that, although the styles of architecture have varied at
                    different periods, buildings, wherever similar materials are employed, must be
                    constructed on much the same principles. Greater scientific knowledge of the
                    natures and properties of materials has, however, given to the modern workman
                    immense advantages over his mediaeval brother craftsman, and caused many changes
                    in the details of the trade, or art of building, although stones, bricks,
                    mortar, &amp;c., then as now, formed the element of the more solid parts of all
                    edifices. The introduction of fir, too, in place of the more sohd and durable
                    timber oak, has likewise occasioned similar changes, too numerous to mention in
                    detail, in the sister arts of carpentry and joinery, probably also causing the
                    division of the carpenter’s trade of the mediaeval period. Certain exceptional
                    features of mediaeval work did exist, and most, if not all, will, it is hoped,
                    be found referred to in this article.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Principles of Construction.</hi></p>
                <p>The object of construction is to adapt and combine fit materials in such a manner
                    that they shall retain in use the forms and dispositions assigned to them. If an
                    upright wall be properly constructed upon a sufficient foundation, the combined
                    mass will retain its position, and bear pressure acting in the direction of
                    gravity, to any extent that the ground on which it stands and the component
                    materials of the wall can sustain. But pressure acting laterally has a necessary
                    tendency to overturn a wall, and therefore it will be the aim of the constructor
                    to compel, as far as possible, all forces that can act upon an upright wall to
                    act in the direction of gravity, or else to give it permanent means of
                    resistance in the direction opposite to that in which a disturbing force may
                    act. Thus when an arch is built to bear against an upright wall, a buttress or
                    other counterfort is applied in a direction opposed to the pressure of the arch.
                    In like manner the inclined roof of a building, spanning from wall to wall,
                    tends to thrust out the walls; and hence a tie is applied to hold the opposite
                    sides of the roof together at its base, where alone a tie can be fully
                    efficient, and thus the roof is made to act upon the walls wholly in the
                    direction of gravity; or where an efficient tie is inapplicable, buttresses or
                    counterforts are added to the walls, to enable them to resist the pressure
                    outwards. A beam laid horizontally from wall to wall, as a girder to carry a
                    floor and its load, may sag or bend downwards, and tend thereby to force out the
                    walls; or the beam itself may break. Both these contingencies are obviated by
                    trussing, which renders the beam stiff enough to place its load on the walls in
                    the direction of gravity, and strong enough to carry it safely. Or if the beam
                    be rigid in its nature, or uncertain in its structure, or both (as cast-iron
                    is), and will break without bending, the constructor, by the smith’s art, will
                    supply a check and ensure it against the possible contingency.</p>
                <p>Perfect stability, however, is not to be attained with materials which are
                    subject to influences beyond the control of man, and all matter is subject to
                    certain influences of that nature. The influences mostly to be contended against
                    are heat and humidity, the former of which produces movement of some kind or to
                    some extent in all bodies; the latter, movement in many kinds of matter; whilst
                    the two acting together contribute to the disintegration or decay of materials
                    available for the purposes of construction. These pervading influences the
                    constructor seeks to counteract, by the selection and disposition of his
                    materials accordingly. From the tenacity of wrought iron, and its almost plastic
                    character in the hands of the smith, it is employed to tie together other more
                    bulky but less costly and more rigid materials; but on account of its exceeding
                    susceptibility of heat, and its consequent expansion and contraction, wrought
                    iron must be used in short lengths only, unless where protected from great
                    alternations of heat and cold. The rapid decay, too, of wrought iron when
                    exposed to humidity, and especially when it is alternately wet and dry, will
                    teach the constructor not to expect enduring stability <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n495/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0495-0448"/> in his works if he makes them dependent upon
                    wrought iron. Cast-iron is brittle, and may not be exposed with impunity to
                    transverse strain, especially if such strain be attended by action tending to
                    induce vibration; it expands and contracts under the influence of heat, but it
                    resists compression in every direction, and if used in small bodies, is valuable
                    as a means of connecting other materials. Timber, being practically unchangeable
                    in the direction of its length from the mere absorption of either heat or
                    humidity, and at the same time practically both inextensible and incompressible
                    in that direction, and being also readily wrought and easily combined alike with
                    other timber and with iron, is a valuable material in the hands of the
                    constructor; but it shrinks and swells in the direction of its thickness, and,
                    in consequence, is subject to rapid decay when exposed to alternations of
                    moisture and dryness; and although in many varieties timber is perdurable and
                    unchangeable in form if it be kept either altogether free from moisture or
                    always wholly wet, its quality of inextensibility is greatly diminished in value
                    to the constructor on account of the comparatively slight resistance it offers
                    to compressing power, and the comparative ease with which its fibrous structure
                    is torn asunder. From this cause it cannot be grasped or otherwise held so that
                    its power of resisting extension may be made available in any degree
                    proportioned to its strength; whilst its quality of incompressibility in the
                    opposite direction is of less value to the constructor for many purposes which
                    require that quality in the material, because it absorbs moisture by the ends of
                    the fibre more readily, and with a far more mischievous effect, than it does in
                    the direction in which it is compressible. Hence timber rots more rapidly by the
                    ends than by the sides.</p>
                <p>Stone and brick, the other main available materials in general construction, keep
                    their places in combination by means of gravity. They may be merely packed
                    together, but in general they are compacted by means of mortar or cement, so
                    that although the main constituent materials are wholly incompressible, masses
                    of either or of both combined in structures are compressible until the setting
                    medium has indurated to a like condition of hardness. That kind of stone is best
                    fitted for the purposes of general construction which is least absorbent of
                    moisture, and at the same time free to work. Absorbent stone exposed to the
                    weather rapidly disintegrates; and for the most part non-absorbent stone is so
                    hard that it cannot always be used with a due regard to economy. When,
                    therefore, fitting stone of both qualities can be obtained, the harder stone can
                    be exposed to the weather, or to the action which the softer stone cannot
                    resist, and forms the main body of the structure of the latter so protected. The
                    hard and the soft should be made to bear alike, and should therefore be coursed
                    and bonded together by the mason’s art, whether the work be of stone wrought
                    into blocks and gauged to thickness, or of rough dressed or otherwise unshaped
                    rubble compacted with mortar.</p>
                <p>Good bricks are less absorbent of moisture than any stone of the same degree of
                    hardness, and are better nonconductors of heat than stone. As the basis of a
                    stable structure, brickwork is more to be relied upon than stone in the form of
                    rubble, when the constituents bear the relation to one another last above
                    referred to, the setting material being the same in both; because the brick, by
                    its shaped form, seats itself truly, and produces by bonding a more perfectly
                    combined mass; whilst the imperfectly shaped and variously sized stone as
                    dressed rubble can neither bed nor bond truly,·—the inequalities of the form
                    having to be compensated for with mortar, and the irregularity of size of the
                    main constituent accounted for by the introduction of larger and smaller stones.
                    The mo3t perfect stability is to be obtained, nevertheless, from truly wrought
                    and accurately seated and bonded blocks of stone, mortar being used to no
                    greater extent than may be necessary to exclude wind or water, to prevent the
                    disintegrating action of both upon even the most durable stone. When water alone
                    is to be dealt with, and especially when it is liable to act with force, mortar
                    is necessary for securing to every block in the structure its own full weight
                    and the aid of every other collateral and super-imposed stone in order to resist
                    the loosening effect which water in powerful action is sure to produce.</p>
                <p>In the application of construction to any particular object, the nature of the
                    object will greatly affect the character of the constructions and the materials
                    of which they are to be formed.</p>
                <p>Every piece of construction should be complete in itself, and independent as such
                    of everything beyond it. A door or a gate serves its purpose by an application
                    wholly foreign to itself; but it is a good and effective or a bad and
                    ineffective piece of construction, independently of the posts to which it may be
                    hung. Whilst the wheel of a wheelbarrow, comprising fellies, spokes, and
                    axle-tree, is a piece of construction complete in itself, and independent as
                    such of everything beyond it, an arch of masonry, however large it may be, is
                    not necessarily a piece of construction complete in itself,—it would fall to
                    pieces without abutments. Thus, a bridge consisting of a series of arches,
                    however extensive, may be but one piece of construction, no arch being complete
                    in itself without the collateral arches in the series to serve as its abutments,
                    and the whole series being dependent thereby upon the ultimate abutments of the
                    bridge, without which the structure would not stand. This illustration is not
                    intended to apply to the widely distended masses of the older bridges, by which
                    each pier becomes sufficient to abut the arches springing from it, but which
                    tend, in providing for a way over a river, to choke up the way by the river
                    itself, or compel the river to throw it down, or otherwise destroy its own
                    banks. A bridge, of which the way is formed upon arches of masonry, may be thus
                    but one piece of construction; and in like manner, that paragon of constructive
                    skill, the complete church, whether cathedral or otherwise, as built in the
                    Pointed style when that style was practised in full accordance with true
                    constructive principles, is but one piece of construction. As in the long series
                    of arches in a bridge, viaduct, or other such work, in which the piers are
                    vertical supports to the bridging structure, and may be of no greater substance
                    than is necessary to bear the weight coming directly by vertical pressure from
                    the superincumbent structure and its possible load, but throwing all the
                    pressure arising from weight acting laterally, or as thrust, upon terminal
                    abutments,—nothing may be omitted, as nothing can be removed from the structure
                    of the Pointed arch cathedral, or other church built in that style, the whole
                    system of which is bridge-like in construction, without leaving something
                    unsupported or unresisted that requires vertical support or lateral resistance.
                    The western towers of a Pointed cathedral form effective abutments to the long
                    series of arches of the inner ranges over the piers which stand between the nave
                    and the aisles on both sides, whilst turrets or massive buttresses and deep
                    porches upon the northern and southern transept fronts perform the same services
                    in respect of the arches of the transepts. The counteracting east end of the
                    chancel forms a true constructive abutment to the arches of the chancel, whilst
                    the tower, with, it may be, a spire upon it, at the intersection of the four
                    grand compartments of the cross, gives, by its weight, abuttal to them all. The
                    want of this last-named grand and essential body in the system is but too
                    strongly marked in many of the English cathedrals, by the iron bars which have
                    been applied to tie in the arches of the nave, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n496/mode/1up"

                    upon which the transept arches bear at a higher level from the thrust to which,
                    being without the weight of a tower upon them, they have continually yielded.
                    Transversely the weight and the thrust of the vaulted ceilings of the nave are
                    brought up to, and thrown against, the piers of the clerestory, which stand upon
                    the main piers or columns of the interior below, and are abutted by flying
                    buttresses, which carry the thrust down to the pinnacle-weighted buttresses of
                    the outer aisle walls, which have already received the weight and thrust of the
                    vaulted ceilings of the aisles themselves. Corbels in the walls and spreading
                    capitals upon shafts take the weight directly, and leave the walls and piers but
                    little encumbered in the middle, so that the vertical structure is continued
                    upwards without bearing upon the springing stones of the arches.</p>
                <p>But it is not necessary that the arch employed should be the Pointed arch, to
                    produce combinations as effective in construction as the most perfectly designed
                    and extensively elaborated work of the kind referred to as models of
                    constructive skill; the skill consists in a full and clear perception of the
                    bearing and leaning of every part, and of the means necessary to support and
                    counteract the bearings and the leanings within the reasonable limits of the
                    work with reference to its object and purpose—to the end that the work may
                    become complete in itself, and independent as a piece of construction of
                    everything beyond it.</p>
                <p>In making reference to the noble works of construction above referred to, in
                    which the art of the mason is iuaιnιy employed, as works exhibiting construction
                    most fully and most truly, the hall must not be passed over without remark, and
                    of all the great halls of the class to which Westminster Hall belongs, it is
                    itself the most effective as a work of construction; and its effect is wholly
                    produced by the magnificent roof which covers it. This roof is a piece of
                    carpentry admirably designed to resolve it into a compact body to act upon the
                    walls in the direction of gravity alone. But the designer may not have felt
                    quite certain of the results, so whilst erecting massive walls on which to place
                    his elaborate combination of timber, he threw up against the lateral walls a
                    series of flying buttresses to check any tendency of the roof to spread under
                    its own weight in the absence of a thorough transverse tie; for these buttresses
                    are said to be independent of the walls, not being built into them.</p>
                <p>An application of the principles of construction exhibited in the most perfect
                    works of constructive skill ever executed, as above indicated, may be made in
                    the rougher operations of mere practical utility. The sides of cuttings through
                    certain earths in the formation of lines of inland communication, whether
                    carriage roads, railways, or canals, are sometimes required to be widened out to
                    an inordinate extent because of the looseness or slipperiness of the soil, or
                    must otherwise be retained or held upright by special constructions. The expense
                    of the first formation of a cutting under given circumstances is easily
                    calculable, and so is the time within which the work may be effected. Experience
                    has proved that there is for every soil a limit in depth beyond which it becomes
                    more expedient to drift the required way, and construct a vaulted tunnel of
                    sufficient dimensions, than to make an open cutting with the requisite slopes.
                    Even when the first cost would not decide the question, the preference is
                    nevertheless often given to the tunnel because of the greater security of
                    constructed work.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding to the consideration of the means of enabling opposite
                    retaining walls to assist each other, it may be worth while to consider, whether
                    retaining walls are generally constructed so as best to adapt their components
                    to the duty to be performed. No one would place a buttress intended to resist
                    the thrust of an arch within the springing walls, or under the arch whose thrust
                    is to be resisted; yet in the construction of retaining walls, according to the
                    common practice, the counterfort is placed on that side which receives the
                    pressure, where its utility is very questionable, except to keep the retaining
                    wall from falling back against its load, which, from the transverse section
                    generally given to such walls, they would be apt to do, if not so propped up by
                    their counterforts. Wharf and quay walls, and the revetment walls of military
                    works, may require a face unbroken by projections; but this is not the case with
                    retaining walls for roads and railways, where a long line of projecting
                    buttresses would be unobjectionable, the counterforts becoming buttresses and
                    merely changing places with the wall. On account of the common practice of
                    battering the faces of retaining walls in curved lines, and of radiating the
                    beds of the brickwork composing them from the centre of curvature in every part,
                    the back of the wall must contain more setting material than the face, with the
                    same quantity of solid brick, that is, if the work be bonded through.
                    Counterforts must be built in the same courses, and consequently must have still
                    thicker beds of compressible mortar than the wall; or the bond between the wall
                    and its counterfort must be dropped, and the counterfort thus become utterly
                    inefficient.</p>
                <p>The retaining walls in the cutting upon the line of the extension of the London
                    and North-Western Railway, from Camden Town to Euston Square, are, according to
                    the common practice, built wholly of brickwork in radiating courses and with
                    counterforts following their own contour. In this case the centre of gravity of
                    the wall falls wholly behind its base, and the counterforts not commencing until
                    the wall has reached one-third its height render it still more dependent for
                    support upon the ground it is intended to retain. It is well known that these
                    extensive walls, though furnished with all the collateral works necessary to
                    protect them from exposure to undue influences, and although set nearly
                    one-fourth of their height in the ground, failed to a considerable extent. A
                    system of strutting with cast-iron beams, across from the opposite walls, as
                    shown in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n497/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0497-0450"/> fig. 1, to make each aid the other, was applied
                    to meet the emergency; but this is limited to the upper parts of the walls.</p>
                <p>Abutting struts from opposite walls, occurring at intervals only, leave the
                    intermediate portions of the walls exposed to pressure from behind without
                    support, unless these intermediate portions are so disposed as to communicate
                    the pressure upon them to the struts. Hence a common retaining wall, abutted at
                    intervals, would require these intervals to be more or less distant, in
                    proportion to the strength of the wall between them. Instead, therefore, of a
                    continuous wall on each side of the cutting, buttress walls should be placed at
                    intervals, opposite to one another, and strutted apart at their toes by an
                    inverted arch (as in fig. 2); and above, at a height sufficient for whatever
                    traffic the cutting is to accommodate, by a built beam of brickwork, in vertical
                    courses, supported on an arch, and prevented from rising under the pressure by
                    an invert upon it, as in fig. 3. This built beam will then be, as it were, a
                    piece of walling turned down on its vertical transverse section, and will resist
                    any pressure brought upon it through the buttress walls, to the full extent of
                    the power of such a wall built vertically to bear weight laid upon its summit;
                    the pressure would be applied in the line of the greatest power of resistance,
                    and there would be no tendency to yield, except to a crushing force. Let such
                    transverse buttress walls, so strutted apart, with the road between them, be the
                    springing walls of longitudinal counter-arched retaining walls, which, being
                    built vertically and in horizontal courses, but arched in plan, against the
                    ground to be retained, will carry all the force exerted against them to their
                    springing walls, and the springing walls or buttresses will communicate, through
                    the struts, the power of resistance of each side to the other, and thus insure
                    the security of both.</p>
                <p>This arrangement may be carried to any extent in height, by repeating the
                    abutting beam or strut at such intervals as the thrust to be resisted and the
                    strength of the buttress springing-walls may require.</p>
                <p>To constructions thus arranged, any requisite power may be given, by altering the
                    quantity of materials in each part, •—the length of the buttresses transversely
                    of the cutting, the number of struts to each pair of buttresses, or the length
                    of the compartments. The thickness of the buttresses should be in proportion to
                    their height and length, and their length should be in proportion to the
                    flatness and weight of the struts with their arches, and to the space in height
                    between any two of them, as well as to the magnitude of the thrust brought to
                    them by the counter-arched retaining walls. The inverted arch below and the
                    built beam above must, of course, have sufficient substance to enable them to
                    resist, without yielding in any direction, the pressure brought to them through
                    the buttresses; and the retaining walls themselves must have substance given to
                    them according to their height, to the pressure they are liable to receive from
                    behind, to the length of the compartments, and to the extent of their
                    flexure;—subject, of course, as to all these, to the nature of the materials,
                    workmanship, and mode of structure.</p>
                <p>The positive strength which such constructions should possess depends much, of
                    course, upon the nature of the soil, and its susceptibility of being affected by
                    external influences; but it depends, even in a greater degree, upon the manner
                    in which the constructions can be applied to the ground they are intended to
                    retain. A very slight power will retain at rest a body which the exertion of
                    great force could not stop if once in motion, and a half-brick counter-arch, set
                    in close contact with undisturbed ground, would hold safely up what three times
                    the substance would not stop if there were space and opportunity for motion
                    between the ground and the brickwork. It is impossible, therefore, to state
                    precisely what is the least strength which the retaining constructions must
                    have, but there can be no question that too much strength is better than too
                    little, and it is generally cheaper to pay in materials than in labour to save
                    materials.</p>
                <p>The diagrams, figs. 4 and 5, represent a cutting 65 feet deep to the level of the
                    rails. It is assumed that the ground at the top may stand for the first 15 feet
                    at less than 2 to 1, and that it may, therefore, be cheaper to run out to that
                    depth with slopes, leaving 50 feet from the rails, or about 52 feet in all, to
                    be retained. As the bricklayer may follow up the excavator with bay after bay,
                    his work lying mostly on the side and out of the way of the excavator, the
                    latter would run out the spoil without interruption, his work being benched
                    onwards and shored as he proceeded. As every compartment, with its buttresses,
                    invert, abutting beams, and counter-arches is complete in itself, the ground
                    being backed against the counter-arches as the work rises, the shoring would
                    come out, and be sent on for use on the forward benches. The invert may be
                    turned upon footings in half-brick rings, to get the largest quantity of solid
                    resisting matter in the curved line. At a height from the surface of the rails
                    sufficient for headway—assumed at 14 feet 6 inches—a 14-inch bonded arch is
                    turned from buttress to buttress, springing from skewbacks on corbelled courses.
                    Upon the back of this arch the abutting beam is built of brick on end and edge,
                    bonded as a wall, with beds vertical and widening over the haunches of the
                    discharging arch and under the similar inverted arch turned upon it; so that
                    although the beam be in the centre but 21 inches deep, it presents an abutment
                    at each end of three times that depth. The object of the invert over the
                    abutting beam is to stiffen it, and to bring down and distribute the weight and
                    pressure from the buttresses more effectually. The built beam, and its
                    sustaining and stiffening arches, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n498/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0498-0451"/> should be composed of particularly well-formed
                    bricks of really good quality, set in cement or in some quick-setting mortar,
                    that there may be no yielding to the pressure which must be immediately thrown
                    upon this part of the construction. Another built beam, of greater depth,
                    because of the absence of any inverted arch to stiffen it, is thrown across over
                    the back of a semicircular arch, with its abutting ends extended in like
                    manner.</p>
                <p>To relieve the work from water, a drain being run along over the middle of the
                    inverts, or side-drains being passed by ring culverts through the buttresses,
                    drain-shafts are carried up at the backs of the buttresses against the
                    springings of the counter-arches, to within a few feet of the surface. These
                    shafts, being steened with open joints at intervals to admit drainage water and
                    communicating with the draius below, prevent the possibility of water lodging
                    about the backs of the counter-arches, or even in the ground itself. The drain
                    shafts should be semi-domed with bricks set dry and covered in, and the walls
                    also backed up with good clean gravel, through which the surface water may
                    percolate and pass freely down to the shafts.</p>
                <p>The constructions are assumed to be of brickwork, for the obvious reason that the
                    cases supposed being clay cuttings, brick is the material which would be most
                    economical. But if masonry be cheaper, it may of course be used with the same
                    effect. Where a cutting intersects loose beds of laminated stone, and
                    particularly strata inclined to the horizon, so as to be unsafe with the
                    ordinary slopes, such constructions are available; and in Cases where the sides
                    of the cutting will stand vertically or nearly so, as in chalk, it may be useful
                    to apply similar constructions, though of slighter character, to check the
                    separation and fall of masses from the precipitous sides. It is obvious, too,
                    that these constructions present the means of security, when the stratum forming
                    the base of any cutting is too weak to bear the weights of slopes, or of
                    retained sides, without rising between them. Sheet-piling may be driven to any
                    depth along the backs of the counter-arched walls so as to be retained at the
                    head by the walls; and thus in effect the walls woùld be carried down to a safe
                    depth, even through the weak stratum; whereas such piling at the toes of slopes
                    is commonly found to be almost if not wholly useless, for the want of a stay to
                    the head.</p>
                <p>The ignitibility of timber, and the rapidity with which it burns when placed in
                    circumstances so favourable to that effect as by its disposition in an erected
                    building, have led to its prohibition for the purposes of the main enclosures of
                    houses and buildings generally, in London, and in many of the larger provincial
                    towns. It is possible, however, so to protect timber employed in the enclosures
                    and for the internal partitions and floors of buildings as to render mere
                    dwelling-houses practically incombustible. Whilst, however, the liability of
                    timber to take fire and to burn may in a great measure be counteracted, and
                    notwithstanding that this material combines the advantage of economy with
                    security, stone and brick are undoubtedly better adapted for the main structure
                    of a building. Brick or stone, or. brick and stone together, with a setting
                    material, ought to be employed, but in such manner only as to be free from
                    dependence upon other and less trustworthy materials. The most perfect erections
                    as buildings are those in the composition of which this principle has been
                    understood and fairly practised. If adventitious aid be given to brick or stone
                    walls by foreign materials, the materials ought to be at the least harmless.
                    Iron in bulk is not a proper substance to incorporate with walls because of its
                    great expansibility by heat; but iron used in thin laminae, as hoop-iron laid in
                    walls in the bed-joints of the brick or stone, cannot be productive of any bad
                    consequences, while it is most beneficial in that form as a tie to the
                    structure.</p>
                <p>Bricks come ready shaped to the hands of the workman in a form the best adapted
                    for the arrangement in the construction of a wall which, under the designation
                    of bond, gives it such a degree of consistency that a weight placed upon the top
                    is carried by the wall in every part throughout its whole thickness, and
                    throughout a greater or less proportion of the length according to the height of
                    the wall. Stone, on the other hand, comes to the workman without regular form;
                    and with skill on his part to dispose and arrange the materials, good erections
                    may be produced of rubble; for although the thickness of which walls may be
                    built of rubble with safety will depend in a great degree upon the quality of
                    the mortar, much depends also on the skill of the workman in bedding and bonding
                    the stones. Under any circumstances, however, a wall so composed cannot safely
                    be charged with heavy weights, or be exposed to the vibrating action of floors,
                    until the mortar shall have indurated to some extent; whereas a wall of
                    brickwork is secure by the horizontal bedding of the bricks, and by the effect
                    of the transverse bond which the alternation of header and stretcher almost
                    necessarily produces. Stone, again, may be dressed to any shape, and so as to
                    mould it to every variety of construction with the smallest possible quantity of
                    mortar or cement. From blocks with rough hammer-dressed parallel beds, up to the
                    most complete and perfectly wrought parallelopipeds adapted to any arrangement
                    of bond that may be best adapted to the structure,. and with combinations of
                    rudely formed and perfectly formed pieces of stone, walls may be built of stone
                    of greater strength than the best brick can be made to yield, whilst stone walls
                    are liable to be inferior in every respect to brick-built walls of ordinary
                    quality.</p>
                <p>Some combinations of the two kinds of materials have the effect, however, of
                    making a better wall than could be produced by the main constituent in the form
                    employed alone. A stone-rubble or pebble built wall is greatly improved by one
                    or two bonding courses of brickwork at short intervals; and a brick wall is
                    improved and adapted for a higher purpose by thorough courses, at intervals, of
                    good stone, wrought to bed and joint truly; whilst on the other hand, a wall
                    substantially of stone-rubble or pebble, and faced with brickwork, is
                    essentially an unsound wall; and in like manner a brick wall faced with wrought
                    stone is liable to be weaker than the brickwork would have been without the
                    stone.</p>
                <p>With regard to the thicknesses of the walls of buildings, it is generally
                    considered that these should be governed by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n499/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0499-0452"/> the height of the structure; but they ought not
                    to be determined by that condition alone. Chimney-breasts, or other
                    buttress-like projections, built up with a wall, and extending to more than the
                    thickness of the wall, make it in fact stronger in its transverse section, and
                    justify less general thickness in the body of the wall, whilst window and other
                    openings in a wall leave piers which ought to be of greater thickness than the
                    mere height would require. But all returns, indeed, whether as chimney-breasts
                    or as cross walls, built and bonded with a wall, tend to render unnecessary the
                    full thickness which the height might require; whilst, as just intimated, the
                    omission of portions of a wall for door and window openings should be
                    compensated for by additional substance to the parts which remain. Walls
                    subjected to undue action, such as that arising from slight joists tailed into
                    them, or that occasioned by inclined timbers, as under galleries in churches,
                    chapels, and theatres, require to be of greater thickness than they otherwise
                    would; whilst it is quite wonderful to what great heights brick walls may be
                    built with safety, if they are well built, and exposed to no other action than
                    direct vertical weight. When, indeed, such walls stand upon a sufficient
                    foundation, direct vertical weight without motion is a means of security to the
                    walls so long as the weight is reasonably within the power of resistance of the
                    materials to crushing pressure. The object to be looked at, therefore—the walls
                    being honestly built—is, as before remarked, to make the weight to be imposed
                    upon any wall act upon its solids vertically and steadily.</p>
                <p>Floors upon girders, or framed to strong trimmers—the girders or the
                    trimmer-joists running into and bearing upon the piers or solids of the
                    walls—are far preferable to what are termed single floors, of which each joist
                    runs into the wall. Girders as the basis of floors render plates in the walls
                    wholly unnecessary, by depositing the weight in the right places, without
                    requiring plates to carry it on from the weaker to the stronger places; and
                    being of necessity stout and rigid, they form a fair tie and strut to the walls
                    into which their bearing ends are tailed. Whether girders or trimmer-joists be
                    employed for placing the weight of floors upon the walls of a building in the
                    safest manner, the bearing timbers ought to be placed upon pieces of stone as
                    templets built into the walls, and to be made to take a cog-hold of the
                    templets, so as to enable them to tie and stay the walls by means of the cogs.
                    It is by means of the girder bearing upon the solids of the walls, though with
                    bad carpentry, that the French are able to carry up their soft, coursed-rubble,
                    stone walls to heights that would certainly be unsafe if the walls were seamed
                    with wooden plates, and shaken by floors of single joist; such, for instance, as
                    a wall of a total height of say 85 feet, with a thickness of 18 English inches
                    on the ground-floor and through six stories, or about 65 feet, and finished by a
                    gable,—the basement being vaulted with walls about 20 inches thick. It is by
                    means of the solidity given to the floors by the girders, and the solid bearings
                    which the girders obtain, that the floors are able to carry the dead weight of
                    matter which renders them practically fireproof, as described below, in addition
                    to the moving weights to which the floors of buildings are necessarily exposed
                    in use. We can and do frame floors most effectively by carpentry alone; whereas
                    the French do the work so badly, that no important bearing is, or indeed may be,
                    trusted by them to the framed joint—dog-nailed stirrup straps of iron being
                    always brought in aid. But the common practice in England is to use single or
                    unframed floors, which carry the weight and the vibration to which floors are
                    exposed into the walls, over voids as well as over solids; while the French
                    frame their floors to or upon girders, by means of which the floors are brought
                    to bear upon the solids of the walls. The walls are thus not only less exposed
                    to vibratory action, but are both tied together and strutted apart with better
                    effect by the stout girders stiffened by joists than by joists which themselves
                    requiro some foreign aid to stiffen them. Moreover, single floors of joists,
                    unless trimmed at frequent intervals, when, indeed, they may be termed
                    half-framed, are supposed to require plates of timber laid along the inside
                    faces of outer walls and upon internal walls. This defect is avoided by French
                    builders, who exclude all timber, except the bearing ends of girders, from their
                    walls, and use framed floors.</p>
                <p>When the walls of a building have reached their full height, the wall-plate comes
                    into use legitimately—to cope the walls, in fact, and to form a curb as a base
                    upon which to place the roof, which should deposit its weight, nevertheless, by
                    means of its tie-beams upon the plates over the solids of the wall below, and
                    which should, moreover, oversail, so as to cover and effectually shelter from
                    the weather the enclosing walls also.</p>
                <p>In setting forth the structural advantages derivable from the use of girders as
                    the bases of floors, it may be necessary to repeat the warning already intimated
                    against the use of girders of a material of uncertain strength, and of
                    treacherous character when exposed to transverse strain. Cast-iron is of
                    uncertain strength, mainly because of the imperfections which the most skilful
                    founders, with the best materials and every appliance at command, cannot always
                    avoid, and which are most liable to occur in the production of complex forms in
                    long lengths; whilst careless founding and rapid cooling are contingencies
                    connected with the production of cast-iron girders—which are necessarily long
                    and complex castings. Cast-iron is treacherous, inasmuch as it is brittle and
                    liable to be startled into fracture by impact trifling when compared with what
                    it may have borne safely as a dead-weight. Proving long metal castings by
                    straining them upon their transverse section does but aggravate imperfections,
                    and leave the casting weaker; whilst no dead-weight proof is proof against blows
                    or other action inducing vibration. It is only under circumstances which do not
                    admit of concussive action upon the beam, or which prevent it from vibrating
                    under any shock that may reach it, that cast-iron can be safely used in beams of
                    long lengths to carry heavy weights, without some appliance to mitigate, at
                    least, the imperfections which this substance exhibits. The application of
                    wrought iron tension bars as soles to beams and girders of cast-iron would
                    prevent the most serious consequences from attending the failure of the casting,
                    if the beam were also prevented by binders, or by other sufficient means, from
                    turning round when the blow produces an oblique fracture. Wrought iron girders
                    can be and are now extensively used to carry floors, partitions, and even walls
                    with safety.</p>
                <p>Inasmuch as some soils are liable to change in form, expanding and contracting
                    under meteorological influences, as clays which swell when wetted and shrink
                    when dried, concrete foundations are commonly interposed upon such soils to
                    protect the building from derangement from this cause; or rather, for that
                    purpose walls of the cheaper material, concrete, instead of the more expensive
                    brick or stone structure, are brought up from a level sufficiently below the
                    ordinary surface of the ground. When concrete is used to obviate the tendency of
                    the soil to yield to pressure, expanse or extent of base is required; and the
                    concrete, being widely spread, should therefore be deep or thick as a layer,
                    only with reference to its own power of transmitting to the ground the weight of
                    the wall to be built upon it, without breaking across or being crushed. But when
                    concrete is used as a substitute for a wall, in carrying a wall down to a low
                    level, it is in fact a wall, wide only in proportion to its comparative weakness
                    in the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n500/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0500-0453"/> absence of manipulated bond in its construction,
                    and encased by the soil within which it is placed.</p>
                <p>The foundation of a building of ordinary weight is, for the most part,
                    sufficiently provided for by applying what are technically termed footings to
                    the walls. The reason for a footing is, that the wall obtains thereby a bearing
                    upon a breadth of ground so much greater than its own width or thickness above
                    the footing, as to compensate for the difference between the power of resisting
                    pressure of the wall and of the ground or ultimate foundation upon which the
                    wall is to rest. It will be clear from this, that if a building is to be erected
                    upon rock as hard as the main constituent of the walls, no expanded footings
                    will be necessary; if upon chalk, upon strong or upon weak gravel, upon sand, or
                    upon clay, the footing must be expauded with reference to the power of
                    resistance of the stratum to be used as a foundation; whilst in or upon made
                    ground, or other loose and badly combined or imperfectly resisting soil, a solid
                    platform bearing evenly over the ground, and wide enough not to sink into it,
                    becomes necessary under the constructed footing. For this purpose the easiest,
                    the most familiar, and, for most purposes, the most effectual and durable, is a
                    layer of concrete, which may be formed so as to cover a surface large enough to
                    obtain from the most yielding soil the amount of resistance to pressure required
                    to support the weight of the intended building. It will be evident that upon a
                    concrete foundation a footing or expanded base may or may not be required to a
                    wall, according to the hardness of the concrete and the kind of wall to be
                    built; but it is perhaps better to give the footing to the wall than to wait for
                    the sufficient induration of the concrete to enable the wall to do without a
                    footing; and better still, to lay the concrete of such height only with
                    reference to the spread or extent of base beyond the toes of the footing, as the
                    gravel of which the concrete is made would stand at in an uncombined condition.
                    Concrete, indeed, is at all times more safely to be regarded as a substance to
                    be placed as a layer, than as a substance to be set up as a wall; for although
                    excellent erections as walls may be made of concrete—as erections in the same
                    form may be made of tempered clay or of pisé-work—neither concrete nor tempered
                    clay is to be regarded as a proper substance with which to form the lofty walls
                    of buildings in towns. The use of lime concrete involves walls of a considerable
                    thickness; Portland cement concrete, a stronger material and having the property
                    of hardening rapidly, is more commonly used for thin walls. Several patents have
                    been taken for erecting buildings with concrete walls by the construction of
                    troughs formed of frames and movable boards or shutters. But considerable doubt
                    exists as to the extent to which such walls can be built, as many have cracked,
                    proved leaky, and shown other faults; whilst much economy does not result except
                    where the work is very plain and straightforward, where little is spent on
                    subsequent finish, and where the materials can be obtained at very little cost
                    either for themselves or for carriage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Construction for Protection against Fire.—</hi> Houses seldom
                    take fire from common accidents, such as occur to the lighter movable furniture
                    and to drapery; but, for the most part, from the exposure of timber in or about
                    the structure to the continued action of fire, or of heat capable sooner or
                    later of inducing the combustion of timber; and as the source is most commonly
                    in defective gas-piping, or in some stove, furnace, flue, pipe, or tube, for
                    generating or for conveying heat, or for removing the products of combustion,
                    much of the real danger to buildings from fire would be prevented by avoiding
                    that degree of proximity of timber to all such things as can lead to its
                    combustion. With a view to lessen the danger to which buildings with timber in
                    their structure are exposed from fire, it will be well to consider how far the
                    timber and wooden fittings commonly used may be necessary either to the
                    stability of the buildings, or to the comfort and convenience of the
                    inhabitants. But it is not our intention to describe here the various modes of
                    fire-proof construction, but only to notice the principles upon which ordinary
                    buildings may be rendered nearly incombustible. So long: as danger of fire is
                    brought to buildings through pipes and tubes, the necessity must be admitted of
                    guarding the combustible materials used in buildings from any chance of becoming
                    ignited. When heat is produced and passed through pipes in any manufactory,
                    whether it be to act as power, or for drying or for warming, the fires used may
                    be guarded, and the machinery which regulates the intensity of the heat to be
                    transmitted may be under constant care; but even in such cases there can be no
                    certainty that the heat shall not at some time arrive at the point of danger.
                    But when heat is diffused throughout dwelling-houses by means of apparatus which
                    is committed to persons unskilled in its use, and unconscious or careless of the
                    danger which may arise from neglect, it seems impossible to lay down inflexible
                    rules for distances from timber which shall render it safe from heated pipes.
                    Twelve or fifteen inches may not be a greater distance than safety requires
                    under some circumstances, whilst there are many cases in which the actual
                    contact of such pipes with timber is hardly inconsistent with safety. When the
                    air about heated bodies is not confined, as it would be within the timbers of an
                    ordinary floor, a distance between the timber and the heated surface equal to
                    the longest diameter of the tube or pipe will be found sufficient if the
                    temperature of the pipe does not exceed that of boiling water. It is to be
                    understood that a piece of wood will bear a powerful deadheat upon its sides for
                    an indefinite period without igniting, unless a transverse section of the fibre,
                    as at or around a live knot, or where a branch had been lopped, present itself
                    to the action. It is by the end that a piece of wood exposed to powerful heat
                    most readily ignites. The gases evolved in the substance of the timber by the
                    action of heat applied to its surface, expanding as they are evolved, are thrown
                    out by the pores among the fibres at the ends, if the ends are near enough to
                    the action to allow of this effect, with less power than may be enough to obtain
                    vent for the inflammable gases laterally.</p>
                <p>The English Government, when it has legislated upon such matters, has generally
                    confined itself to making provision that the enclosing walls of buildings should
                    be formed of incombustible materials. In provisions regarding the least
                    thicknesses of such walls, these were generally determined with reference to the
                    height of the building, and to the area to be enclosed, as an indication of the
                    probable lengths of the walls; and this both for the purpose of promoting safety
                    of structure, and of checking the spread of fire from building to building. As,
                    however, in most cases greater thickness is required in the side wall of an
                    ordinary dwelling-house in a town to render its structure secure than is
                    necessary to enable it to check the spreading of fire, such walls are frequently
                    made of greater thickness than would be necessary to fulfil the objects which
                    the Legislature has had in view, if the walls were not supposed to extend the
                    whole length of the two longer sides of a parallelogram without intermediate
                    cross or return walls. A solid, well-built brick wall, one brick or 9 inches
                    thick, between two ordinary dwelling-houses of five or six squares in area each,
                    will prevent the communication of fire through it from one to the other. But, in
                    towns, ordinary dwellinghouses, which occupy each an area of five or six
                    squares, are generally disposed iu plan as parallelograms, having their opposite
                    sides 18 or 20 feet, and 28 or 30 feet respectively in length, and are seldom
                    carried up to less height than 35 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n501/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0501-0454"/> or 40 feet; and walls of such lengths and heights
                    could hardly be deemed safe if not more than one brick thick. Consequently, a
                    greater thickness has been prescribed as the least thickness of the walls of
                    buildings of the sizes indicated. In the older Metropolitan Building Acts much
                    greater thicknesses were prescribed for the walls likely to be the longer walls;
                    whilst the only necessity for more than one brick rises from structural
                    requisites, and not from any insufficiency of a wall of solid brickwork one
                    brick thick as a means of preventing the spread of fire.</p>
                <p>But the requisites of the structure would be as well fulfilled by one-brick walls
                    upon the long sides as by 1⅜ brick walls, if the ordinary internal cross
                    partition for dividing a house into front and back rooms were built of brickwork
                    abutting upon, and at right angles to, the longer walls, and carried up coursed
                    and bonded with them. That is to say, party-walls of one brick or 9 inches in
                    thickness, connected at their-ends by l∣-brick or 13-inch front and back walls,
                    and at or about the middle of their length by other 9-inch cross walls, would be
                    at the least as strong as 1J-brick party-walls, though connected in the same
                    manner at the two ends, but without the abutting and connecting cross wall of
                    brickwork. Instead, however, of such internal cross walls, hollow partitions of
                    timber are commonly used in all stories above the basement story; and it is by
                    these partitions, and by the light and highly inflammable wooden stairs, that
                    fire extends itself rapidly throughout ordinary dwelling-houses; whilst the
                    substitution of a brick wall for the cross timber partition would in most cases
                    justify the abatement of a half brick of the thickness otherwise necessary to
                    party-walls, and give an indestructible internal support to the floors, whereby
                    also one of the means by which fire travels rapidly through a house would be
                    removed. It is true that there must be openings as doorways, and fittings in
                    them for doors, in such internal partition wall; but the wall could not carry
                    fire up from floor to floor through its own heart, as the hollow wood-lathed
                    quartering partition carries it. Doors and shutters, and door window linings, in
                    and against brick or stone walls, may take fire and burn in any story of an
                    ordinarily built dwelling-house, without carrying itibeyond the story in which
                    the fire occurs; for a plastered ceiling of the most common description will
                    resist the action of flame upon its surface for a long time, and plastering of
                    really good quality, though upon wood laths, will keep fire off from the joists
                    by which it is held up, almost without danger, so long as the fire acts upon the
                    face only of the plastering. If, however, fire reach the joists through the
                    agency of hollow quartering partitions, the enemy has turned the flank of the
                    plastering, and the floors and skirtings above and behind it taking fire, the
                    building almost inevitably falls a prey to the flames. Any step, indeed, from
                    the hollow quartering partition ' towards a solid wall is a step towards
                    security. A brick wall is, perhaps, the best internal partition for all the
                    purposes of strength and security from fire; and in small houses, which will not
                    afford the expense of 9-inch walls, half-brick walls with 9-inch jambs at the
                    doors, and short 9-inch piers on alternate sides of the partition, at intervals
                    of 3 or 4 feet in length, will give sufficient strength; but even quartering
                    partitions, if based upon brick walls, may be rendered nearly proof against fire
                    by brick-nogging them, especially if care be taken to fill in with brickwork
                    between the joists over the head of one partition and under the sill of another,
                    as well as between the timbers of the partitions. Filling in between the joists,
                    and up as high as the skirtings go, will do something, indeed, towards
                    diminishing the dangerous tendency of even lathed and plastered timber
                    partitions; whilst the adoption of the plan now commonly practised in Paris, in
                    forming not only internal partitions, but the rearward external enclosures of
                    buildings, would secure to the structure the structural efficiency of timber on
                    end in carrying weight, and give the solid and incombustible character of a
                    brick or stone wall to a partition or enclosure which is structurally of timber.
                    The plan referred to is, to frame and brace with timber quarterings much in the
                    manner practised in England, except that the timber used in Paris is commonly
                    oak, and is generally seasoned previously. The framed structure being complete,
                    strong oak batten-laths, from 2 to 3 inches wide, are nailed up to the
                    quarterings horizontally, at 4, 6, or even 8 inches apart, according to the
                    character of the work, throughout the whole height of the enclosure or
                    partition; and the spaces between the quarterings, and behind the laths, are
                    loosely built up with rough stone rubble, which the laths prevent from falling
                    out until the next process has been effected. This is, to apply a strong mortar,
                    which in Paris is mainly composed of plaster of Paris, which is there of
                    excellent quality, laid on from both sides at the same time, and pressed through
                    from the opposite sides so that the mortar meets and incorporates, embedding the
                    stone rubble by filling up every interstice, and with so much body on the
                    surfaces as to cover up and embed also the timber and the laths—in such a
                    manner, indeed, as to render the concretion of stone and plaster, when
                    thoroughly set, an independent body, and giving strength to rather than
                    receiving support from the timber.</p>
                <p>The English brick-nogged partition is, in point of structure, nothing without the
                    aid of timber. The plastering is merely spread upon the surfaces of brick and
                    wood, and is fragile in the extreme, and always liable to crack and drop off.
                    This lathed and plastered partition is composed of the hollow framework of the
                    timber quarters, with two slight thicknesses of mortar, as plastering, hung upon
                    slighter laths, over and between which the flaccid mortar forms a key for
                    itself; but all necessarily depends upon the timber, and fails with it wherever
                    decay or fire may destroy it.</p>
                <p>Only second in importance to the internal partition as a source of danger, or as
                    a means of safety, are the stairs; and the stairs are second in importance only
                    when the partitions are made to carry the floors of the several stories. In
                    England, and in London particularly, even when the steps and intermediate
                    landings are of stone, it is but too common to find the passage from the street
                    door to the foot of the stairs, and the floors which connect flight with flight
                    at the several landings, either wholly of wood or of slight stone paving laid
                    upon wooden joists or bearers. Any stone paving upon wooden joists will
                    certainly retard the action of fire upon the joists, especially if assisted by a
                    well-plastered ceiling; but in this, again, if the floors be not formed of
                    wholly incombustible materials, the French practice as to floors would be better
                    than ours.</p>
                <p>In Paris stone stairs are far less common in modern houses than they are in
                    London in houses of corresponding character and date; but wooden staircases in
                    Paris are rendered almost as safe as common stone staircases are in England, by
                    a process similay in character to that applied to partitions and enclosures. The
                    result is an almost incombustible structure. Wooden staircases formed between
                    brick or stone walls, or between partitions of the kind above described as
                    commonly made in modern buildinge in Paris (that is, filled with a solid mass of
                    concreted rubble), may perhaps be set on fire, but they can hardly burn.</p>
                <p>It has been remarked that a mere plastered ceiling will resist the action of fire
                    for a long time, although the plastering be upon wooden laths, and the laths
                    nailed to joists of timber; and as fire does not readily act downwards, flooring
                    boards may take fire from above without any immediately serious consequence to
                    the joists under them, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n502/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0502-0455"/> so long as there is no access of air from below.
                    But the English indoor plastering upon laths is commonly of the most fragile
                    kind, and the slightest weight falling upon the back of a ceiling will make a
                    breach through it, whilst the floors are commonly of deal laid upon fir joists,
                    and are exposed to the action of fire from below directly the lathed and
                    plastered ceiling has failed; if, indeed, the fire have not found its way to the
                    joists under the flooring boards by the hollow lathed and plastered quartering
                    partitions. In the timber enclosures and partitions, which economy induces the
                    Paris builder to introduce as substitutes for walls, the timber is so embedded
                    in and made part of a solid concrete, as to be protected from almost every
                    casualty of which it is susceptible. But the French render their floors also so
                    nearly incombustible as to leave but little to desire in that respect, and in a
                    manner attainable with single joists, as well, at the least, as with joists
                    framed into girders. According to their practice, the ceiling <hi rend="italic"
                    >must</hi> be formed before the upper surface or floor is laid, as the ceiling
                    is formed from above instead of from below. The carpenters’ work being complete,
                    strong batten-laths are nailed up to the under sides of the joists, as laths are
                    in England; but they are much thicker and wider than our laths, and are placed
                    so far apart that not more, perhaps, than one-half of the space is occupied by
                    the laths. The laths being affixed—and they must be soundly nailed, as they have
                    a heavy weight to carry—a platform, made of rough boards, is strutted up from
                    below parallel to the plane formed by the laths, and at about an inch below
                    them. Mortar is then laid in from above over the platform and between and over
                    the laths, to a thickness of from 2∣ inches to 3 inches, and is forced in under
                    the laths, and under the joists and girders. The mortar, being gauged, as
                    plasterers term it, or rather, in great part composed of plaster of Paris, soon
                    sets sufficiently to allow the platform to be removed onwards to another
                    compartment, until the whole ceiling is formed. The plaster ceiling thus
                    produced is, in fact, a strong slab or table, in the body of which the
                    batten-laths which hold it up are incorporated, and in the back of which the
                    joists, from which the mass is suspended, are embedded. The finishing coat of
                    plastering is then laid on. Such a ceiling will resist any fire that can act
                    upon it from below, under ordinary circumstances; and it would be difficult for
                    fire to take such a hold from above as to destroy the joists to which a ceiling
                    so composed is attached, the laths and the under side of the joists being alike
                    out of its reach; and consequently such a ceiling alone would diminish the
                    danger from fire, although the floor above the joists were laid with deal
                    boards.</p>
                <p>A boarded floor, however, in Paris is a luxury not to be found in the dwellings
                    of the labouring classes, nor, indeed, are boarded floors to be found in any
                    dwellinghouses but those of the more costly description. Whether the proposed
                    surface is to be boarded or not, however, the flooring joists are covered by a
                    table of plaster above, as completely as they are covered by a plaster ceiling
                    below. Bough battens, generally split and in short lengths stout enough to bear
                    the weight of a man without bending, are laid with ends abutting upon every
                    joist, and as close together as they will lie without having been shot or planed
                    on their edges. Upon this rough loose floor, mortar of nearly similar
                    consistence to that used for the ceilings is spread to a thickness of about
                    three inches; and as it is made to fill in the voids at the ends and sides of
                    the floor-laths upon the joists, the laths become bedded upon the joists, whilst
                    they are to some extent also incorporated with the plaster. The result is a firm
                    floor, upon which, in ordinary buildings, paving-tiles are laid, bedded in a
                    tenacious cement. It must be clear that the timbers of a floor so encased could
                    hardly be made to burn even if fire were let in between the floor and ceiling.
                    But it has been already stated that the practice of making these incombustible
                    floors is connected with the use of walls which have no timber laid in them
                    bedwise, and that the timber enclosures employed instead of walls, and the
                    internal partitions, are rendered practically incombustible, whilst the wooden
                    staircase which economy dictates to the Parisian builders—the freestone which is
                    used in building walls being altogether too soft for the purpose— is also
                    rendered, in the manner already shown, almost unassailable by fire.</p>
                <p>It may be remarked with reference to the employment of any substance such as
                    cinder, being of the nature of pozzuolana, or volcanic scoria, in mortar, to
                    form a floor in the manner above described (about 3 inches thick), that as all
                    such mortars expand in setting, the walls of buildings may be forced out by the
                    expansion of the plaster floors, if the whole surface of the floor in any story
                    be at once covered with the mortar. A margin of 4 or 5 inches on every side
                    should be left void until the expansion has taken place, when the floor may be
                    completed with an assurance of close joints, and without injury to reasonably
                    stable walls.</p>
                <p>When a boarded floor is required, as the surfaces of the true joists lie under
                    the mortar, a base for the boards is formed of what English carpenters would
                    call stout fillets of wood, about 2⅜ inches square, ranged as joists, and
                    strutted apart to keep them in their places, over the mortar table, to which
                    they are sometimes scribed down, and that to these fillets, or false joists, the
                    flooring boards are secured by nails; so that in truth the boarded floor is not
                    at all connected with the structure of the floor, but is formed upon its upper
                    coat of plaster. The wooden floor thus becomes a mere fitting in an apartment,
                    and not extending beyond the room the floor might burn without communicating
                    fire to the stairs, even if the stairs were readily ignitible.</p>
                <p>The practice now in Paris, in respect of floors, is to form the structure of
                    wrought iron joists rolled to the form known with us as I, T, and Z iron, and to
                    fill in with the same strong plaster between, below, and above the iron, and so
                    to form a slab of plaster from 6 to 8 inches thick, according to the bearing and
                    the depth of the iron bars— the bars being enveloped in the plaster; and the
                    ceiling is formed as before described by laths resting on the lower flanges. In
                    order to lighten the weight of the solid plaster, earthen pots have been placed
                    between the joists and the spaces filled up with the mortar.</p>
                <p>The necessity which arises with us of dividing the upper stories of houses into
                    more rooms, as bed-rooms, than are commonly required in the lower stories, will
                    be made an objection to any process that would render the partitions heavier;
                    but it is not in the upper stories that the lathed and plastered partition is
                    most dangerous in respect of fire. Generally the stairs may be enclosed by solid
                    partitions throughout almost the whole height of an ordinary dwellinghouse
                    without occasioning any inconvenience as regards the greater weight of such a
                    partition; and generally, too, the partition which divides the front from the
                    back rooms of such houses may be carried up throughout the whole height of a
                    house without removing the bearing, if the house be judiciously disposed. But
                    even if a partition rest upon a beam or girder, a very slight addition to the
                    scantling of the timber will make up for the additional weight which the filling
                    in of the partition would involve, if the materials of the core be well chosen;
                    and it is well known that a piece of timber placed over a void as a bressummer,
                    and carrying a wall, resists the action of fire for a long time, and the longer
                    if it be of oak or other hard wood. It is not necessary, however, that the
                    timber employed in parti-tionβ<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n503/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0503-0456"/> and enclosures should be of oak; though it is
                    desirable that main bearing timbers, in situations which render them most liable
                    to be exposed to the action of fire in the event of casualty, should be of such
                    timber rather than of fir; but the quarterings, or partition timbers, which the
                    plaster concrete wholly encases, may be of fir as safely almost as of oak.</p>
                <p>The core used in Paris consists for the most part of chips and spalls arising in
                    the process of dressing the soft freestone which is the main constituent of the
                    walls of most buildings in that city. Almost any hard material, however, will
                    furnish rubble fit for the purpose, which must be angular and irregular in form,
                    so as to allow the mortar to pass freely through the rubble, and embed it all.
                    Rubble of brick material, as broken burrs, or even of old bricks freshly broken,
                    will answer very well; but if brickbats or shreds of plain tiles be used, care
                    must be taken in packing not to bring flat beds together, or the mortar will not
                    pass through and make a perfect concrete. Rubble of almost any kind may be used;
                    but the kinds of stone which are themselves concretions, and present rough
                    surfaces upon the fracture, are the best, while schistose or scaling slaty
                    stones are the worst for the purpose. But there is no better substance for
                    coring partitions upon the plan described than clay burnt into a kind of brick
                    rubble.</p>
                <p>The same process applied to external enclosures will justify the use of timber in
                    their structure in situations and under circumstances in which it may be
                    properly prohibited when the timber is merely lathed and plastered, or even
                    brick-nogged, for brick-nogging adds nothing, as already remarked, to the
                    strength of a partition or an enclosure, but rather takes from it, being itself
                    a source of infirmity. But chimneys and their flues, with their congeners,
                    stoves and furnaces, ought not, under any circumstances, to be formed in an
                    enclosure in which timber is employed as a part of the structure.</p>
                <p>Under some circumstances, again,—that is to say, when any street of a town is so
                    wide and the buildings to be built fronting it are to be of such small
                    elevation, as to make the communication of fire from one side to the opposite
                    side practically impossible, if the buildings adjoining laterally are
                    effectually separated from one another by sufficient walls, party or otherwise,
                    and these project before the outside faces of the front and back enclosures so
                    as effectually to prevent fire from passing round them,—the temperature of
                    dwelling-houses may be much more easily maintained and regulated if the outside
                    surface be boarded. Weather-boarding is a safe and economical, as well as a
                    neat, wholesome, and equable outside casing for the fronts of a dwelling-house,
                    if the boarding be backed up solidly, and the timber quarterings necessary to
                    secure it be properly filled in between and behind with brick or stone work, or
                    with rubble and concrete in the manner already described. Brickwork builds up
                    badly with the raking braces of timber-framed enclosures, and the concrete
                    described would not be so perfect with weather-boarding on one side as if the
                    mortar were thrown in from both sides; but raking braces are less essential to
                    enclosures which are filled in and backed with a heavy body of brickwork or
                    concrete, than when mere lathing or even brick-nogging is to be employed on the
                    inside. A 9-inch brick wall may, indeed, be very well built up with framed
                    quarterings without raking braces, if the work be built between and around the
                    quarterings, carrying, that is to say, the inner half-brick before the inside
                    faces of the chartering, and so as to show on the inside a plain brick wall.</p>

                    In this order the works of the trades will be described, and we now proceed to
                    the ordinary routine of the practice of building. The two publications which

                    at the end of each trade.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Foundation.—</hi> The architect having furnished the
                    specification and working-drawings of his design, the first step is to prepare
                    the foundation; and as this relates to the bricklayer as well as to the mason,
                    we say what is necessary respecting it here. Much in this particular, it is
                    evident, must depend on localities. It is not of so much importance that the
                    ground be hard, or even rocky, as that it be compact, and of similar consistence
                    throughout; that it be so constituted as to resist entirely and throughout, or
                    yield equally to the superincumbent weight. But in the ordinary processes of
                    building little requires to be said of the artificial preparation of foundations
                    beyond the notice of jt already given. When a good, hard soil is easily
                    accessible, as solid gravel, chalk, or rock, we have nothing to do but to remove
                    the surface mould, dig to the sound bottom, and at once to put in the footings.
                    On softer ground it was usual to employ footings at least double the width of
                    the wall, and frequently more; but since the invention, or rather revival, of
                    the use of concrete, this is seldom or never done. In this case, or when the
                    ground is a deep clay, be the material used what it may, it should at least go
                    so deep as not to be affected by change of temperature, or the rising and
                    falling of springs, as the alternate shrinking and swelling of the ground must
                    affect the building. Frost seldom penetrates a foot into the ground in this
                    country; but in clay soils, fissures, the consequences of drought, are found 3
                    feet and more in depth. The basis should, therefore, be below this point in such
                    a stratum. If the ground be springy, it should be drained, if possible; if not,
                    a foundation should be made with concrete as low as the lowest level of the
                    water; or if very deep or boggy, piles must be used. The plan of building on
                    sleepers and planking, so common some years ago, is very bad, as they rot after
                    a time, and the building settles in all directions, as the greater weights crush
                    the decayed timbers sooner thaιi do the lighter portions of the building. Where
                    ground is alternately wet and dry, the best timber soon decays; even piles
                    should always be kept in the water. The use of concrete, except in very peculiar
                    cases, has entirely superseded every other artificial foundation. It may be
                    defined as a sort of rough masonry, composed of broken pieces of stone or
                    gravel, cemented together with lime prepared in various ways, and thoroughly
                    mixed with it, and not laid by hand but thrown at random into the trenches, to
                    form the depth required.</p>
                <p>Any hard substance, broken into small pieces, will make good concrete. That most
                    used is gravel, or ballast. This should not be too fine, as the sand which may
                    be in it will mix with the lime and form a sort of mortar, assisting to cement
                    the stones together. If broken stones or masons’ chips are used, it is desirable
                    to add some sharp sand with them. The general rule is, that no piece of stone
                    should exceed a hen’s egg in size. In this country the lime is generally ground,
                    which is bad, as the core or unburnt portion is ground up with the good lime.
                    About one-sixth part of lime is generally used; chalk lime should not be used in
                    a damp situation. It is mixed with the ballast by scattering it among the
                    stones, and turning it all over with a shovel, water being at the same time
                    thrown upon the mass. It is then, while hot, filled into the trenches, sometimes
                    by shooting from stages <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n504/mode/1up"

                    work; but this process has been very justly censured as uncertain by eminent
                    engineers, who prefer to put it in layers of not more than one foot in
                    thickness, and to level each course, ramming it down thoroughly. When the lime
                    is too hastily put into the trenches, and has not had time to be thoroughly
                    slaked, the process will continue, and the mass will puff or swell and sometimes
                    cause considerable mischief. Wing walls of bridges have been thrust out by this
                    means. To make a solid concrete all the interstices of the gravel should be
                    filled with the sand, and the lime and the water will be absorbed without any
                    increase of bulk. In France the lime is first made into a paste, and the mixture
                    is then called <hi rend="italic">béton,</hi> not concrete; this is a more
                    scientific process for obtaining a sound substance. In some experiments made by
                    the Architectural Publication Society, where the materials were carefully mixed,
                    no change took place in the bulk; but some experimentalists, practical men, and
                    writers differ on this point, and assert there is a loss of one-seventh in bulk
                    when set. The lime, if it can be procured, should be hydraulic; and concrete is
                    much improved by the addition of the volcanic sands. French authors recommend,
                    as good proportions, one-fifth hydraulic lime, one-fourth pozzuolana, one-eighth
                    sharp sand, and the rest broken stone or gravel; or 20 per cent, hydraulic lime,
                    the same of trass, the same of sharp sand, 15 per cent, of gravel, and 25 per
                    cent, of broken stone. Perhaps the very best concrete is made of a simple
                    mixture of gravel, sand, and Portland cement. It is unnecessary to enter into
                    the details of foundations in water, as this but seldom comes within the
                    ordinary builder’s province.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Digger or Excavator.—</hi> The digger works with a pick-axe and
                    a spade or shovel. With the pick-axe he breaks down the soil if it be hard or
                    very stiff, and throws it out with the shovel; but compacted sand and alluvial
                    soil are spitted and thrown out with the spade alone, without previous breaking
                    down. When rock occurs in a foundation, the assistance of the quarryman is
                    requisite to cut through or blast it, as the occasion may require. The digger
                    should be required to produce a perfect level in every direction, and especially
                    in trenches for walls; fior may this be done by replacing loose matter, but the
                    level must be produced on the solid or undisturbed bed. A good excavator will
                    dig and throw out, of common soil, into a basket or wheelbarrow, 8 or 10 yards
                    per diem; but of stiff clay or firm gravel not more than 6 yards.</p>
                <p>When the excavation has to be dug to a depth about the height of a man it will,
                    be necessary to strut the ground to prevent its falling in, especially if it be
                    of a sandy, loose, or watery nature. This is done by placing on each side of the
                    cutting upright planks against the soil, which may be either open or close,
                    according to the quality of the soil, and against these one or more horizontal
                    waling pieces secured by horizontal cross pieces or struts, and wedging up as
                    necessary. On these struts are formed the landings or stageβ on which the lowest
                    workman throws the soil he digs up, which is then again thrown up by a second
                    man to another stage or to the surface, according to the depth. Sometimes the
                    soil is hoisted in baskets or tubs raised by a windlass worked by hand, or by a
                    horse-run. When the work has been executed for which the excavation was
                    prepared, the digger has to fill in over and around it, carefully ramming the
                    soil to prevent inequalities on the surface by the soil sinking, and to prevent
                    water soaking in which might affect the foundations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brickwork,</hi></p>
                <p>The tools and implements employed by the bricklayer are the trowel, plumb-rule,
                    rod, level, square, bevel, line-pins and lines, raker, jointer, crow-bar,
                    pick-axe, and rammer, together with a hod and spade for his labourer. Besides
                    these there are sundry others, as an axe, saw, and rubstone, used in ctutting
                    and gauging bricks, and some which are peculiar to tiling and paving. A pug-mill
                    and screens for mixing and tempering mortar, and tubs and pails for water, are
                    alsoauxiliaries of great importance.</p>
                <p>In ordinary practice the bricklayer’s scaffolds are carried up with the walls,
                    and are made to rest on them. Having built up the walls as high as he can reach
                    from the ground, he plants a row of poles, which vary in height from 30 to 40
                    and even 50 feet, parallel to and at a distance of about 4 feet 6 inches from
                    the walls, and from 10 to 12 feet apart. To these, which are called standards,
                    are attached by means of cords other poles called ledgers, horizontally and on
                    the inside, with their upper surface on a level with the highest course of the
                    wall yet laid; and on the ledgers and wall short transverse poles, called
                    putlogs or putlocks, are laid as joists to carry the floor of scaffold boards.
                    These putlocks are placed from 4 to 6 feet apart, according to the length and
                    strength of the scaffold boards; and the ends which rest on the walls are
                    carefully laid on the middle of a stretcher, so as to occupy the place of a
                    header brick, which is inserted when the scaffolds are struck after the work is
                    finished. On the floor of the scaffold thus formed the bricklayer stands, and
                    the materials are brought up ladders to him by labourers in hods from the ground
                    below; or they are hoisted up in baskets and buckets by means of a pulley-wheel
                    and fall; or by the horse-run, which is more generally used, formed of a level
                    pathway in which the horse moves, drawing up the load by the intervention of
                    snatch blocks and guide wheels; or by the now usual hoisting-machine, worked by
                    men, horses, or steam-power. The mortar is placed on ledged boards about 3 feet
                    square, at convenient distances; and the bricks are strewn on the scaffold
                    between the mortar boards, leaving a clear way against the wall for the
                    bricklayers to move along unobstructedly. The workman then recommences the
                    operation of bricklaying, beginning at the extreme left of his course, and
                    advancing to the right until he reaches the angle or quoin in that direction, or
                    the place where his fellow-workman on the same side may have begun. Thus he goes
                    on with course after course until the wall is as high as he can conveniently
                    reach from that scaffold, when another ledger is tied to the poles, another row
                    of putlocks laid, and the boards are removed up to the new level. The ledger and
                    most of the putlocks, however, remain to give steadiness to the temporary
                    structure, and so on to the full height of the wall, the poles being pieced out
                    by additional lengths as may be required. If a scaffold be very much exposed,
                    and run to a great height, it must be braced. This is done by tying poles
                    diagonally across on the outside to the standards and ledgers, and it may be
                    further secured by tying the ends of some of the putlocks to the ledgers; but an
                    outside scaffold should never be attached in any way to the building about which
                    it stands. A scaffold should never be loaded heavily, as well on account of the
                    work as of the scaffold itself; for the putlocks resting, as they do, on single
                    bricks, in a green wall, they exert an injurious influence on it, which every
                    additional pound weight on the scaffold must necessarily increase, and the
                    putlocks themselves are liable to be bent or broken. A constant and steady
                    supply of bricks and mortar on the part of the labourers, without overloading
                    the scaffold at any one time, should be strictly required.</p>
                <p>The suspended scaffold is a very ingenious contrivance, by which pointing and
                    other external repairs of a house can be performed at a comparatively small
                    cost, and without interference with the thoroughfare. The front can also be
                    painted by the same means. Although known at least <pb break="no"

                    scaffold has been much used. A couple of planks are secured side by side to form
                    a platform, which is guarded by a railing all round to prevent the workmen
                    falling off. To iron bands are secured pulleys and ropes, passing over other
                    pulleys made fast to two or more beams projecting out of the upper windows, or
                    secured to the roof-timbers, by means of which the workmen employed can raise or
                    lower the scaffold to any position where it is wanted to get access to the work
                    to be done.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Mortars and Cements.—</hi> A few observations on the
                    composition of mortars and cements for bricklaying will be necessary here.
                    Mortar is of two kinds,—common mortar, or that mixture of lime and sand
                    ordinarily used in building; and hydraulic mortar, or that which will set under
                    water. Cement is a name given to the produce of certain argillaceous stones,
                    after calcination, which will set rapidly in the air, becoming a hard adhesive
                    substance in a short time, and will also set under water, both without admixture
                    of any other substance. The name is given, too, to certain artificial imitations
                    of these substances, possessing the same properties; and besides, to various
                    bituminous or oleaginous compositions, used in building for similar
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>Pure lime, which is an oxide of a metal called calcium, does not exist in a
                    natural state. It is, however, found abundantly in the conditions of carbonates
                    and subcarbonates, in chalk, and in the various other descriptions of
                    limestones. Its chemical qualities and analysis will be described under the
                    proper headings in this work. Limes are generally classed, since the publication
                    of the work of Vicat, as—(1) rich limes, (2) poor limes, (3) limes slightly
                    hydraulic, (4) hydraulic limes, and (5) eminently hydraulic limes. In treating
                    of mortar we have to deal with the first two of this division. The first
                    operation is to drive off the water, which all limestones contain in a greater
                    or less degree, and the carbonic acid gas, which is done by calcining or burning
                    in a kiln at red heat; this must be kept up for several hours, care being taken
                    to avoid any approach to vitrification. By this process it is slightly
                    diminished in bulk, loses nearly half its weight, and becomes caustic lime. The
                    lime is next converted into a hydrate by a process called “slaking,” or throwing
                    pure water over it from time to time till it hisses and cracks with considerable
                    force and some noise, gives off a large quantity of hot vapour, and falls into a
                    powder. The rich limes, which are the purest oxides of calcium, increase to
                    double their bulk in the process. The poor limes swell to a much less degree.
                    The hydrates thus formed absorb water, and easily take the form of a paste. They
                    contain rather less than one-third water to two-thirds lime. In this state, if
                    treated with pure water, frequently renewed, every particle of the rich limes,
                    and very nearly the whole of the poor limes, will be taken up in solution. In
                    the process of slaking too much water should not be used, as it “drowns” the
                    lime, according to the expression of the workmen. When in the form of paste it
                    begins to absorb carbonic acid, which is always present in air in considerable
                    quantities, and gradually to crystallize again, and so to harden. If the air be
                    excluded from the hydrate of pure lime, it may be kept for almost any length of
                    time. Alberti (lib. ii. cap. 11) says that he once discovered some in an old
                    ditch, which from certain indications must have been there 500 years, and was as
                    soft as honey or marrow, and perfectly fit for use.</p>
                <p>The rich limestones give a white lime, which easily slakes, and increases in
                    bulk; but it is curious that though the stones differ so much in outward
                    appearance and in texture, the lime, if they be well burned, is the same. The
                    softest chalk and the hardest rag-stone or marble yield an equally good lime,
                    the calcium which they contain being the same mineτah But as chalk generally
                    contains water, irregularly distributed in some places and not in others, and as
                    it does not exhibit the change that marble or stone does, it is frequently
                    unequally burned, and therefore slakes imperfectly. It is said by Higgins <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mortars and Cements,</hi> p. 29), however, that lime made from
                    chalk absorbs carbonic acid more rapidly than that made from stone; but
                    experience does not seem to warrant this conclusion. Poor limestones are those
                    which contain silica, magnesia, manganese, or metallic oxides. In consequence of
                    this they are more liable to vitrify in burning, and do not slake so freely. The
                    lime is generally of a browner colour than that from rich limestones, which is
                    said to be a proof of the presence of the above-named metallic oxides. If,
                    however, they be ground so as to facilitate the slaking of every particle, and
                    if used immediately being made up, poor limes produce a mortar which becomes
                    harder than that from the rich limes, and which resists water better. In fact,
                    works where the latter have been used have been found to fail .entirely by the
                    action of running water, which, as before has been said, will continue to remove
                    the whole of a rich lime particle by particle.</p>
                <p>It is found that the mixture of some kind of hard matter in particles or granules
                    facilitates the setting of mortar, and renders it harder and more adhesive than
                    when used alone, besides the saving of limestone and expense of burning. The
                    harder this material and the sharper the particles the better, as the brick or
                    stone has always some irregularities on the surface, into which these angles or
                    sharp points may enter, and form what is called a key. The substance most
                    generally used is sand, which is classed as riversand and pit-sand. The former
                    is usually preferred, as it is more free from earthy matters, particularly soft
                    loams or clay. Mortar made with sand containing one-seventh or one-eighth part
                    of fat clay moulders in winter like marl,—a circumstance which proves the
                    propriety of freeing from clay the sand used in mortar. If pit-sand bo used it
                    should be well washed. Scarcely any material is better than crushed quartz, or
                    flint, from the sharpness of the angles of the particles; in fact, it is said
                    that very sharp sand, with an inferior lime, will make a more adhesive mortar
                    than soft sand with the best lime. The practical mixing of mortar will be
                    noticed further on. Where sand is scarce, other materials are sometimes used,
                    the principal and cheapest of which is burned clay. The Romans used this
                    extensively in the form of pounded tile. At present the custom is to throw up
                    clay mixed with fuel in loose heaps, to burn it slowly, and then to grind it in
                    a mill with a proper quantity of lime. The French writers at one time asserted
                    that burned clay, if not equal to pozzuolana, was very nearly so; and large
                    quantities were used as hydraulic mortars at various public works. Where the
                    water was fresh, as at Strasburg, the work stood very well; but where these
                    mortars were exposed to the action of sea-water, they failed and went to powder
                    in three or four years. Vicat gave great attention to the subject; and though he
                    attributed much of the fault to the imperfect carbonization of the materials, it
                    appears with but little doubt there is some inherent difference between the
                    pozzuolanas and other volcanic products and those produced artificially. After
                    long investigation, Vicat was of opinion that this failure was due to the
                    quantity of hydrochloride of magnesia always present in sea-water; but in what
                    way this affected the burned clay and not the volcanic products he was unable to
                    explain.</p>
                <p>A very excellent mortar, much used by engineers in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0506-0459"/> tunnels, is composed of one part of moderately
                    hydraulic lime, one part of coal ashes, one part of burned clay, and two parts
                    of sharp sand. The vitrified refuse of furnaces, called slag, and the scoriae
                    from the iron-works, have also been crushed and used instead of sand; and with
                    lime, slightly hydraulic, produce good mortar. The former is preferred to the
                    latter, as having sharper and harder particles, and containing much less iron.
                    Coal cinders have been used, and seem to have some hydraulic properties; they
                    should, however, be employed with caution, for it is considered they make the
                    lime “short.” Wood cinders are too alkaline to be used with safety.</p>
                <p>The vitrified and calcined products of volcanoes make most excellent materials
                    for mortars, particularly where required to be eminently hydraulic. The
                    principal of them is the pozzuolana, which abounds in Italy. It is called so
                    from being found in great abundance at Pozzuoli, near Naples, and is, in fact,
                    the basis of all the best Roman mortars, ancient as well as modern. It is
                    usually sent to England from Civita Vecchia. It varies in colour from reddish
                    brown to violet red, and is sometimes greyish; it has a roughly granulated
                    appearance, and sometimes resembles a cinder in texture, and has frequently a
                    spongy appearance. Acids have little effect on it, and it is not soluble in
                    water. Λ similar earth is found in the centre of France. But one long known in
                    this country comes from the village of Brohl, near Andernach, on the Rhine; this
                    is called tarrass or tras3. These materials have a wonderful effect in rendering
                    even the rich limes eminently hydraulic, and in less proportions improving the
                    hydraulic limes. Vicat says, these mortars begin to set under water the first
                    day, grow hard in the third, and in twelve months are as hard as the bricks
                    themselves. The mixture of common lime with these materials, according to the
                    French writers, should be 1 of pounded lime to] 2⅜ of pozzuolana, or to 2 of
                    trass; or 1 of lime to 1 of sand and 1 of pozzuolana.</p>
                <p>In addition to the hydraulic limes, which have been thus described, there is a
                    peculiar class of stonps, which, when burned and pulverized, may be used as
                    mortar, without admixture of sand or any similar substance; and which will not
                    only set rapidly under water, but will acquire an unusual degree of hardness and
                    tenacity. These are called natural cements. Mr Parker is supposed to have been
                    the inventor; at any rate, that gentleman took out a patent about sixty years
                    ago for what he called Roman cement. His materials were the argillo-calcareous
                    nodules, or septaria, found in the Isle of Sheppey, and commonly called
                    bald-pates. They contain about 70 per cent, of carbonate of lime, about 4 per
                    cent, of oxide of iron, 18 per cent, of silica, and 6 or 7 per cent, of alumina.
                    The process is simply to break the stones into small pieces, and burn them in
                    running kilns with coal or coke; they are then ground to a powder, and headed up
                    into casks for use. The success of Parker’s cement led to experiments in other
                    places, and the same process was carried on with other argillo-calcareous
                    nodules, as the septaria at Hawick; those in Yorkshire, which produce the cement
                    called Atkinson’s; and those in the Isle of Wight, which produce the Medina
                    cement. Similar substances were also discovered, and the same processes carried
                    on in France and in Russia. All these cement-stones effervesce with acids, and
                    lose about one-third of their weight in burning. Parker considered that the more
                    the stones were burned short of absolute vitrification the better; but this is
                    not the practice in the present day, though, no doubt, sound in theory. When
                    taken from the kiln these stones will not slake without being pulverized; and if
                    kept dry, and not exposed to the air, the cement will be good almost any length
                    of time; but it rapidly absorbs both water and carbonic acid if not carefully
                    closed up, and falls back into a state of subcarbonate, from which it is said it
                    may be recovered by fresh burning, but it is doubted whether it is ever so good
                    as on the first calcination. The great utility of these cements, and the expense
                    of obtaining the stone, induced manufacturers to endeavour to discover some
                    method of making an article by artificial means which should resemble the
                    natural cements. Mr Frost seems to have been the first who attempted it on a
                    large scale; but though he was assisted by the science of General Pasley, the
                    results did not come up to the expected standard. Of course, the object was to
                    produce an argillo-calcareous substance containing the same chemical qualities
                    as the natural nodules, which might be burned in kilns as they are. The attempt
                    to combine argil in the form of burned clay, to be mixed with lime instead of
                    pozzuolana, had partially failed, as has been stated above. The experiments
                    conducted by General Pasley, and by Vicat at Meudon in France, were all based on
                    the principle of mixing together, in a mill, with a quantity of water, masses of
                    chalk and clay, just as the brickmakers do for the production of malm bricks,
                    but in the proportion of about four of the former to one of the latter. The
                    fluid mixture is run out into shallow receivers, and when dry is cut into small
                    blocks or lumps, and burned exactly as the natural nodules are. The difficulty
                    was to give the materials the full degree of calcination short of vitrification.
                    A successful result seems to have been at last attained by the inventors of the
                    Portland cement, so called from its near resemblance to Portland stone in its
                    colour. It not only possesses the property of setting more quickly, and has
                    greater powers of cohesion than the natural cements, but it may be used with a
                    superabundance of water in the form of grout, which they cannot be; above all,
                    it seems to resist the action of sea-water beyond all others; and it is proof
                    against water when used as a mortar in setting brickwork, and in the composition
                    of concrete for foundations. It also forms a very superior cement for
                    plasterer’s work. A prepared patent carbonate (Westmacott’s patent) is used in
                    combination with chalk, grey, and all other limes. All the carbonic acid being
                    removed from the lime in its burning, 75 per cent, of this acid is restored by
                    its mixture with the prepared patent carbonate, and its induration immediately
                    commences, instead of the lime gaining the carbonic acid by atmospheric
                    influence through a lengthened period. It is used as a quick stucco for rapid
                    plastering; and as a carbonated lime for external use it is in the course of a
                    few days converted into a stone mortar.</p>
                <p>Selenitic mortar is the name given to a composition lately invented by
                    Major-General Scott. He was the first to observe, about eighteen years ago, that
                    a limestone capable of conversion by burning into a hydraulic lime might furnish
                    a good cement by simply allowing a small portion of sulphuric acid gas to pass
                    into the kiln during the burning of the lime. Having found difficulty in carry
                    ing out this process, he now mixes with the water used in the preparation of the
                    mortar a small quantity of sulphate of lime <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi>
                    plaster of Paris, or gypsum) or green vitriol. It has the advantage, when used
                    for plastering, of allowing the setting coat to be applied in forty-eight hours
                    after the first coat has been put on. This mortar is said to save half the lime,
                    is four times as strong, and sets in one quarter of the time required by common
                    mortar. The lime will take six parts of sand, and is said to be an excellent
                    substitute for Portland cement for concrete at less cost.</p>
                <p>Asphalt, or mineral pitch (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Asphalt),</hi> has lately
                    come into extensive use for paving, for covering the backs of arches, or
                    rendering the walls of basements where wet is likely to soak through, also as a
                    damp-course over the footings of walls to prevent the rise of damp, and for
                    lining cisterns and tanks to prevent the escape of the fluid. The best qualities
                    are the Vai de Travers and the Seyssel, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0507-0460"/> both obtained from France. In using asphalt for
                    paving, a bed of concrete, made of the best hydraulic lime, is first prepared,
                    and made fair at top by a rendering of similar mortar. The asphalt will not
                    dissolve with heat by itself, but will calcine in the caldron. A small quantity
                    of pure mineral pitch is therefore first put in; when this is hot the asphalt is
                    added, and soon dissolves; a quantity of powdered stone-dust is then stirred in,
                    and a small portion of quicklime. The mixture in its melted state is then laid
                    on the bed of concrete (which must be quite dry), and spread close and fair,
                    some sand being sprinkled over the top and well trowelled in. The best
                    proportions are said to be about 2 pints of mineral pitch to 10 K&gt; of asphalt
                    and one-fourth bushel of stone-dust. Another method of forming a paving is to
                    place on the concrete a layer about 3 inches in thickness of hot asphalt in
                    powder, and then to ram it down with hot iron rammers, until it has come to its
                    proper consistency; it is then finished as usual. This has been lately much used
                    for roadways in the city of London and elsewhere. The same material has been
                    compressed into tiles about 6 inches square, and these laid on a good
                    foundation. A very inferior imitation is made by mixing a quantity of sharp sand
                    with gas-tar, heated in a caldron, and then adding some quicklime. This may do
                    for rendering walls, &amp;c., to keep out wet, but it is of very little use as
                    paving. Gravel coated with tar, and theu laid and set in tar, rammed down, and
                    sanded over, makes a very good pavement for ordinary footpaths.</p>
                <p>As before noticed, particular attention must be paid to cleansing the sand to be
                    used for mortar of every particle of clay or mud that may adhere to or be mixed
                    up with it. Sea-sand is objectionable for two reasons: it cannot be perfectly
                    freed from a saline taint, and the particles are moreover generally rounded by
                    attrition, caused by the action of the sea, which makes it less efficient for
                    mortar than if they retained their natural angular forms. Lime should not be
                    slaked until the moment it is to be mixed up with the sand in mortar, but the
                    sooner that is done after it is burnt the better. The proportion of lime to sand
                    generally taken, and the best, is one to three; but if both the materials be of
                    good quality, that is, if the lime slake freely, and become a fine pungent
                    impalpable powder, perfectly clear from argillaceous or any other foreign
                    matter, and the sand be clean and sharp, one part to four is enough; more is
                    injurious. The ingredients should be well mixed together, and with just as much
                    water as will suffice to make the compound consistent and paste-like. Of late
                    years, in lieu of sand, burned clay, as above noticed, has been much used in
                    localities where it is difficult to obtain the former material. This is ground
                    up with lime in a mill, but unless very great care is taken in its manufacture
                    the result is a very poor substitute for sand and lime mortar; and brick and
                    lime rubbish have also been used in like manner, with an equally inferior
                    result. Rain or other soft water should be used for the purpose of making
                    mortar, and not spring or hard water, though any other may be preferred to what
                    is brackish even in the slightest degree. Higgins recommended that lime-water
                    should be used in preference to pure water. A quick-setting cement, such as
                    those which are commonly used in building in England, and known as Parker’s or
                    Roman cement, and Portland cement, can only be mixed or gauged as it is required
                    for use. A bricklayer will keep a labourer fully employed in gauging cement for
                    him alone. It is mixed with sand in the proportion of from about two or three to
                    about five or six of sand, to one of the cement, according to the quality of the
                    latter; and the labourer as he gauges on one board supplies the mixture to the
                    bricklayer fit for use on another board, a spadeful at a time; it must then be
                    applied within half a minute, or it sets and is spoiled and wasted, for it
                    should never be worked up again.</p>
                <p>The average size of bricks in England is a fraction under 9 inches long, 4∣
                    inches wide, and 2⅜ inches thick; and in consequence of this uniformity of size,
                    a wall of this material is described as of so many bricks in thickness, or of
                    the number of inches which result from multiplying 9 inches by any number of
                    bricks; a 9-inch or one-brick wall; a 14-inch or one-brick-and-a-half wall (13⅛
                    inches would be more correct, in fact, for although a joint of mortar must occur
                    in this thickness, yet the fraction under the given size of the brick is enough
                    to form it); an 18-inch or two brick wall, and so on.</p>
                <p>The great art in bricklaying is to preserve and maintain a bond, to have every
                    course perfectly horizontal, both longitudinally and transversely, and perfectly
                    plumb (which last, however, may not mean upright, though that is the general
                    acceptation of the term, for the plumb-rule may be made to suit any required
                    inclination, as inward against a bank, for instance, or in a tapering tower);
                    and also to make the vertical joints recur perpendicularly over each other,
                    which is vulgarly and technically called keeping the <hi rend="italic"
                    >perpends.</hi> By bond in brickwork is intended that arrangement which shall
                    make the bricks of every course cover the joints of those in the course below
                    it, and so tend to make the whole mass or combination of bricks act as much
                    together, or as dependently one upon another, as possible. The workmen should be
                    strictly supervised as they proceed with it, for many of the failures which have
                    occurred may be referred to their ignorance or carelessness in this particular.
                    The object of bonding will be understood by reference to the diagram, fig. 1,
                    Plate XX. Here, it is evident, from the arrangement of the bricks, that any
                    weight placed on <hi rend="italic">a</hi> would (supposing, as we are obliged to
                    suppose, that every brick bears equally, throughout its whole length, a stress
                    laid on every part of it) be carried down and borne alike in every course from
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to <hi rend="italic">c</hi>; in the same manner the
                    brick <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is upbome by every brick in the line <hi
                    rend="italic">e f,</hi> and so throughout the structure. Eut this forms a
                    longitudinal bond only, which cannot extend its influence beyond the width of
                    the brick; and a wall of one brick and a half or two bricks thick, built in this
                    manner, would, in effect, consist of three or four half-brick-thick walls,
                    acting independently of each other, as shown in the plan at <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> in the diagram under fig, 1. If the bricks were turned so as to show
                    their short sides or ends in front, instead of their long ones, certainly a
                    compact wall of a whole brick in thickness would be produced; but the
                    longitudinal bond would be shortened one-half, as at <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">c h,</hi> and a wall of any greater thickness, in the same manner,
                    must be composed of so many independent one-brick walls, as at <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> in the plan before referred to. To obviate this, to produce a
                    transverse, and yet preserve a true longitudinal bond, the bricks are laid in
                    alternate courses of headers and stretchers, or of ends and sides, as shown in
                    fig. 2, thus combining the advantages of the two modes of arrangement <hi
                    rend="italic">abc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g c</hi><hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    fig. 1, in<hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> fig. 2. Each brick in fig. 2 showing its long side in front, or being a
                    stretcher, will have another lying parallel to it, and on the same level, on the
                    other side, to receive the other ends of the bricks showing as headers in front,
                    which in their turn bind, by covering the joint between them, as shown in the
                    end of such a wall at <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Thus a well-bonded 9-inch or
                    one-brick wall is produced. The end elevations of the same wall at <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> show how the process of
                    bonding is pursued in walls of one and a half and two bricks thick, the
                    stretcher being abutted in the same course by a header,—thus, in a 14-inch wall,
                    inverting the appearance on the opposite sides, as seen at e <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and producing the same appearance in an 18-inch wall,
                    as at <hi rend="italic">f.</hi> In the diagram <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n510/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0510-0461"/> under fig. 2, at <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> is the
                    plan of a 14-inch wall, showing the headers on one side, and the stretchers on
                    the other, and at <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is the plan of the course immediately
                    above it, in which the headers and stretchers are inverted; at <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> are shown in the same manner the plans of
                    two courses of an 18-inch wall. This is called English bond. ’Thicker walls are
                    constructed in the same manner by the extension of the same principle.</p>
                <p>But a brick being exactly half its length in breadth, it is impossible,
                    commencing from a vertical end or quoin, to make a bond with whole bricks, as
                    the joints must of necessity fall one over the other. This difficulty is
                    obviated by cutting a brick longitudinally into two equal parts, which are
                    called half headers. One of these is placed next to a whole header, inward from
                    the angle, and forms with it a tbree-quarter length between the stretchers above
                    and below, thus making a regular overlap, which may then be preserved
                    throughout; half headers so applied are technically termed closers, and are
                    shown next the upright angle of the wall fig. 2, and the first joints inwards
                    from the square ends by the headers in the plans at <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> A three-quarter stretcher is obviously as available
                    for this purpose as a half header, but the latter is preferred, because, by the
                    use of it, uniformity of appearance is preserved, and whole bricks are retained
                    on the returns. In walls of almost all thicknesses above 9 inches, to preserve
                    the transverse, and yet not destroy the longitudinal bond, it is frequently
                    necessary to use half bricks; but it becomes a question whether more is not lost
                    in the general firmness and consistence of the wall by that necessity, than is
                    gained in the uniformity of the bond. It may certainly be taken as a general
                    rule, that a brick should never be cut if it can be worked in whole, for a new
                    joint is thereby created in a construction, the difficulty of which consists in
                    obviating the debility arising from the constant recurrence of joints. Great
                    attention should be paid to this, especially in the quoins of buildings, in
                    which half bricks most frequently occur; and there it is not only of consequence
                    to have the greatest degree of consistence, but the quarter bricks used as
                    closers are already admitted, and the weakness consequent on their admission
                    would only be increased by the use of other bats, or fragments of bricks.</p>
                <p>Another mode of bonding brickwork, which may be supposed to have arisen from the
                    appearance of the ends of a wall according to the former mode of arrangement
                    (see <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> fig. 2), instead of
                    placing the bricks in alternate courses of headers and stretchers, places
                    headers and stretchers alternately in the same course, fig. 3. The plans below
                    this at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> are of two courses
                    of a 14-inch wall, with their bond, showing in what manner the joints are broken
                    in the wall horizontally as well as vertically on its face. This is called
                    Flemish bond. Closers are also necessary to this variety of bond; half bricks
                    also will occur in both, but what has been said with reference to the use of
                    them in the former applies even with more force to the latter, for they are more
                    frequent in Flemish than in English, and its transverse tie is thereby rendered
                    less strong. Their occurrence is a disadvantage which every care should be taken
                    to obviate. The arrangements of the joints, however, in Flemish Bond, presenting
                    a neater appearance than that of English bond, it, is generally preferred for
                    external walls when their outer faces are not to be covered with some
                    composition; but English bond should have the preference when the greatest
                    degree of strength and compactness is considered of the highest importance,
                    because it affords, as we have already noticed, a better transverse tie than the
                    other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> Mr W. IIosking was the first to notice (in the last
                    edition of this work) that what is in England called Flemish bond is unknown in
                    Flanders, and is practised in the British Isles alone. In Flanders, Holland, and
                    Rhenish Germany, which are bricklaying countries, no kind of bond is found but
                    what is known in England as English bond. But it has lately been noticed that
                    the mediaeval brick buildings in the north-east of Germany are worked in Flemish
                    bond, or as it is there called “cross-bond;” and it is also to be seen at
                    Brussels in work of about the end of the 18th century. Many of the buildings
                    designed by Inigo Jones in England, and perhaps all of those by Sir C. Wren, are
                    executed in Flemish bond, which name, it has been suggested, might have been
                    derived from the word “flemishing” used by workmen, and thus applied to
                    brickwork as meaning work better “finished off” than the other kind.</p>
                <p>It has been attempted to improve the bond in thick walls by laying raking courses
                    in the core between external stretching courses, and reversing the rake when the
                    course recurs. This obviates whatever necessity may exist of using half bricks
                    in the heading courses, but it leaves triangular interstices to be filled up
                    with bats, as is shown in Plate XX. fig. 4. This represents the plan of 36-inch
                    or three-brick wall with raking courses at α, between external ranges of
                    stretchers, and lying on a complete course of headers, and at <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> a wall of the same thickness herringboned; courses of headers would bed
                    and cover this also, and, in the second course above, the raking or
                    herringboning would be repeated, but the direction of the bricks reversed. It
                    will be seen that the latter demands, in addition to the triangular filling in
                    bats at the outer ends of the diagonally placed bricks, half bricks to fill up
                    the central line of interstices, rendering herring-boning more objectionable in
                    that particular, though it has some advantages over simply raking, or thorough
                    diagonal courses in other points. Neither mode should, however, be had recourse
                    to for walls of a less thickness than three bricks, and that indeed is almost
                    too thin to admit of any great advantage from it.</p>
                <p>Not second in importance to bonding is, that the brickwork be perfectly plumb, or
                    vertical, and that every course be perfectly horizontal, or level, both
                    longitudinally and transversely. The lowest course in the footings of a brick
                    wall should be laid with the strictest attention to this latter particular <hi
                    rend="italic">; for</hi> the bricks being of equal thickness throughout, the
                    slightest irregularity or incorrectness in that will be carried into the
                    superimposing courses, and can only be rectified by using a greater or less
                    quantity of mortar in one part or another, so that the wall will of course yield
                    unequally to the superincumbent weight, as the work goes on, and perpetuate the
                    infirmity. To save the trouble of keeping the plumb-rule and level constantly in
                    his hands, and yet to insure correct work, the bricklayer, on clearing the
                    footings of a wall, builds up six or eight courses at the external angles (Plate
                    XX. fig. 5), which he carefully plumbs and levels across, and from one to the
                    other. These form a gauge for the intervening parts of the courses, a line being
                    tightly strained from one end to the other, resting on the upper and outer
                    angles of the gauge bricks of the next course to be laid, as at <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and with this he makes his
                    work range. If, however, the length be great, the line will of course sag; and
                    it must therefore be carefully set and propped at sufficient intervals. Having
                    carried up three or four courses to a level, with the guidance of tho line, the
                    work should be proved with the level and plumbrule, and particularly with the
                    latter at the quoins and reveals, as well as on the face. A smart tap with the
                    end of the handle of the trowel will generally suffice to make a brick yield
                    what little it may be out, while the work is so green, and not injure it. Good
                    workmen, however, take a pride in showing how correctly their work will plumb
                    without tapping. In work which is circular on the plan, both the level and the
                    plumb-rule must be used, together with <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0511-0462"/> a gauge-mould or a ranging trammel, for every
                    course, as it must be evident that the line cannot be applied to this in the
                    manner just described. For every wall of more than one brick thick, two men
                    should be employed at the same time, one outside and the other inside; one man
                    cannot do justice from one side even to a 14-inch wall.</p>
                <p>Bricks should not be merely <hi rend="italic">laid;</hi> every brick should be
                    rubbed and pressed down in such a manner as to force the mortar into the pores
                    of the bricks, and so produce absolute adhesion. Moreover, to make brickwork as
                    good and perfect as it may be, every brick should be made damp, or even wet,
                    before it is laid, especially in hot weather, otherwise it immediately absorbs
                    the moisture of the mortar, and, its surface being covered with dry dust, and
                    its pores full of air, no adhesion can take place; but if the brick be damp, and
                    the mortar moist, the dust is enveloped in the cementitious matter of the
                    mortar, which also enters the pores of the brick, so that when the water
                    evaporates their attachment is complete. To wet the bricks before they were
                    carried to the scaffold would, by making them heavier, add materially to the
                    labour of carrying; in dry weather they would, moreover, become dry again before
                    they could be used, and for the bricklayer to wet every brick himself would be
                    an unnecessary waste of his time; boys may therefore be advantageously employed
                    to dip the bricks on the scaffold, and supply them in a damp state to the
                    bricklayer’s hand. A watering-pot with a fine rose to it should also be used to
                    moisten the upper surface of the last laid course of bricks preparatory to
                    strewing the mortar over it. In bricklaying with quicksetting cements all this
                    is of even more importance; indeed, unless the bricks to be set with cement are
                    quite wet it will not attach itself to them at all.</p>
                <p>As mortar is a more yielding material, used in brickwork merely for the purpose
                    of making the detached portions of the staple adhere, by filling up their
                    interstices and excluding the air, and the object is to produce as unyielding
                    and consistent a mass as possible, no more should be used than is sufficient to
                    produce the desired result. No two bricks should be allowed to touch, because of
                    their inaptitude to adhere to each other; and no space between them should be
                    left unoccupied by mortar which may produce adhesion. When the bricks are a
                    fraction under 2⅜ inches thick, four courses of bricks and mortar, or brickwork,
                    are usually allowed 11 inches in height; and if they are fully that thickness,
                    four courses are allowed 11∣ inches. The result of thick beds of mortar between
                    the bricks is, that the mortar is pressed out after the joint is drawn, on the
                    outside, in front; and being made convex instead of slightly concave, the joints
                    catch every drop of rain that may trickle down the face of the wall, and are
                    thus saturated; the moisture freezes, and in thawing bursts the mortar, which
                    crumbles away, and creates the necessity, which is constantly recurring, of
                    pointing the joints to preserve the wall. The diagram, fig. 6, shows the section
                    of a 9-inch wall, with the joints on the side <hi rend="italic">a</hi> as drawn,
                    and on the side <hi rend="italic">b</hi> as bulged, in consequence of the
                    quantity of mortar in them yielding to the weight above. This, too, is in
                    addition to the inconvenient settling, which is the consequence of using too
                    much mortar in the beds. In practice, bricklayers lay the mortar on the course
                    last finished, and spread it over the surface with the trowel, considering that
                    it will fill the space between the bricks of that course, in addition to what
                    they may have placed in the edges of the outside joints; but the mortar ought
                    not to be so thin as to fall into the joints by its own weight; so, unless they
                    press it down, half the height of the space between the bricks remains
                    unoccupied, and the wall is consequently hollow, incompact, and necessarily
                    imperfect. To obviate this, it is common to have thick walls grouted in every
                    third or fourth course; that is, mortar made liquid, and called grout, is poured
                    on and spread over the surface of the bricks, that it may run in and fill up the
                    joints completely. This, at the best, is but doing with grout what should be
                    done with mortar; and filling or flushing up every course with mortar requires
                    very little additional exertion, and is far preferable. It also assists in
                    making the house warmer and drier, by preventing the passage of wind or damp
                    through the joints.</p>
                <p>All the walls of a building that are to sustain the same floors and the same roof
                    should be carried on simultaneously; under no circumstances should more be done
                    in one part than can be reached from the same scaffold, until all the walls are
                    brought up to the same height, and the ends of the part first built should be
                    racked back, as at <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> Plate XX. fig. 2, and not carried
                    up vertically with merely the toothing necessary for the bond, as at <hi
                    rend="italic">a b,</hi> fig. 3.</p>
                <p>Brickwork should never be carried on in frosty weather, nor even when it is
                    likely that frost will occur before the walls can be covered in or become so dry
                    as not to bo affected by frost. Covering an unfinished wall with a thick layer
                    of straw when frost may supervene is a very useful precaution; and on the straw
                    weather-boarding should be laid, to prevent access of moisture from rain or
                    snow. Merely wet weather may be guarded against by following the directions
                    given above as to flushing every course of the work well up with mortar, so that
                    no interstices be left into which water may insinuate itself, and by covering
                    the walls with boards to act as a coping when the men are not actually at work
                    on them; the joints in the face of a wall that is not to be plastered in any way
                    should be protected in this manner with great care.</p>
                <p>After the footings of a wall (above noticed) have been brought up to the level of
                    the finished surface of the ground, or to the underside of the joists of the
                    lowest floor, there should always be introduced a damp-proof course, intended to
                    prevent that rise of damp from the soil in the brickwork which is the cause of
                    so much disfigurement and injury to buildings. This damp course is formed in
                    various ways, as a layer of asphalt, or asphalt canvas, or some similar
                    material. One of the best and most usual, as the materials are always at hand,
                    is formed of two courses of slates, well breaking joint, and set in cement.
                    Another is Taylor’s or Jennings’s patent stoneware damp course, which being
                    pierced horizontally admits air to the space under the floor and thus ventilates
                    it.</p>
                <p>Where the ground would come against the walls of a basement story, it is
                    requisite, in order to keep them dry, either to form an open drain or area, or
                    to make what is called a dry area. This is done by building up against the soil
                    a thin wall of brickwork not less than 8 inches from the main wall, and either
                    straight or curved, and covering it over above the ground with stone or slate,
                    as in fig. 7. Thus any water coming through the thinner wall falls down, and is
                    conveyed away or soaks through the bottom. This thinner wall requires <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n512/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0512-0463"/> support from the main one, and the cavity has to
                    be ventilated,</p>
                <p>Besides the outer or main walls of a house, there are interior walls, or
                    partitions as they are called. Thes <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> in large
                    structures are always executed in brickwork; in smaller ones they are usually
                    constructed of timber; and these timbers are often filled in between the
                    uprights by brickwork formed of bricks laid fiat or on edge according to the
                    thickness of it. A plate of wood is occasionally introduced to strengthen the
                    work, which is then plastered over This is called a brick-nog partition. In many
                    of the model lodging-houses in London the partition walls have been constructed
                    a half brick in thickness in good mortar, for the whole height of the building,
                    the floor joists being fixed against them to steady them.</p>
                <p>Another sort of wall consists of two skins of brickwork with a few inches between
                    them; this is called a hollow wall. The two skins, either both of half a brick
                    thick, or the outer one of one brick and the inner one of half a brick, are tied
                    together by iron band-ties at various intervals. These when straight are
                    sometimes found to transmit the wet blown through the outer facing to the inner
                    one, so a bend or loop is formed in the centre of the tie, which throws off the
                    water. This hollow space tends to make the houses both dry and warm, but it is
                    said to form receptacles for insects, &lt;fcc. An addition to such walls has
                    been lately made by a series of these looped ties supporting a course of slates
                    placed not quite vertical but sloping back slightly. The next course of ties is
                    built in at such a level that it fixes the top of this first course of slate in
                    place, and provides a starting for the next course. Thus, in the heart of the
                    wall there is a continuous surface of slates, slightly overlapping at joists and
                    at beds, and so placed that whatever moisture blows through the outer skin is
                    not able to penetrate, but will trickle down the slates to the bottom of the
                    cavity in the hollow wall. This is one of the many building patents of Mr John
                    Taylor.</p>
                <p>A rod of brickwork will consume about 4500 bricks, though the number will be a
                    few more or less than this, as the bricks happen to be below or above the
                    average size, and as the joints are made thicker or thinner. The quantity of
                    mortar, it is evident, will be affected by the latter consideration also; but in
                    London it is generally reckoned at from ninety to a hundred striked bushels to
                    the rod, or from four to four and a half cart-loads, each containing about one
                    cubic yard. The labour on a rod of brickwork may be done on an average by a
                    labourer in four days; this, however, does not include making and turning the
                    mortar, nor scaffolding. Many things will, however, affect the time in which the
                    work may be performed, both of the bricklayer and his labourer; the former can
                    do or·.e-fourth as much more, at the least, in walls which are to be plastered,
                    as in those in which he has to keep the perpends and draw the joints, &amp;c.,
                    and more in thick walls than in thin ones; and the capability of the latter will
                    depend, inversely, on the rate at which the former can proceed, on the distance
                    he may have to carry the bricks and mortar to the foot of the ladder, and mainly
                    on the height he has to carry the materials up the ladder. In great heights,
                    however, the materials should be hoisted.</p>
                <p>Tiling being much less in vogue than formerly, in consequence of the better
                    appreciation of the superior qualities of slate for covering roofs, and the
                    moderate cost at which slates are now furnished to the builder, it no longer
                    maintains its separate artificer, but is performed, when it is required, by the
                    bricklayer. Tiling is for the most part of two sorts—plain tiling and pantiling.
                    Plain tiles are simple parallelograms, generally about 10⅛- inches in length, G
                    inches wide, and ∣ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> f an inch thick; and each tile
                    has a hole pierced through it near one end, to receive the oak pin by which it
                    is hooked to the lath. The tiles are laid in mortar and sometimes in hay, or
                    moss, on the laths, which in England are of oak or fir, with an overlap of 6, 7,
                    or 8 inches. The greatest overlap or smallest gauge makes the securest work,
                    though it does not present so good an appearance externally as a longer gauge
                    does; and it requires, moreover, a greater number of tiles and laths, thereby
                    adding materially both to the weight and the cost. The great overlap and the
                    mortar (or hay or moss) are both necessary to prevent the rain and snow from
                    driving in between and under the tiles, especially when of a low pitch. Plain
                    tiling requires the pitch of the roof to be at an angle of at least 50°, and is
                    one of the heaviest coverings that can be used, though it is at the same time
                    one of the warmest. The tiles, however, readily and rapidly absorb moisture,
                    which they communicate to the laths and rafters under them, to the serious
                    injury of both the latter; and the mortar in which they are set requires to be
                    frequently pointed, the constant atmospheric changes to which it is exposed
                    occasioning it to crumble and fall away in no long time. Terro-metallic tiles
                    are made with projections at the back to catch on the laths, in lieu of pegs.
                    Italian tiles have been made in England since about 1840, and are occasionally
                    used. They are slightly curved, fit easily one into another, and have a
                    horizontal indentation across the upper part to prevent the wind drifting the
                    rain over the head of the tile. They have either wide or narrow vertical rolls.
                    Taylor’s new roofing tiles have a plane surface with slightly turned up edges at
                    the sides, and a lump on the surface near the upper edge to prevent the upper
                    tile slipping. The cover tile is of a similar size and form. They are
                    recommended as half the weight of the common tiling; they are about as light as
                    slating, and may be laid to nearly as flat a pitch.</p>
                <p>Pantiles are parallelograms of irregular surface, straight in the direction of
                    their length, which is 13⅜ inches, but twisted in the transverse section.
                    Measuring the whole surface across, a tile is 9 inches wide, but in a right line
                    from point to point not more than 7, and its thickness is half an inch; a small
                    tongue or lip is bent down at one end from its flatter convexity, on the under
                    side, to hook it to the lath by, instead of a wooden pin through it, as in a
                    plain tile. Pantiles are set dry or in mortar, on laths. They are not laid side
                    by side, but overlap laterally as in 6g.</p>
                <p>8; consequently all the overlap they have longitudinally is 3 or 4 inches only,
                    or enough to prevent rain and snow from driving up under the upper, over the end
                    of the lower tile; and hence pantiling is but little more than half the weight
                    of plain tiling. It is, however, a much less warm covering for houses, and is
                    more liable to be injured by violent gales or gusts of wind than the latter is;
                    but again, it presents a far more pleasing appearance to the eye. Pantiling will
                    not bear a much flatter pitch than the other. It is greatly improved by being
                    pointed on the inside with lime and hair. Sometimes, indeed, the whole of the
                    work is, as we have said, set in mortar; but this mode has disadvantages to
                    which pointing internally is not liable, and its superiority in other respects
                    is questionable. In both pan and plain tiling large concave tiles are used to
                    cover the hips and ridges of a roof. These are not generally made to overlap
                    each other in any situation, but are set in mortar, and fastened with nails and
                    hooks fitted for the purpose, and driven into the woodwork of the roof. In
                    addition to these an ornamental ridging or cresting is often introduced. A
                    variety of patterns are now made for this purpose. Another form of <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0513-0464"/> pantile very useful for common purposes is the
                    Bridgewater tile; it is rather wider than the common tile and has a double roll,
                    being about 16∣ inches wide and 14 inches long.</p>
                <p>As plain tiling is heavier than slating, the plates and rafters of the roofs have
                    to be made stouter than is necessary for slates, consequently the expense of the
                    roofing is added to, supposing that the same thickness of wall be sufficient.
                    The tile also imbibes one-seventh part of its weight or about 5 oz. of water in
                    ten minutes, and takes many days to dry again thoroughly, this necessarily
                    tending to deteriorate the timbers.</p>
                <p>When the top of a brick wall is not protected by a roof, it must be covered or
                    coped in some manner, or it will soon be destroyed by the weather. Sometimes
                    this is done by means of a course of bricks set across it on their edges in
                    cement, and called a barge course, but it is a very imperfect covering, for
                    water will trickle down the face of the wall on both sides, as the coping brick
                    can be no longer than the thinnest wall is in thickness. Two double courses of
                    plain tiles may be put side by side under the barge course, making a projection
                    over each face of about 1⅜ inch, as shown in fig. 9. This is much better than
                    the barge course alone; but still the covering receives no inclination outwards
                    to throw the water off; the upper surfaces are all horizontal. The same
                    objection exists to foot-paving tiles, which are also used as a coping; but none
                    of these methods is available for any wall above 9 inches in thickness. Stone
                    coping, therefore, which may be made of sufficient width, and be both weathered
                    and throated, is much to be preferred. One of the greatest faults in the modern
                    practice of building, both architecturally as a matter of taste, and practically
                    as a matter of prudence, is, that these copings, and cornices which serve as
                    such, do not project sufficiently to protect the wall from the weather. A
                    massive and well-projected cornice on a wall serves as a roof or pent-house to
                    it; and, besides imparting great beauty to the plainest structure, protects the
                    wall from the premature decay of its upper part especially, and of the joints
                    generally, if it be unplastered brickwork, which thereby calls for the frequent
                    repetition of pointing. Effective and pleasing cornices and blocking-courses may
                    be formed with uncut bricks alone; and these, set in cement, would, with
                    judicious management, add materially both to the appearance and durability of
                    brickwork, without the foreign aid of either the plasterer or the mason. Figs.
                    10 and 11 show two of the approved modes of forming plain copings in brickwork
                    to garden and other walls.</p>
                <p>From the injury which accrues to the joints of brickwork through bad management
                    in its execution and imperfect protection when executed, arises the necessity,
                    so frequent at tho present day, of pointing. Sometimes frost will have
                    supervened before the surfaces of the joints in a wall are dry; consequently,
                    the mortar bursts and peels away, and the whole then requires to be pointed.
                    Preparatory to this operation the scaffold, if it has been struck, must be
                    re-erected, the mortar raked out of the joints to a depth of about ⅜ of an inch,
                    or deeper if the injury have reached further;—this can be done by a labourer;—a
                    bricklayer then goes over the whole with a hard hair brush and water to cleanse
                    and moisten the joints; and then, with mortar prepared for the purpose, he
                    carefully fills them all up, and neatly draws them with his trowel. This mortar
                    must be of the best quality; it is generally compounded with a certain
                    proportion of forge or smith’s ashes, which gives it a blue tinge, and adds
                    greatly to its power of resisting the action of the weather. Cement is sometimes
                    used instead of this blue mortar. If peculiar neatness be required, every joint
                    is marked with a narrow parallel ridge of a fine white putty, in the composition
                    of which bone-lime forms a principal ingredient. The former is called flatjoint,
                    and the latter tuck-pointing. If it be an old wall that requires pointing, a
                    scaffold must be erected before it; and where the putlocks cannot be rested on
                    window-sills and the like, half bricks are generally drawn from the wall to make
                    rests for them, and restored again when the work is done. The former process is
                    then gone through with a common wall; but if it require tuck-pointing, the whole
                    surface is well washed, and then coloured to look like new brickwork, before the
                    pointing is done. The gauged arches over the windows and doors are always
                    coloured, and the joints drawn with peculiar neatness. If in the original
                    building of the wall the perpends have not been preserved, that is, if the
                    vertical joints have not been made to fall perpendicularly in the alternately
                    recurring courses, the workman in pointing stops up the old joints, which are
                    irregular, with putty of a brick colour, and forms false new ones in the proper
                    places.</p>
                <p>Arches in brickwork are plain, rough-cut, or gauged. Plain arches are built of
                    uncut bricks, and the bricks being parallelopipeds, an arch built of them must
                    be made out with mortar; that is, the difference between the outer and inner
                    periphery of the arch requiring the parts of which an arch is made up to be
                    wedge-formed, as in fig. 12, which the brick is not, the difference must be made
                    in mortar, as in fig. 13, so that the inner or lower angles of bricks used for
                    this purpose should all but touch. The mortar should be more consistent than
                    that used in ordinary walling; and the centre on which an arch of this kind is
                    set or built should not be struck or removed until the work is thoroughly hard,
                    or rather all such arches should be set in cement which will harden immediately.
                    In consequence of this inherent defect in uncut-brick arches, in extensive
                    continuous works, such as sewers, tunnels, vaults, &lt;fcc., it is advisable to
                    make them in thin independent rings of half-brick or one-brick thick, as the
                    case may be; that is, a 9-inch arch should be in two half-brick arches, as at σ,
                    fig. 6, Plate XX., and an 18-inch arch in two one-bricks, as at δ, each arch in
                    the latter case being bonded in itself as in a common 9-inch wall with headers
                    and stretchers. It is evident that, by this mode of structure, a greater
                    quantity of the solid material comes into the back or outer ring or arch than
                    into the lower one; and if they had been bonded together into one arch, as at c,
                    all that difference must have been made up with mortar. Moreover, whatever
                    pressure comes on the outer ring is carried by it directly to the inner or
                    lower, from whose joints, however, the mortar cannot escape or be pressed out,
                    the inner angles of the bricks, by meeting, preventing it below, and the bricks
                    of the upper arch, which conveys the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n514/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0514-0465"/> pressure, are themselves opposed to the back of
                    the same joints, so that its power of resistance is made equal to that of the
                    bricks themselves, except at the ends; which, in such works as we have supposed,
                    are remote, and may be protected by the use of cement in their joints, whilst
                    mortar is used in the rest. Rough arches are those in which the bricks are
                    roughly cut with an axe to a wedge form, and are used over openings, such as
                    doors and windows, wheu the work is to be plastered on the outside, or in plain
                    back fronts, outhouses, garden-walls, &amp;c., when, however, they are neatly
                    pointed with what is called a tuck or tucked joint. Semicircular and elliptical
                    arches are generally made plain, or without cutting the bricks; but arches
                    composed of a smaller segment of a circle (vulgarly and technically called <hi
                    rend="italic">scheme</hi> arches), if not gauged, are cut or axed. Very flat
                    arches are distinguished by the term camber, from the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >cambrer,</hi> to round like an arch. It is arches of this kind which are
                    generally employed over windows and doors in external work, and they too are
                    either cut or gauged. Gauged arches are composed of bricks which are cut and
                    rubbed to gauges and moulds, so as to form perfectly fitting parts, as in
                    masonry. Gauging is equally applicable to arches and to walling, as it means no
                    more than the bringing every brick exactly to a certain form, by cutting and
                    rubbing, or grinding it to a certain gauge or measure, so that it will exactly
                    fit into its place, as in the finer works of masonry. Gauged brickwork is set in
                    a putty instead of common mortar, but it is seldom used except for arches in the
                    fronts of houses, &amp;c., which are to be neatly finished. These are for the
                    most part straight, and are generally from 11 to 12 inches in depth, or the
                    height of four courses of brickwork. Their value as arches will be best
                    understood by reference to the diagram, fig. 7, Plate XX., by which it appears
                    that all the material between the soffit of the straight arch or head of the
                    opening <hi rend="italic">b c,</hi> and the dotted line <hi rend="italic">b f
                    c,</hi> is useless, the intrados or soffit of the really efficient part of the
                    arch being at that dotted line itself. This is the arc of an angle of 60°,—its
                    chord, the width of the opening, being the base of an equilateral triangle
                    constructed on it, and the joints are the radii of a circle whose centre is at
                    <hi rend="italic">a. b d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c e,</hi> the continuations
                    of the sides of the triangle or radii <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">a c,</hi> are technically termed the skew-back of the arch.
                    Sometimes the arc is made under a more acute angle, in which case the skew-back
                    is less, that is, the external angles <hi rend="italic">c</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >b d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b c</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi> are less
                    obtuse; a smaller unavailable portion of the arch is thus left between the arc
                    and its chord, but that portion is less securely retained under the flatter
                    segment, because the joints or radii diverge less, or are more nearly parallel.
                    These gauged arches being, as they for the most part are, but a half brick in
                    thickness, and not being tied by a bond to anything behind them—for, indeed,
                    almost the whole, if not the whole, of their height is occupied behind by the
                    reveal and the wooden lintel— require to be executed with great care and nicety.
                    It is a common fault with workmen to rub the bricks thinner behind than before,
                    to insure a very fine joint in front. This tends to make the work bow outwards;
                    it should rather be inverted, if it be done at all, though the best work is that
                    in which the bricks are gauged to exactly the same thickness throughout. The
                    same fault occurs when a gauged arch is inserted in an old wall, on account of
                    the difficulty of filling up with cement the space behind the bricks. Fig. 8,
                    Plate XX. is a transverse section of fig. 7, and the gauged arch, lintel,
                    &amp;c., in it show the total disconnection of the gauged arch with any
                    surrounding brickwork to which it might be bonded. The absurdity of constructing
                    arches circular on plan, especially in a thin unbonded shell of bricks, is so
                    clear as hardly to require notice.</p>
                <p>It is generally held that nothing but its own components should be admitted into
                    a brick wall, except what is absolutely necessary for its connection with the
                    other parts of a building, such as wall-plates and wood-bricks (and that these
                    should be avoided as much as possible), templets, lintels, &amp;c. Wall-plates
                    are applied to receive the ends of the joists, and distribute the weight of the
                    floor to which they belong equably along the walls. If the joists tailed singly
                    on the naked bricks, their thin edges would crush those immediately under them,
                    and the rest of the brickwork would escape immediate pressure altogether.
                    Wall-plates may be avoided by the use of framed floors, which are carried by a
                    few large beams, under whose ends stout pieces of timber or stone, 2 or 3 feet
                    in length, are placed. These supports are intended, like a wall-plate, to
                    distribute the weight over a considerable part of the wall, and prevent the
                    necessity of placing the beam on the naked friable bricks, and are called
                    templates. As bond timbers and wood-plates are now interdicted by the Buildings
                    Act in London, the joists have to be tenoned into trimming joists carried by
                    brick, stone, or iron corbels. Lintels are used over square-headed windows and
                    doors, instead of arches in brickwork. They are useful to preserve the square
                    form and receive the joiner’s fittings, but they should always have discharging
                    arches over them, and should not tail into the wall at either end more than a
                    few inches, that the discharging arch be not wider than is absolutely necessary.
                    Fig. 9, Plate XX., indicates the elevation of the inside of part of an external
                    wall with a window in it, and shows the lintel over the opening with a
                    discharging arch over it, and wood-bricks under its ends, on the jambs of the
                    opening. Discharging arches should be turned over the ends of beams, and
                    templets also, as in fig. 10. They may generally be quadrants of a circle or
                    even flatter, and should be turned in two or more half bricks over doors and
                    windows, and other wide openings, but over the ends of beams they need not be in
                    more than one half brick. Wood-bricks are used to prevent the necessity of
                    driving wedges into the joints of brickwork to nail the joiner’s work to. They
                    are pieces of timber generally cut to the size and shape of a brick, or portion
                    of one, and worked in as bricks in the inner face of a wall, where it is known
                    the joiners have occasion for something of the kind. This is principally in the
                    jambs of the windows and doors for their fittings, and along the walls, at
                    proper heights, for the skirtings or wainscotting, as the case may be. The use
                    of bond timbers in brick walls is objectionable because of their liability to
                    shrink and swell, to decay, and to be set on fire; and in England the use of
                    timber in walls has, since the extension of the manufacture of iron in these
                    countries, been in a great degree superseded by that metal in the form known as
                    hoop iron. Thin and narrow strips of this metal are laid in the bed joints of
                    mortar, at intervals more or less frequent according to the nature and character
                    of the work, with the best effect in respect of compactness and consequent
                    strength. An improvement on the straight band has been introduced by Mr Tyerman,
                    whereby a notch is made and the tongue bent down, which coming at each hollow of
                    the bricks tends to afford a better hold on the mortar.</p>
                <p>It will be generally found that a brick wall built with mortar and faced with
                    ashlar has settled inward to a less or greater extent, as the work has been more
                    or less carefully performed. Indeed, in the nature of things it cannot be
                    otherwise, unless the brick backing be worked in some cement which sets and
                    hardens at once; for the outer face is composed of a layer of unyielding
                    material, with few and very thin joints, which p erhaps do not occupy a fiftieth
                    part of its height, while the back is built up of an infinity of small parts,
                    with fully one-eighth its height <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n515/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0515-0466"/> of joints, which are composed of material that
                    must both yield to pressure and shrink in drying. Some part of the ill effect
                    attendant on this is obviated by the bond-stones, which tail in or run through
                    the wall, and tendito keep the discordant materials together; but still much of
                    it remains. And besides this, the internal or cross walls, which have no stone
                    in them, will either settle down and shrink away from the external walls, or
                    drag them inward, as they happen to be well or ill bonded or tied. For these
                    reasons, brickwork built in this manner with masonry should be executed with
                    exceedingly well-tempered mortar, made with no more lime than is absolutely
                    necessary to cement the particles of sand together, and the sand again to the
                    bricks, worked as stiff as it can be, and laid in as thin courses as may be to
                    answer the purpose required of it. Above all, work of this kind must not be
                    hurried, but allowed time to dry and shrink as it goes on. In some-large
                    edifices the brickwork is carried up and completed, and after a sufficient time
                    has elapsed for the work to have settled, the ashlaring is carried up and worked
                    in with the bond stones set in the brickwork for the purpose.</p>
                <p>Discharging arches over vacuities having been disposed of incidentally, we have
                    now only to speak of them under openings, in which situation their use is to
                    distribute the superincumbent weight equally over the substructure, or along the
                    foundation as the case may be. For this purpose the arch is inverted, as shown
                    in fig. 4, Plate XXI.; and by means of it the weight brought down by the piers
                    is carried along the footings, which are thus equally borne upon throughout
                    their whole length. Arches of two half bricks are indicated here, that being
                    sufficient for ordinary purposes, and to develop the principle; in large and
                    heavy works, arches of three half bricks, and even greater may be judged
                    necessary. Any arc between a quadrant and a semicircle may be used with
                    advantage; but an arc of less than 45° cannot be recommended for the inverted
                    discharging arch under piers. Arches require abutments whether they are-erect or
                    inverted; this is often forgotten when inverted arches are used.</p>
                <p>Not the least important part of the bricklayer’s art is the formation of chimney
                    and other flues. Great tact is required in gathering-over properly above the
                    fire-place, so as to conduct the smoke into the smaller flue, which itself
                    requires to be built with, great care and precision, that it be not of various
                    capacity in different parts, in one place contracted to a narrow straight, and
                    in another more widely expanded, and so on. There is now often introduced at the
                    level of the mantel, a plate with an opening in it through which the smoke
                    ascends. This, which is called a chimney-hopper or chimney lintel, is very
                    useful not only to ensure the proper gathering of the flue, as the brickwork of
                    the flue is formed at once upon it, but as a substitute for the usual register,
                    and it also renders needless the usual iron chimney bar required to support the
                    breast. It is absolutely necessary that flues be of a certain magnitude, but the
                    bore should be regulated by the size of the fireplace, or rather by the quantity
                    of smoke to which it is required to give vent. For large kitchen fires it is
                    considered best to have two flues.</p>
                <p>Practical men differ as to whether a tapering flue, or an enlarging flue is best
                    for carrying away smoke. They are usually made of one size throughout. Of late
                    years cylindrical earthenware tubes have been used with advantage. and of a
                    smaller bore than the common 9-inch by 14-inch capacity. With glazed tubes it
                    has been found that the soot falls down with thunderclaps and other strong
                    vibrations. Flues of brick are plastered or pargetted with a mortar in which „a
                    certain proportion of cow-dung is mixed, which prevents it from cracking and
                    peeling <hi rend="italic">off</hi> with the heat to which it is exposed. The
                    part brought out into the room from the wall, and over the opening, is called
                    the breast. The flooring in the opening is called the hearth, fig. 8, Plate
                    XXI.; it is set on the bricks or stones of the wall, and is usually of stone,
                    although cement and iron plate are sometimes used. The slab is that part of the
                    floor of a room which is immediately before the fire-place, and along the extent
                    of its front. In basement rooms, this slab is supported by a brick wall brought
                    up from the ground; but in upper rooms the slab is supported by a flat half
                    brick arch called a brick trimmer, which is turned from the chimney breast under
                    the hearth on one side to the trimmer joist on the other, which is generally
                    made somewhat thicker than the other joists for this purpose. The chimney-piece
                    which comes in front is fixed by the mason after the carpenter’s work is
                    done.</p>
                <p>The plate above mentioned assists in ensuring a proper draught to the flue, and
                    preventing a smoky chimney. These are frequently caused by want of sufficient
                    air to feed the fire, which must be supplied from the room itself or by a tube
                    brought from the outside of the building. Another cause of smoke is too short a
                    funnel, especially if the flue be a large one, as formerly built for sweeping by
                    boys. Every fire-place must have its own flue. Other causes are—one fire
                    overpowering the other, when there are two in one large room, or two rooms
                    communicating by a doorway, or when the tops of chimneys are commanded by higher
                    buildings, or by a hill, so that the wind sometimes blows almost perpendicularly
                    into the tops of the chimneys that lie in its way and beats down the smoke. A
                    down draught is usually produced by the difference of the external atmosphere
                    from that in the room; this often brings down the smoke of a neighbouring
                    chimney; it can occasionally be obviated by raising one of them, or by fixing on
                    it one of the exhausting pots now manufactured for the purpose. The bad
                    construction of fire-places is another cause of smoky chimneys, the throat being
                    too large for the fire. We shall not attempt to describe the many patent and
                    other inventions submitted for curing these nuisances, but what is known as
                    Billings’s terminal must be excepted. It consists of a low conical top about a
                    foot high, placed on the flue, and screened on each side by a terra-cotta
                    baffler, rising somewhat higher than the pot; the wind striking the former is
                    thrown upwards and assists in extracting the smoke; the latter prevents the
                    smoke of one flue being blown down the adjoining ones in the same stack. The
                    common terra-cotta pot with louvre sides is also useful and ornamental.</p>
                <p>Brick and tile paving is performed by the bricklayer. Brick-paving is either flat
                    or on edge, in sand or in mortar or cement. Brick flat-paving in sand, that is,
                    with the bricks laid on their broadest surfaces, and bedded in and on dry sand,
                    is very slight and fragile, and brick flat-paving set and bedded in mortar is
                    very little better; for if the soil on which the paving is laid be light and
                    sandy, the bricks are easily displaced by being pressed unequally; and if it be
                    clayey it will probably be moist, and the thin porous brick absorbing the
                    moisture, will generally become saturated, and present a damp unwholesome floor.
                    Paving with bricks on their edges, however, forms a much better floor, and is
                    preferable to a stone paving, if the latter be laid on the ground without the
                    intervention of footings. Brick-on-edge paving in sand is generally used in beer
                    cellars, pantries, dairies, stables, &amp;c., as its numerous open joints allow
                    wasted or discharged fluids readily to escape; and it is both cool and dry under
                    ordinary circumstances. In mortar or cement, bricks on their edges form a sound,
                    dry floor; the smallness of the surface exposed by each brick in this manner
                    leaves them, of course, less susceptible of partial pressures, and the depth
                    from the soil to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n518/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0518-0467"/> surface is such that damp rarely shows through.
                    The paving brick differs from the common brick only in thickness, its dimension
                    in that direction being rather less than 2 inches, instead of 2∣ inches, and in
                    being rather harder and more compact.</p>
                <p>Dutch clinkers are paving bricks, smaller and much harder than the English, and
                    of a light yellow colour; they are 6 inches long, 3 inches wide, and 1⅜ inch
                    thick, and are always set on edge and herring-boned, that is, instead of being
                    placed in parallel lines, they are set at right angles to each other, as in fig.
                    14, yet with a perfectly even face. Paving tiles are made 9⅜ inches and 1l⅜
                    inches square, though they are called 10-inch and 12-inch or foot tiles
                    respectively, the former being 1 inch, and the latter 1⅜ inch thick; they are
                    set in courses, as stone paving would be, the alternating courses breaking
                    joint. A sort of tiles called terro-metalĭic are manufactured for stabling and
                    similar purposes.</p>
                <p>Here may be mentioned the extended manufacture of ornamental tiles. The tiles
                    formed in intaglio and enamelled, similar to those used by the Moors in Spain,
                    have enabled the architect to break through the monotonous surface of brick
                    buildings, and to introduce ornamental forms and colour without the necessity of
                    resorting to plaster and stucco. From the geological position of London and many
                    other towns, bricks must always be the prevailing material for building
                    purposes; such means, therefore, for the safe introduction of colour and
                    ornament are especially desirable and should be carefully studied. With this,
                    too, has come the extended use of ornamental brickwork by the introduction of
                    moulded bricks of all forms, and of many colours, together with a material of a
                    like nature, by which decorative work of a more ornamental character can be
                    obtained, namely terra-cotta, or prepared clay moulded or wrought and then burnt
                    in a kiln. Tiles as above referred to are made for mosaic and tesselated
                    pavements in plain colours (some being enamelled), for halls, footways of
                    landings, conservatories, &lt;fcc., also glazed tiles for hearths, and white and
                    toned tiles, with the encaustic tiles of many colours, for walls. The former are
                    manufactured of all sizes, so that by the combination of certain forms and
                    colours an endless variety of patterns are obtainable. For pavements they
                    require to be carefully set in cement on concrete, and in cement on walls.</p>
                <p>Sewers and drains which are not cylindrical should be built with concave bottoms;
                    this keeps the stream more together, and enables it the better to carry its
                    impurities along with it, whereas a flat-bottomed drain offers a large surface
                    for the particles of soil to attach themselves to, and the stream of water being
                    more scattered is less efficient in force. Drains near houses, and in other
                    places where it may be necessary to open them at any time, may be of the form of
                    which <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 1, Plate XXI. is a section, with a flat
                    covering of stone paving, or large paving tiles, set and jointed with cement.
                    Gun-barrel drains, of 9-inch or 12-inch diameter, as at <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> are the best in exposed situations, because they are the strongest; but
                    as there is no mode of cleaning, if they are too long to be raked, but by
                    breaking them up, they should not be employed except, with a considerable fall
                    and a frequent or constant stream of water through them, as from a pump trough,
                    rain-water trunks, &amp;c. They are constructed on a barrelled centre of wood,
                    which tlιe bricklayer drags on as he advances with his work, finishing as ho
                    goes. No drain should have an inclination or fall of less than one-quarter of an
                    inch to a foot; and where the stream is infrequent and dull, as much more would
                    bo a great advantage. Large sewers, which are accessible from the ends, or from
                    side entrances, for men to clear or remove any accidental obstructions, are best
                    made circular, elliptical, or egg-shaped, as in fig. 15. The last two shapes are
                    gen ally preferred, because in proportion to the capacity the height is
                    greater.</p>
                <p>The form in fig. 15 maintains the greatest possible depth with a small quantity
                    of fluid, and combines this qualification with those of great strength to resist
                    external pressure and large capacity with a given amount of materials. The form
                    shown at c, fig. 1, Plate XXL, is now disused, though it was long advocated for
                    sound workmanship and regular joints. A rate of fall of 1 in 120, or 1 inch in
                    10 feet, is desirable, although less will suffice for a main sewer.</p>
                <p>Pipes or hollow cylinders of well-made and well-burnt glazed stoneware form the
                    most efficient house-drains. Such pipes are put together with great accuracy
                    with sockets, so as to fit spigot and faucet fashion; movable tops are provided
                    so as to give access to them at any part required, without taking up and
                    relaying the drain from one or other of its ends, as was so often the case with
                    the old brick drain, Proper bends, junctions, syphons, &lt;fcc., are also made
                    of the same material. In using pipes for drains, it should be borne in mind that
                    a little larger than large enough is better than the reverse of this. No pipes
                    should be laid down for a house-drain of less bore than 6 inches, nor should
                    earthenware be used for drains requiring a greater bore than 12 inches; the
                    material is too weak to allow of more, and the material is not strong enough to
                    stand more than a dead pressure. Glazed stoneware pipes are also employed for
                    small sewers in side streets, or to take off the collected soil and water from a
                    short row of houses into the main brick sewer, and thence to a watercourse or to
                    a reservoir of a main drainage scheme.</p>
                <p>In building drains it is of great importance that proper traps should be
                    constructed to prevent the ascent of foul air and the passage of vermin. At
                    every sink there should be a bell-trap, and a well-trap within that, or near the
                    hither end of the drain. Suppose a drain leading from a kitchen or scullery to
                    the common drain of the house, in which it meets that which may come from the
                    water-closet and other places. The bell-trap in the sink itself will prevent the
                    return of smell when it is constantly in use, but it is liable to be left out,
                    broken, or otherwise injured, or it may become dry by evaporation; it is,
                    therefore, necessary to have a trap not so liable to such ordinary
                    contingencies. Let a well be made 18 inches or 2 feet in diameter, square or
                    round, and 2 feet 6 inches or 3 feet deep, across and below the level of the
                    drain, as shown in plan, fig. 2, Plate XXL, and in longitudinal section, fig. 3;
                    it must be built around with brick in cement, and be plastered on the inside
                    with the same material, which will make it capable of retaining fluids.
                    Uprightly across this well, and in the transverse direction of the drain, must
                    be placed a sound piece of paving stone, so long that its ends may be inserted
                    in the sides of the well, as shown in fig. 12, and so wide that its upper edge
                    shall touch the covering of the drain, and that its lower may reach 6 or 9
                    inches down into the well below the bottom of the drain. Mortar or cement must
                    prevent the passage of air between the upper edge of this trap-stone and the
                    cover of the well and drain, and the trap is complete. The water coming from the
                    sink flows along the drain from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> (fig. 3), where it falls into the well, and filling it up to that level
                    it flows on again from <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in the direction of <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> to the cess-pool or common sewer from which, however, no
                    smell can return; for the trap-stone <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0519-0468"/><hi rend="italic">e,</hi> the lower half of which
                    is thus immersed in water, completely bars the passage. It is evident, however,
                    that if the well should leak the water in it may fall below the lower edge of
                    the stone, and the efficiency of the trap be destroyed; but if it be made
                    perfect in the first instance, there can be no danger of any inconvenience that
                    a bucket of water thrown into the sink will not cure. It is from the drying up
                    of the fluid in water-traps that uninhabited houses are so frequently offensive.
                    These well-traps form an effectual bar to vermin, and they may, therefore, be
                    advantageously placed at the entrance of water-closet drains, to prevent rats
                    from getting at the soil-pipes, which they will gnaw and destroy if they can get
                    access to them. Internal drains, or those which go through a house, should
                    always pass under the doorways if possible, in external walls at least. If,
                    however, circumstances should render it absolutely necessary that a drain be
                    taken through a wall, an arched ring or bull’s eye should be made for it to pass
                    by</p>
                <p>All the traps to the drains should be ventilated, as well as the head of the
                    drain itself, by a tube carried up to the top of the house, and away from any
                    opening where the foul air could be blown into any of the rooms. The sewers
                    should also be ventilated, if not by the gully or side gratings, then by a
                    grating placed over them in the centre of the roadway There have been numerous
                    suggestions for ventilating shafts in the lines of main drainage, but nothing
                    beyond a tall lamp-post has been carried out, and no doubt this is
                    sufficient.</p>
                <p>In* country houses where the drainage is used for manure to the gardens or land,
                    the drain from the closets may be led into a brick or iron tank or cesspool, the
                    surplus water being carried off by an overflow drain. Cesspools are strongest if
                    made cylindrical, and should be bricked round and domed at the top, with a
                    manhole in it for access, which should be fitted with a stone, having a ring in
                    it by which the stone can be raised. But whether they are made to retain fluids
                    or not is not a matter of consequence, if they be placed in a secluded
                    situation, where, if the object be not to get rid of the waste, there is seldom,
                    at least, any desire to retain it. In towns and cities where the common sewering
                    is as complete as it ought to be, and water-closets are used insteaα of privies,
                    cesspools are unnecessary, as the soil becomes so much diluted by the water that
                    goes down with it, that it flows readily enough through the private drains to
                    the common sewer, and so on with the rest, to the common receptacle. Sometimes,
                    indeed, it may be found necessary to clean out the well-traps before described,
                    but this cannot often occur. Galvanized tanks are occasionally used in some
                    parts of the country, with pumps attached, by which the sewage can be rendered
                    available r the garden. Earth closets on Dr Moule’s system, or the
                    cinder-sifting ash closets, are valuable for preventing the waste of an
                    important manure. For workmen’s cottages in large towns and villages they must
                    be of great service, but whether they are adapted to a town house, or are
                    applicable on an extensive scale for the relief of town drainage, is a question
                    which still remains unsolved.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mason-Work.</hi></p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">mason</hi> is derived directly from the French <hi
                    rend="italic">maçon,</hi> which signifies indifferently a bricklayer or mason.
                    Du Cange attributes the origin of the word to the low Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >maceria,</hi> a wall; but a more probable derivation is that from the old
                    German <hi rend="italic">τneizan,</hi> to cut. Among ourselves, at present, we
                    reckon three sorts of artificers— rubble or rag-stone masons, freestone masons,
                    and marble masons. This last branch, however, is rather that of the carver or
                    statuary. The art of working or reducing stone to the proper shape for the mason
                    to <hi rend="italic">set, i.e.,</hi> to place them in the walls, &lt;fcc., has
                    generally been called <hi rend="italic">stone-cutting,</hi> and depends very
                    much on the nature of the stone for its details. <hi rend="italic">Stone
                    masonry</hi> is the art of building in stone.</p>
                <p>The mason’s tools consist of a handsaw, for cutting soft stones; a drag, which is
                    a flat piece of iron wherewith to finish its surface; chisels and gouges for
                    forming mould ings, gauges and moulds for sinking them to the proper foims; a
                    mallet, chisels, tools, and points for working the harder stones; a level, a
                    plumb-rule, a square, a bevel, with rules of various sorts wherewith to try the
                    surfaces in the progressive stages of the work. Granite is brought to a face by
                    the scabbling hammer or granite axe, and the operation is called nidging. In
                    rubbed work a surface is obtained by smoothing it with sand or gritstone.
                    Marbles are polished by being rubbed with the gritston then with pumice-stone,
                    and lastly with emery powder.</p>
                <p>Rubble walls are scaffolded with single, and ashlar-fronted or other gauged stone
                    walls with double-fronted scaffolding,—the former tailing one end of the
                    putlocks in the wall, and the other having an inner row of standard poles, and
                    ledgers parallel to the outer, making the scaffold entirely independent of the
                    wall. In some places, however, it is the custom to dispense altogether with an
                    external scaffold in building stone walls, particularly with gauged stones. With
                    light and plain work this may be done without much inconvenience or retardation;
                    but if the work be heavy or delicate, considerable delay and incorrectness
                    result. Sometimes the finer work, such as that to mouldings, flutes, and foliate
                    or other enrichments, is merely boasted or roughed out before the stones are
                    set, and finished afterwards, but this can be done well only from a secure floor
                    or scaffold on which the workman may feel he can move freely and surely. For
                    large and elaborately decorated structures, such as a public building, a
                    mechanical scaffolding has to be erected, by which some economy is effected
                    through diminishing labour, or some emergencies met attendant on the works
                    themselves. Where the face of a stone is worked in the shop and may have some
                    weeks or months labour on it, it becomes a valuable work worth careful handling.
                    Hence the old-fashioned kind of scaffolding, of poles and ropes, has been much
                    superseded by the so-called whole timber or framed scaffold, with its tramway
                    and crab engines aloft. It is usually formed by laying square timbers on the
                    ground to receive similar uprights, which are secured by iron ties to it; on the
                    heads of these are placed horizontal timbers, which are also secured to the
                    uprights, and the whole is kept from changing position by timber struts and
                    braces. On these another range may be erected, and so on to the required height.
                    Tramways are placed on it, and a travelling crane, worked by hand labour or by
                    steam, raises the neavy weights, carries them to their places, and at once
                    deposits them in the work with great ease. By the use of a steam-lift, with a
                    long arm to reach many feet above it, on the first stage of the frame scaffold,
                    no other scaffold is necessary except a slight one for the use of the workmen to
                    set the stone. The clock tower at the Houses of Parliament was built by a
                    scaffold formed of two timbers, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n520/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0520-0469"/> each <hi rend="italic">2</hi> feet 3 inches deep
                    and 14 inches wide, running across from side to side, on which rails were fixed
                    to carry a travelling platform of the whole width which went the reverse way. To
                    one side of the first named timbers was suspended a platform which carried the
                    machinery for raising the materials from the bottom up the central shaft; they
                    were then raised on to the traveller which carried them at once to the required
                    spot for fixing. When a certain height of work had been done, the huge timbers
                    were raised by six screw-jacks working together, and rested on the new wall, the
                    jacks being removed and prepared for another raising when necessary. The
                    Victoria Tower was erected on a somewhat similar principle, but having two
                    travellers working upon a circular tramway on a strong trussed framing, the ends
                    of each secured to a central drum. To raise the materials a strong under-trussed
                    parallel framing was formed on one side, which brought them up on the outside of
                    the tower.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stones used in Building.—</hi> It may be useful to give a list
                    of the stones principally used in building, according to their geological
                    formation, with some practical remarks upon each.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">igneous rocks</hi> of <hi rend="italic">volcanic</hi>
                    origin, the varieties which are used on the continent of Europe are those light
                    stones called tufa and pumice, and the stone called peperino. The two former
                    were extensively employed by the Romans in the filling in of vaulting, on
                    account of their great lightness. The latter stone, which is obtained in large
                    quantities near Rome, was used by that people extensively, particularly for
                    substructures, being obtained in large blocks. Of the second division of igneous
                    rocks, the <hi rend="italic">trappean,</hi> porphyry and serpentine have been
                    used, but chiefly as ornamental coloured stones, and have been generally classed
                    as marbles. Of the third division, the <hi rend="italic">supersilicated</hi>
                    rocks, granite alone is now extensively employed, not only in engineering works,
                    but in public buildings and dwellings. It is got from the quarries by splitting
                    the blocks with wedges, and is so hard that it cannot be cut by any ordinary
                    saws. It has to be worked first with large hammers, and then reduced by pointed
                    chisels, and consequently is very expensive in building. Machinery is used very
                    largely in cutting and also in polishing it. Some very good specimens come from
                    Cornwall and Devonshire, but by far the best are from Dundee and Aberdeen. A
                    variety of the latter, called Peterhead granite, is only to be equalled by the
                    finest Oriental granites. The Kingstown granite from near Dublin is much used
                    locally.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">the aqueous rocks, mechanically formed,</hi> and of the <hi
                    rend="italic">arenaceous</hi> varieties, gravel is used for concrete, and sand
                    in making mortar. Sandstones and gritstones are very extensively used. These are
                    either laminated, as the York stone, used generally for paving, as it can
                    readily be split into large surfaces of small relative thickness, or compact, as
                    Old Red Sandstones, which stand very well internally, but perish sadly with the
                    weather, as may be seen at Chester Cathedral. The New Sandstones, the best of
                    which is the Calverley stone got near Tunbridge Wells, are easily quarried, but
                    if sawn, the wet saw and sand must be used. The finer grained compact
                    sandstones, which are comparatively free from iron, and form very good
                    building-stones, are very numerous. Such are the Bramley Fall, used for bridge
                    copings, plinths, &amp;c.; the Park ≡, Eiland Edge, Whitby, and others, all in
                    Yorkshire; the gton in Staffordshire; the Mansfield in Nottinghamshire; and the
                    Minera quarries at Wrexham. A bed of the last is much used at Chester and
                    Liverpool for building purposes, and it has just been introduced into the London
                    market, for which city it is thought it will be very eligible, on account of its
                    lasting qualities; it has been also used at the National Safe Deposit Company’s
                    offices in London. Scotland can boast of some of the finest quarries of
                    sandstone, the best, perhaps, being the Craigleith, much used at Edinburgh. The
                    College, courts of law, Register House, Customhouse, Royal Exchange, National
                    Monument, and many churches and private residences there, are built of this
                    excellent material, which has also been extensively exported to Hamburg, Altona,
                    Gothenburg, and other places. Humbie stone has also been much used, both at
                    Edinburgh and at Glasgow, where it forms the Royal Exchange and Royal Bank; it
                    is easier to work than Craigleith. Glamis is also a fine sandstone; the castle
                    there, as well as those at Inver&lt;juharity and Cortachy, and Lindertis House,
                    are built of this material. In Fifeshire, at Cullalo, are quarries whence the
                    stones τ° <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi> t <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="superscript"> onu</hi> ≡ <hi

                    Nelson at Yarmouth, were obtained. In addition to beauty and durability, these
                    stones have the merit of being capable of receiving the finest and smoothest
                    forms from the chisel of the workman. Another class of sandstones are commonly
                    called <hi rend="italic">firestones,</hi> as they endure the action of fire
                    better than most others. Of these the best known is the Reigate stone, which is
                    the principal material used at Windsor Castle, Hampton Court, and in many old
                    buildings round London. The Minera stone already mentioned is another.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">mechanically-formed aqueous stones</hi> classed as <hi
                    rend="italic">argillaceous,</hi> the Clunch only is used in building. It may be
                    seen in Ely and Peterborough cathedrals, and many other mediaeval buildings, and
                    is a beautiful material for interior carved work, but will not stand the
                    weather.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">aqueous stones</hi> classed as <hi rend="italic"
                    >chemically formed,</hi> there is none of note but the Travertine, or, properly
                    speaking, Tiburtine. This is a coarse grained stone, of warm colour, found in
                    large blocks, and extensively used at Rome, both in ancient and modem buildings,
                    of which the cathedral of St Peter’s may be cited as an instance, but it is
                    unknown in England.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">aqueous rocks, organically derived,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">calcareous</hi> claim principal attention. The chief of these are
                    the <hi rend="italic">limestones,</hi> which are classed as compact, magnesian,
                    or oolitic limestones. Of the first, the best, in the south of England, is that
                    called Chilmark, of which Salisbury Cathedral and Wilton Abbey, and many other
                    fine buildings, have been erected. In the Midland counties the Tottenhoβ stone,
                    of which Dunstable Priory, Woburn Abbey, Luton church, &amp;c., are built, is an
                    excellent stone. There is also a stone of high quality got at Hopton Wood, near
                    Worksworth in Derbyshire, used at Chatsworth, Belvoir, Drayton Manor, &amp;c.
                    Ancaster stone, near Sleaford in Lincolnshire, has been used for a number of
                    years; also Ham Hill, near Yeovil, in Somersetshire. Of magnesian limestones we
                    may name the Anston and Bolsover Moor stones, used formerly at Southwell
                    Minster, and lately at the Houses of Parliament; the Tadcaster stones, used at
                    York, Beverley, and Ripon Minsters, and very many other buildings; the Roche
                    Abbey, used at the building of that name, and very many other churches in Y
                    ork-shire and Lincolnshire; the Brodsworth, near Doncaster; and the Huddlestone,
                    near Sherburne in Yorkshire. These stones contain a great deal of carbonate of
                    magnesia, from which they take their name, are of beautiful texture, and stand
                    well in the country as building stones, but fail in London.</p>
                <p>A very excellent limestone for rough walling, especially for Gothic work, is that
                    called Kentish Rag. 11 is found in large quantities in the neighbourhood of
                    Maidstone; it is very hard, and is worked with large hammers instead of the saw.
                    Jambs, strings, and mouldings are sometimes worked of it, but the hardness makes
                    the work expensive; these, as well as the quoin stones and dressings, are
                    therefore formed of Caen or Bath or other local stones. Kentish Rag does not
                    answer for interior work.</p>
                <p>The most important subdivision of the limestones used in masonry is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oolitic.</hi> They are so called because they resemble, when
                    broken, a conglomerate of globular eggs; they are also named roestones, from
                    their resemblance to what is called the hard roe of a fish. Very good examples
                    of these are the Barnack stone from Northamptonshire, of which Peterborough
                    Cathedral, Croyland Abbey, Burleigh House, &amp;c., are erected, and the Ketton
                    stone, used at most of the colleges in Cambridge, and at Bury St Edmunds,
                    Bedford, Stamford, Doulting in Somersetshire, and at Wells Cathedral and
                    surrounding churches. But the principal English oolites used in masonry are the
                    Bath and the Portland. The former, as its name imports, is found in the
                    neighbourhood of Bath. The chief quarries are the Box Hill, Combe Down, Farleigh
                    Down, and Corsham Down; all these quarries vary in quality at different depths.
                    The Corsham Down is said to produce the finest in quality, and the Box Ground
                    stone to be the hardest; but everything in the use of this stone depends on the
                    bed selected. Large quantities of a similar stone are imported from Caen, in
                    Normandy. This is more compact in texture than Bath, and therefore fitter for
                    carving, but does not appear to stand our climate so well. The best variety of
                    this stone is said to be the D·’Aubigny stone. Almost all these oolites can be
                    sawn with a common dry saw, which saves a great deal in the labour of
                    conversion. But, without doubt, the best of all this class of stones is that
                    from the Island of Portland; for beauty of texture, and for durability, it
                    perhaps exceeds any stone in the world. It seems the only one unaffected by the
                    smoke of London; and therefore the greater number of its buildings, St Paul’s
                    among the rest, are of this stone. Being of hard texture, however, it must be
                    sawn by the use of sand and water, and is much more expensive to work than the
                    softer oolites. There are between fifty and sixty quarries on the island. The
                    best are said to be those on the north-eastern side; but, as with all stones,
                    there is good and bad in every quarry, and everything depends on the selection.
                    It is said that when Sir Christopher Wren built St Paul’s Cathedral, he had this
                    stone quarried and exposed to the weather on the sea-beach for three years,
                    before he suffered it to be used.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">siliceous</hi> stones, flint is sometimes used for rough
                    walling and for ornamental facing with brickwork; but in England this work is
                    done by the bricklayer, and not the mason.</p>
                <p>The only remaining class is that of the <hi rend="italic">metamorphic rocks,</hi>
                    of which the crystalline or saccharine and the serpentinous limestone are used;
                    but these are all species of marbles, used more as ornamental than as
                    constructive building-stones, and need not be dwelt upon here.</p>

                <p>Many of the early buildings of the Middle Ages were entirely constructed of
                    masses of concrete, often faced with a species of rough cast. The early masonry
                    seems to have been for the most part worked with the axe and not with the
                    chisel. A very excellent example of the contrast between the earlier and later
                    Norman masonry may be seen in the choir of Canterbury Cathedral. In those times
                    the groining was frequently filled in with a light tufa stone, said by some to
                    have been brought from Italy, but more probably from the Rhine. The Normans
                    imported a great quantity of stone from Caen, it being easily worked, and
                    particularly fit for carving. The freestones of England were also much used; and
                    in the first Pointed period, Purbeck and Bethersden marbles were employed for
                    column shafts, &amp;c. The methods of working and setting stone were much the
                    same as at present, except that, as the roads were then in a very bad state, and
                    in many places the only means of conveyance was by pack-horses, the stones were
                    used in much smaller sizes. The methods of setting out work were, however,
                    different from those of other styles, as might be expected from the difference
                    of forms. As time went on the art of masonry advanced till, in England, in point
                    of execution it at length rivalled that of any country.</p>
                <p>From the regular and determined form of bricks, modes or systems for setting or
                    arranging them, may be formed, and any workman, by habit and an exertion of
                    memory merely, may become competent to build a brick wall as well as it can be
                    built, but it is not so with stone used in common masonry walling. The workman
                    in this material has for the most part to deal with masses of all forms and of
                    all sizes, and a continual exercise of the judgment is required from him beyond
                    the tact or skill which may be acquired by practice. For this reason workmen are
                    generally less to be trusted to their own discretion in stone building than even
                    in bricklaying. The young mason should be extremely careful to avoid making the
                    beds of stones concave or hollow; for if this be done, in any case where the
                    stones have to bear much pressure, they will flush or break off at the joints
                    and disfigure the work. The best or highest sort of stone walling is the easiest
                    to set; it is that in which the stones are all tooled and gauged in regular
                    parallelogramic figures, to range in courses and suit the thickness of the wall
                    to which they are to belong; and the most difficult to execute properly is that
                    in which amorphous stones are used, the mason being allowed merely to dress them
                    roughly with his hammer or axe, and fit them in as he best can to form the most
                    compact mass: this is called rubble walling.</p>
                <p>From the brittle nature of stone, great tact is required in setting, to prop or
                    bear up the longer pieces in every part, or they will break across, and thus
                    occasion more injury than could accrue if the whole mass had been made up of
                    small pieces. Very long lengths, therefore, should be avoided, even in regular
                    tooled courses, with which the bearing is or should be perfectly even, and a
                    settling down of the work itself is hardly to be feared. There is a certain
                    medium which may be preserved; and although the object is obviously, in stone as
                    in brick walls, to form a compact mass, as unbroken into parts as possible, a
                    mason will act judiciously in breaking a very long stone into two or more
                    shorter ones, and working them in that state, though he thus makes two or more
                    additional joints, well knowing that he has the power of counteracting to a
                    certain extent the ill effect of joints made by himself, but that those made by
                    accident are irremediable.</p>
                <p>The observations made in the section on brickwork, on the use of mortar, will
                    apply here also. Of whatever quality the stone may be of which a wall is to be
                    built, it should consist as much of stone and as little of mortar as possible.
                    If the stone be inferior in durability and power of resisting the action of the
                    atmosphere to the mortar, besides the certain fact that the mortar will yield
                    until it has set hard, and so far act injuriously, no ulterior good is .gained;
                    and if the stone be the more durable material, the more of it that enters into
                    the wall the better. Indeed, in rough walling, if the stones be pressed together
                    until the more prominent angles on their faces come into actual contact, the
                    interstices being occupied by mortar, it will be better than if a thick yielding
                    mass were allowed to remain between them. Absolute contact, however, should not
                    be permitted, any more than in brickwork, lest the shrinking of the mortar in
                    drying leave the stones to such unequal bearing as the prominent parts alone
                    would afford. Stone being generally of a less absorbent nature than brick, it is
                    not a matter of so much importance that it be wetted before setting;
                    nevertheless, adhesion on the part of the mortar is more certain and more
                    complete, if the stones be worked in at least a damp state.</p>
                <p>What bond is, and the necessity for it, have also been shown in the preceding
                    section; and bond is of not less importance in stone walling than in
                    bricklaying. We have also hinted above at the greater difficulty of
                    understanding, forming, and preserving it in the former, and can now only add a
                    few observations in addition that can be of any use, and these with reference to
                    rubble walling particularly. Instead of carefully making the joints recur one
                    over the other in alternate courses, as with bricks and gauged stones, the
                    joints should as carefully be made to lock, so as to give the strength of two or
                    three courses or layers between a joint in one course and one that may occur
                    vertically over it in another. In bonding through a wall, or transversely, it is
                    much better that many stones should reach two-thirds across alternately from the
                    opposite sides than that there should be a few thorough stones, or stones
                    extending the whole thickness of the wall. Indeed, one of the many faults of
                    stone masons is that of making a wall consist of two scales or thin sides, with
                    thorough stones now and then laid across to bind them together, the core being
                    made up of mortar and small rubble merely. This is a mode of structure that
                    should be carefully guarded against. There is no better test of a workman’s tact
                    and judgment in rubble walling than the building of a dry wall, or wall without
                    mortar, affords. Walls are frequently built with mortar that without it would
                    have fallen down under their own weight in a height of 6 feet, in consequence of
                    their defective construction,—thus rendering it evident that they are only held
                    together by the tenacity of the mortar, which is very seldom an equivalent for a
                    proper bond of stone. Masons are very apt to set thin broad stones on their
                    narrow edges to show a good face, by which the wall is injured in two ways; the
                    practice tends to the formation of a mere case on the surface of a wall, and it
                    for the most part exposes the bed of the stone to the atmosphere, as a stone is
                    more likely to be broad in the direction of its bed than across it.</p>
                <p>The footings of stone walls ought to consist of the largest stones which can be
                    conveniently procured. It is better to have them of a rectangular form than any
                    other; and if they are not square, their largest surfaces should be laid
                    horizontally. With this shape and disposition they will make the greatest
                    resistance to sinking. WTιen footings can be obtained the full breadth of the
                    wall in one piece, they are to be preferred; but if not, then every alternate
                    stone in the course may be the whole breadth. Each course should be well bedded
                    in mortar.</p>
                <p>Rubble walling is either coursed or uncoursed. In the latter sort, fig. 5, Plate
                    XXI., the work is carried on with stones of any sizes, as they occur, and
                    without reference to their heights, somewhat in the manner of the Cyclopean
                    walling of antiquity,—the interstices of the larger being filled up λvith
                    smaller stones. For this work the mason uses no tool but the trowel to lay on
                    the mortar, the scabling hammer to break off the most repulsive irregularities
                    from the stones, and the plumb-rule to keep his work perpendicular. The line and
                    level are equally unnecessary, as the work is independent of considerations <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n522/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0522-0471"/> which are affected by them. An attentive and
                    intelligent workman will, however, make a sound wall with this specios of
                    construction, by fitting the stones well together and packing them with as
                    little mortar as possible, yet filling every crevice with it, and carefully
                    bonding through to secure compactness, transversely at the least.</p>
                <p>In coursed rubble walling, fig. G, Plate XXI.,the line and level are used, the
                    work is laid in courses, each course being carefully brought up to the same
                    level in itself, though no attention is paid to uniformity in the heights of the
                    different courses. For this species of walling the stones are generally
                    thoroughly dressed by the workman in the gross before he begins building. He is
                    careful to get parallel beds to them, and he brings the best face of each stone
                    to a tolerably even surface at right angles to the beds; the ends, too, receive
                    some little attention, and for this purpose he uses an axe in addition to his
                    scabling hammer. The quoins in coursed rubble walling are generally built with
                    peculiar neatness and precision, and they are set to serve as gauge courses for
                    the rest. This, when well executed, makes a sound and excellent wall. It
                    presents, however, rather a rough and homely appearance, and in finer works must
                    be covered with stucco or cement, or faced with ashlar.</p>
                <p>Ashlar is an external rind of gauged stones in equal courses, having tooled or
                    closely-fitting joints to give a wall a neat and uniform appearance; it is axed,
                    tooled, or rubbed, as may be thought most in character with the structure, or
                    that part of it to which it is to belong. Ashlar stones, or ashlars as they are
                    commonly called, are made of various sizes on the surface, as the character of
                    the edifice may require or convenience demand, and vary in thickness from 5 to 8
                    or 9 inches. Some of the ashlar stones must, it is clear, be used transversely
                    as bond stones, or the facing, having nothing to connect it with the wall
                    behind, would soon totter and fall. Bond stones are generally put in alternate
                    courses, with the backing to the jambs of openings, such as windows, and
                    offener, if these do not recur within a length of 5 or G feet; the bond stones
                    themselves, too, should not fall in the same vertical chain, except when they
                    are in the jambs of openings, but should break in their alternate courses.
                    Ashlar is commonly set in fine mortar or in putty. It is generally recommended
                    that ashlars should not be made regular parallelopipeds, but run back
                    irregularly to tooth in with the backing, the vertical joints being left open
                    from about an inch within the face of the wall, and the upper surface or bed of
                    the stones made narrower than, though perfectly parallel to, the lower. These
                    things may exert a slightly beneficial influence under some circumstances; but
                    the mode of construction involved is so radically bad, that unless the backing
                    is set in a quick-setting cement, or is so well packed as to be proof against
                    its general tendency to settle away from the ashlar facing, no method of the
                    kind can materially improve it. A well-compacted wall of coursed rubble, the
                    courses being frequently made up of whole stones and faced with ashlar, may be
                    made tolerably sound and trustworthy. Brick backing, with ashlar facing, cannot
                    be considered as good, though it has the advantage of not requiring battening
                    and lathing for inside plastering, as the stone-backed wall does. Uncoursed
                    rubble with ashlar has all the disadvantages of both the preceding, with nothing
                    to recommend it before either of them. A thin inner brick wall, like a hollow
                    wall, is very often necessary, where it is anticipated that the rain will be
                    beaten through the stone-work by the impetuosity of the wind. The settlement of
                    these two kinds of work during the setting of the mortar is so different, that
                    the walls often separate; or where this is prevented by bond stones, the walls
                    bulge outwards and bear unequally on their base. These evils are best prevented
                    by using as little mortar as possible in the interior parts of the wall, and not
                    raising tho wall a great height at a time.</p>
                <p>In order to give an uniform colour to a stone or ashlar wall, masons mix up
                    pounded chippings of the stone they have used with some lime, salt, whiting, and
                    size, and a little ochre, with which they colour the stone as they clean off the
                    work. It is called badigeon, and is used also on plastered walls, where joints
                    are sometimes drawn in colour to represent stone-work. Small defects in the
                    stone are filled up with the same, or with shell-lac and the pounded stone.</p>
                <p>There are many different sorts of walling or modes of structure arising from the
                    nature of the materials furnished in various localities. That of most frequent
                    occurrence, perhaps, is a manner in which either squared, broken, or rounded
                    flints are used. These depend entirely on the care with which they are arranged,
                    and on the mortar with which they are compacted, as also on a coursed chain,
                    which is commonly introduced at short intervals of larger stones or of bricks,
                    to act as a bond; the quoins, too, in this species of structure are generally
                    constructed of dressed stones or of brick. Another sort of building is that of
                    Pisé work, which from its economy as well as its general utility, has been much
                    used in various countries. It consists of merely compressing earth in moulds or
                    cases, whereby houses of two or three stories in height can be raised. Strong
                    earths, with a mixture of small gravel, form the best material. The earth cannot
                    be used when it is either too dry or too wet; when prepared it is put into the
                    moulds and rammed down. The openings for the doors and windows must be left at
                    the time of building the walls; and the openings have to be faced with wood for
                    hanging the doors or for inserting the frames. The exterior decorations are best
                    made of stone or brick; wood will not unite very well with the Pisé; the flues
                    are also formed of brickwork. The exterior should be cemented or rough-casted,
                    which should only be done when the wall is quite dry, oι the cement will be cast
                    off by the damp. The walls require to be bonded at the angles by thin rough
                    planks to each course of about 3 feet in height, and the interior walls to be
                    likewise so tied to the main ones. Such work has lasted over a century and a
                    half. It was extensively practised at Lyons and in the south of France during
                    the last century. Several attempts have been made of late years to build
                    concrete walls for houses, and with much success. The process is similar to that
                    already described. One patentee has been enabled to produce a cheap material
                    wherewith he has built every part of a house,—walls, floors, staircase, and a
                    flat roof, and even the doors, the material being set in an iron frame, thus
                    rendering the house perfectly incombustible. Several such “monolithic doors”
                    have lately been put up in London in place of plate iron doors.</p>
                <p>Whatever objections lie against bond timber in brickwork apply with equal force
                    at least to the use of it in stone walls. Hoop-iron bond is not only available
                    in all kinds of stone walling, including the highly-wrought close-jointed kind,
                    but it is invaluable, as it may be used both longitudinally and transversely as
                    it may in brickwork; whilst it compels the building mason to bring his work up
                    to a true and fair bed as often as the bond is to be laid in it. Discharging
                    arches, it must be evident, are as necessary in and to stone walls as to walls
                    of brick, and they may be treated much in the same manner. See fig. 10, Plate
                    XX., and fig. 4, Plate XXI.</p>
                <p>When walls are not entirely of masonry, in the ordinary course of economic
                    building, stone is frequently used for copings, cornices, string and blocking
                    courses, sills, landings, pavings, curbs, steps, stairs, hearth-stones and
                    slabs, and chimney-pieces; to these may be added quoins and architectural
                    decorations, or dressings for windows, doors, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n523/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0523-0472"/> &amp;c., though both the former and latter are
                    not unfrequently executed in plaster composition or cements. Quoin-stones are
                    gauged and wrought blocks with parallel beds and vertical faces, placed on the
                    angles of buildings in the Greek, Roman, and Italian styles, with the intention
                    of adding to their beauty and strength, as in fig. 7, Plate XXI.; they are used
                    in all kinds of walling, and are generally made to project before the face of
                    that to which they are attached, mostly with a weathered angular joint, or with
                    a rectangularly grooved or moulded one. The quoins are coursed with the rest of
                    the wall if it be of stone, and are made to occupy the exact space of a limited
                    number of courses of brick in a brick wall, or of flints where these are used.
                    Copings in Italian work to cover walls, parapets, &lt;fcc., are worked with a
                    plain horizontal bed, two vertical faces, and an inclined or weathered back or
                    upper surface,— either forming an acute angle with the outer and wider, and an
                    obtuse angle with the inner and narrower face, to throw the water off, shown at
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> fig. 9, Plate XXI.; or sloping to both sides from the
                    middle, as at δ; the latter is technically termed saddle-back coping. In both
                    cases they are made to project over the wall or parapet on both sides; and in
                    the projected part of the bed under the edge or edges towards which the
                    inclination is given, a channel or groove, called a throat, is cut, to intercept
                    the water in its inclination to run inwards to the wall. On gables or other
                    inclined planes the coping is neither weathered nor throated, as the water is
                    necessarily impelled along its course to the lower end, and not over the sides.
                    It is a curious circumstance that the mediaeval designers rarely made their
                    copings to project on the inside of a parapet, as shown in fig. 16, so that the
                    exterior projection, which was returned up, was perhaps intended as much for
                    effect as use. To protect the separate stones of a coping course from the danger
                    of being displaced by high winds or other accidental causes, and to form a chain
                    through its whole length, the stones are linked together by cramps of copper or
                    iron let into their backs and ran with lead. These metals, however, especially
                    the iron, for the most part act very injuriously, from their exceeding
                    sensibility to atmospheric changes, and their greater or less tendency to
                    oxidation; indeed, the stone invariably suffers more than the work benefits from
                    the metal cramps. Tenons, dowels, joggles, or dovetails, of stone, of hard word,
                    or of slate set in Portland cement, applied so as to be protected from the
                    weather, are far better, and would answer every desirable purpose sufficiently.
                    Lead dowels, when small, are occasionally used. The value of joggling and
                    doweling to stone-work is well exemplified in the construction of Eddystone
                    lighthouse. Cornices are but ramified copings, and are or may be subjected to
                    the same general laws. Care must be taken, however, in arranging them, that
                    their centre of gravity be not brought too far forward, in the anxiety to
                    project them sufficiently, lest they act injuriously on the wall by pressing
                    unequally, and their own seat be also endangered. String courses economically,
                    in contradistinction to architecturally, are meant to protect a set-off in a
                    wall, by projecting over its lower face in the manner of a coping, as in fig. 7,
                    Plate XXI., at c; the beds are worked parallel, and the outer face vertical or
                    at right angles to them, but so much of the upper surface is weathered or sloped
                    off as protrudes from the upper part of the wall to carry the water off; and,
                    for the reason above stated with regard to copings, the lower bed just within
                    the outer face is throated. A stone string course, cramped or dovetailed in the
                    bed, forms an excellent chain round a brick wall; but the part of it in the wall
                    should be of the exact height of one, two, or more courses of brickwork. The
                    woodcut, fig. 17, is a usual cornice or string course in the later period of
                    mediaeval art in England. A blocking course is either a very thick string
                    projecting over or flush with the face of the lower part of the wall to cover a
                    set-off; or it is a range of stone over a crowning cornice to bring the centre
                    of gravity more in on the wall than it otherwise would be; in the former case it
                    is treated exactly as a string, excepting that, if it bo flush below, there is
                    no occasion for a throat; in the latter it has a horizontal case bed, parallel
                    vertical sides, and a weathered back or upper surface. Sills are weathered and
                    throated like the parts of a string course, Plate XXI., fig. 7, αand ό; yet in
                    mediaeval work they may be seen flush with the upright of the wall. They are
                    laid across window openings as a base to the sash-frame; distinct sills in the
                    same line may, indeed, be considered as an intercepted string course. In the
                    ordinary practice of building, window sills are seldom set in brick walls until
                    they are absolutely required to set the sash-frames on; or they are set but not
                    bedded, except at the ends. The object of this is to prevent any settlement that
                    may occur in the piers from breaking the sills across on the unyielding part of
                    the wall under the windows. A necessity for this, however, can only arise from
                    bad construction; for with a good bond in the brickwork, all would settle
                    together, and the sills might be completely bedded across at once.</p>
                <p>Landings are platforms of stone, either over an area before a door, at the head
                    of a flight of stairs, or as the floor of a balcony. They are made four, five,
                    six, or eight inches in thickness, according to their extent and bearing · if
                    not one piece of stone they are of nicely jointed pieces joggled and plugged
                    together, and are worked on the face and edges just as their situation may
                    demand. They should also be very carefully pinned into the walls. Fig. 18 will
                    show the danger, should they not be so, through the full length of their
                    insertion. If the front edge be pinned up, as at A, but a vacancy be left, as at
                    B, the point C will become the fulcrum of a lever, and the landing have a
                    tendency to turn at that point, and to break at the edge C. Every step and
                    landing should have 8 inches hold in a brick wall. All landings should be well
                    joggled; the joint joggles made as at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 19, is
                    called by workmen a <hi rend="italic">he,</hi> and that at <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> a <hi rend="italic">she</hi> joggle. An accident at the Polytechnic
                    Institution in London arose, no doubt, from the ’ carelessness of the workmen,
                    who put two landings together, in which two she-joggles were worked, as in fig.
                    20, and filled the open space with plaster. There happened to be a large fossil
                    in the stone close to the wall in the landing <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which,
                    having no support from the other landing«, gave way, and caused the destraction
                    of the lower portion of the staircase upon which it fell.</p>

                <p>Stone pavings are prepared and laid in various ways. Ordinary paving is of
                    self-faced or of tooled York; and for better purposes it is of rubbed Portland
                    stone. For entrance halls, square stones, with the angles slightly cut off, the
                    four spaces thus obtained being filled up by a small square of black or other
                    coloured stone, makes a neat paving, which is replaced by marbles in best houses
                    and public buildings, if a tesselated pavement be not required. Stone paving
                    that is not exposed to the sun and air, if next the ground, should be laid on
                    footings of brick or stone, or it will be constantly damp should the soil be
                    close and clayey; but in yards, open areas, &amp;c., it may be laid on the
                    ground, bedded in sand, and jointed with mortar or cement. Stone-paved floors
                    should be formed on brick arches, or on a timber floor prepared for the purpose;
                    the latter, however, is a very bad mode of supporting paving, as the impression
                    derived from the presence of the stone is, that the floor is incombustible; but
                    if it be bedded on combustible material, the danger to human life in the event
                    of fire is greater than if the stone paving did not exist at all. It is worked,
                    cut, and set more or less expensively, according to circumstances. A curb is a
                    range or course of thicker and stronger stone to bound a pavement, and is either
                    flush with the paving showing as a step on its outer edge, or is raised above it
                    to receive a balustrade, and shows on the outer side as a blocking course; in
                    the latter situation it is generally joggled and plugged in the joints. The term
                    step or steps alone is usually understood to mean external steps, whether
                    arranged in long or short flights, or the single step in a doorway into which
                    the door-frame is tenoned. A step should have a plain horizontal bed, and a very
                    slightly weathered tread or upper surface,—the front or riser worked plain and
                    vertical, or with a moulded nosing, and the back sunk with a joggle or
                    bird’s-mouth joint to receive the step or landing above or behind it. Steps for
                    areas or back courts are often made of 2 or 2∣ in. stone for the tread, the
                    riser being formed of a 4∣ or 5 in. stone, both tailed into a wall at one or
                    both ends. This is much lighter in effect. Slate is sometimes used for the
                    treads.</p>
                <p>Stairs are but a flight or combination of steps used internally, and the general
                    principle of designing staircases, as regards the rise and tread of steps,
                    setting out curves, curtails, landings, &amp;c., are given in the part treating
                    of joinery. The chief difference between these and other staircases consists in
                    the fixing, the one being framed with wooden strings, while the other have no
                    strings, but are supported entirely by the walls. If there be a wall at each
                    end, they are simply built in at the time the work goes up; but if they are
                    supported at one end only, they are called geometrical stairs, and depend
                    entirely on their being securely wedged into the wall; on which and on the
                    support each derives at one edge from the step below, they wholly rely. If they
                    are square in section, they are called solid steps; but as the under side or
                    soffit, then, is irregular, it is usual to make the steps of somewhat a
                    triangular shape, so as to present a continued soffit. In this case they are
                    called arris, or feather-edge steps. Care should be taken that there are no
                    sudden or irregular changes in the curves. These may be easily avoided by the
                    method shown in the portion relating to joinery for the easing of the curves and
                    ramps in handrails.</p>
                <p>In houses built of stone the flues are usually formed in brickwork. The
                    chimney-pieces consist of plain jambs, or boxings, or other vertical sides more
                    or less decorated and moulded, and of the architrave or transverse covering or
                    mantel, fig. 8, Plate XXI., with its shelf or cornice. The parts of a
                    chimney-piece are generally put together with an adhesive plaster or cement, and
                    affixed to the yvall or chimney-breast behind with cramps, holdfasts, and plugs.
                    The material of which chimney-pieces, if not of wood, are composed, varies from
                    the coarsest stone to the finest marble; and the labour on them varies to a
                    still greater extent.</p>
                <p>Masonry to receive architectural decorations is generally worked into the walls
                    as they are carried up; but as they are seldom homogeneous either in matter or
                    construction, the result is mostly the converse of what it purports to be, for
                    the work is more frequently weakened than strengthened by the decorative
                    masonry. Stones of which columns are to be composed, whether each column is to
                    be of one stone or more, are generally roughly boasted out before they are set,
                    and are finished afterwards to traversing moulds and templets with a plumb-rule,
                    whose sides are cut to the diminution obtained from the bottom and upper
                    diameters, whatever it may be. Flutes are cut at the same time and in the same
                    manner. The beds of the joints in columns should be worked with the greatest
                    precision, so as to obtain parallel planes, that they may fit firmly and closely
                    together; they must not, however, be worked hollow to make a close joint
                    externally, or the arrises will chip off. It is considered a good plan, where
                    the columns are large, to put a piece of thin milled lead between the beds, cut
                    circular, and extending to within a short distance of the surface, and that the
                    rest be filled with a fine adhesive putty, made as nearly of the colour of the
                    stone as possible. This makes a solid bed, and protects the arrises effectually;
                    but it will not do so well for slight columns, because it narrows the bed so
                    materially. A joggle or dowel of hard wood, slate, or cast-iron let into the
                    core might be a sufficient counteraction, and it would certainly add to the
                    stability of a polylithic shaft. The other parts of a columnar composition may
                    be sufficiently cramped and joggled together with wood and metals, according to
                    the situation, though it may be again remarked, that neither wood nor metal
                    should be used, unless it can be protected from access even of the
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Sections for Roman mouldings are given in the part relating to joinery, but as
                    those used in Grecian architecture are parts of conic sections, and not struck
                    by compasses, we give a short problem by which they may all easily be set out.
                    Both Roman and Grecian mouldings are shown on Plate XIII. of vol. ii.</p>
                <p>Let an ovolo be the moulding required (fig. 21), the height of which (to the
                    point where the moulding curves backward) is AC or BD, and the greatest
                    projection AB or CD; and let CE be a tangent line, or line which the curve must
                    touch but not cut. Produce CA to F, and make A F equal to AC, and AG to ED.
                    Divide GB BE each into the same number of equal parts as 5. Draw the
                    co-ordinates from F and C to the respective · numbers, their intersections will
                    trace the curve. If BE be more than half the whole height, the curve is an
                    ellipse; if exactly half the height, itis aparabola; and if BE be less than half
                    BD, the curve will be a hyperbola. All other mouldings can be drawn by this
                    method, it being remembered that cymas, ogees, and all reflex curves, must be
                    divided and drawn in two separate portions.</p>
                <p>The mouldings in mediaeval architecture differ entirely from those of other
                    styles. They are chiefly formed by a combination of curves stopped by right
                    lines or worked into other curves and hollows. The mouldings differ in <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0525-0474"/> each of the several periods of the style in
                    England, and also in the variations of the style as practised here and in each
                    country on the Continent. We insert an outline, fig. 22, of a window jamb at
                    Sleaford church, Lincolnshire, to show the forms and combination of an example
                    during the Decorated period. A full description of those used in each style
                    woμld exceed our limits, nor, indeed, is it a subject within the scope of this
                    article. They are sometimes set out with the compasses, and many often appear to
                    have been drawn by eye. We must refer our readers to the works of Professor
                    Willis, F. A. Paley, and of J. H. Parker, for any details required about them. A
                    very curious treatise was published by Professor Willis, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Architectural Nomenclature of the Middle Ages,</hi> which goes at
                    great length into the subject. A bead or astragal seems to have been called a
                    bowtelle; a torus, a grete bowtelle; a hollow or scotia, a casement; an ogee, a
                    ressaunte, and so on.</p>
                <p>The methods of forking mouldings in the stones at the builder’s command have been
                    already noticed at the commencement of this section. The soft stones and marbles
                    are easily shaped into mouldings with the chisel and the mallet, and are sawn
                    and the surfaces even finished with a plate having a fine edge. These stones
                    will take mouldings of minuter character than the harder stones, which have to
                    be worked with force, and require pointed tools to form the faces. The hardest
                    material, granite, again, has to be stunned with heavy picks to make an
                    impression, so that only bold ornaments have a good effect; much money has been
                    thrown away in details more suitable for softer materials. Good effect is
                    obtained by the contrast of axed and polished surfaces. A designer should visit
                    the places where buildings in granite have been erected for a knowledge of a
                    proper application of that material.</p>
                <p>The earliest arches were circular and, of course, easily set out. But as the
                    Pointed styles came in, several methods were used for describing them. Pointed
                    arches may be classed as—1st, lancet; 2d, equilateral; 3d, depressed; and 4th,
                    four-centred or Tudor. In the first the centres, as 1, 2, in fig. 23, are
                    outside the arch <hi rend="italic">a b.</hi> At Westminster Abbey the arches of
                    the choir are so acutely pointed that the distances <hi rend="italic">la</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">2δ</hi> are nearly two-thirds of the entire opening <hi
                    rend="italic">a b.</hi> In the nave at York the points are without the arch at a
                    distance of about one-fifth the opening <hi rend="italic">a b.</hi> In
                    equilateral arches the centres are exactly on the points <hi rend="italic">a
                    b</hi> in fig. 24, so that the apex <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> joined to <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> will form an equilateral
                    triangle. The nave arches at Wells are of this description, and also those at
                    Lincoln (see vol. ii. Plate XVIII. fig. 1). In later times the arches were of
                    lower pitch, as fig. 25, and then, of course, the centres 1 and 2 were within
                    the arch <hi rend="italic">a b.</hi> At Salisbury Cathedral the distance <hi
                    rend="italic">al</hi> is one-sixth of <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> while in the
                    choir at Lincoln (vol. ii., Plate XVIII., fig. 2) it is as much as two-fifths.
                    To describe arches which shall be similar to one another throughout a building,
                    however the openings may differ, this principle must always be borne in mind,
                    that the centres are to be always distant from the points <hi rend="italic">a
                    b</hi> by some aliquot portion of the whole opening. This is the more important,
                    as the lines of tracery will not fall into their proper places except the arches
                    are set out upon some regular principle. If the arches are not equilateral, some
                    distance from each point <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> should be first determined
                    on (say one-third the opening <hi rend="italic">a</hi> &amp;), and after this,
                    whatever the span of the other arches may be, one-third its own opening is to be
                    taken from the points <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> as the centres from which to
                    strike its curves. The only exception is that, in mediaeval buildings, the
                    arches to the doorways are frequently somewhat flatter than those of the
                    windows. In the Tudor period the arches are very frequently drawn from four
                    centres instead of two. As there has been great misapprehension as to
                    four-centred arches, some persons treating them as parts of conic sections,
                    whereas they are really parts of segments of circles, it is thought well to give
                    two methods of describing these arches.:</p>
                <p>First, when the width AB, fig. 26, of the arch, and the apex height OC, are
                    given, and a tangent to the upper circle as CD. In this case draw AD
                    perpendicular to AB, and set out Al equal to AD; draw C3 perpendicular to CD,
                    and make CE equal to AD or Al; join IE and bisect the same as shown by a
                    perpendicular meeting CE produced in 3; join 3 1 and produce towards F, then 1
                    and</p>
                <p>3 will be the centres for half the arch; and, transferring the points across, 2
                    and <hi rend="italic">4</hi> will be the centres for the other half. In the
                    second case, when the width AB and the height OC, and the centres of the small
                    circles 1, 2, are given. Make AD equal to Al, join CD (which will be a tangent
                    to the upper curve), draw C3 at right angles <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n526/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0526-0475"/> thereto, make CE equal to Al, join IE, bisect the
                    same, and proceed as before. The points FG, as has before been explained, arc
                    the points where the circles will meet each other. The joints to these arches
                    will all radiate to their respective centres.</p>
                <p>Specimens of various sorts of the tracery which adorn the windows of the
                    mediaeval periods, and are in fact their greatest glory, are shown in Plates
                    XVIII., XIX., and XX. of vol. ii. The designs for tracery are almost infinite,
                    and the various methods of setting them out would fill a volume. But although
                    they display such ingenuity and fancy that one would think the design to be
                    quite arbitrary, it will be found that they are all, or very nearly all, set out
                    on the principle of geometrical intersections. An example will show the
                    principles on which the mediaeval architects proceeded to describe the tracery,
                    and also the method of finding the joints of the various pieces of stone.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> (fig. 27) be the opening of the arch; as there are
                    to be two mullions, divide the same into three equal parts, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >a c, c d, d b;</hi> then determine the points from which to strike the arch. In
                    this instance, for the sake of simplicity, we make it equilateral (as in fig.
                    24); <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> then are the centres
                    for striking the main arch <hi rend="italic">a eg, bfg,</hi> and the height <hi
                    rend="italic">og</hi> is that of an equilateral triangle. Produce the springing
                    line, and the same opening of the compasses through c and <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> will give the principal inner branches of the tracery <hi rend="italic"
                    >ce,</hi><hi rend="italic">df.</hi> From the centre <hi rend="italic">o,</hi>
                    with an opening extending to the middle of the lights <hi rend="italic">a e, d
                    b,</hi> strike a semicircle; raise perpendiculars from <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    and c to 1 and 2; draw a line through 1 and 2; on this and the springing line
                    will be found the centres of the lower ogees; bisect the part of <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">o</hi> cut off by 1 2 in <hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi> which is in fact the same thing as dividing the whole height <hi
                    rend="italic">o g</hi> into three; divide <hi rend="italic">h g</hi> into three
                    parts, at 3 and 4; through 3 draw a horizontal line, and set off from 3
                    distances one-third of the width <hi rend="italic">o d,</hi> or draw the
                    perpendicular lines as shown, which is better; then 5 and 6 will be the centres
                    of the upper quatre-foil. From the line 1 2, on the same perpendicular as last,
                    set down similar points, as at 7. These will be the centres for the lower
                    subdivision as shown. Next draw <hi rend="italic">ehf</hi> and subdivide by
                    similar perpendiculars, and where the lines intersect, as at 8, will be the
                    centres for the upper subdivisions. The lines thus drawn will form a species of
                    skeleton diagram, as shown on the right side of fig. 27, which is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">element of the tracery,</hi> and is in fact the centre line of the
                    mullion, as shown by <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 28. On each side of this,
                    using always the same centres for the same branches, draw lines, showing the
                    face (or what the workmen call the <hi rend="italic">nose)</hi> of the mullion,
                    and answering <hi rend="italic">to be;</hi> and then others answering to the
                    sides of the mullion, as <hi rend="italic">d e.</hi> Any other mouldings upon
                    their sides or faces maybe drawn in like manner. Put in the cusping as shown,
                    and the tracery is complete. The practical stone-mason will take care never to
                    make a joint where there is an angle of any sort, as the point of a cusp. In all
                    cases the joints must tend to the centres of the circles from which they are
                    struck, and where the lines branch off in two directions, the joints must not be
                    in one line, but must tend in two, or as many directions as there are branches,
                    and each to the centre of such respective branch. When the lines are
                    perpendicular, as at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and
                    at the joint below <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> the joints are horizontal. A close
                    inspection of fig. 27, where they are carefully drawn, will fully elucidate the
                    matter. The elaborate west window at York Cathedral (see Plate XVI1I. of vol
                    ii.) is entirely set out on this principle; and so is the still more remarkable
                    instance, the eastern window at Carlisle, which is composed of 86 pieces of
                    stone, and the design for which is drawn from 263 centres.</p>
                <p>All the upper construction of windows and doors, and of aisle arches, should be
                    protected from superincumbent pressure by strong relieving arches above the
                    labels, as shown by the dark tints in fig. 27, which should be worked in with
                    the ordinary masonry of the walls, and so set that the weight above should not
                    press on the fair work, in which case the joints of the tracery, &amp;c., will
                    sometimes flush or break out.</p>
                <p>In mediaeval vaults the crowns <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cd,</hi> are not level, but all have a slight curve or spring, as shown in fig.
                    29, and the filling-in between them also is slightly curved, so as to partake in
                    some degree of the character of the dome as well as of the groined arch; and for
                    the most part the ribs in early vaulting are not true segments of ellipses, but
                    approximations drawn by the compasses. The triumph of mediaeval stone-masonry,
                    however, is that species of groin known as fan-vaulting. It is unlike that of
                    any other age or time. The roofs of King’s College Chapel at Cambridge and of
                    Henry VII.’s Chapel at Westminster are eminent and late examples. The earliest
                    are supposed to be in the cloisters of Gloucester Cathedral. It is impossible in
                    our limited space to give demonstrations of them, and we must refer our readers
                    to the admirable treatise on the subject by Professor Willis, published in the
                    first volume of the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Royal Institute
                    of British Architects. The filling-in between the ribs of mediaeval groins is
                    generally of clunch, or of some soft stone, over which a layer of concrete is
                    sometimes placed in such manner as to bind all together and to resist the
                    thrust.</p>
                <p>The bold and beautiful termination to mediaeval towers, which we call a spire,
                    and the French <hi rend="italic">cah</hi><hi rend="italic">flèche,</hi> is
                    another proof of the skill of the mediaeval masons. These are generally
                    octagonal, and rise partly from the wall of the tower and partly from arches
                    thrown angle-wise from wall to wall inside, to cut off the corners, as it were,
                    and afford a springing to the spire. The wonder of these constructions is their
                    extreme lightness and thinness. The top of the spire at Salisbury is 411 feet
                    from the ground, of which the tower takes up 207 feet, leaving, of course, 204
                    feet for the height of the spire itself; this is only 9 inches thick at the
                    bottom, diminishing to 7 inches, or on an average only about the 300th part of
                    its height. It has been attempted to show mathematically that the joints of a
                    spire would be stronger if formed at right angles to its face; but they would
                    then slope inwards and hold the wet, which in sudden frosts would do most
                    serious injury; practically, therefore, it is found best to lay the courses on a
                    level bed. They should, however, be frequently doweled and cramped together, but
                    not with metal, for the extreme thinness of the stone would soon cause it to
                    rust and break out the stone.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Saw yer-work.</hi></p>
                <p>The labour of the sawyer is applied to the division of large pieces of timber or
                    logs into forms and sizes to suit the purposes of the carpenter and joiner. His
                    working-place is called a saw-pit, and his almost only important tool a pit-saw.
                    A cross-cut saw, axes, dogs, files, compasses, lines, lamp-black, black-lead,
                    chalk, and a rule, are all accessories which may be considered necessary to
                    him.</p>
                <p>The facility with which sawing whole timber is now done by the aid of the upright
                    saw-frame, and smaller timber by the circular-saw bench, has in large factories
                    and workshops caused the saw-pits to be out of date; timber after it has been
                    cut at the mills can be again reduced into sizes and scantlings at a rapid rate,
                    and with great exactitude and little labour. In some country parts, however, the
                    saw-pit is still used. Unlike most other artificers, the sawyer can do
                    absolutely nothing alone; sawyers are therefore always in pairs,—one of the two
                    standing on the work, and the other in the pit under it. The log or baulk of
                    timber being carefully and firmly fixed on the pit, and lined for the cuts which
                    are to be made in it, the top-man standing on it, and the pit-man below or off
                    from its end, a cut is commenced, the former holding the saw with his two hands
                    by the handle above, and the other in the same manner by the box handle below.
                    The attention of the top-man is directed to keeping the saw in the direction of
                    and out of winding with the line tobe cut upon, and that of the pit-man to cut
                    down in a truly vertical line. The saw being correctly entered, very little more
                    is required than steadiness of hand and eye in keeping it correctly on
                    throughout the whole length. In the operations of the carpenter and joiner much
                    depends on the manner in which the sawyers have performed their part. The best
                    work on the part of the carpenter cannot retrieve the radical defects in his
                    materials from bad sawing; and although the joiner need not allow his work to
                    suffer, bad sawing causes him great loss of wood and immense additional and
                    otherwise unnecessary labour. Planks or boards, and scantlings, on coming from
                    the sawpit, should be as straight and true in every particular, except mere
                    smoothness of surface, as if they had been tried upon the joiner’s bench; and
                    good workmen actually produce them so. Saw-mills, too, by the truth and beauty
                    with which they operate, show the sawyer what may be effected; for though he can
                    hardly hope to equal their effect, he may seek to approach it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Carpentry.</hi></p>
                <p>Carpentry or carpenter’s work has been divided into three principal heads,
                    namely, <hi rend="italic">descriptive, constructive,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >mechanical.</hi> The first shows the lines or methods for forming every species
                    of work by the rules of geometry; the second comprises the practice of reducing
                    the timber into particular forms, and joining the forms so produced so as to
                    make a complete whole according to the intention or design; and the third
                    displays the relative strength of the timbers and the strains to which they are
                    subjected by their disposition. Here, we have merely to describe the practical
                    details of carpenters’ work in the operations of building. The carpenter works
                    in wood, which he receives from the sawyer in beams, scantlings, and planks or
                    boards, which he cuts and combines into bond-timbers, wall-plates, floors, and
                    roofs. He is distinguished from the <hi rend="italic">joiner</hi> by his
                    operations being directed to the mere carcass of a building —to things which
                    have reference to structure only. Almost everything the carpenter does in and to
                    an edifice is absolutely necessary to its stability and efficiency, whereas the
                    joiner does not begin his operations until the carcass is complete; and every
                    article of joiners’ work might at any time be removed from a building without
                    undermining it or affecting its most important qualities. Certainly, in the
                    practice of building, a few things do occur regarding which it is difficult to
                    determine to whose immediate province they belong; but the distinction is
                    sufficiently broad for general purposes. The carpenter, with the bricklayer or
                    mason and some of the minor artificers, constructs the frame or hull; and the
                    joiner, with the plasterer and others, decorates and rigs the vessel. On the
                    former the actual existence of the ship depends, and on the latter depends her
                    fitness for use.</p>
                <p>The carpenter frames or combines separate pieces of timber by scarfing, notching,
                    cogging, tenoning, pinning, and wedging. The tools he uses are the rule, the
                    axe, the adze, the saw, the mallet, hammers, chisels, gouges, augers, wimbles,
                    pincers, hook-pins, a square, a bevel, a pair of compasses, and a gauge,
                    together with the level, square, and plumb-rule; besides these, planes (for
                    making grooves, rebates, and mouldings), gimlets, pincers, a sledge-hammer, a
                    maul or beetle, wedges, and a crow-bar may be considered useful auxiliaries,
                    though they are not absolutely necessary to the performance of works of
                    carpentry. Planing and other machines are used to diminish the great manual
                    labour of working the surface of planks and boards, and of moulding, tenoning,
                    and other similar operations; and so elaborate are some of these machines, that
                    a four-panelled door can now be made complete in a couple of hours, which
                    formerly was considered a good day’s work for a man. Circular-saws are employed
                    for working up larger timbers; and for ripping up boards or scantlings of
                    moderate thickness, they are now used in all workshops.</p>
                <p>The fir timber in general use is imported from Memel, Riga, Dantzig, and Sweden.
                    Memel timber is the most convenient for size, Riga the best in quality, Dantzig
                    the strongest, and Swedish the toughest. Riga timber can always be depended
                    upon. Red pine may be used wherever durability and strength are objects; Quebec
                    yellow pine for light dry purposes. Iu selecting timber, spongy heart, porous
                    grain, and dead knots are to be avoided; the brightest in colour, and where the
                    strong red grain appears to rise on the surface, are the best to be chosen. For
                    joists and main timbers, the best woods are from Dantzig, Memel, or Riga; for
                    partitions and minor timbers, American red wood, which not being so strong as
                    the Baltic timber, must be cut to a little larger size. For sleepers,
                    window-sills, and some parts of a roof, oak is used; for framing, Christiania
                    deals or battens; for panelling, Christiania white deal oι American yellow pine;
                    for upper floors, Dram or Drammen and Christiania whites; for ground floors,
                    Stockholm and Gefle yellows; for warehouse floors and staircases, Archangel and
                    Onega planks; for best floors, St Petersburg, Onega, Dram, and Christiania
                    battens. American deals <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n530/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0530-0477"/> should not be used for floors, as they are
                    softer; and Swedish deals are bad for framing, as they warp. For interior
                    finishings generally, Baltic red and white woods, and the American red and
                    yellow pine, are to be preferred.</p>
                <p>We must first proceed to consider the means by which form in the work of the
                    carpenter is to be secured, and the connections by which the various strains are
                    excited and communicated. The following practical remarks on various <hi
                    rend="italic">joints</hi> are abridged from the article by Prof. Robison in the
                    former editions of this work.</p>
                <p>The joinings practised in carpentry are almost infinitely various, and each has
                    advantages which make it preferable in some circumstances. Many varieties are
                    employed merely to please the eye. We do not concern ourselves with these; nor
                    shall wc consider those which are only employed in connecting small works, and
                    can never appear on a great scale; yet even in some of these, the skill of the
                    carpenter may be discovered by his choice; for in all cases it is wise to make
                    every, even the smallest, part of his work as strong as the materials will
                    admit. He will be particularly attentive to the changes which will necessarily
                    happen by the shrinking of timber as it dries, will consider what dimensions of
                    his framings will be affected by this and what will net, and will then dispose
                    the pieces which are less essential to the strength of the whole in such a
                    manner that their tendency to shrink shall be in the same direction with the
                    shrinking of the whole framing. If he do otherwise, the seams will widen, and
                    parts will be split asunder. He will dispose his boardings in such a manner as
                    to contribute to the stiffness of the whole, avoiding at the same time the
                    giving them positions which will produce lateral strains on truss beams which
                    bear great pressures; recollecting, that although a single board has little
                    force, yet many united have a great deal, and may frequently perform the office
                    of very powerful struts.</p>
                <p>Our limits confine us to the joinings which are most essential for connecting the
                    parts of a single piece of a frame (when it cannot be formed of one beam, either
                    for want of the necessary thickness or length), and the joints for connecting
                    the different sides of a trussed frame.</p>
                <p>Much ingenuity has been bestowed on the manner of building up a great beam of
                    many thicknesses, and many singular methods are practised; but when we consider
                    the manner in which the cohesion of the fibres performs its office, we see that
                    the simplest are formed on the same principles as the most refined, and they are
                    less apt to induce false notions of the strength of the assemblage. Thus, were
                    it required to build up a beam for a great lever or a girder, so that it may act
                    nearly as a beam of the same size of one log, it may either be done by plain
                    joggling, as in Plate XXII. fig. 1, A, or by scarfing, as in B or C. If it is to
                    act as a lever, having the gudgeon on the lower side at C, we believe that most
                    artists will prefer the form B and C. We may frequently gain a considerable
                    accession of strength by this building up of a beam, especially if the part
                    which is stretched by the strain be of oak, and the other part be fir. Fir being
                    so much superior to oak as a pillar, and oak so much preferable as a tie, this
                    construction seems to unite both advantages. But much better methods of making
                    powerful levers, girders, &amp;c., are obtained by trussing. Observe that the
                    efficacy of both methods depends entirely on. the difficulty of causing the
                    piece between the cross joints to slide along the timber to which it adheres.
                    Therefore, if this be moderate, it is wrong to make the notches deep; for as
                    soon as they are so deep that their ends have a force sufficient to push the
                    slice along the line of junction, nothing is gained by making them deeper; and
                    this requires a greaterexpenditure of timber.</p>
                <p>Scarfings of beams are frequently made oblique, as in Plate XXII. fig. 2; but
                    this seems a bad practice. It begins to yield at a point where the wood is
                    erippled and splintered off, or at least bruised out a little. As the pressure
                    increases, this part, by squeezing broader, causes the solid parts to rise a
                    little upwards, and gives them some tendency, not only to push their antagonists
                    along the base, but even to tear them up a little. For similar reasons we
                    disapprove of the favourite practice of many artists to make the angles of their
                    scarfings acute, as in fig. 3. This often causes the two pieces to tear each
                    other up. The abutments should always be perpendicular to the directions of the
                    pressures. This law is also to be extended to the abutments of different pieces
                    of a frame, and the artist must even attend to the shrinking of the timbers by
                    drying. When two timbers abut obliquely, the joint should be most full at the
                    obtuse angle of the end; because, by drying, that angle grows more obtuse, and
                    the beam would then be in danger of splintering off at the acute angle.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the nicest work is indispensably necessary in building up a
                    beam. The parts must abut on each other completely, and the smallest play or
                    void takes away the whole efficacy. It is usual to give the abutting joints a
                    small taper to one side of the beam, so that they may require moderate blows of
                    a maul to force them in, and the joints may be perfectly close when the external
                    surfaces are even on each side of the beam. But we must not exceed in the least
                    degree, for a very taper wedge has great force; and if the pieces be driven
                    together by very heavy blows, the whole is left in a state of violent strain,
                    and the abutments are perhaps ready to splinter off by a small addition of
                    pressure. It is not unusual to leave some abutments open enough to admit a thin
                    wedge reaching through the beam. Nor is this a bad practice, if the wedge is of
                    material which is not compressed by the driving or the strain of service. Iron
                    would be preferable for this purpose, and for the joggles, were it not that, by
                    its too great hardness, it cripples the fibres of timber to some distance. In
                    consequence of this it often happens, that in beams which are subjected to
                    desultory and sudden strains (as in the levers of reciprocating engines), the
                    joggles or wedges widen the holes, and work themselves loose; therefore skilful
                    engineers never admit them, and indeed admit as few bolts as possible, for the
                    same reason; but when resisting a steady or dead pull, they are not so improper,
                    and are frequently used.</p>
                <p>Beams are built up, not only to increase their dimensions in the direction of the
                    strain (which we have hitherto called their depth), but also to increase their
                    breadth, or the dimensions perpendicular-to the strain. Sometimes the breadth of
                    girder is doubled, if it is thought too weak for its load, and when the
                    thickness of the flooring must not be increased.</p>
                <p>The mast of a great ship of war must be made bigger athwartship, as well as fore
                    and aft. This is one of the nicest problems of the art; and professional men are
                    by no means agreed in their opinions in regard to it. We shall content ourselves
                    here with exhibiting the different methods. The most obvious and natural method
                    is that shown in Plate XXII. fig. 4. It is plain that (independent of the
                    connection of cross bolts, which are used in them all when the beams are square)
                    the piece C cannot bend in the direction of the plane of the figure without
                    bending the piece D along with it. This method is much used in the French navy;
                    but it is undoubtedly imperfect. Fig. 5 exhibits another method. The two halves
                    of the beam are tabled into each other in the same manner as in fig. 1. It is
                    plain that this will not be affected by any unequal swelling or shrinking,
                    because this is insensible in the direction of the fibres; but when bent in the
                    direction <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> the beam fig. 4 is weaker than bent in the
                    direction <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n531/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0531-0478"/><hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Each half of fig. 4
                    has, in every part of its length, a thickness greater than half the thickness of
                    the beam. It is the contrary in the alternate portions of the halves of fig. 5.
                    When one of them is bent in the direction AB, it is plain that it drags the
                    other with it by means of the cross butments of its tables, and there can be no
                    longitudinal sliding. But unless the work is accurately executed, and each
                    hollow completely filled up by the table of the other piece, there will be a
                    lateral slide along the cross joints sufficient to compensate for the curvature;
                    and this will hinder the one from compressing or stretching the other in
                    conformity to this curvature.</p>
                <p>The imperfection of this method is so obvious that it has seldom been practised;
                    but it has been combined with the other, as is represented in fig. 6, where the
                    beams are divided along the middle, and, the tables in each half are alternate,
                    and alternate also with the tables of the other half. Thus 1, 3, 4 are
                    prominent, and 5, 2, 6 are depressed. This construction evidently puts a stop to
                    both slides, and obliges every part of both pieces to move together, <hi
                    rend="italic">a b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c d</hi> show sections of the
                    built-up beam corresponding to AB and CD. No more is intended in this practice
                    by any intelligent artist, than the causing the two pieces to act together in
                    all their parts, although the strains may be unequally distributed on them.
                    Thus, in a built-up girder, the binding joists are frequently mortised into very
                    different parts of the two sides. But many seem to aim at making the beam
                    stronger than if it were of one piece; and this inconsiderate project has given
                    rise to many whimsical modes of tabling and scarfing.</p>
                <p>The practice in the British dockyards is somewhat different from any of these
                    methods. The pieces are tabled as in fig. 6, but the tables are not thin
                    parallelopipeds, but thin prisms. The two outward joints or visible seams are
                    straight lines, and the table 1 rises gradually to its greatest thickness in the
                    axis. In like manner, the hollow 5, for receiving the opposite table, sinks
                    gradually from the edge to its greatest depth in the axis. Plate XXII., fig. 7,
                    No. 1, represents a section of a round piece of timber built up in this way,
                    where the full line EF, GH is the section corresponding to AB of fig. 6, and the
                    dotted line EG, EH is the section corresponding to CD. This construction, by
                    making the external seam straight, leaves no lodgment for water, and looks much
                    fairer to the eye; but it appears to us that it does not give so firm a hold
                    when the mast is bent in the direction EH. The exterior part3 are most stretched
                    and most compressed by this bending; but there is hardly any abutment in the
                    exterior parts of these tables. In the very axis, where the abutment is the
                    firmest·, there is little or no difference of extension and compression. But
                    this construction has an advantage, which, we imagine, much more, than
                    compensates for these imperfections, at least in the case of a round mast; it
                    will draw together by hooping incomparably better than any of the others.</p>
                <p>Joggles of elm are sometimes used in the middle of the large tables of masts; and
                    when sunk into the firm wood near the surface, they must contribute much to the
                    strength. But it is very necessary to employ wood not much harder than the pine,
                    otherwise it will soon enlarge its bed and become loose, for the timber of these
                    large trunks is very soft.</p>
                <p>The most general reason for piecing a beam is to increase its length. This is
                    frequently necessary, in order to procure tie-beams for very wide roofs. Two
                    pieces must be scarfed together. Numberless are the modes of doing this, and
                    almost every master carpenter has his favourite nostrum. Some of them are very
                    ingenious; but here, as in other cases, the most simple are commonly the
                    strongest. We do not imagine that any, the most ingenious, is equally strong
                    with a tic consisting of two pieces of the same scantling laid over each other
                    for a certain length, and firmly bolted together. We acknowledge that this will
                    appear an artless and clumsy tie-beam, but it will be stronger than any that is
                    more artificially made up of the same thickness of timber. The next simplest and
                    most obvious scarfing is that represented in Plate XXII., fig. 8, Nos. 1 and 2.
                    If considered merely as two pieces of wood joined, it is plain that, as a tie,
                    it has but half the strength of an entire piece, supposing that the bolts (which
                    are the only connections) are fast in their holes. No. 2 requires a bolt in the
                    middle of the scarf to give it that strength, and in every other part is weaker
                    on one side or the other. If the bolts were sufficiently numerous and
                    sufficiently firm, so as to produce a great degree of adhesion or of friction
                    between the parts, this joint might be made almost as strong as the entire beam,
                    since there is nothing to prevent the co-operation of each side with the other
                    throughout its extent; but much of the strength would be lost if the bolts
                    became loose, even in an inconsiderable degree. But the bolts are very apt to
                    bend by the violent strain, and require to be strengthened by uniting their ends
                    by iron plates,—in which case it is no longer a wooden tie. The form of No. 1 is
                    better adapted to the office of a pillarthan No. 2, especially if its ends be
                    formed in the manner shown in the elevation No. 3. By the sally given to the
                    ends, the scarf resists an effort to bend it in that direction. Besides, the
                    form of No. 2 is unsuitable for a post, because the pieces by sliding on each
                    other by the pressure are apt to splinter off the tongue which confines their
                    extremity. Figs. 9 and 10 exhibit the most approved form of a scarf, whether for
                    a tie or for a post. The key represented in the middle is not essentially
                    necessary; the two pieces might simply meet square there. This form, without a
                    key, needs no bolts (although they strengthen it greatly), but, if worked very
                    true and close, and with square abutments, will hold together, and will resist
                    bending in any direction. But the key is a very great improvement, and will
                    force the parts together with perfect tightness, but it must not be over driven.
                    The form of fig. 9 is by far the best (it is sometimes said to be tabulated,
                    that is, to render the joints as close as possible, and the juncture more
                    independent of any bolts which might be placed similarly to those in fig. 8, No.
                    1),—because the triangle of fig. 10 is much more readily splintered off by the
                    strain or by the key than the square wood of fig. 9. It is far preferable for a
                    post, for the reason given in speaking of fig. 8, No. 1 and No. 2. Both may be
                    formed with a sally at the ends equal to the breadth of the key. In this shape
                    fig. 9 is well suited for joining the parts of the long corner posts of spires
                    and other wooden towers. Fig. 9, No. 2 differs from No. 1 only by having three
                    keys; the principle and the longitudinal strength are the same. The long scarf
                    of No. 2, tightened by the three keys, enables it to resist bending much
                    better.</p>
                <p>None of these scarfed tie-beams can have more than one third of the strength of
                    an entire piece, unless with the assistance of iron plates; for if the key be
                    made thinner than one-third, it has less than one-third of the fibres to pull by
                    We are confident, therefore, that when the heads of the bolts are connected by
                    plates, the simple form of fig. 8, No. 1, is stronger than those more ingenious
                    scarfings. It may be strengthened against lateral bending by a little tongue, or
                    by a sally, but cannot have both.</p>
                <p>The strongest of all methods of piecing a tie-beam would be to set the parts end
                    to end, and grasp them between other pieces on each side, as in Plate XXIII.,
                    fig. 1. This the ship-carpenter calls fishing a beam; it is a frequent practice
                    for occasional repairs. Perronet used it for the tie-beams or stretchers by
                    which he connected the opposite feet of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n534/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0534-0479"/> a centre, which was yielding to its load, and had
                    pushed aside one of the piers above 4 inches</p>
                <p>Where the beams stand square with each other, and the strains are square with the
                    beams and in the plane of the frame, the mortise and tenon is the most perfect
                    junction. A pin is generally put through both in order to keep the pieces
                    united, in opposition to any force which tends to part them. Every carpenter
                    knows how to bore the hole for this pin, so that it shall draw the tenon tight
                    into the mortise, and cause the shoulder to butt close, and make neat work; and
                    he knows the risk of tearing out the bit of the tenon beyond the pin, if he draw
                    it too much. We may just observe, that square holes and pins arc much preferable
                    to round ones for this purpose, bringing more of the wood into action, with less
                    tendency to split it.</p>
                <p>Ship-carpenters have an ingenious method of making long wooden bolts, not passing
                    completely through, which take a very fast hold, though not nicely fitted to
                    their holes, which they must not be, lest they should be crippled in driving.
                    They call it fox-tail wedging. They stick into the point of the bolt T, Plate
                    XXIII., fig 2, thin wedges of hard wood, so as to project a proper distance;
                    when these reach the bottom of the hole by driving the bolt, they split the end
                    of it, and squeeze it hard to the side. This may be practised with advantage in
                    carpentry. If the ends of the mortise are widened inwards, and a thin wedge be
                    put into the end of the tenon, it will have the same effect, and make the joint
                    equal to a dove-tail; but this risks the splitting the piece beyond the shoulder
                    of the tenon, which would be unsightly, and may be avoided by two <hi
                    rend="italic">very</hi> thin wedges <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and c being struck
                    in near its angles, projecting equally; at a very small distance within these
                    are to be placed two shorter ones δ, <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and more within
                    these if necessary. In driving this tenon, the wedges <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    and c will take first, and split off a thin slice, which will easily bend
                    without breaking. The wedges <hi rend="italic">b, d</hi> will act next, and have
                    a similar effect, and the others in succession. The thickness of all the wedges
                    taken together must be equal to the enlargement of the mortise towards the
                    bottom.</p>
                <p>When the strain is transverse to the plane of the two beams, great care must be
                    taken by the artist in placing his mortise A mortise in a girder for receiving
                    the tenon of a binding-joist of a floor should be as near the upper side as
                    possible, because the girder becomes concave on that side by the strain. But as
                    this exposes the tenon of the binding-joist to the risk of being torn off, we
                    are obliged to mortise further down. The form in Plate XXIII., fig. 3, generally
                    given to this joint is extremely judicious. The sloping part <hi rend="italic">a
                    b</hi> gives a very firm support to the additional bearing <hi rend="italic">e
                    d,</hi> without much weakening of the girder. This form should be copied in
                    every case where the strain has a similar direction</p>
                <p>The joint that most of all demands the careful attention of the artist is that
                    which connects the ends of beams, one of which pushes the other very obliquely,
                    putting it into a state of extension. The most familiar instance of this is the
                    foot of a rafter pressing on the tie-beam, and thereby <hi rend="italic"
                    >drawing</hi> it away from the other wall. When the direction is very oblique
                    (in which case the extending strain is the greatest), it is difficult to give
                    the foot of the rafter such a hold of the tie-beam as to bring many, of its
                    fibres into the proper action. There would be little difficulty if we could
                    allow the end of the tie-beam to project to a small distance beyond the foot of
                    the rafter; but, indeed, the dimensions which are given to tiebeams for other
                    reasons are always sufficient to give enough of abutment when judiciously
                    employed. Unfortunately this joint is very liable to fail from the effects of
                    the weather. It is much exposed, and frequently perishes by rot, or becomes so
                    soft and friable that a very small force is sufficient either for pulling the
                    filaments out of the tie-beam, or for crushing them together. We are therefore
                    obliged to secure it with particular attention, and to avail ourselves of every
                    circumstance of construction.</p>
                <p>One is naturally disposed to give the rafter a deep hold by a long tenon, but it
                    has been frequently observed in old roofs that such tenons break off. Frequently
                    they are observed to tear up the wood that is above them, and push their way
                    through the end of the tie-beam. This in all probability arises from the first
                    sagging of the roof, by the compression of the rafters and of the head of the
                    kingpost. The head of the rafter descends, and the angle with the tie-beam is
                    diminished by the rafter revolving round its step in the tie-beam. By this
                    motion the heel or inner angle of the rafter becomes a fulcrum to a very long
                    and powerful lever much loaded. The tenon is the other arm, very short; and
                    being still fresh, it is therefore very powerful. It therefore forces up the
                    wood that is above it, tearing it out from between the cheeks of the mortise,
                    and then pushes it along. Carpenters have therefore given up long tenons, and
                    give to the toe of the tenon a shape which abuts firmly, in the direction of the
                    thrust, on the solid bottom of the mortise, which is well supported on the under
                    side by the wall-plate. This form, represented in Plate XXIII., fig. 4, has no
                    tendency to tear up the end of the mortise. The tenon has a small portion <hi
                    rend="italic">a b</hi> cut perpendicular to the surface of the tie-beam, and the
                    rest <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> is perpendicular to the
                    rafter.</p>
                <p>But if the tenon is not sufficiently strong (and it is not so strong as the
                    rafter, which is thought not to be stronger than is necessary), it will be
                    crushed, and then the rafter will slide out along the surface of the beam. It is
                    therefore necessary to call in the assistance of the whole rafter. It is in this
                    distribution of the strain among the various abutting parts that the varieties
                    of joints and their merits chiefly consist. We can only mention a few here that
                    have met with most general approval.</p>
                <p>The aim in fig. 5, Plate XXIII., is to make the abutments exactly perpendicular
                    to the thrusts. The action is the same as against the joggle on the head or foot
                    of a king-post. This is a very effectual joint; it is not, however, much
                    practised. It is said that the sloping seam at the shoulder lodges water; but
                    the great reason seems to be a secret notion that it weakens the tie-beam. Fig.
                    6 exhibits a form that is more general, but certainly worse. The shoulder-joint
                    is sometimes formed like the dotted line <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">edef</hi><hi rend="italic">g</hi> of fig. 6. This is much more
                    agreeable to the true principle, and would be a very perfect method, were it not
                    that the intervals <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">df</hi> are so short that the little wooden triangles <hi
                    rend="italic">b ed, def</hi> will be easily pushed off their bases <hi
                    rend="italic">b d, df.</hi> Fig. 7, No. 1, seems to have the most general
                    approbation, but we fail to perceive its peculiar merits. It is the joint
                    recommended by Price, and copied into books of carpentry as the <hi
                    rend="italic">true joint</hi> for a rafter foot. The visible shoulder-joint is
                    flush with the upper surface of the tie-beam. The angle of the tenon at the tie
                    nearly bisects the obtuse angle formed by the rafter and the beam, and is
                    therefore somewhat oblique to the thrust. The inner shoulder <hi rend="italic"
                    >ac</hi> is nearly perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">b d.</hi> The lower angle
                    of the tenon is cut off horizontally as at <hi rend="italic">e d.</hi> Fig. 8 is
                    a section of the beam and rafter foot, showing the different shoulders. Fig. 7,
                    No. 2, is a simpler, and in our opinion a preferable joint. We observe it
                    practised by the most eminent carpenters for all oblique thrusts; but it surely
                    employs less of the cohesion of the tie-beam than might be used without
                    weakening it, at least when it is supported on the other side by the wall-plate.
                    Fig. 7, No. 3, is also much practised by the best carpenters. Fig. 9, No. 1, is
                    proposed by Mr Nicholson as preferable to fig. 7, No. 3, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n535/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0535-0480"/> because the abutment of the inner part is better
                    supported. This is certainly the case, but it supposes the whole rafter to go to
                    the bottom of the socket, and the beam to be thicker than the rafter. Some may
                    think that this will weaken the beam too much, when it is no broader than the
                    rafter is thick; in which case they think that it requires a deeper socket than
                    Nicholson has given it. Perhaps the advantages of Nicholson’s construction may
                    be had by a joint like fig. 9, No. 2.</p>
                <p>Whatever is the form of these butting joints, great care should be taken that all
                    parts bear alike; and the artist will attend to the magnitude of the different
                    surfaces. In the general compression the greater surfaces will be less
                    compressed, and the smaller will therefore change most. When all has settled,
                    every part should be equally close. Because great logs are moved with
                    difficulty, it is very troublesome to try the joint frequently to see how the
                    parts fit; therefore we must expect less accuracy in the interior parts. This
                    should make us prefer those joints whose efficacy depends chiefly on the visible
                    joint. It appears from all that has been said on <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>
                    this subject, that a very small part of the cohesion of the tie-beam is
                    sufficient for withstanding the horizontal thrust of a roof, even though very
                    low pitched. If, therefore, no other use is made of the tie-beam, one much
                    slenderer may be used, and blocks may be firmly fixed to the ends, on which the
                    rafters might abut, as they do on the joggles on the head and foot of a
                    king-post. A tie-beam may have to carry a floor or ceiling (sometimes the
                    workshops and store-rooms of a theatre), and therefore requires a great
                    scantling, but frequently beams have little to do, and contain an unnecessary
                    quantity of timber. It is therefore of importance to ascertain the most perfect
                    manner of executing such a joint, and we have directed the attention to the
                    principles that are really concerned in the effect. In all hazardous cases the
                    carpenter calls in the assistance of iron straps; and they are frequently
                    necessary, even in roofs, notwithstanding this superabundant strength of the
                    tie-beam. But this is generally owing to bad construction of the wooden joint,
                    or to the failure of it by time.</p>
                <p>There needs but little to be said of the joints at a joggle worked out of solid
                    timber; they are not near so difficult as the last. When the size of a log will
                    allow the joggle to receive the whole breadth of the abutting brace, it ought
                    certainly to be made with a square shoulder; or, which is still better, an arch
                    of a circle having the other end of the brace for its centre. Indeed, this in
                    general will not sensibly differ from a straight line perpendicular to the
                    brace. By this circular form the settling of the roof makes no change in the
                    abutment; but when there is not sufficient stuff for this, we must avoid bevel
                    joints at the shoulders, because these always tend to make the brace slide off.
                    The brace in Plate XXIII., fig. 10, No. 1, must not be joined as at <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> but as at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> or in some equivalent
                    manner.</p>
                <p>When the very oblique action of one side of a frame of carpentry does not extend,
                    but compresses, the piece on which it abuts, there is no difficulty in the
                    joint. Indeed a joining is unnecessary, and it is enough that the pieces abut on
                    each other; and we have only to take care that the mutual pressure be equally
                    borne by all the parts, and that it do not produce lateral pressures, which may
                    cause one of the pieces to slide on the butting joint. A very slight mortise and
                    tenon is sufficient at the joggle of a king post with a rafter or straining
                    beam. It is best, in general, to make the butting plain, bisecting the angle
                    formed by the sides, or else perpendicular to one of the pieces. In fig. 10, No.
                    2, where the straining beam <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> cannot slip away from the
                    pressure, the joint <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is preferable to <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> or indeed to any uneven joint, which never fails to produce very
                    unequal pressures on the different parts, by which some are crippled, others are
                    splintered off, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>When it is necessary to employ iron straps for strengthening a joint,
                    considerable attention is necessary that we may place them properly. The first
                    thing to be determined is the direction of the strain. This must be resolved
                    into a strain parallel to each piece, and another perpendicular to it; and then
                    the strap which is to be made fast to any of the pieces must be so fixed that it
                    shall resist in the direction parallel to the piece. Frequently this cannot be
                    done; but we must come as near to it as we can. We can hardly give any general
                    rules. Fig. 30 shows the nature of the strap or stirrup by which the king-post
                    carries the tie-beam. The strap that we observe most generally ill placed is
                    that which connects the foot of the rafter with the beam. It only binds down the
                    rafter, and does not act against its horizontal thrust. It should be placed
                    farther back on the beam, with a bolt through it, which will allow it to turn
                    round. It should embrace the rafter almost horizontally near the foot, and
                    should be notched square with the back of the rafter. It is represented in fig.
                    11, Plate XXIII. By moving round the eye-bolt, it follows the rafter, and cannot
                    pinch and cripple it, which it always does iu its ordinary form. We are of
                    opinion that straps which have eye-bolts in the very angles, and allow all
                    motion round them, are of all the most perfect. A branched strap, such as may at
                    once bind the king-post and the two braces which butt on its foot, will be more
                    serviceable if it have a joint. When a roof warps, those branched straps
                    frequently break the tenons, by affording a fulcrum in one of their bolts. An
                    attentive and judicious artist will consider how the beams will act on such
                    occasions, and will avoid giving rise to these great strains by levers. In the
                    foregoing reasoning upon the direction of straps, regard has been had especially
                    to the economizing of their immediate strength; but it may happen that the
                    principal purpose of the strap will be answered by its pressing the rafter
                    firmly upon the beam, and this effect may be produced by a certain deviation
                    from the horizontal position, with but little diminution of the strength of the
                    strap,—a deviation which has also the advantage of allowing the strap to embrace
                    the whole of the beam, without weakening it by driving a bolt through it. We
                    must not, however, run the risk of crippling the end of the . beam. A skilful
                    carpenter never employs many straps, considering them as auxiliaries foreign to
                    his art, and subject to imperfections in workmanship which he cannot discern or
                    amend. We must refer the reader to ^Nicholson’s <hi rend="italic">Carpenter and
                    Joiner’s Assistantiox</hi> a more particular account of the various forms of
                    stirrups, screwed rods, and other iron-work, for carrying tie-beams, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The diagrams of Plate XXIV. will illustrate the use of the before-described
                    joints on a smaller scale in the further operations of the carpenter’s work.</p>
                <p>Ordinary scarfing is the cutting away equally from the ends, but on the opposite
                    sides, of two pieces of timber, for the purpose of tying or connecting them
                    lengthwise, and is done to wall-plates and bond-timber. The usual mode is by
                    cutting about three-fifths through each piece on the upper face of the one and
                    the under face of the other, about 6 or 8 inches from the end, as in fig. 1,
                    Plate XXIV., transversely, making what is technically termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >calf ox kerf,</hi> and longitudinally from the end, from two-fifths down on the
                    same side, so that the pieces lap together with a sort of half dovetail.
                    Theheavy supervening weight of the wall and joists renders it impossible that
                    they should be drawn apart without tearing the fibres asunder or lifting the
                    weight. Nevertheless <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n538/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0538-0481"/> these joints are generally spiked, and it is
                    always required that they be made to fall in or under a pier. Notching is either
                    square or dovetailed; it is used in connecting the ends of wall-plates and
                    bond-timber at the angles, in letting joists down on beams or binders, purlines
                    on principal rafters, àc. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, fig. 2, show varieties of
                    notches applied as we have described No. 1 is a simple square notch; No. 2, a
                    dovetailed notch. No. 3 is the notch most commonly used; it is similar to No. 1,
                    but that the ends are allowed to run on so that the one piece grasps the other,
                    and each forms a cog to the other. No. 4 is an oblique-angled, dovetailed notch;
                    and No. 5 shows how joists are notched or let down on beams and binders, and
                    purlines on principal rafters. A notch is cut into the under edge of the joist
                    or purline an inch or an inch and a half in depth, and considerably shorter than
                    the beam, binder, or rafter is in thickness. Notches are also cut down on the
                    upper angles of the bearing pieces, as long as the rider is thick, as deep as
                    the notch before described of the latter is, and so far in as to leave a
                    thickness on its own edge equal to the length of the notch in the riding joist
                    or purline. In the diagram one joist is indicated in its place let down in the
                    notch, and another indicates the notch in its own edge, and leaves exposed the
                    notches in the binder. Cogging, or corking, as it is vulgarly termed, is the
                    last-mentioned species of notch extended on one side, and leaving a narrow tooth
                    or cog alone in the bearing-piece flush with its upper face, No. 1, fig. 3. It
                    is used principally in tailing joists and beams on wall-plates and templets, and
                    the cog is here made narrower, because the end of the joist or rider coming
                    immediately beyond the plate, that part which forms the shoulder of the notch
                    would be liable, on being strained, to be chipped off or torn away, if it were
                    not kept as long as possible; and it is not of so much importance to guard
                    against weakening a wall-plate which is supported along its whole length, as a
                    beam, binder, or principal rafter, which rests on distant points alone. No. 2 of
                    the same figure shows another mode of tailing on joists and beams by a dovetail
                    notch, which, to distinguish it from the flat notches, Nos. 2 and 4, fig. 2, is
                    called corking, or cogging also, though the operation certainly is not cogging.
                    This is a good mode if the timber be so well seasoned as not to be likely to
                    shrink more; but it would be improved by allowing the rider to take a bearing in
                    a notch like that to No. 1 before the dovetail commenced, as at No. 3, for in
                    the ordinary mode it is weakened in a point of great importance. Whatever
                    notches and cogs for beams and joists are required in wall-plates and templets,
                    should be made before tljey are set on or in a wall; for, as they are always
                    bedded in mortar, anything that may break the set must be avoided. A cog-hold is
                    best obtained through the agency of a chair of cast-iron, which should, however,
                    be itself cogged or joggled to a stone templet laid in the wall under it, and be
                    capped or covered by another broad flat stone, as an inverted templet, with a
                    joggle from the chair running up into it.</p>
                <p>Tenoning implies mortising also as a matter of course. They are the names of the
                    two operations necessary to one result,—that of producing a connection between
                    two pieces by inserting part of the end of one into a hole of similar size cut
                    in the side or face of the other. A tenon is formed by cutting in on each side
                    or edge of a piece of timber, near its end, transversely, to a certain depth, or
                    rather, leaving a certain part of the breadth or depth uncut, and then cutting
                    in longitudinally from the ends as far from each edge as the transverse cuts
                    have been made in depth, thus removing two square prisms and leaving a third
                    undivided. This is the tenon. An excavation in the side of a piece of timber, of
                    a certain depth, in the direction of its thickness, parallel to its edges, and
                    bounded lengthwise by lines at right angles to them, is a mortise. Tenons and
                    mortises are made of exactly corresponding size, and are most frequently at
                    equal distances from one or the other side or edge of the two pieces to be
                    conjoined; and for the most part, too, every angle formed in the process of
                    tenoning, both internal and external, is a right angle. Tenons are called
                    joggles in some situations, when they are not intended to be borne upon, and
                    their use is merely to keep the piece of timber to which they belong steadily in
                    its place, without being liable to slight accidents from lateral pressure or
                    violence. In combining timbers by means of mortises and tenons, to produce as
                    great a degree of strength as possible, it must be obvious that the object to be
                    kept in view is to maintain the end or tenon of the one as large and efficient
                    as it may be, and weaken the other as little as possible in forming the mortise.
                    For the efficiency of the mortised piece in a horizontal bearing, it is clear
                    that as much of its thickness should be below the mortise as possible, as at α,
                    fig. 4; for if it be put low, as at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the superincumbent
                    weight on the tenon would more readily split or rend it in the direction of the
                    grain, as indicated; but the case is inverted with the tenoned pieces. With the
                    mortise at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the tenon could only have the efficacy of so
                    much of the piece to which it belongs as there is of it above its under surface,
                    which is a very small part of its depth; whereas with the tenon at <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> it woιdd command the power of the greatest part of the
                    depth. To guard as much as possible against the danger of too great a mortise
                    and too small a tenon on one side and the other, and to obviate the difficulty
                    arising from the efficiency of one or the other of the two pieces being affected
                    by putting the tenon too high or too low, a compound, called a tusk tenon, is
                    used for almost all horizontal bearings of any importance, especially to joists
                    and binders, to trimmers, beams, girders, bressummers, &amp;c. The body of the
                    tenon in this is a little above the middle of the end, and it runs out 2, 3, or
                    4 inches, or more, as the case may require. Below it the tusk protrudes, and
                    above it the shoulder is cut down at an obtuse angle with the horizontal line,
                    giving the strength of the whole depth of the timber above the under tusk to the
                    tenon, and giving it a bearing in a shallow mortise, whilst a greater depth of
                    the mortised piece than the tusk rests on receives the body of the tenon, and so
                    protects its comparatively narrow margin from undue pressure. The diagram No. 1,
                    fig. 5, shows the tusk tenon, with the section of a beam into which it is
                    mortised, and No. 2 indicates perspectively the appearance of the mortise in
                    front. Pinning is the insertion of nearly cylindrical pieces of wood or iron
                    through a tenon, to detain it in the mortise, or prevent it from being drawn out
                    by any ordinary force. For this purpose the pin is inserted either in the body,
                    or beyond the thickness, of the mortised piece, as indicated at <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 5, or at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 6. Wedging
                    (see <hi rend="italic">b, b,</hi> No. 2, fig. 25) is the insertion of triangular
                    prisms, whose converging sides are under an extremely acute angle, into or
                    beside the end of a tenon, to make it fill the mortise so completely, or bind it
                    so tightly, that it cannot be easily withdrawn. The wedging of tenons also
                    assists in restoring to the mortised piece of timber much of the strength it had
                    lost by the excision of so much of its mass, which indeed the tenon itself does
                    if it fit closely in every direction; but the assistance of the wedge renders
                    the restoration more perfect than the tenon could secure of itself, by
                    compressing the fibres of both, longitudinally to those of the one, and
                    transversely to those of the other, thus removing the tendency of the mortised
                    piece to yield in any degree in the weakened part, though it cannot make up the
                    loss in its tenacity occasioned by the scission of its fibres.</p>

                    the most part struck out with the mallet and chisel, or adze, as may be most
                    convenient. Tenons should be made entirely with the saw. Mortises are generally
                    bored at the ends with an auger whose diameter equals their thickness; the
                    intervening part is taken out with a wide chisel, cutting in the direction of
                    the fibre; and the ends are squared down with a chisel whose breadth just equals
                    the thickness of the mortise. Wood pins must be rent to insure the equal
                    tenacity of their whole mass. Wedges are cut with the saw, but straight-grained
                    stuff is always preferred for them.</p>
                <p>Bond-timbers and wall-plates should be carefully notched together at every angle
                    and return, and scarfed at every longitudinal joint. The scarf shown at fig. 1,
                    Plate XXIV., is sufficient; and the notch at No. 3, fig. 2, may be preferred
                    where notching is required; neither pinniDg nor nailing, however, can be of
                    great use to either the notch or the scarf. Bond-timbers are passed along and
                    through all openings, and are not cut out until such openings are to be
                    permanently occupied, that is, by windows with their sash-frames, &amp;c.,
                    because they assist in preventing irregular settlements, by helping to carry the
                    weight of a heavy part along the substruction generally, instead of allowing it
                    to press unduly upon the part immediately under it.</p>
                <p>It is the duty of the carpenter to supply the bricklayer or mason with wood
                    bricks in sufficient quantity, and to direct him where they should be placed to
                    receive the joiner’s fittings, or the battening, which the carpenter himself may
                    have to put up for the plasterer.</p>
                <p>The carpenter makes and fixes or sets centres of all kinds, whether for single
                    arches or niches, or even in bridge construction. Large centres are framed in
                    distinct ribs, and are connected by horizontal ties; whilst small ones are made
                    of mere boards cut to the required sweep, nailed together, and connected by
                    battens notched into or nailed on their edges. Precision and stability are
                    nevertheless equally and absolutely necessary, as it is impossible for an arch
                    to be turned or set correctly on an incorrect or unstable centre.</p>
                <p>Descriptions of various sorts of flooring are noticed in the earlier part of this
                    article as for fireproof structures; and also under <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brickwork</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mason-work.</hi> The timbers or framework
                    of ordinary house and warehouse floors is called naked flooring, and it is
                    distinguished as single, double, and framed. Of these the first, under ordinary
                    circumstances, is the strongest.</p>
                <p>Single flooring (Plate XXV. figs. 1, 2) consists of one row or tier of joists
                    alone, bearing from one wall or partition to another, without any intermediate
                    support, and receiving the flooring boards on the upper surface or edges of the
                    joists, and the ceiling, if there be one, on the lower. Joists in single floors
                    should never be less than 2 inches in thickness, because of their liability to
                    be split by the brads or nails of the boards if they are thinner; and they
                    should never be much more, because of the keying of the ceiling, which is
                    injuriously affected by great thickness of the joists. Twelve inches from joist
                    to joist is the distance generally allowed; that dimension, however, from centre
                    to centre of the joists would be better Strength to almost any extent may be
                    given by adding to the depth of the joists, and diminishing the distance between
                    them; and they may be made firm, and be prevented from buckling or twisting, by
                    putting struts between them. The struts are short pieces of batten, fig. 31,
                    which should not be less than an inch, and need not be more than an inch and a
                    half thick, and 3 or 4 inches wide, placed diagonally between the joists, to
                    which they are nailed, in a double series, or crossing, as indicated by the full
                    and dotted lines in Plate XXIV.</p>
                <p>fig. 7; and they should be made to range in a right line, that none of their
                    effect may be lost; and these ranges or rows should be repeated at intervals not
                    exceeding 5 or G feet. The struts should be cut at the ends with exactly the
                    same inclination or bevel, to fit closely. Great care should be taken, too, not
                    to split the struts in nailing; but the trouble of boring with a gimlet is saved
                    by making a slight nick or incision with a wide-set saw for each nail, of which
                    there should not be less than two at each end; and the nails used should be
                    clasp-nails. If the struts were notched into the joists, as in fig. 32, it would
                    add very materially to their efficiency, but perhaps not in proportion to the
                    additional labour it would involve. This strutting should be done to single
                    flooring under any circumstances, as it adds materially to its firmness and
                    indeed to its strength, by making the joists transmit any stress or pressure
                    from one to another.</p>
                <p>The efficiency of single flooring is materially affected by the necessity which
                    constantly occurs in practice of trimming round fire-places and flues, and
                    across vacuities. Trimming is a mode of supporting the end of a joist by
                    tenoning it into a piece of timber crossing it, and called a trimmer, instead of
                    running it on or into the wall which supports the ends of the other joists
                    generally. A trimmer requires for the most part to be carried or supported at
                    one or both of its ends by some of the joists, which are called trimming joists,
                    and are necessarily made stouter than if they had to' bear no more than their
                    own share of the stress. Commonly it is found enough to make the trimmers and
                    trimming joists from half an inch to an inch thicker than common joists. In
                    trimming, tusk tenons should be used; and the long tongue or main body of, the
                    tenon should run not less than 2 inches through, and be draw-pinned and wedged,
                    moreover, if it do not completely fill the mortise in the direction of the
                    length of the latter.</p>
                <p>The principal objection, however, to single flooring is, that sound readily
                    passes through, the attachment of the boards above and of the ceiling below
                    being to the same joists throughout. Another objection, and one already referred
                    to, is the necessity of making the joists so thin, not to injure the ceilings,
                    that they with difficulty receive the flooring brads in their upper edges
                    without splitting. A partial remedy for both these disadvantages is found in a
                    mode sometimes adopted of making every third or fourth joist an inch or an inch
                    and a half deeper than the intervening joists; and to these, ceiling joists are
                    notched and nailed, or nailed alone, as shown in Plate XXIV. fig. 7. This, by
                    diminishing the number of points of contact between the upper and the lower
                    surface, for the ceiljng joists must be carefully kept from touching the
                    shallower joists of the floor, is less apt to convey sound from one story to
                    another, and allows conveniently thin joists to be used for the ceiling without
                    affecting those of the floor.</p>
                <p>Double flooring (see Plate XXIV. fig. 8, Nos. 1 and 2, and Plate XXV. fig. 3)
                    consists of three distinct series of joists, which are called binding, bridging,
                    and ceiling joists. The binders in this are the real support of the floor; they
                    run from wall to wall, and carry the bridging joists above and the ceiling
                    joists below them. Binders need not be less and should not be much more than 6
                    feet apart, that is, if the bridging or flooring joists are not inordinately
                    weak.' The bridging joists form the upper tier, and are notched down on the
                    binders with the notch No. 5, Plate XXIV. fig. 2. The ceiling joists range under
                    the binders, and are notched and nailed as shown at No. 1, fig. 8; but the notch
                    must be taken entirely out of the ceiling joists, forthe lower face or edge of
                    the binder may not be wounded by any means or on any account, and, moreover, no
                    good would be gained in any other respect by doing so. When <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n542/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0542-0483"/> it is an object to save height in the depth or
                    thickness of this species of floor, the ceiling joists may be tenoned into the
                    binders, instead of being nailed to them; in this case the latter must be
                    chase-mortised on one side, fig. 33, for the convenience of receiving the former
                    when they are themselves set and fixed. A chase is a long wedge-formed groove of
                    the breadth or thickness of the mortise, of which it is indeed an elongation, so
                    that the tenon at one end of the ceiling joist being inserted in the regular
                    mortise in the binder prepared for it, that at the other end is driven along the
                    chase up to its place in the mortise in the next binder. When ceiling joists are
                    thus chase-mortised, their lower or under faces are allowed to come a little
                    below the under face of the binders, and the space across is firred down by
                    slips not wider than the ceiling joists are thick. No. 2, fig. 8, shows a
                    transverse compartment, or bay, of a floor in this manner; but it is not so good
                    a one as the preceding; for, besides the weakening of the binders, by cutting so
                    many mortises and chases in them, it is almost impossible to give the ceiling
                    floor the degree of firmness and consistency it possesses in the other way,
                    besides requiring the firring down on the binders. The same space would be
                    better gained by cutting the bridging joists so much lower down; as they may,
                    with the sort of notch indicated above, be let down fully half their depth
                    without great injury to either bridging joists or binder, for they can always be
                    made to fit tightly or firmly, and very little more labour is involved in
                    notching deeply than slightly.</p>
                <p>Flooring is said to be framed when girders are used together with binding,
                    bridging, and ceiling joists (see Plate XXIV. fig. 9, Nos. 1 and 2, and Pl te
                    XXV. fig. 4). Girders are large beams, in one or more pieces, according to the
                    length required, and the size and strength of which timber can be procured. They
                    are intended for longer bearings than mere binders may be trusted at, and may be
                    strengthened by forming a built beam. The principle of constructing girders of
                    any depth, says Tredgold, in his <hi rend="italic">Carpentry,</hi> is the same
                    as that of building beams, and when properly conducted they are as strong as any
                    truss can be made of the same depth. The most simple method consists in
                    bolting,'two pieces together, with keys between to prevent the parts sliding
                    upon each other,—the upper one of hard compact wood, the lower of tough straight
                    grained wood. The joints should be at or near the middle of the depth; the
                    thickness of all the keys added together should be greater than one-third more
                    than the whole depth of the girder; and if they be made of hard wood, the
                    breadth should be about twice the thickness. They may be held together by bolts.
                    Fig. 34 is a good form held by bands, and, if the upper timber be cut so as to
                    be smaller towards the ends, would admit of these hoops being driven on till
                    perfectly tight. In fig. 35 the parts are tabled or indented together instead of
                    being keyed, and a king-bolt is added to tighten the joints. Girders may be
                    further strengthened to almost any extent by trussing; but to be efficient, the
                    height of the truss must always be greater than the depth of the beam itself,
                    and the strength is increased by extending that height as the space or bearing
                    increases. A truss is indeed a wooden arch, whose lateral thrust will of course
                    be greater the smaller the angle subtended by it, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> It has been a commonly received opinion, that a truss less than the
                    depth of a girder adds materially to its strength; but experiments have proved
                    that very little advantage is gained by such a one, even when executed in the
                    best manner, and that, badly executed, the beam or girder is weaker with the
                    truss than without it. In some situations the flooring joists can be raised to a
                    certain height to allow of the head of the truss, which is usually made of iron,
                    being placed at a sufficient height to be truly efficient. Such is the trussed
                    girder shown in fig. 36, intended for a great length. A common mode of
                    strengthening a beam or bressummer, is to cut the timber in hale longitudinally,
                    whereby any defects in the interior can be seen; then to reverse the pieces, end
                    for end, and bolt them well together. Some additional strength is obtained by
                    putting between the timbers a plate of wrought iron about the depth of the beam
                    and about half an inch in thickness, and then bolting the three together, as in
                    Plate XXIV. fig. 9, No. 3.</p>
                <p>Binders are made dependent on the girders by means of double tusk tenons, and on
                    and to them the bridging and ceiling joists are attached as above described.
                    Plate XXIV. fig. 9, No. 1, shows the transverse section of a compartment or bay
                    of a framed floor; No. 2 the same longitudinally of the girder and of the
                    bridging and ceiling joists, and transversely of the binders. Plate XXV. fig. 1,
                    is the plan of a single floor of joists tailing in on wall-plates with two
                    chains of struts, and trimmed to a fire-place. Fig. 2 is a floor similar to fig.
                    1, with ceiling joists nailed to deeper flooring joists at intervals, as in
                    Plate XXIV. fig. 7. Fig. 3 is the plan of a double floor; and fig. 4 is that of
                    a framed floor of joists, bays of which are shown in section in Plate XXIV.
                    figs. 8, 9. It is to be observed, with reference to the diagram fig. 9, No. 1,
                    that binders ought not to be framed into the girders opposite to one another, as
                    they are here shown to be as a matter of convenience, since the girder is unduly
                    weakened by being mortised on both sides at the same place. Cast-iron shoes
                    render mortising the one forming a tenon upon the other almost unnecessary; and
                    in like manner cast-iron shoes laid into a wall upon stone templets give a good
                    and safe bearing to the girders; but it is not everywhere that castiron shoes
                    are attainable, and mortises and tenons may be made anywhere.</p>
                <p>The above descriptions of the three sorts of flooring apply to floors which are
                    to have a ceiling as in house building, or may be left open, as usual in
                    warehouses. But in house building according to the practice of the mediaeval
                    period, these timbers would be left exposed. They would all require to be planed
                    smooth, the girders moulded, the binders partly so, and the joists perhaps only
                    stop-chamfered, which is done by cutting the arris of tho timber to an angle
                    along its whole length, but stopping short of the ends by a few inches, when it
                    is returned into the arris by a cant. The underside of the joists in a framed
                    floor may be lined with chamfered boarding or formed into panels and
                    ornamented,—a boltel or a set of mouldings forming a frame or cornice all round
                    against the binder. The girders would rest upon stone corbels, either moulded or
                    decorated with foliage or figures, or all three united. Viollet le Duc, in his
                    valuable <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire raisonné</hi><hi rend="italic">de l</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">Architecture,</hi> gives several examples of such a floor,

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0543-0484"/> of one of which we avail ourselves, from a house
                    at Rheims of the 15th century (fig. 37). He gives an example also of a floor
                    formed of a girder into which joists are laid formed of square timbers cut in
                    half through the diagonal. These are fixed close together like a succession of
                    v’s, thus vvvvv, and boarded over. The top of the angle space formed by two
                    joists is filled up with a small angle fillet presenting a flat surface. The
                    whole effect is unique.</p>
                <p>In mediaeval carpenters’ work it was always the rule only to mould the useful
                    members, and so it was also as regards the carving. Most of the old wood carving
                    is so contrived as to be wrought out of the same plank or thickness as that
                    which is moulded, or else is a separate piece of wood, in a spandril for
                    instance, enclosed within the constructional members. In joining their work,
                    which was of oak, they trusted entirely to tenoning and pinning with stout oak
                    pins.</p>
                <p>Although cast-iron columns and stanchions have for some years been preferred to
                    timber posts as supports to girders of warehouse floors, lately the latter have
                    again come into use from their known greater resistance to fire, whereas
                    cast-iron soon succumbs to the great heat and the effects of water upon it. Such
                    posts are usually made of fir or of oak, the dimensions of which vary according
                    to their compound of crushing force and stiffness which is as 25 to 40. The caps
                    to them should be long, so that they may not press into the girders, and if
                    practicable, iron dowels should pass through the girders to catch the bases of
                    the posts in the floor above.</p>
                <p>Partitions of timber are called quartering partitions, and they are generally
                    framed. Common quartering partitions, which rest on a wall or floor, and have
                    nothing to carry, consist merely of a sill, a head, and common uprights called
                    studs to receive the lath for plastering; these last may be simply joggled or
                    tenoned into the head and sill, as shown in Plate XXIV. fig. 4, c, and stiffened
                    by struts or stretching pieces put between them and nailed. When, however, a
                    quartering partition is over a vacuity, or rests only on certain points, and
                    has, moreover, to sustain a weight, a floor perchance, it is framed and trussed
                    with king or queen posts and trussing pieces as to the tie-beam of a roof, and
                    is thence called a trussed partition; and the filling in of common uprights or
                    quarters for the laths is generally performed by joggling them at one end into
                    either head or sill, and nailing them securely to the trussing pieces. In the
                    diagram, Plate XXV. fig. 5, it is supposed that an opening or doorway is to be
                    made in the partition, so that the timbers of the truss are placed around it
                    with queenposts, and a small internal truss is put over the door-head to prevent
                    it from sagging, and to carry the long part of the partition, which we supposed
                    required to bear a floor, so that the partition acts also, in fact, the part of
                    a trussed girder in the most available form. Pig. 6 presents another method of
                    framing a similar partition. Such partitions should be set up in every story
                    before the beams and joists of the floors are laid, that their horizontal
                    timbers may be notched on to the wall-plates, and that the joists or binders may
                    be notched on to them if occasion require it; but they should be fixed rather
                    below than above the level of the wall-plates, because they are not liable to
                    settle down so much as the walls, though even that will depend in a great degree
                    on the nature of the walling, and its liability to yield. As the whole weight on
                    partitions is supported by the principal posts, their scantlings must be first
                    considered, which should be done in two different ways: first, when the studs
                    are to be filled in with brickwork and rendered thereon, when they are called
                    brick-nog partitions; or secondly, when they are to be lathed and plastered on
                    both sides, or to be wainscoted. Thin partitions of wood only are called framed
                    partitions and are considered in the portion relating to the joiner.</p>
                <p>Roofing is another very important branch of the art of carpentry. The most simple
                    form is a shed-roof or lean-to, which is merely obtained by pieces of wood being
                    laid across in the position of an inclined plane to throw off the water.
                    Rectangular buildings are usually covered by a roof in the form of a prism, the
                    vertical section of which is an isosceles triangle. The height of this, or as it
                    is technically called, the pitch of a roof, has varied in different ages, to
                    suit the exigencies of the climate or the taste of the designer. A few examples
                    showing the insertion of the foot of a principal rafter into a tie-beam, the
                    struts into a post, and the heads of struts, are given in Plate XXIII.</p>
                <p>To relate all the specialities which the carpenter may have to do in some
                    particular buildings, as a church, for instance, would far exceed our limits.
                    The mode of executing such things would be the same as already described, the
                    style only making a difference in the result. Pewing or benching—the pulpit and
                    reading-desk, stalls, screen work, font cover, gallery front, &lt;fcc.—all
                    depend on the architect’s designs. Again, shop fronts are now almost a
                    speciality, together with shop-fittings; and among the minor things in a house
                    are the cupboards, closets, bath, cisterns, kitchen-dresser, plate-rack,
                    dust-bin when not of wholly of brick,—also stable fittings if the improved iron
                    fittings be not used. Centering for arches and for bridges, wharf-walls, spires,
                    turrets, belfries, church bell hangings, gables, are all embraced in carpenter’s
                    work, as well as timber houses, the manner of framing which, and the names of
                    the different timbers, will be found described in Le Muet’s work (1747) and
                    others of that period, and illustrated in many valuable publications, by Nash,
                    Richardson, Habershon, Clayton, Viollet de Due, Parker, Dollman, and others; and
                    not least of such works in timber are the barn, porches, lych gates, palings,
                    with chests and presses, and tables and chairs formerly.</p>
                <p>Pugging floors, firring down joists, bracketing and cradling for plastering, and
                    some other things, are operations performed indifferently by the carpenter or
                    the joiner, as less or greater precision is required in the performance.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Joinery.</hi></p>
                <p>Joinery is one of the useful arts which contributes most materially to the
                    comfort and convenience of man. As the arts of joinery and carpentry are often
                    followed by the same individual, it appears at first view natural to conclude
                    that the same principles are common to both these arts; but a closer examination
                    of their objects leads to a different conclusion. The art of carpentry is
                    directed almost wholly to the support of weight or pressure, and therefore its
                    principles must be found in the mechanical sciences. In a building it includes
                    all the rough timberwork necessary for support, division, or connection; and its
                    proper object is to give firmness and stability. The art of joinery has for its
                    object the addition in a building of all the fixed wood-work necessary for
                    convenience or ornament. The joiner’s works are many of them of a complicated
                    nature, and require to be executed in an expensive material; therefore joinery
                    requires much skill in that part of geometrical science which treats of the
                    projection and description of lines, surfaces, and solids, as well as an
                    intimate knowledge of the structure and nature of wood. A man may be a good
                    carpenter without being a joiner at all; but he cannot be a joiner without being
                    competent, at least, to all the operations required in carpentry. The rough
                    labour of the carpenter renders him in some degree unfit to produce that kind of
                    accurate and neat workmanship which is expected from a modern joiner; but it is
                    no less true, that the habit of neatness and the great precision of the joiner
                    make him a much slower and less profitable workman than the practised carpenter
                    in works of carpentry. In carpentry, as before observed, framing owes its
                    strength to the form and position of its parts; but in joinery, the strength of
                    a frame depends upon the strength of the joinings. The importance, therefore, of
                    fitting the joints together as accurately as possible is obvious. It is very
                    desirable that a joiner should be a quick workman, but it is still more so that
                    he should be a good one; that he should join his materials with firmness and
                    accuracy; that he should make surfaces even and smooth, mouldings true and
                    regular, and the parts intended to move so that they may be used with ease and
                    freedom. It is also of the greatest importance that the work, when thus put
                    together, should be constructed of such sound and dry materials, and on such
                    principles, that the whole should bear the various changes of temperature and of
                    moisture and dryness, so that the least possible shrinkage or swelling should
                    take place.</p>
                <p>In early times very little that resembles modern joinery was known; every part
                    was rude, and joined in the most artless manner. The first dawnings of the art
                    appear in the thrones, stalls, pulpits, and screens of our cathedrals and
                    churches; but even in these it is of the most simple kind, and is indebted to
                    the carver for everything that is worthy of regard. Whether iu these monuments
                    the carver and the joiner had been one and the same person we cannot now
                    determine, though we imagine, from the mode of joining in some of them, that
                    this was the case. With the revival of classic art great changes took place in
                    every sort of construction. Forms began to be introduced in architecture which
                    could not be executed at a moderate expense without the aid of new principles,
                    and these principles were discovered and published by practical joiners. As
                    might naturally be expected, these authors had but confused notions, with their
                    scanty geometrical knowledge; and, accordingly, their descriptions are often
                    obscure, and sometimes erroneous. The change from the heavy mullioned casement
                    and its guard of iron bars to the sash windows necessitated some new method of
                    protection, and boxing shutters were invented. The framed wainscot of small
                    panels gave way to the large bolection moulded panelling. Heavy doors, which
                    were fomerly hung on massive posts, or in jambs of cut stone, were now framed in
                    light panels, and hung in moulded dressings of wood. The scarcity of oak timber,
                    and the expense of working it, led to the importation of fir timber from the
                    north, which gradually superseded all other material except for the choicest
                    works. But the art is still far short of perfection, and in some respects it
                    seems to have retrograded. It is seldom that large glued-up panels will now
                    stand well. Mouldings of great girth givo at the mitres, doors wind, and
                    skirtings shrink from the floors in a way seldom seen in old houses. The sashes,
                    perhaps, are made better than the heavy barred windows of a century and a half
                    ago. In no other respect, however, has joinery made the progress which has been
                    made in other arts. The improved state of machinery has also done but little for
                    its excellence, though the circular saw-bench, the planing-machines, the
                    moulding-machines, and the mortising-machines have done much to reduce the cost
                    of labour. This last machine was suggested in the seventh edition of this work
                    (1830), attention having been drawn to the subject from the improvements in the
                    art of blockmaking, and it is now used in most of the large establishments
                    throughout the country.</p>
                <p>The joiner operates with saws, planes, chisels, gouges, hatchet, adze, gimblets,
                    and other boring instruments (which are aided and directed by chalked lines),
                    gauges, squares, hammers, mallets, and a great many other less important tools;
                    and his operations are principally sawing and planing in all their extensive
                    varieties, setting out, mortising, dovetailing, &amp;c. Descriptions of the
                    tools, with instructions for using them, may be found in Moxon’s <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">Mechanical Exercises,</hi> London, 1812.</p>
                <p>There is likewise a great range of other operations, none of which can be called
                    unimportant, such as paring, gluing up, wedging, pinning, fixing, fitting, and
                    hanging, and many things besides which depend on nailing, &lt;fcc., such as
                    laying floors, boarding ceilings, wainscoting walls, bracketing, cradling,
                    firring, and the like. In addition to the wood on which the joiner works, he
                    requires also glue, nails, brads, screws, and hinges,—and accessorily he applies
                    bolts, locks, bars, and other fastenings,—together with pulleys, lines, weights,
                    white-lead, hold-fasts, wall-hooks, &lt;fcc., &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>The joiners’ work for a house is for the most part prepared at the shop, where
                    every convenience may be supposed to exist for doing everything in the best and
                    readiest manner; so that little remains to be done when the carcass is ready,
                    but to fit, fix, and hang, that is, after the floors are laid. The sashes and
                    frames, the shutters, back flaps, backs, backs and elbows, soffits, grounds,
                    doors, &lt;kc., are all framed and put together, that is, wedged up and cleaned
                    off, at the shop; the flooring boards are prepared, that is, faced, shot, and
                    gauged with a fillister rebate; and the architraves, pilasters, jamb linings,
                    skirtings, mouldings, &lt;fcc., are all got out, that is, tried up, rebated, and
                    moulded, at the shop. The joiner very often turne the house he has to fit up
                    into a workshop <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> benches, and a fire for his
                    glue-pot, are nearly all he requires, should he not have the now usual “general
                    joiner” machine.</p>

                <p>There is no art in which it is required that the structure and properties of wood
                    should be so thoroughly understood as in joinery. The practical joiner, who has
                    made the nature of timber his study, has always a most decided advantage over
                    those who have neglected this most important part of the art.</p>
                <p>It is well known that wood contracts less in proportion, in diameter, than it
                    does in circumference; hence a whole tree always splits in drying. Mr Knight has
                    shown that, in consequence of this irregular contraction, a board may be cut
                    from a tree that can scarcely be made by any means to retain the same form and
                    position when subjected to various degrees of heat and moisture. From the ash
                    and the beech he cut some thin boards in different directions relatively to
                    their tranverse septa, so that the septa crossed the middle of some of the
                    boards at right angles, and lay nearly parallel with the surfaces of others.
                    Both kinds were placed in a warm room, under perfectly similar circumstances.
                    Those which had been formed by cutting across the tranverse septa, as at A in
                    fig. 38, soon changed their form very considerably, the one side becoming
                    hollow, and the other round; and in drying, they contracted nearly 14 per cent,
                    in width. The other kind, in which the septa were nearly parallel to the
                    surfaces of the boards, as at B, retained, with very little variation, their
                    primary form, and did not contract in drying more than 3i per cent, in width.
                    <hi rend="italic">{Philosophical Transactions,</hi> part ii. for 1817; <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine,</hi> vol. 1. p. 437.)</p>
                <p>As Mr Knight had not tried resinous woods, two specimens were cut from a piece of
                    Memel timber; and to render the result of the observations more clear, conceive
                    fig. 38 to represent the section of a tree, the annual rings being shown by
                    circles. BD represents the manner in which one of our pieces was cut, and AC the
                    other. The board AC contracted 3'75 per cent, in width, and became hollow on the
                    side marked <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The board BD retained its original
                    straightness and contracted only 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 per cent.
                    The difference in the quantity of contraction is still greater than in hard
                    woods. From these experiments, the advantages to be obtained merely by a proper
                    attention in cutting out boards for panels, &amp;c., will be obvious; and it
                    will also be found that panels cut so that the septa are nearly parallel to
                    their faces, will appear of a finer and more even grain, and require less labour
                    to make their surfaces even and smooth. But as this system would necessitate the
                    rejection of all but the heart of the tree for superior work, a method has been
                    adopted which it is said was first used by the billiard-table makers. Let AC,
                    fig. 39, represent the piece above referred to by the same letters. It will
                    become hollow on the side marked <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> no doubt because the
                    rings of the wood when cut across are relieved from tension, and endeavour to
                    expand themselves. To counteract this it is customary, in all good work, to rip
                    the plank down the centre, and then to “turn the stuff inside out” as it is
                    popularly called. This is done by reversing the wood, end for end, so as to
                    bring the heart against heart, and the outside against outside, as is shown in
                    fig. 40 (without which the glue joints are sometimes liable to fly), and also so
                    as to reverse the circular parts of the grain.</p>
                <p>In wood that has the larger transverse septa, as the oak, for example, boards cut
                    as BD will be figured, while those cut as AC will be plain.</p>
                <p>There is another kind of contraction in wood whilst drying, which causes it to
                    become curved in the direction of its length. In the long styles of framing we
                    have often observed it; indeed, on this account, it is difficult to prevent the
                    style of a door, hung with centres, from curving, so as to rub against the jamb.
                    A very satisfactory reason for this kind of curving has been given by Mr Knight,
                    which also points out the manner of cutting out wood, so as to be less subject
                    to this defect, which it is most desirable to avoid. The interior layers of
                    wood, being older, are more compact and solid than the exterior layers of the
                    same tree; consequently, in drying, the latter contract more in length than the
                    former. This irregularity of contraction causes the wood to curve in the
                    direction of its length, and it may be avoided by cutting the wood so that the
                    parts of each piece shall be as nearly of the same age as possible. But as this
                    would also necessitate the rejection of a great deal of stuff, a simpler method
                    is found, which is always to turn the heart of the wood outwards. Thus, in
                    framing a door, the heart should always go against the jambs, and the sap side
                    to the panels.</p>
                <p>Besides the contraction which takes place in drying, wood undergoes a
                    considerable change in bulk with the variations of the atmosphere. In
                    straight-grained woods the change in length is nearly insensible, and hence they
                    are sometimes employed for pendulum rods; but the lateral dimensions vary so
                    much that a wide piece of wood will serve as a rude hygrometer. The extent of
                    variation decreases in a few seasons, but it is of some importance to the joiner
                    to be aware that even in very old wood, when the surface is removed, the extent
                    of variation is nearly the same as in new wood.</p>
                <p>It appears from Rondelet’s experiments <hi rend="italic">(R’Ärt</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de bâtir,</hi> article “Menuiserie,” tom. iv. p. 425, 1814), that
                    in wood of a mean degree of dryness, the extent of contraction and expansion,
                    produced by the usual changes in the state of the atmosphere, was, in fir wood,
                    from ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> to <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ⅛ of its width, and in oak, from <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi> ⅛ to ⅛∙ Consequently, the mean extent of variation in fir is <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>, and in oak, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ∣- <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi>; and, at this mean
                    rate, in a fir board about 12⅜ inches wide, the difference in width would be
                    -⅛th of an inch. This will show the importance of attending to the maxims of
                    construction we have already laid before the reader; for, if a board of that
                    width should be fixed at both edges, it must unavoidably split from one end to
                    the other.</p>
                <p>The kinds of wood commonly employed in joinery are —the oak, the different
                    species of pine, mahogany, and sometimes lime-tree and poplar. Of the oak there
                    are two species common in Britain; that which Linnaeus has named <hi
                    rend="italic">Quercus Robur</hi> is the most valuable for joiners’ work; it is
                    of a finer grain, less tough, and not so subject to twist as the other kind. Oak
                    is also imported from the Baltic ports, from Germany (that known as wainscot),
                    and from America. These foreign kinds being free from knots, of a straighter
                    grain, and less difficult to work, they are used in preference to British
                    species. The greater part of joiners’ work is executed in fir imported from the
                    north of Europe. Yellow fir is used for outside work, as doors and sashes, and
                    for floors where there is likely to be much wear. Very good red pine deals have
                    been imported from Canada. Inside work is almost always framed of white fir.
                    Some very good panels when not too wide, and excellent mouldings, are made of
                    American pine. White fir is often used for internal work, and yellow pine is
                    much used for mouldings. The forest of Braemar, in Aberdeenshire, furnishes
                    yellow fir of an excellent quality, little inferior to the best foreign kinds.
                    For the general purposes of joinery, the wood of the larch seems to be the best;
                    this useful tree thrives well on the Scottish hills. Some fine specimens of it
                    have been obtained from Blair-Athol<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n546/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0546-0487"/>. It makes excellent steps for stairs, floors,
                    framing, and most other articles. Mahogany, in joinery, is only used where
                    painted work is improper, as for the hand-rails of stairs, or for the doors and
                    windows of principal rooms. For doors it is not now so often used as it was
                    formerly, its colour being found to be too gloomy to be employed in large
                    masses. Lime-tree, and the different species of poplar, make very good floors
                    for inferior rooms; and may often be used for other purposes, in places where
                    the carriage of foreign timber would render it more expensive. Lime-tree is
                    valuable for carved work, and does not become worm-eaten; but carving is at
                    present seldom used in joinery.</p>
                <p>From these timbers, the oak and fir especially, the joiner obtains the battens,
                    fillets, boards, and planks, with which he performs all his works, cutting them
                    into scantlings and thin deals as he requires them.</p>
                <p>Battens are narrow boards running from half .an inch to an inch and a half or 2
                    inches thick, and from 3 to 6 or 7 inches wide. A piece of stuff of too small a
                    scantling to be a batten is called a fillet. The term board is applied to sawed
                    stuff when its width exceeds that of a batten, and its thickness does not exceed
                    2 inches or 2⅜ inches. The term plank is applied to large pieces of stuff whose
                    width is great in proportion to their thickness, and whose thickness
                    nevertheless does not exceed 3 or 4 inches. In London these terms are used in
                    much more restricted senses than they are here described to mean, because of the
                    fixed and regular sizes and forms in which stuff for the joiner’s use is for the
                    most part brought to market there. A batten, to a London joiner, is a fine
                    flooring board from an inch to an inch and a half in thickness, and just 7
                    inches wide. A board is a piece cut from the thickness of a deal whose width is
                    exactly 9 inches; and nearly everything above that width, and not large enough
                    to be called a scantling of timber, is a plank.</p>
                <p>Mouldings, in the Roman and Italian styles, as used in joinery, are generally
                    composed of parte of circles, and differ somewhat from those used in stone. (See
                    Plates XIII., &amp;c., illustrating the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Architecture,</hi> in vol. ii.) Mouldings are almost the only part of modern
                    joiners’ work which can, in strictness, be called ornamental, and consequently
                    that in which the taste of the workman is most apparent. The form of them should
                    be distinct and varied, forming a bold outline of a succession of curved and
                    flat surfaces, disposed so as to form distinct masses of light and shade. If the
                    mouldings be of considerable length, a greater distinction of parts is necessary
                    than in short ones. Those for the internal part of a building should not,
                    however, have much projection; the proper degree of shade may always be given,
                    with better effect, by deep sinkings judiciously disposed. The light in a room
                    is not sufficiently strong to relieve mouldings, without resorting to this
                    method; and hence it is that quirked and under-cut mouldings are so much
                    esteemed. The following present the convex side to the eye fig. 41 is merely a
                    rounded edge; fig. 42, of small size, is a bead; fig. 43, of larger size, a
                    torus; and fig. 44 shows the torus and bead together. If there be a deep sinking
                    under a bead (as fig. 45), it is called a quirked or cock bead; if there be two
                    such sinkings, so as to show three-quarters of a circle in the bead, it is
                    called (fig. 46) a double-quirked bead; two or more beads, side by side fas fig.
                    47) are called reeds; the fourth part of a circle, or half a bead (as fig. 48),
                    is called an ovolo, or quarter round. A moulding composed of two convex parts is
                    also called an ovolo, the upper part of the curve being continued round into the
                    bed similar to a quirk, as fig. 44. In concave mouldings a simple curved
                    grooving, as fig. 49, is called a hollow, and two or more such grooves are
                    flutes, as fig. 50. A hollow forming the fourth part of a circle is called a
                    cavetto, fig. 51; a deep hollow between two fillets, as used in base mouldings,
                    is a scotia, fig. 52. Mouldings which are partly convex and partly concave, are
                    of two sorts, the cyma recta, as figs. 53 and 54, and the cyma reversa or ogee,
                    as figs. <hi rend="italic">55</hi> and <pb break="no"

                    projection. Grecian mouldings are all similar in principle, but the parts are of
                    conic sections instead of circles, as explained above, p. 473.</p>
                <p>A plain square sinking on the edge of a board, as fig. 57, for the purposes of
                    framing, is called a rebate; if away from the edge, as fig. 58, a groove; placed
                    under a cap (as fig. 59), or as a necking (as fig. 60), it is called a fillet;
                    three such fillets under an ovolo, when composing part of the capital of a
                    column, are called annulets. In all kinds of framing the mouldings which rise
                    above the styles are called bolection mouldings (see fig. 82).</p>
                <p>The mouldings during the mediaeval period used by the carpenter and joiner, who
                    were perhaps the same person, seldom varied from those cut by the mason, except
                    that they were somewhat more refined and less in size, as appropriate to the
                    material out of which they were to be cut. “They are such as would not be
                    executed in any other material; they are sharp, delicate, minute, and quaintly
                    under-cut. Every curve is subtle; every alternation of round and flat and hollow
                    thoughtfully contrived, graceful, and yet vigorous; they are very often unlike
                    any stone mouldings,” says Mr G. E. Street, in a lecture in 1865 on “English
                    Woodwork in the 13th and 14th Centuries,” printed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions of the Royal Institute</hi> o∕ <hi rend="italic">British
                    Architects.</hi> “In the stalls at Selby there is an elaborate cap only 1⅜
                    inches in height; and at Winchester a band ∣ths of an iuch in height, and yet
                    consisting of four distinct members, and showing in elevation as many as eight
                    distinct lines.” The woodcuts appended will suffice to explain the author’s
                    meaning. Fig. 61 is a mullion from stalls at Winchester Cathedral, and fig. 62
                    from St Mary’s Hospital at Chichester. Figs. 63 and 64 are arch mouldings from
                    the same stalls; and fig. 65, the cornice of a screen in Old Shoreham church.

                <p>When an inclined or raking moulding is intended to join with a level moulding, at
                    either an exterior or an interior angle, the form of the level moulding being
                    given, it is necessary that the form of the inclined moulding should be
                    determined, so that the corresponding parts of the surfaces of the two mouldings
                    should meet in the same plane, this plane being the plane of the mitre. This may
                    be otherwise expressed by saying that the mouldings should mitre truly
                    together.</p>
                <p>When the length of a joint at an angle is not considerable, it is sufficient to
                    cut the joint in such a manner that when the parts are joined, the plane of the
                    joint shall bisect the angle. This kind of joint is shown for two different
                    angles, by fig. 67, and is called a mitre. When an angle of considerable length
                    is to be joined, and the kind of work does not require that the joining should
                    be concealed, fig. 68 is often employed; the small bead renders the appearance
                    of the joint less objectionable, because any irregularities from shrinkage are
                    not seen in the shade of the quirk of the bead. A bead upon an angle, where the
                    nature of the work does not determine it to be an arris, is attended with many
                    advantages; it is less liable to be injured, and admits of a secure joint
                    without the appearance of one. Fig. 69 shows a joint of this description, which
                    should always be used in passages. Fig. 70 represents a very good joint for an
                    exterior angle, whether it be a long or a short one. Such a joint may be nailed
                    both ways. But the joint represented by fig. 71 is superior to it; the parts,
                    being drawn together by the form of the joint itself, can be fitted with more
                    accuracy, and joined with certainty. The angles of pilasters are often joined by
                    this last method. Interior angles are commonly joined as shown in fig. 72. If
                    the upper or lower edge be visible, the joint is mitred, as in fig. 67, at the
                    edge only, the other part of the joint being rebated, as in fig. 70. In this
                    manner are put together the skirting and dado at the interior angles of rooms,
                    the backs and backlinings of windows, the jambs of door-ways, and various other
                    parts of joiners’work. Fig. 73 is an excellent method of joining angles for
                    drawers, frames for lead cisterns, boxes, <pb break="no"

                    called a dovetail. If a portion of the junction is cut off at an angle of 45°,
                    as fig. 74, while the portion at <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is dovetailed, it is

                    fig. 76, the angles being brought together at an angle of 45°, two or more saw
                    curfs are cut with a dovetail saw, and thin pieces of wood glued in as shown;

                <p>Glue is a viscid tenacious matter used as a cement to connect objects together.
                    The common or animal glue is made from certain portions of animals reduced after
                    certain processes by boiling to the required consistency, and dried in cakes.
                    The best marine glue is composed of caoutchouc dissolved in naphtha, to which
                    shellac is added, and heated until amalgamated. It is insoluble in water,
                    sufficiently solid to give strength, and adhesive to an intense degree. Glue is
                    used principally in putting framed work together, but not at all in fixing; and
                    even for the former purpose it is much less used by good workmen than by
                    bungling hands. When the stuff is well seasoned, and the trying up, setting out,
                    mortising, and tenoning are well and accurately executed, there is no necessity
                    for glue on the tenons and shoulders; the wedges alone need be glued, to attach
                    them to the sides of the tenons, that their effect may not depend on mere
                    compression. Joiners are generally furnished with a cramp, with which to force
                    the joints of framing into close contact; it is either of wood acting by means
                    of wedges, or of iron with a screw. This, too, is unnecessary with good work,
                    every joint of which may be brought perfectly close without great violence of
                    any kind. The cramp will sometimes give bad work the semblance of good, but it
                    cannot make it really so. If any cracking and startiug be heard in the joiner’s
                    work of a new building, it generally indicates one of two things: either the
                    cramp has been required in putting the framing together, or, having been put
                    together, it has' been forced out of winding in fixing, and the constrained
                    fibres are seeking to regain their natural position. A good workman does not
                    require cramp, nor will his work, if he has been supplied with seasoned stuff,
                    ever require to be strained; and consequently the cracking and starting of
                    joiners’ work indicate unfit stuff or bad work, or perhaps both, It is true that
                    glued joints will sometimes fly; but when they do, there need be no hesitation
                    in determining the presence of both bad work and stuff* in an improper
                    state.</p>
                <p>It is seldom possible to procure boards sufficiently wide for panels without a
                    joint, on account of heart shakes, which open in drying. In cutting out panels,
                    for good work, shaken wood should be carefully avoided. That part near the pith
                    is generally the most defective. If the panels be thick enough to admit of a
                    cross or feather tongue in the joint, one should always be inserted, for then,
                    if the joint should fail, the surfaces will be kept even, and it will prevent
                    light passing through. A very good way also is to glue a piece of strong canvas
                    on the back of the panel when the work is not intended to be seen on both sides.
                    Sometimes plane surfaces of considerable width and length are introduced in
                    joiners’ work, as in dado, window backs, &lt;fcc.; such surfaces are commonly
                    formed of inch or inch and quarter boards joined with glue, and a cross or
                    feather tongue ploughed into each joint. When the boards are glued together, and
                    have become dry, tapering pieces of wood, called keys, are grooved in across the
                    back with a dovetailed groove. These keys preserve the surface straight, and
                    also allow it to shrink and expand with the changes of the weather. It would be
                    an endless task to describe all the methods that have been employed to glue up
                    bodies of such varied forms as occur in joinery; for every joiner forms methods
                    of his own, and merely from his being most familiar with his own process, he
                    will perform his work, according to it, in a better manner than by another,
                    which to an unprejudiced mind has manifestly the advantage over it. The end and
                    aim of the joiner, in all these operations, is to avoid the peculiar
                    imperfections and disadvantages of his materials, and to do this with least
                    expense of labour or material. The straightness of the fibres of wood renders it
                    unfit for curved surfaces, at least when the curvature is considerable. Hence,
                    short pieces are glued together as nearly in the form desired as can be, and the
                    apparent surface is covered with a thin veneer; or the work is glued up in
                    pieces that are thin enough to bend to the required form. Sometimes a thin piece
                    of wood is bent to the required form upon a cylinder or saddle, and blocks are
                    jointed and glued upon the back; when the whole is completely dry it will
                    preserve the form that had been given to it by the cylinder. The curve should be
                    made a little “quicker” than the curve intended, as the stuff will always spring
                    back a trifle on being released. A piece of work glued up in thicknesses should
                    be very well done; but it too often happens that the joints are visible,
                    irregular, and in some places open; therefore other methods have been tried.</p>
                <p>Large pieces of timber should never be used in joinery, because they cannot be
                    procured sufficiently dry to prevent them splitting with the heat of a warm
                    room. Therefore, the external part of columns, pilasters, and works of a like
                    kind, should be formed of thin pieces of dry wood; and, if support be required,
                    a post, or an iron pillar, may be placed within the exterior column. Thus, to
                    form columns of wood, so that they shall not be liable to split, narrow pieces
                    of wood are used, not exceeding 5 inches in width. These are jointed like the
                    staves of a cask, and glued together, with short blocks glued along at each
                    joint. Fig. 78 is a plan of the lower end of a column glued up in staves; the
                    bevel at A is used for forming the staves, that at B is used for adjusting them
                    when they are glued together. A similar plan must be made for the upper end of
                    the column, which will give the width of the upper end of the staves. The bevels
                    taken from the plan, as at A and B, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n549/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0549-0490"/> are not the true bevels; but they are those
                    generally used, and are very nearly true when the columns are not much
                    diminished The same method may be adopted for forming large pillars for tables,
                    &lt;fcc. If a column have flutes, with fillets the joints should be in the
                    fillets, in order to make the column as strong as possible; also, if a column be
                    intended to have a swell in the middle, proper thickness of wood should be
                    allowed for it. When columns are small they may be made of dry wood, and turned
                    in a lathe, when they can be moulded at the same time. Balusters for stairs are
                    made thus. To secure small columns against splitting, a hole should be bored
                    down the axis of each column</p>
                <p>If a piece of wood be boiled in water for a certain time, and then taken out and
                    immediately bent into any particular form, and it be retained in that form till
                    it be dry, a permanent change takes place in the mechanical relations of its
                    parts; so that though, when relieved, it will spring back a little, yet it will
                    not return to its natural form The same effect may be produced by steaming wood;
                    but though both these methods have been long practised to a considerable extent
                    in the art of ship-building, we are not aware that any general principles have
                    been discovered either by experiment or otherwise, that will enable us to apply
                    them in joinery, where so much precision is required. They do not seem to have
                    been tried; and before they can be rendered extensively useful, the relation
                    between the curvature to which the wood is bent, and that which it assumes when
                    relieved, should be determined, and also the degree of curvature which may be
                    given to a piece of a given thickness. The time that a piece of wood should be
                    boiled or steamed, in order that it may be in the best state for bending, should
                    be made the subject of experiments; and this being determined, the relation
                    between the time and the bulk of the piece should be ascertained. A novel and
                    very simple and effective way of boiling sash-bars or thin articles has been
                    adopted, as shown in fig. 79. Take a p∣ece of common cast-iron pipe of
                    sufficient diameter, stop up one end with a plug of wood driven tight, fill the
                    pipe with water, raise one end in a sloping position, leaning it on a pile of
                    bricks, and kindle a fire under the pipe. For the joiner’s purposes the process
                    might perhaps be greatly improved by saturating the convex side of each piece
                    with a streng solution of glue immediately after bending it. By filling, in this
                    manner, the extended pores, and allowing the glue to harden thoroughly before
                    relieving the pieces, they would retain their shape better.</p>
                <p>The object in framing is, to reduce the wood into narrow pieces so that the work
                    may not be sensibly affected by its shrinkage; and, at the same time, it enables
                    us to vary the surface without much labour. Besides this, as the strains from
                    the grain of the wood are in different directions, the work is prevented from
                    winding on its face. From this view of the subject, the joiner will readily
                    perceive that neither the parts of the frame nor the panels should be wide. And
                    as the frame should be composed of narrow pieces, it follows that the panels
                    should not be very long, otherwise the frame will want strength. The panels of
                    framing should not be more than 15 inches wide and 4 feet long, and panels so
                    large as this should be avoided as much as possible. The width of the framing is
                    commonly about one-third of the width of the panel. Frames in joinery are
                    usually connected by mortise and tenon joints, with grooves to receive the
                    panels. Wainscoting, doors, window-shutters, &amp;c., are framed in this
                    manner.</p>
                <p>In framing or framed work, the outer vertical bars which are mortised are called
                    styles; and the transverse, those on whose ends the tenons are formed are called
                    rails (Plate XXVI. fig. 2). In doors the open spaces or squares formed
                    internally by the rails and styles are divided in the width by bars parallel to
                    the styles. These are tenoned into the rails, and are called munnions or
                    mountings, or, vulgarly, <hi rend="italic">muntins.</hi> The frame being formed
                    by trying up, setting up, mortising, and tenoning, the inner or face edges of
                    the styles, and of the highest and lowest rails, and both edges of the muntins
                    and of the inner rails, are grooved with the plough to receive the edges and
                    ends of the filling-in parts or panels of the framework. Panels are either flat,
                    raised, or flush (Plate XXVI. fig. 3). Flat panels are no thicker than the
                    grooves into which they are fitted, and consequently their faces are as much
                    below the surface of the framing as the groove is in from each side of the
                    styles and rails. Raised panels are thicker than the groove in the framing, but
                    are not so thick as to reach the surface; nor is the panel thickened through its
                    whole extent. It fits exactly into the groove, and thickens gradually for an
                    inch or two, and then sets off at a right angle with the surface, increasing
                    suddenly three or four sixteenths of an inch. A panel may be raised on one side
                    only, or on both sides. Flush panels are rebated down from one face to the
                    distance the plough groove is in from the surface of the framing; and the back
                    of a panel thus rebated on one side is worked down to be even with the other
                    edge of the groove, leaving a tongue to fit it exactly; for if it be required to
                    make panels flush on both sides, this is generally effected by filling in on the
                    back or flattened side with an extraneous piece. Panels of external doors and
                    shutters may be rendered more secure by boring them, and inserting iron wires,

                    vol. xxv. p. 106. Framing is not, however, often finished in the manner above
                    described, especially with raised and flush panels; mouldings are generally
                    introduced, and are either struck or worked in the solid substance of the
                    framing, or are in separate pieces or slips, and laid in with brads. If a
                    moulding be struck or laid in on one side only, and the other is left plain, the
                    framing is described as moulded and square, a flat panel being in that case
                    understood; if the panel be raised the framing will be described as moulded with
                    a raised panel on one side, and square or flush on the other. It may be moulded
                    with a flat panel, or moulded with a raised panel, on both sides; and the
                    moulding may, as before intimated, be either struck in the solid or laid in any
                    of the preceding cases. Mouldings which are laid in round the panels of framing
                    are neatly mitred at the angles, and bradded, to appear as much as possible as
                    if they were struck in the solid. In nailing or bradding the mouldings, the
                    brads should be driven into the framework, and not into the panels. Framing with
                    sunk panels, in some kinds of work, has the edges of the rails and styles either
                    stop-chamfered or slightly curved. With a flush panel the moulding is always
                    either a bead, or a series of beads called <hi rend="italic">reeds;</hi> and is,
                    in the case of a single bead, which is most common, always struck on the solid
                    frame, and the work is called bead-flush; but reeds are generally struck on the
                    panel in the direction of the grain, and laid in on the panel across it, or
                    along the ends; this is termed reed-flush.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n552/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0552-0491"/>
                <p>Flush panels in inferior works have a single bead struck <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >gh</hi> their sides in the direction of the grain alone, the ends abutting
                    plainly, and this is termed, bead-butt, the fact that the panels are flush being
                    inferred.</p>
                <p>The plainest quality of framing, in which it is square on both sides, is used in
                    the fittings of inferior bed-rooms, inner closets, and the plainer domestic
                    offices, but always internally; framing moulded on one or both sides, in rooms
                    and places of a greater degree of importance, and in places where the work may
                    be more generally seen; in some cases a flat panel may be enriched by a small
                    moulding laid on its surface, leaving a margin between it and the larger
                    moulding at its extremities. This may be done in drawingrooms and apartments of
                    that class, especially if they be in an upper story; and raised panels should be
                    confined to the framed fittings of dining-rooms and other apartments on a ground
                    or principal story. Framing with flush panels is almost restricted to external
                    doors, &amp;c., one side of a door being bead-flush, and the other flat and
                    moulded, perhaps, or the face may be moulded with a raised panel, and the back
                    bead-flush; and this for principal entrances. Bead-butt framing is found in
                    external doors to offices, &amp;c. Partitions between rooms are often made of
                    framing as above described. Lately some sliding partitions have been put
                    forward, one of which consists of two or three large sliding framings, and felt
                    is relied upon to render them sound, proof. This is by Stone; while that by
                    Williams consists of a series of framings pivoted at top and bottom, and with
                    the pivots running on grooves at top and bottom, so that the shutters may be
                    formed into a pilaster-like mass at the side of the room.</p>
                <p>It is of the utmost'importance in framing that the tenons and mortises should be
                    truly made. After a mortise has been made with the mortise chisel, it should be
                    rendered perfectly even with a float,—an instrument which differs from a single
                    cut or float file only by having larger teeth. An inexperienced workman often
                    makes his work fit too tight in one place, and too easy in another, hence the
                    mortise is split by driving the parts together, and the work is never firm;
                    whereas if the tenon fill the mortise equally, without using any considerable
                    force in driving the work together, it is found to be firm and sound. The
                    thickness of tenons should be about one-fourth of that of the framing, and the
                    width of a tenon should never exceed about five times its thickness, otherwise,
                    in wedging, the tenon will become bent, and bulge out the sides of the mortise.
                    If the rail be wide, two mortises should be made, with a space of solid wood
                    between; fig. 80 shows the tenons for a wide rail. If the tenon occurs at the
                    end of a piece of framing, it must be set back a little, so as to allow
                    sufficient solid wood to form a sound mortise; this is called a haunching (see
                    <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> fig. 81). In thick framing, the strength and firmness
                    of the joint is much increased by putting a cross or feather tongue in on each
                    side of the tenon; these tongues are about an inch in depth, and are easily put
                    in with a plough proper for such purposes. The projected figure of the end of a
                    rail, as in fig. 80, shows these tongues put in; in the style there are grooves
                    ploughed to receive them. Sometimes these projections are left in the solid wood
                    itself, in which case they are called <hi rend="italic">stump tenons.</hi>
                    Sometimes, in thick framing, a double tenon in the thickness is made; but we
                    give the preference to a single one, when tongues are put in the shoulders, as
                    we have described; because a strong tenon is better than two weak ones, and
                    there is less difficulty in fitting one than two. The panels of framing should
                    be made to fill the grooves, so as not to rattle, and yet to allow the panels to
                    shrink without splitting. When the mouldings are stuck on the framing, as is
                    often the case in large stuff, it becomes necessary to find the lines to bring
                    the angles together. In square framing, this is done simply by cutting <hi
                    rend="italic">ab,cd,</hi> as in fig. 81, at a mitre; but if the framing be
                    oblique angle, it is done by scribing; the angle at <hi rend="italic">a b</hi>
                    being determined by the eye, <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> is cut parallel to it.
                    Where large projecting or bolection mouldings are used, the French have a very
                    excellent way of framing (fig. 82), which it would be well to imitate in this
                    country. Here C is the panel round which the moulding B is framed and mitred,
                    the whole is then framed into A, which is a section both of the styles and
                    rails. When a frame consists of curved pieces they are often joined by means of
                    pieces of hard wood called keys. Fig 83 is the head of a Gothic window frame
                    joined with a key, with a plan of the joint below it. A cross tongue is put in
                    on each side of the key, and the joint is tightened by means of the wedges, <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a.</hi> It is, however, a better method to join such pieces by
                    means of a screw bolt instead of a key, the cross tongues being used whichever
                    method is adopted. Where the ends of the bolts cannot be allowed to project,
                    they should be fixed as <hi rend="italic">bed bolts.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >JDoors</hi> are made two and four panelled for the most part when the panels
                    are flat and the framing square, six-panelled when the latter is moulded, and
                    six, eight (as figs. 2 and 3, flate XXVI., to which the details in the following
                    description will apply), or even ten-panelled when the framing is of the
                    superior descriptions. Doors which are hung in two equal widths to occupy the
                    doorway, and are hung to the opposite side posts or jambs of the frame, are said
                    to be folding-doors or double-margined,—that is, the styles or margins are
                    repeated necessarily in the middle where they meet. The style, muntin, and rails
                    to doors are the same as in framing or wainscoting; and the panels may be
                    moulded in the same manner. Doorways are fitted with jamb linings, and
                    architraves or pilasters. Jamb linings, as A in fig. 86, when they exceed 9 or
                    10 inches in width, should always be so framed to correspond with the door on
                    the outer faces; or they may be made solid. Narrow and plain jamb linings to
                    inferior rooms are rebated on one side of the lining only, and the rebate forms
                    the frame into which the door is fitted. To superior work they are rebated on
                    both sides, as if it were intended to put a door on each side. The jambs are
                    fixed to the inner edges of the grounds, which are’fixed to the wall to receive
                    the architrave or other decorations to the opening, and to stop the plastering;
                    if they are wide, and not framed, backings are put across to stiffen them; and
                    these backings are dovetailed into the edges of the grounds.</p>
                <p>It requires a considerable degree of care to hang a door, a shutter, or any other
                    piece of work in the best manner. In the hinge, the pin should be perfectly
                    straight, and truly cylindrical, and the parts accurately fitted together. The
                    hinges should be placed so that their axes may be in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n553/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0553-0492"/> the same straight line, as any defect in this
                    respect will produce a considerable strain upon the hinges every time the
                    hanging part is moved, will prevent it from moving freely, and is injurious to
                    the hinges. In hanging doors, centres are often used instead ,of hinges; but, on
                    account of the small quantity of friction in centres, a door moves too easily,
                    so that a slight draught of air accelerates it so much in falling to, that it
                    shakes the building, and is disagreeable. This may be in some degree remedied by
                    placing a small spring to receive the shock of the door.</p>
                <p>The greatest difficulty, in hanging doors, is to make them to clear a carpet, and
                    be close at the bottom w hen shut. To do this, that part of the floor which is
                    under the door when shut, or the width of the jambs, may have a piece of wood
                    about a quarter of an inch thick above the general level of the floor, which,
                    with placing the hinges so as to cause the door to rise as it opens, will be
                    sufficient unless the carpet should be a very thick one. Several mechanical
                    contrivances have been used for either raising the door, or adding a part to
                    spring close to a floor as the door shuts. The best method now in use, and the
                    simplest, is the invention of the rising or skew-butt hinge. The parts of this
                    which bear on each other are made with a double bevel, so that, if more than
                    half opened, the door falls against the wall by its own weight; if less than
                    half open, it closes itself.</p>
                <p>Various kinds of hinges are in use. Sometimes they are concealed, as in the kinds
                    of joints called rule joints; others project, and are intended to let a door
                    fold back over projecting mouldings, as on pulpit doors and outside folding
                    shutters. When hinges project, the weight of the door acts with an increased
                    leverage upon them, and they soon get out of order, unless they be strong and
                    well fixed. The door of a room should be hung so that, in opening the door, the
                    interior of the room cannot be seen through the joint. This may be done by
                    making the joint according to fig. 84. The bead should be continued round the
                    door, and a common butt-hinge answers for it</p>
                <p>The proper bevel for the edge of a door or sash may be found by drawing a line
                    from the centre of motion C (fig. 85) to e, the interior angle of the rebate;
                    <hi rend="italic">e d</hi> drawn perpendicular to C <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    gives the bevel required. In practice the bevel is usually made less, leaving an
                    open space in the joint when the door is shut; this is done on account of the
                    interior angle of the rebate often being filled with paint.</p>
                <p>The extension of the principle of ploughing and tonguing work together is one of
                    the most important of the improvements that have been introduced by modern
                    joiners. It is an easy, simple, and effectual method of combination, and one
                    that provides against the greatest defect of timber-work, its shrinkage. By
                    means of this method, the bold mouldings of mediaeval architecture can be
                    executed with a comparatively small quantity of material; and even in the
                    mouldings of modern architecture it saves much labour. For example, the moulded
                    part of an architrave may be joined with the plain part, as shown by fig.</p>
                <p>86. . If this method be compared with the old method of glueing one piece upon
                    another, its advantage will be more evident</p>
                <p>Architraves and pilasters are variously sunk and moulded according to the fancy
                    of the designer. They are fixed to the grounds with their internal edges exactly
                    fitting to the rebates in the jambs, and they form the enriched margin or
                    moulding of the frame in which the door is set. Architraves are mitred at the
                    upper angle, but pilasters have generally a console or an enriched block or cap
                    resting on them, to which they fit with a square joint; both the one and the
                    other either run down and are scribed to the floor, or rest on squared blocks or
                    bases, -which may be the height of the skirting board, or of the whole base.</p>
                <p>The architraves, skirtings, and surbase mouldings, are fixed to pieces of wood
                    called <hi rend="italic">grounds,</hi> as A, fig. 86; and as the straightness
                    and accuracy of these mouldings depend upon the care that has been taken to fix
                    the grounds truly, it will appear that fixing grounds, which is a part often
                    left to inferior workmen, in reality requires skill and attention; besides, they
                    are almost always the guide for the plasterer. Where the plasterer’s work joins
                    the grounds, they should have a small groove ploughed in the edge to form a key
                    for the plaster. In old work the ground was generally hidden, but in modern work
                    it is frequently shown, which is a saving of stuff; thus, instead of architraves
                    being prepared as in fig. 86, they are made as shown in fig. 87, whero A is the
                    rebated and beaded door-jamb, and B the ground, which is generally splayed at
                    the back as a key to the plastering instead of being grooved. On this a thin
                    piece of stuff is bradded to form the double-faced architrave, instead of
                    sinking out of the solid, and on this the ogee or ovolo moulding is nailed.
                    Again with base mouldings, A (fig. 88) is the ground fixed against the wall, on
                    the top of which is nailed the upper moulding B, and C shows the skirting and
                    lower moulding, fixed against a fillet on the floor.</p>
                <p>We have thus far spoken chiefly of joinery as performed at the bench; but by far
                    the most important part remains to be considered; for, however well a piece of
                    work may have been prepared, if it be not properly fixed, it cannot fulfil its
                    intended purpose. As in the preceding part, the general principles will be
                    stated that ought to be made the basis of practice; and these illustrated by
                    particular examples. When the carcass of a building is ready for the joiner, the
                    first thing to be done is to cut the bond timber out of the openings, set the
                    sash frames, and fill them with old sashes or with oiled paper on frames, to
                    exclude the weather, but admit light. The flooring joists are then proved with
                    straight-edges, and any inequalities in them are removed with the adze; the
                    flooring boards are next cut down to their places, and are turned -with their
                    faces downwards until the ceilings are done. First, however, the pugging is
                    done, if any be intended. This is to prevent sound passing through the floor
                    when finished, and is sometimes called deafening sound-boarding. It is effected
                    by nailing fillets to each side of the joists, near the bottom, and laying on
                    these pieces of rough boards across <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n554/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0554-0493"/> and close together; then there is put a layer of
                    mortar mixed with chopped straw, or sometimes clay, sawdust, or small
                    shells.</p>
                <p>The preparation given to flooring boards in superior work is planing the face,
                    shooting the edges, and gauging to a thickness,—the common fillister or stop
                    rebate plane being used to work down to the gauge mark, from the back of every
                    board, and about half an inch in on each edge. When a board is to be laid, it is
                    turned on its face in the place it is to occupy, and the workman with his adze
                    cuts away from the back over every joist down to the gauge rebate, so that on
                    being turned over it falls exactly into its place, and takes the same level with
                    all its fellows, which have been brought to the same gauge; then follows the
                    process of laying, and the result must, if the work be done well, be a perfectly
                    even and level surface. The slight inequalities of surface which may occur are
                    reduced with a smoothing-plane, the brads being previously punched below the
                    surface if the floor be face-nailed. Floors are in ordinary cases either laid
                    straight joint or folding, and are edge-nailed, as fig. 89, or face-nailed.
                    According to the folding method, two boards are laid, their heading joints all
                    on the same joist, and of course in the same straight line, and nailed at such a
                    distance apart that the space is a little less than the aggregate width of the
                    three, four, or five boards intended for it; these boards are then put to their
                    places, and, on account of the narrowness of the space left for them, they rise
                    like an arch between its abutments. The workmen force them down by jumping upon
                    them. Accordingly, the boards are never soundly fixed to the joists, nor can the
                    floor be laid with any kind of evenness or accuracy. This method should be
                    avoided in all good work. Straight joint flooring is when every board is laid
                    separately, or one at a time, the heading joint or joints being broken or
                    covered regularly in every case. Dowelling is the drivingpins of wood or iron
                    half their length, into the edge of the last laid board, the outer edge of which
                    has been skew-nailed, their other ends running into holes prepared for them in
                    the inner edge of the next board, in the way the head of a cask is held
                    together, and then its outer edge is skew-nailed in the same manner, and so on.
                    Tonguing is effected by grooving both edges of every board, and fitting thin
                    slips and tongues into them. The boards are usually forced together by pressure
                    as with a clamp applied to the outer edge. The nail used in face-nailing floors
                    is called a flooring brad; it has no head, but a mere tongue projecting on one
                    side of the top of the nail, which is put in the direction of the grain, that it
                    may admit of being punched in below the surface level, otherwise the superficial
                    inequalities could not be reduced when the floor was completed, because of the
                    projecting heads of the nails. For side or edge nailing, however, clasp-nails,
                    nails whose heads extend across on two of the opposite sides, are used.</p>
                <p>As boards can seldom be got long enough to do without, joints, it is usual,
                    except in very inferior work, to join the ends with a tongued joint, as shown in
                    fig. 89, where B is the joint. The etched board is first laid, and edge-nailed
                    to the joist. In oak floors the ends are forked together sometimes, as shown at
                    A (fig. 90), in order to render the joints less conspicuous. The joints should
                    be kept as distant from one another as possible.</p>
                <p>In laying floors the advice of Evelyn only to tank the boards down the first
                    year, and nail them down for good the next, is certainly the best method when it
                    is convenient to adopt it; but, as this is very seldom the case, we must expect
                    the joints to open more or less as the wood lias been more or less seasoned.
                    Now, these joints always admit a considerable current of cold air; and also, in
                    an upper room, unless there be a counter floor, or pugging, the ceiling below
                    may be spoiled by spilling water, or even by washing the floor. To avoid these
                    disagreeable results, the boards should be ploughed and a tongue inserted into
                    each joint, according to the old practice. When the boards are narrow, they
                    might be laid without any appearance of nails, in the same way as a dowelled
                    floor is laid, the tongue serving the same purpose as the dowels. In this case
                    the cross or feather tongues for the joints should be used. A new system of
                    flooring has for some years been used in London, to which the name of “Victoria
                    floors” has been given. A rough floor of boards, three-quarters of an inch
                    thick, is first laid, and the rest of the joiners’ work fixed, and the
                    plastering finished. When all is done, a floor formed of inch or inch and
                    quarter plank, ripped down the middle, and consequently very little more than 5
                    inches wide, is laid; the rough boarding being first covered with a layer of
                    shavings, or old newspapers, or other waste paper. These boards are dowelled on
                    one edge and nailed on the other, and a very sound floor is thus formed, which
                    neither springs nor creaks. A wainscot floor can be laid well on this
                    principle.</p>
                <p>Another early operation in joinery is the fixing of the framed grounds for the
                    doors and windows, and for the skirting (Plate XXVI. fig. 5, and woodcuts, figs.
                    86, 87, and 88) to which the plasterers may float their work. The skirting
                    grounds are generally dovetailed at the angles, and are well blocked out, so
                    that they may not vibrate on being struck, or yield to pressure when the
                    plasterer’s straight-edge passes roughly over the surface; they must also be set
                    with the utmost truth and precision. When the floors are cut down and the
                    grounds fixed, the joiner’s operations in a building should be suspended until
                    the plasterers have finished, or nearly so, and then the floors may be laid. By
                    deferring this operation until that period, the workmen of the two different
                    trades are prevented from interrupting each other, and indeed injuring each
                    other’s work; and joiners always find employment in the shop preparing, as
                    before intimated.</p>
                <p>If the part to be fixed consists of boards jointed together, but not framed, it
                    should be fixed so that it may shrink or swell without splitting or winding. The
                    nature of the work will generally determine how this may be effected. Let us
                    suppose that a plain back of a window is to be fixed. Fig. 91 is a section
                    showing B the back of the window, A the windowsill, D the floor, C the skirting,
                    and E the wall of the house. The back is supposed to be prepared as previously
                    stated, and is kept straight by a dovetailed key <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Now,
                    let the back be firmly nailed to the window-sill A, and let a narrow piece <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> with a groove and cross tongue in its upper edge, be fixed
                    to bond timbers or plugs in the wall, the tongue being inserted also into a
                    corresponding groove in the lower edge of the back B. It is obvious, that the
                    tongue being loose, the back B may contract or expand, as a panel in a
                    frame.</p>
                <p>In getting out skirtings, if the work be of a superior description, the boards
                    should be tried up as for framing in every way except bringing to a width, which
                    need not be done. The face edges, however, must be worked with great precision,
                    and moulded or rebated as the case may require. Rebating or tonguing will be
                    perhaps necessary when the skirting consists of more than one piece, that the
                    different <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n555/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0555-0494"/> pieces may be made to fit neatly and firmly
                    together; and all but the lowest piece must of necessity be brought to a width,
                    as well as tried up in other particulars. A skirting in a single width is called
                    by that term; but when it is made up of more than one part it is designated a
                    base; the lowest board is then called the skirting board, and the upper the base
                    moulding or mouldings (Plate XXVI. figs. 1 and 5). The skirting board is not
                    brought to a width because the labour would be lost according to the ordinary
                    mode of fixing it. The board is applied to its place with its lower edge
                    touching the floor; but as the most perfectly wrought floors are found to have
                    some slight unevenness of surface so close to the wall, a straight edge would
                    not fit closely down to it in every part. The board is therefore propped up at
                    one end or the other until the upper or faced edge is perfectly parallel with
                    the average line of the floor, or rather so as to be perfectly level. A pair of
                    strong compasses, such as are used by the carpenter, is taken, and opened to the
                    greatest distance the lower edge of the skirting board is from the floor
                    throughout its length; the outer edge near the point of one leg of the compasses
                    is then drawn along the floor, whilst the point of the other, being kept
                    vertically above it, is pressed against the face of the board, on which it marks
                    a line exactly parallel to the surface of the floor, indicating, of course,
                    every, even the slightest, irregularity there may be in it. If the floor be not
                    a very uneven one, the excluded part may be ripped off with the hand or the
                    panel saw, which may generally be made to follow the traced or inscribed line
                    exactly; if, however, the line be a very irregular one, having quick turns in
                    it, the hatchet must be used. This operation is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >scribing,</hi> and the result of it is evidently to make the skirting fit down
                    on the floor with the utmost precision. Care must be taken in performing the
                    operation that the upper edges of the skirtings be not only level, but that all
                    which are in immediate connection be scribed to the same height, that their
                    upper edges may exactly correspond.</p>
                <p>In the principal rooms of a house, the skirting C (fig. 91) is usually grooved
                    into the floor D, and fixed only to the narrow piece <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>
                    called a ground. (See also Plate XXVI. fig. 5.) By fixing in this manner, the
                    skirting covers the joint, which would otherwise soon be open by the shrinking
                    of the back, and from the skirting being grooved into the floor, but not
                    fastened to it, there cannot be an open joint between the skirting and floor.
                    When it is considered that an open, joint in such a situation must become a
                    receptacle for dust and a harbour for insects, the importance of adopting this
                    method of fixing a skirting will be apparent. As grooving a floor is attended
                    with considerable labour, and as the boards will sometimes twist, it is more
                    common now to nail a small fillet to the floor, against which the back of the
                    skirting rests, and, of course, has full room for expansion. Before skirtings
                    are fixed, vertical blocks are put at short intervals, extending from the floor
                    to the narrow grounds, and made exactly flush with and true to the latter, and
                    are firmly nailed. These form a sound backing, to which the skirtings may be
                    bradded or nailed, and so prevented from warping or bending in any manner. If,
                    however, the skirting be not very wide, and be sufficiently stout to stand
                    without a backing, a fillet only is nailed along the floor as a stop for its
                    lower edge; but this is rendered unnecessary if the skirting be tongued into the
                    floor, as the tongue will answer every purpose of a stop (fig. 5, Plate XXVI.)
                    The ends of skirtings should be tongued into each other when it is necessary to
                    piece them in length; and on returns or angles the end of one should be tongued
                    into the returned face of the other in the square parts, and mitred in the
                    oblique-angled or moulded parts.</p>
                <p>The dado of a room should be fixed in the same manner as explained above for
                    window backs (fig. 91). When a chair-rail or surbase is required, grounds
                    similar to those for the base are fixed to range like them with the face of the
                    plastering; the surbase itself must be wide enough to cover the grounds and the
                    joints formed by them and the plastering completely; it is in effect a cornice
                    to the stereobate (or pedestal, as the three parts may be termed of base, dado,
                    and surbase), and the space or dado between it and the base is generally
                    understood to be wainscoted, though it is more frequently plastered.</p>
                <p>In fixing any board above 5 or 6 inches wide, similar precautions are necessary
                    as those detailed in fig. 91, otherwise it is certain to split when the house
                    becomes inhabited. We may, in general, either fix one edge and groove the other,
                    so as to leave it at liberty, or fix it in the middle and leave both edges at
                    liberty. Sometimes a wide board, or a piece consisting of several boards, may be
                    fixed by means of buttons screwed to the back, which turn into grooves in the
                    framing, bearers, or joists, to which it is to be fixed. If any shrinking takes
                    place the buttons slide in the grooves. In this manner the landings of stairs
                    are fixed, and it is much the best mode of fixing the top of a table to its
                    frame.</p>
                <p>The parts of the outside frame of a sash are distinguished by the terms applied
                    to the similar parts of common framing. The upright sides are styles, and the
                    transverse or horizontal ones, which are tenoned into the ends of the styles,
                    are rails; but the inner framework or divisions for the panes are called merely
                    upright and cross bars (these bars, according to the way they are moulded, are
                    called lamb’s tongue, ovolo, beaded, &amp;c.),—the upright being the mortised,
                    and the cross bars the tenoned, as with the outer framework (Plate XXVI. fig.
                    1). Sashes are got out like common framing; the parts are tried up, set out, and
                    mortised and tenoned, exactly in the same manner, allowance being made in the
                    length of the rails and all tenoned pieces in the setting out, as in common
                    framing also,for the portions of the mortised styles and upright bars which are
                    worked away in forming the moulding and rebate. The meeting rails of sashes
                    which are in pairs, to be hung with lines, are made thicker than the other parts
                    by the thickness of the parting bead, and they are bevelled or splayed off, the
                    one from above and the other from below, that they may meet and fit closely.
                    When the framework is completed, although it cannot be put together because of
                    what has just been referred to, the rebate is formed by the sash fillister on
                    the further part of the face edge, and the moulding struck on its hither angle.
                    These things being done, the moulded edges are either mitred or scribed at the
                    shoulders and haunches, and the sash may be put together. If sash bars are
                    mitred at the joints, they require dowels in the cross bars to act as tenons;
                    but if they can be scribed, dowelling is not necessary. Sashes are either hung
                    upon hinges or hung with lines, pulleys, and weights. Fixed sashes are put into
                    frames, of which every part may be solid but the stop, which must be put in
                    behind the sash to detain it. Sashes hung with hinges are usually called
                    casements, and require solid rebated frames; but there can be no stops to them,
                    except their own movable fastenings, and the outer stop, which of course the
                    rebate furnishes. These are usually known as French casements, or sash doors, as
                    they are called when they open down to the ground or floor; they have now taken
                    the place of sash windows, where they may lead from the room to garden paving,
                    or to a balcony, or may be used for similar purposes. The ordinary arrangement
                    for an aperture is that of two leaves working on hinges at the sides inwards or
                    outwards, meeting in the centre of the opening. With the former, which is the
                    usual mode, one leaf is secured to the head and sill by bolts either round or
                    sunk in; the other leaf, when closed, is secured to the first by a handle fixed
                    on the second and turning over a staple fixed on the first. If the casement <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n556/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0556-0495"/> should be a high one, this second leaf often
                    requires a bolt at top and bottom, to secure it against the force of the wind,
                    which by bending it admits the cold air and wet. When it is placed towards an
                    exposed aspect, and is thus subject to driving rains, it is necessary to take
                    many precautions for the prevention of wet being blown through the meeting
                    surfaces all round the casements. To effect this object, the styles, rails, and
                    frames are sunk and beaded in various ways. Figs. 92 and 93 represent sills and
                    bottom rails; and fig. 94, meeting rail, styles, and frame, which last is an
                    ordinary arrangement in France. An improvement to the mere handle for securing
                    the leaf of the casement is that of affixing an upright metal rod, which is
                    turned by the handle C, fig. 92, on the leaf being closed, and by hooks at top
                    and bottom as B, fig. 95, catching into a plate fixed for them, and effectually
                    fastening it. A simpler method has been shown where, in lieu of the rod, a
                    reeded bar, as D, fig 96, is moved to and fro as the leaf is required to be
                    opened or shut, the top and bottom of the bar being rounded as shown at E, fig.
                    97, so as to slide into two segmental plates F, secured to the sill and lintel.
                    Fig. 96 is a plan of the two casements, and 97 a plan of the head and sill. The
                    metal rod, which is of brass, is called the Espagnolette bolt. Another mode of
                    securing the casements has lately been introduced, whereby a flat plate, the
                    whole height of the opening, is inserted in a groove formed in one edge of the
                    meeting style of a leaf; and on this being closed the plate is shot forward by a
                    handle into a groove in the other leaf, fastening the two together, the plate
                    forming a stop against both the wind and the rain. This is a patent arrangement
                    of Arch. Smith and Co. Fig. 98 is a plan of the usual French casement used at
                    Paris. A shows the two leaves of the casement when shut; B is a plan of the
                    shutters in their boxing, CC the shutters when closed, D the bolt, E the inside
                    architrave and F the <hi rend="italic">Persiennes,</hi> or outside blinds, shut
                    against the stone reveals, and so provided for by the architect, instead of
                    being an addition made by the upholsterer after the work is done, and perhaps
                    spoiling the design. The ordinary mode is for them to be hung with projecting
                    hinges to admit of their being folded back into the face of the wall, which is a
                    hideous arrangement for any façade, except perhaps one of plain brickwork or
                    plain cement. GG shows the position of the blinds when shut, and H is the
                    outside architrave. Much difficulty arises in preventing the rain and wind from
                    penetrating under sUclι doors. The French raise the doors very much to secure
                    this, as shown in figs. 92 and 94. In England various methods have been adopted
                    by forming second sills of metal cast into shapes to form gutters and throats;
                    perhaps the best arrangement is the “patent sill or water bar” (fig. 99), as now
                    manufactured by</p>
                <p>Archibald Smith and Co. A metal plate A is screwed to the face of the bottom
                    rail. An arrangement in metal B is screwed to the upper weathering of the wood
                    sill C, having on its outer edge a plate D hinged to it. When the door is opened
                    this plate falls down, and when the door or leaf is shut, a pin E, let into the
                    underside of the bottom rail, forces up the hinged plate D, and presses it
                    against the first named plate A, making all tight. Fig. 100 is a section of a
                    mediaeval moulded bottom rail found in France. When the window lights are
                    carried up over the casements, as is very often the case, the upper lights are
                    generally fixed; but it is better that one or two of them should be rendered
                    available for ventilating the apartment when it is not desirable to have the
                    door itself open. This will be effected by hinging the light on the bottom rail,
                    with the necessary means of opening and closing it, or placing it on centre
                    hinges at the sides.</p>
                <p>Sashes hung with lines require cased frames (Plate XXVI. figs. 1, 4), to receive
                    the pulleys and weights. The sill of the frame is made, as in the former cases,
                    solid, is sunk and weathered, and is generally made of a more durable material
                    than the rest of the frame; the sides in the direction of the thickness of the
                    frame are of one and a quarter or one and a half inch board, very truly tried
                    up, and grooved to receive a parting bead; for it must be obvious that sashes
                    hung with lines to run vertically up and down within the height of the frame
                    must be themselves in two heights, and must pass each other in separate and
                    distinct channels. The ends of these boards are fixed into the upper face of the
                    solid sill below, and into a similar board parallel to the sill which forms a
                    head above, and they are called pulley pieces, or styles, because they receive
                    the pulleys, which are let into them near their upper ends.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n557/mode/1up"

                <p>Linings from 4 to 6 inches in width, and from three-fourths of an inch to an inch
                    in thickness, are nailed on to the edges of the pulley pieces, and to the sill
                    and head above and below, inside and outside, in the direction of the breadth of
                    the sash frame, and are returned along the head in the direction of its length.
                    The outside linings are made to extend within the pulley pieces about half an
                    inch, to form a stop for the upper and outer sash; and the inside linings are
                    made exactly flush with their inner faces. The casing is completed by fixing
                    thin linings on the outer edges of the outside and inside linings, parallel to
                    the pulley pieces, to prevent anything from impeding the weights. Thin slips
                    called parting-beads are fitted tightly into the grooves previously noticed in
                    the pulley pieces, but they are not fixed, as the upper sash can be put in or
                    taken out only by the temporary removal of the parting-bead. An inner or stop
                    bead is mitred round on the inside to complete the groove or channel for the
                    lower sash; the stop bead covers the edge of the inside linings on the sides and
                    head, and is fixed by means of screws, which may be removed without violence
                    when it is required to put in or take out the sashes. A hole covered with a
                    movable piece large enough to allow the lead or iron weight to pass in and out,
                    is made in each of the pulley pieces, so that the sashes may be hung after the
                    frames are set, and to repair any accident that may occur to the hangings in
                    after use (Plate XXVI. fig. 4). It may be remarked that sash frames require
                    greater truth and precision from the workman than anything else in the joiners’
                    work of a building; and unless the stuff employed be quite sound and perfectly
                    seasoned all the workman’s care will be thrown away.</p>
                <p>Sashes, it may be remarked, are never fitted until these frames are immovably
                    fixed, so that if there be any inaccuracy in the latter, the sashes are cut away
                    or pieced out to make them fit; but, as they are intended to traverse, the
                    fitting in that case can only apply to one particular position, and in every one
                    but that there must be something wrong. Any incorrectness in the sash-frame,
                    again, must throw the shutters and their back flaps out; indeed, the sash-frame,
                    though apparently a secondary part of the arrangement, is that which affe&lt; Is
                    all the rest beyond anything else. When sashes have been fitted, a plough
                    groove, wide and deep enough to receive the sash-line, is made in the outer
                    edges of the styles, for about two-thirds of their length, at their upper ends.
                    They are then primed and glazed, and when the putty is sufficiently set the
                    joiner hangs them. He is furnished with sash-line, which is made of the best
                    flax well plaited together, tacks, and iron or lead weights, which are generally
                    made cylindrical, with a ring at one end, to which the line may be attached. A
                    sash is weighed, and two weights are selected which together amount to within a
                    few ounces of a counterpoise. The line is then passed through the pulley, which
                    was previously fixed in the pulley style; the end is knotted to a weight which
                    is passed in at the hole left for the purpose; and at a sufficient distance,
                    which a common degree of intelligence will readily determine, the line is cut
                    off and the end tacked into the groove in the style of the sash. Other modes of
                    attaching the sash-line to the sash are also used.</p>
                <p>Of recent inventions connected with windows there are some for enabling the
                    parting-beads to be taken out, or are dispensed with, so that sashes may be
                    readily cleaned without the operator standing on the sill, a dangerous practice,
                    and without the use of the glazier’s horse, which tends to injure the inside
                    painting. A contrivance for easily opening and closing sashes of large size by
                    an arrangement of cords and pulleys, which likewise secure it when shut, is
                    patented by Mr Meakin. Another, having counterbalancing rack slips for hanging
                    sashes, dispenses with the use of sash lines, pulleys, and sash weights. An
                    objection to this invention may be that both upper and lower sashes must be
                    opened at the same time. There are other useful arrangements for opening
                    windows, such as those used in the wards of hospitals, where the opening is
                    divided into about four horizontal lights working on pivots, all opening to any
                    required extent by a rack and pinion. A sash fastener with a second spring,
                    which clips the projection on the lower sash when the fastening is closed, and
                    another where the shape of the arm of the fastener is altered, both prevent the
                    sash being opened from without by a knife, a common mode of forcing an entrance
                    into buildings. Patent wrought windows, and patent wrought iron water-tight
                    windows and frames suitable for churches, parsonage houses, &lt;kc., are readily
                    obtainable.</p>
                <p>The fittings of a window which has boxed shutters consist of back linings,
                    grounds, back elbows and soffit, together with shutters and back flaps, and
                    architraves (or pilasters) round on the inside to form a moulded frame (figs. 1
                    and 4, Plate XXVI.) Back linings are generally framed with flush panels; they
                    fit in between the inside lining of the sash frame and the framed ground, to
                    both of which they are attached, and form the back of the boxing into which the
                    shutters fall back. They are tongued into the inside lining by their inner edge,
                    and on the outer edge the ground is nailed, and they are set at right angles to
                    the sash-frame, or obtusely outwards, as the shutters may be splayed or not. The
                    back is the continuation of the window fittings from the sash-sill to the floor
                    on the inside; the elbows are its returns on both sides under the shutters, and
                    the soffit is the piece of framing which extends from one side of the window to
                    the other across the head, or from back lining to back lining. These are all
                    framed to correspond with the shutters on the face; but, as they are fixed,
                    their backs are left unwrought. Window shutters are framed in correspondence
                    with the door and other framed work of the room to which they belong, in front,
                    and generally with a flush panel behind; the back-flaps are in one or two
                    separate breadths to each shutter, according to the width of the window and the
                    depth of the recess; they are made lighter than the shutters themselves, and
                    they should, when shut to, present faces exactly corresponding with those of the
                    shutters, both . intèrnally and externally. The shutters are hung to the
                    sash-frame with butt hinges, and the back flaps are hung to their outer styles
                    with a hinge called a back-flap, from its use. The shutters and their back flaps
                    are hung in one, two, or more heights, as may be found convenient. The moulded
                    margin round the boxings of a window on the inner face are made to harmonize
                    generally with the similar parts of the doors of the room or place to which it
                    belongs. See other examples of shutters and their boxing in fig. 98. The fixing
                    and hanging of window fittings or dressings are hardly less important, for the
                    accuracy required, than the making and fixing of the sash-frame itself; the
                    slightest infirmity or inaccuracy in any part will be likely to derange some
                    essential operation.</p>
                <p>To this old manner of forming shutters must be added the rolling shutters of
                    Clark, Bunnett, Francis, Snoxell, and others. These can be fixed either at the
                    top, bottom, or side of the window as convenient, and are made of wood, steel,
                    iron, or of wood and iron, many of them requiring machinery to raise and to
                    lower them. The advantages consist in the small space occupied, the great
                    security obtained, and the rapidity and ease in opening and shutting them. They
                    are, however, apt to stick, and some are noisy, but one is called the “noiseless
                    self-coiling revolving steel shutter.” One variety consists in a sheet of
                    well-tempered corrugated steel, which coils up on itself like a roll of paper;
                    another is a self-acting wood revolving shutter, with hardened steel bands.</p>

                <p>The construction of stairs is generally considered the highest department of the
                    art of joinery. The principal object to be attended to is that the stairs should
                    afford a safe and easy communication between floors at different levels. The
                    strength of a stair ought to be apparent as well as real, in order that those
                    who ascend it may feel conscious of safety. To make the communication safe, it
                    should be guarded by a railing of proper height and strength; in order that it
                    may be easy, the rise and width (or tread) of the steps should be regular and
                    justly proportioned to each other, with convenient landings; there should be no
                    winding steps, and the top of the rail should be of a convenient height for the
                    hand. The first person that attempted to fix the relation between the height and
                    width of a step, upon correct principles, was, we believe, Blondel, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Cours d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Architecture.</hi> His formula is
                    applicable to very large buildings, but not to ordinary dwellings. Mr Ashpitel,
                    who investigated the subject at length, gives the following rules for buildings
                    of seven different classes :—</p>

                <p>These dimensions give angles of ascent varying from 24 to 37°. Of course the
                    projection of the nosing is not reckoned.</p>
                <p>Hawksley’s patent treads for staircases to public thoroughfares are composed of
                    iron frames, in which small blocks of wood, placed the end way of the grain, are
                    so secured as to present to the foot a roughened surface. They appear to be
                    durable, and to admit of easy renewal of the wood when worn or injured.</p>
                <p>The forms of staircases are various, commencing with a straight flight, which
                    should only be used to a low story. In towns, where space cannot be allowed for
                    convenient forms, they are often made triangular, circular, or elliptical, with
                    winding steps, or are made of a mixed form, with straight sides and circular
                    ends. In large mansions, and in other situations where convenience and beauty
                    are the chief objects of attention, winding steps are never introduced when it
                    is possible to avoid them. Good stairs, therefore, require less geometrical
                    skill than those of an inferior character. The best architectural effect is
                    produced by rectangular staircases, with ornamented railing and newels. In
                    Gothic structures scarcely any other kind can be adopted with propriety for a
                    principal staircase. Modern architecture admits of greater latitude in this
                    respect,—the end of the staircase being sometimes circular, and the hand-rail
                    continued, beginning from either a scroll or a newel.</p>
                <p>When a rectangular staircase has a continued rail, it is necessary that it should
                    be curved so as to change gradually from a level to an inclined direction. This
                    curvature is called the <hi rend="italic">ramp</hi> of the rail. The plan of a
                    staircase of this kind is represented by ABCD in fig. 101; and fig. 103 shows a
                    section of it, supposing it to be cut through at <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> on
                    the plan. The hand-rail is supposed to begin with a newel at the bottom, and the
                    form of the cap of the newel ought to be determined so that it will mitre with
                    the hand-rail. Let H in fig.</p>
                <p>102 be the section of the hand-rail, and <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> the radius of
                    the newel; then the form of the cap may be traced at C. The sections of
                    hand-rails are of various shapes; some of the most common ones are too small; a
                    hand-rail should never be less than would require a square of which the side is
                    2⅜ inches to circumscribe it. For the level landings of a staircase the height
                    of the top of the hand-rail should never be more than about 40 inches, and in
                    any part of the inclined rail the height of its upper side above the middle of
                    the width of the step should be 40 inches, less the rise of one step when
                    measured in a vertical direction. To describe the ramps, let <hi rend="italic">r
                    s</hi> in fig. 103 be a vertical line drawn through the middle of the width of
                    the step; set <hi rend="italic">r u</hi> equal to <hi rend="italic">r s,</hi>
                    and draw <hi rend="italic">u t</hi> at right angles with the back of the rail,
                    cutting the horizontal line <hi rend="italic">st</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi>; then from the point <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> as a centre, describe the
                    curve of the rail. When there is a contrary flexure, as in the case before us,
                    the method of describing the lesser curve is the same.</p>
                <p>The hand-rail of a stair generally begins with a scroll, and the first step of
                    the stair is generally finished with what is called a curtail, a form
                    corresponding closely to the scrolL There are a great variety of geometrical
                    spirals; but as they all finish on a point, and as all architectural scrolls and
                    volutes finish on a circle or eye, the usual mathematical scrolls are
                    inapplicable. The earliest spiral adapted to architecture was that of De Lorme.
                    Since his time several systems have been invented, particularly that of
                    Goldmann; the best is that derived from the Ionic volute (fig. 104).</p>

                    be the total height, and AC the intended height of the eye, and let the spiral
                    be required to make two revolutions. Divide BC into four times as many parts as
                    there are revolutions required (4 × 2 = 8), because there are four quadrants in
                    every revolution. Draw any line DE equal to the height of the spiral. Set down
                    from D half the number of the parts and one more (4 + 1 = 5); this is the top of
                    the eye. Set down half AC at O, and describe the eye; then at 0 set up half a
                    part to F, and make FG, FH = OF; then, as in fig 105, draw OG, OH, GI, and from
                    0 draw a line parallel to GH, and divide the same into as many parts as there
                    are to be revolutions. Fig. 105 is for one, and fig. 106 for two revolutions.
                    Bisect 01 at X; make 21 = 2X, and join XI; and through 1 draw MN parallel to OF
                    to meet OG and XI. Draw the quarter circles, as in the diagram,—HD being the
                    first opening of the compasses, GP the next, and H, G, I, K <hi rend="subscript"
                    > j</hi> L, M, and N being the centres. To describe the scroll let AB, as in
                    fig. 107, be the width across, usually about 10 or 12 inches; let EB be the
                    intended diameter of the eye; and let the scroll be required to make one
                    revolution and a half, or six quadrants (these are shown at greater size by the
                    side of fig. 108), then proceed as last directed, and complete the scroll, also
                    dot in the lines of the nosings and risers. For the curtail step transfer the
                    lines of nosings <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and the lines of the risers <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> to another place, as in fig. 108, and set out the
                    thickness of the veneer within the line of nos ing, the part within this
                    represents the solid block of the curtail. The places of the balusters are shown
                    in fig. 107.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that in every geometrical staircase, the half of a cylinder placed
                    upright in the well-hole would touch the wreathed string in all parts, another a
                    little less would touch all parts of the hand-rail. Let us suppose ACB, as in
                    fig. 109, to be the plan of half a cylinder so set upright in the wellhole, and
                    let us suppose A'E to be the height of the same. Divide the curved line ACB into
                    any convenient number of parts, and set the same off by compasses on the
                    straight line from C to A ’ and C to B'. Or, in case ACB is a semicircle, divide
                    the line AB, draw the diameter CD, making αD equal to three-fourths of the
                    radius, and draw DA, DB', and the rest of the lines through the points of
                    division, as shown in the diagram. Then A'B' is the stretch out or length of the
                    circumference ACB unrolled. But A'E is said to be the whole height. From E set
                    down the respective heights of the winders, step by step, as shown. Now let G be
                    the representation of the cylinder, with the different lines squared up and
                    across, these will give a representation of the curve at which the winders must
                    ascend, and which, of course, must regulate the hand-rail. The other faint lines
                    show the edge of the covering.</p>
                <p>Fig. 112 represents the plan of a staircase, beginning with a scroll, and having
                    steps winding round the circular part of the well-hole. In the first place, let
                    the end of the steps be developed according to the method we have just given
                    (fig. 110 shows this development). Now the hand-rail ought to follow the
                    inclination of a line drawn to touch the nosings of the steps, except where
                    there is an abrupt transition from the rake of the winding to that of the other
                    steps; at such places it must be curved,—the curve may be drawn by the help of
                    intersecting lines, as in fig. 111. The part which is shaded in fig. 109
                    represents the handrail and ends of the steps when spread out, and the handrail
                    is only drawn close to the steps for convenience, as it would require too much
                    space to raise it to its proper position. This development of the rail is called
                    the fallingmould. We will now refer to fig. 113, and will suppose the inner
                    semicircle of ACB to be the plan of the wellhole, and eA, αB, the width of the
                    rail; then the outer shaded part ACB will be the plan of the rail on the level;
                    ADEB is the cylinder referred to before— ADE being the angle at which the stairs
                    ascend.</p>
                <p>Now since by the principles of Conic Sections the oblique section of a circular
                    cylinder is an ellipse, if the cylinder be circular the lines may then be found
                    by a trammel. Be it of what section it may, the delineation of a cylinder cut at
                    any angle ADE may be found by dividing it into equal parts, and setting up the
                    ordinates <hi rend="italic">al, b2,</hi> &lt;fcc., as shown. This delineation is
                    a plan “on the oblique,” or the facemould of the rail, to be cut “on the
                    plumb.”</p>
                <p>The wood used for hand-rails being of an expensive kind, it becomes of some
                    importance to consider how the plank may be cut so as to require the least
                    quantity of material for the curved part of the rail. Now, if we were <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n560/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0560-0499"/> to suppose the rail executed, and a plain board
                    laid upon the upper side of it, the board would touch the rail at three points;
                    and a plank laid in the same position as the board would be that out of which
                    the rail could be cut with the least waste of material. Let it be required to
                    find the moulds for the part <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> of the rail in fig. 112,
                    and to avoid confusing the lines in the small figure, the part <hi rend="italic"
                    >a b</hi> has been drawn to a larger scale in fig. 114. The plain board
                    mentioned above would touch the rail at the points marked C and B in the plan;
                    draw the line CB, and draw a line parallel to CB, so as to touch the curve at
                    the point E. Then E is the other point on the plan; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b',</hi> are the heights of these points in the
                    development in fig. 110. Erect perpendiculars to CB, from the points C, E, and B
                    (fig. 114), and set off <hi rend="italic">Ca'</hi> in fig. 114 equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi> in fig. 110, Ee ’ equal to <hi rend="italic">de',</hi> and
                    Bδ' equal to <hi rend="italic">fb'.</hi> Through the points C and E, draw the
                    dotted line <hi rend="italic">Ch</hi>; through <hi rend="italic">a', e',</hi>
                    draw a line to meet CE in <hi rend="italic">h;</hi> and through the points <hi
                    rend="italic">a', b',</hi> draw a line to meet CB in <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> then join <hi rend="italic">hg,</hi> and make Cz
                    perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">hg.</hi> Now, if <hi rend="italic">Cd</hi> be
                    equal to <hi rend="italic">Ca,</hi> and perpendicular to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ci,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d i</hi> be joined, it will be the angle which
                    the plank makes with the horizontal plane, or plan. Therefore, draw FD parallel
                    to Ci, and thence find the section, which is the same thing as would be obtained
                    by projecting vertical lines from each point in the hand-rail against the
                    surface of a board laid to touch it in three points. The inexperienced workman
                    will be much assisted in applying the moulds if he acquires a clear notion of
                    the position when executed.</p>
                <p>To find the thickness of the plank, take the height to the under side of the rail
                    <hi rend="italic">cr</hi> in the development (fig. 110), and set it off from <hi
                    rend="italic">s,</hi> in the line <hi rend="italic">Ci,</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> in fig. 114; from the point <hi rend="italic">r</hi> draw
                    a line parallel to <hi rend="italic">d i,</hi> and the distance between those
                    parallel lines will be the thickness of the plank. The mould (fig. 114), which
                    is traced from the plan, is called the <hi rend="italic">face mould.</hi> It is
                    applied to the upper surface of the plank, which being marked, a bevel should be
                    set to the angle <hi rend="italic">i d</hi> C, and this bevel being applied to
                    the edge will give the points to which the mould must be placed to mark out the
                    under side. It is then to be sawn out, and wrought true to the mould. In
                    applying the bevel, care should be taken to let its stock be parallel to the
                    line <hi rend="italic">d i,</hi> if the plank should not be sufficiently wide
                    for <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">i</hi> to be its arris. In the
                    method fig. 113, ADE, on the rise of the stair, is the bevel. After the rail is
                    truly wrought to the face-mould, the falling-mould (fig. 110), being applied to
                    its convex side, will give the edge of the upper surface, and the surface itself
                    will be formed by squaring from the convex side, holding the stock of the square
                    always so that it would be vertical if the rail were in its proper situation.
                    The lower surface is to be parallel to the upper one. The sudden change of the
                    width of the ends of the steps causes the soffit line to have â broken or
                    irregular appearance; to avoid this, the steps are made to begin to wind before
                    the curved part begins. Different methods of proportioning the ends of the steps
                    are given by Nicholson, Roubo, Rondelet, and Krafft. We cannot in this place
                    enter into a detail of these methods, nor can we give the varied systems of
                    cutting the rail in the spring and in the plumb, about which so much has been
                    written, but for the reader’s information a list of the principal writers on <hi

                    Royal Society, published a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Mcchanick Exercises,
                    or the Doctrine of Handy works,</hi> 4to, 1677. The introduction of the
                    geometrical staircase, or stair supported on one side by the wall, invented,
                    says Palladio, by the famous Luigi Cornaro (the first English example of which
                    is said to be that erected in stone by Sir Christopher Wren in St Paul’s
                    Cathedral), led to the greatest changes in the art of joinery, inasmuch as the
                    lines for setting them out necessitated a very considerable knowledge of
                    geometry. The hand-rails of these stairs offered most difficulties, and an
                    imperfect attempt to remove them was first made by Halfpenny, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Art of Sound Building,</hi> published in 1725. Price, the author
                    of the <hi rend="italic">British Carpenter,</hi> published in 1733-35, was more
                    successful, and his remarks show a considerable degree of knowledge of the true
                    nature and object of his researches. The publication of this book must have
                    produced a considerable sensation in the trade, for it was soon followed by many
                    other works of different degrees of merit. Of these the publications of Langley
                    and of Pain were the most popular, and were followed by Roubo, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The establishment of the principles of joinery on the sound basis of geometrical
                    science was reserved for Nicholson. In his <hi rend="italic">Carpenter's New

                    published in 1792, 4to, he has made some most valuable corrections and additions
                    to the labours of his predecessors. This writer has been the founder of all the
                    subsequent works on the subject; his books have been published again and again,
                    in various forms, with additions from time to time, by different hands, as

                    also made in the practice of joinery, for which we are much indebted to an
                    architect, Mr James Wyatt.</p>

                <p>The principles of joinery were cultivated in France by a very different class of
                    writers. The celebrated Blondel, an architect of great eminence, had given
                    details for the construction of shutters, wainscoting, doors, hinges,
                    fastenings, &amp;c., in his work <hi rend="italic">Distribution des Maisons de
                    Plaisance,</hi> 4to, 1737-38. In the extensive work of Frezier, entitled <hi

                    des Bois,</hi> 3 vols. 4to, 1739, all the leading principles are given and
                    explained with tedious minuteness, offering a striking contrast to the brevity
                    of English writers. The first elementary work on that part of geometrical
                    science which contains the principles of joinery appeared in France in 1705,
                    from the pen of the celebrated Gaspard Monge, who gave it the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Géométrie</hi><hi rend="italic">Descriptive.</hi> The most
                    celebrated French work which treats of joinery is Rondelet’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >L’Art de bâtir,</hi> which occupied fourteen years (from 1802 to 1816) in
                    publication. It is also the best foreign work on the subject; but it is little
                    adapted to the state of joinery in England. In practice the French joiners are
                    very much inferior to the English workmen. Their work is rough, slovenly, and
                    often clumsy, and at the best is confined to external effect. The neatness,
                    soundness, and accuracy, which is common to every part of the works of an
                    English joiner, is scarcely to be found in any part of the works of a French
                    one. The little correspondence, in point of excellence, between their theory and
                    practice leads us to think that their theoretical knowledge is confined to
                    architects, engineers, &amp;c., instead of being diffused among workmen, as it
                    is in England. See also ThioUet et Roux, <hi rend="italic">Nouveau</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cabinet-making.</hi></p>
                <p>Cabinet-making, or that part of the art of working in wood which is applied
                    to.furniture, has some affinity with joinery, the same materials and tools being
                    employed ip <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n561/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0561-0500"/> both, and the mode of execution being the same.
                    Correctness and strict uniformity are not so essential in movable, as in the
                    fixed parts of buildings; they are also more under the dominion of fashion, and
                    therefore are not so confined by rules as the parts of buildings. Cabinet-making
                    offers considerable scope for taste in appropriate and beautiful forms, and also
                    in the choice and arrangement of coloured woods. It requires considerable
                    knowledge of perspective, and also that the artist should be able to sketch with
                    freedom and precision. If the cabinet-maker intend to follow the higher
                    departments of his art, it will be necessary to study the different styles of
                    architecture, in order to make himself acquainted with their peculiarities, so
                    as to impress his works with the same character as that of the rooms they are to
                    furnish.</p>
                <p>In cabinet-work the French workmen are certainly superior to the English, at
                    least as far as regards external appearance; but when use as well as ornament is
                    to be considered, the latter certainly carry away the palm. The appearance of
                    French furniture is much indebted to a superior method of polishing, which is
                    now generally known in England. The method of making and using French polish is
                    minutely described in Dr Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Annals of Philosophy,</hi>
                    vol. xi. pp. 119 and 371. For many purposes, however, copal varnish (such as
                    coachmakers use) is preferable; it is more durable, and bears an excellent
                    polish. Foreign oak is much used for cabinetwork; and lately, the fine curled
                    oak that is got from excrescences produced by pollard and other old trees has
                    been used with success in furniture. When well managed it is very beautiful, and
                    makes a pleasing variety. It is relieved by inlaid borders of black or white
                    wood, but these should be sparingly used. Borders of inlaid brass, with small
                    black lines, give a rich effect to the darker coloured kinds, as in buhl-work.
                    Cedar is occasionally used for small fittings, or for cupboards where woollens
                    and furs are stored. Ebony and imitation ebony are useful for cases. Russian
                    birch has of late years been largely in request for bedroom furniture from the
                    cleanly appearance of it. But of all woods mahogany has maintained its place
                    since the first introduction of it in the end of last century. The japanner is
                    now seldom employed to give a colour to wood, as variety can be obtained by
                    staining, heightened by varnishing; or the plain deal or pine is polished or
                    varnished like mahogany or oak. Patterns or lines are stencilled or burnt in
                    according to one or other of the many patents now before the public.</p>
                <p>Many curious works on furniture were published in the reigns of Louis XIV. and
                    XV.; those by Sir W. Chambers and the Adams also deserve attention. Cruden’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Joiner's and Cabinet-maker's Darling,</hi> 8vo, 1770, is a curious
                    book. In ornamental composition much benefit may be derived from Tatham’s <hi

                    are the various illustrated publications relative to the Great Exhibitions in
                    London and Paris (1851, 1855, and 1862), where some of the finest specimens of
                    carpentry in the world were exhibited. The most accessible to the English reader
                    are the <hi rend="italic">Art Journal</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated
                    London News.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Slater-work.</hi></p>
                <p>The slater works his material, slates, for the protection of a building by
                    covering the roof timbers with it, in the same manner as a bricklayer works his
                    tiles. Besides this, which is his chief business, he supplies sawn slates for
                    shelving in larders and dairies, for tanks and cisterns, for pavements, steps,
                    and landings, for panels of doors, for covering hips and ridges, and a few other
                    purposes. Enamelled slate for chimney-pieces, lavatories, and similar
                    applications is of great utility.</p>
                <p>The slater’s principal tool is a large knife or chopper called a saixe, sax, or
                    zax, with which, before he begins to work on a roof, he shapes and trims the
                    slates on the ground, sitting on one end of a stool, which forms a sort of bench
                    and has uprights by which to square the slate. With this knife he strikes off
                    the unevenness on one side of a slate, making it as nearly straight as he can;
                    he then runs a gauge along it, marking the greatest width the slate will bear,
                    and, cutting to that line, makes it perfectly parallel. He next, with a square,
                    brings the thickest and best end to right angles with the sides, generally by
                    chopping, but sometimes by sawing; and then marking upward from the squared foot
                    or tail, makes two nail holes, where, by calculating the gauge the slate in hand
                    will bear, he knows the batten must come. He also uses a drag, which is a long
                    flat piece of iron having a cutting edge at the top and hooked on each side;
                    when he has to strip a roof, he forces it between the slates, and pushes out or
                    cuts off the heads of the nails, and thus the slate is loosened. He has also a
                    couple of knee pads to kneel upon while at work.</p>
                <p>The best slate obtained in Britain is from the quarries of Bangor in
                    Carnarvonshire. The Llangollen quarries are remarkable for the size of the
                    slates that can be obtained. The Delabole quarries in Cornwall have been worked
                    for a considerable period, and supply a grey blue slate. Good slate is also
                    procured in the neighbourhood of Tavistock in Devonshire. An esteemed pale blue
                    green slate is obtained from Kendal in Westmoreland. Cumberland sea green slates
                    are shipped from Maryport. Whitland Abbey green slates are much in vogue. The
                    Ballachulish quarries in the north of Scotland are extensive, and supply a good
                    quality. In Ireland are several, of which the Valentia, co. Kerry; Killaloe, co.
                    Tipperary; Benduff, co. Cork; and those in co. Wicklow, are the best.</p>
                <p>The best slate is of a bluish-grey colour, which breaks before the zax like
                    well-burnt pottery, and will ring in the same manner on being struck. Whitish or
                    light greycoloured slate is for the most part stony; dark blue or blackish
                    slate, on the other hand, cuts very freely, but it absorbs moisture and decays
                    rapidly. The best slates have a hard and rough feel, whilst an open absorbent
                    slate feels smooth and greasy.</p>
                <p>Though slate is classed among the incombustible materials, it must not be
                    depended upon for resisting fire, as unfortunately it will crack and fall to
                    pieces at no very high temperature.</p>
                <p>The scantlings of slate are cut in the quarries to set sizes, and these are split
                    into tablets, thicker or thinner according to the size of the slab and the
                    nature of the slate; for the inferior qualities are neither so compact in
                    material, nor so clearly laminated or schistose, as the superior, and will not
                    therefore rend so freely. The sizes of slates best known in the British market
                    are distinguished by the names of ladies, countesses, duchesses, and queens.
                    Ladies measure 15 inches by 8, countesses 20 inches by 10, duchesses 24 inches
                    by 12, and queens 36 inches by 24, and they are valued in proportion to their
                    magnitude. Besides these, there is a slate which equals the queen in extent of
                    surface, but is of very much greater thickness; this is called Welsh rag. A
                    smaller slate, again, which is less indeed than the lady, and is cut from the
                    refuse of large scantlings, is called a double; in size it does not often exceed
                    12 inches by 6. Westmoreland slates are thick and heavy like the Welsh rag, but
                    do not generally run so large.</p>
                <p>The principle on which slates are laid is the same as that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n562/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0562-0501"/> which is employed in plain tiling. To a roof with
                    projecting eaves a wide board is placed over the ends of the rafters; but when
                    the eaves tail into gutters, the gutter-board is made wide enough to receive the
                    eaves-course For light slating it is necessary to board a roof all over with
                    three-quarter inch rough boarding. This is done by the carpenter; but for strong
                    heavy slates, fillets or laths or battens are considered sufficient; and these
                    are laid by the slater himself, to suit the length of his slates. Three inches
                    wide and one inch thick is a sufficient size for them, if the rafters be not
                    more than 12 inches apart. Against gable or party-walls, a feather-edged board
                    called a tilting fillet is laid to turn the water from the wall. A preferable
                    plan, however, is to board all roofs; it gives a better bed for the slates, and
                    fewer are broken if there be occasion for workmen to walk over them in repairing
                    or in cleaning out the gutters. The expense, too, is but trifling beyond that of
                    the laths. A still further benefit is obtained by bedding the slates in mortar
                    or in hay, which fills up the spaces left by the thickness of the first slate,
                    and with the boarding tends to keep the roof cooler in summer and warmer in
                    winter, a very desirable result for the habitable rooms close under them. Where
                    the roofs are finished with diagonal boarding on purlins without rafters, it
                    makes a very sound bedding for slates. All the slates being gauged to a width,
                    and dressed as above described, and sorted in lengths, they are then taken up to
                    the roof in rotation, beginning with the longest and largest for the lowest
                    courses. The first course the slater lays is little more than half the length of
                    that which is intended to cover it, and is necessary to break the joints at the
                    eaves. This is called the doubling eaves-course; and the covering eaves-course
                    is brought to the same foot line, completely to cover it. Then to ascertain the
                    gauge :— from the length of the slate deduct the bond, which should never be
                    less than 2 inches, and need not be more than 3∣ inches, and the half of what
                    remains will be the gauge. Thus, if the bond be fixed at 3 inches, and the slate
                    is 2 feet 3 inches in length, the gauge will be 1 foot. This gauge or margin is
                    set up from the foot of the eaves-course at each end, and a line strained to
                    mark it along the whole length, and so on, to the ridge or top, where another
                    half-course is required to complete the work, and that is in its turn secured by
                    a covering of sheet lead with a roll. To a hipped roof care is taken to complete
                    every course up to the angle, by cutting slates to fit its slope; and these are
                    also covered by an overlap of sheet lead with a roll, it being nailed or screwed
                    to the hip rafter, and the head bossed over.</p>
                <p>Slate ridging with a roll, as fig. 115, or with a groove for receiving an
                    ornamented cresting, is now very usual, and even a common ridge tiling is
                    necessary to prevent theft of the lead in some localities. Fig. 11G shows
                    specimens of the ornamental red ridging tiles occasionally used, continuously or
                    some lengths of a plain tile apart. In fig. 115, A, A are the two portions of
                    the slate roll ridging, B being the roll with a hole drilled at each end for the
                    insertion of a piu to fix the lengths; C the ridge piece fixed in the head of
                    the king-post D; E the rafter; F the lath on which G, the slating, is nailed. In
                    nailing a slate, it must not be strained or bent in the slightest degree, or it
                    will certainly fly in some sudden atmospheric change, to which it is of course
                    constantly liable, even if it escape fracture from being trodden on by the
                    workmen themselves or by others. Copper, being less liable to oxidize from
                    exposure to common causes than any other metal that will answer the purpose,
                    should always be used for slate nails. Zinc is also occasionally used; and iron
                    tinned and painted nails are sometimes substituted by dishonesty on the part of
                    the workman or builder, or bad economy on that of the proprietor. The French
                    method of fixing slates by means of wire clips which hold the bottom of the
                    slates is unusual in England. A method has lately been introduced of effecting
                    it with lead clips, which is said to dispense with a certain proportion of
                    slates. Each slate is held in something of the same manner which the slater now
                    adopts when a broken slate has to be replaced, and the main advantage is
                    supposed to be that the slates are firmer.</p>
                <p>The mode above described of ascertaining the gauge or margin by the bond, is
                    equally applicable to every sort of roof-covering that is made up of small
                    inflexible parallelogramic slabs or tablets; and it should be borne in mind that
                    the greater the angle is at which the rafters rise, or, in technical language,
                    the higher the pitch of the roof, the less the bond may be, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> With slabs or tablets that vary in length, too,
                    as slates generally do as they are brought to market, it is the bond which it is
                    of importance to observe; but if they are of an invariable length, as tiles are,
                    it is sufficient that the gauge or margin be attended to.</p>
                <p>A very light and neat covering is produced by laying wide slates side by side,
                    and covering their joints with narrow slips bedded in putty, the overlap at the
                    ends being no more than the bond is with the usual mode. It is known as patent
                    slating, and was introduced by Mr Wyatt, who never, however, obtained a patent
                    for it. Indeed it is in principle the mode which was adopted in ancient Greece
                    in covering the roofs of temples. Neither boards nor fillets are used, the
                    slates bearing from rafter to rafter, which may be 2 feet or more apart, and to
                    the rafters the slates are screwed. The covering slips are also screwed, as well
                    as bedded in putty. Slating of this kind may be laid at no greater elevation
                    than 10°, whereas for slating in the ordinary way the angle should never be much
                    less than 25°, though large slates with a 3∣ inch bond, carefully laid and
                    pointed, may perhaps be trusted at a rise of 20°. This mode of applying slate is
                    not without the disadvantage attending the fixing of any substance that freely
                    takes up and readily parts with heat. In expanding and contracting, the joints
                    are too often destroyed, aud leaks are tho comm'on consequence.</p>
                <p>Thatching is an admirable covering for securing warmth in winter and coolness in
                    summer; but it is subject to injury by birds, and to risk from fire. It is still
                    occasionally used in picturesque cottages, arbours, and similar buildings, and
                    was much used for churches in Norfolk and Suffolk. The thatcher requires a
                    common stable fork, to toss up the straw together before being made into
                    bundles; a thatcher’s fork, to carry the straw from the heap up to the roof; a
                    thatcher’s rake, to comb down the straw straight and smooth; a knife, or eaves
                    knife, to cut and trim the straw to a straight line; a knife, to point the
                    twigs; a half glove of leather, to protect the hand when driving in the smaller
                    twigs or spars; a long flat needle; a pair of leather gaiters to come up above
                    the knees, used when kneeling on the rafters; and a gritstone to sharpen the
                    knives. Wheat straw lasts from 15 to 20 years, and oat straw about 8 years. Reed
                    thatching, as done in the West <pb break="no"

                    cut off, leaving the clean, sound pipe straw, of which a thickness of 3 inches
                    is laid on the common thatching with spars only. The materials required are
                    straw or reeds, laths, nails, withes, and rods. A load of straw, laid on about
                    12 to 16 inches in thickness, will do a square and a half; a bundle of oak
                    laths, 1⅛ inches wide, and from to fths thick, nailed about 8 inches apart, 1
                    square; a hundred of withes, 3 squares; a pound of rope yarn, 1 square; a
                    hundred of rods, 3 squares; and 2⅜ hundred of nails, 1 square. Probably thatched
                    roofs were formerly ornamented by a species of cresting, for in some parts of
                    the country the withes or willow twigs that bind the thatch are sometimes
                    arranged on the tops of ricks and cottages in an interlacing manner, terminating
                    at the apex or at each end with a spike with a rudely formed cock.
                    Viollet-le-Duc, in his <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire,</hi> alludes to the
                    custom of forming the ridge in mud, in which plants and grasses were inserted to
                    prevent the earth being dissolved and washed away by the rain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Plumber-work</hi></p>
                <p>Lead, as the name imports, is the material in and with which the plumber works.
                    The principal operations of this trade are directed to the covering of roofs and
                    flats, laying gutters, covering hips, ridges, and valleys, fixing water trunks,
                    making cisterns and reservoirs, and laying on the requisite pipes and cocks to
                    them, fixing water-closet apparatus, setting up pumps, and applying indeed all
                    the hydraulic machinery required in economic building. The plumber’s tools are
                    knives, chisels, and gouges for cutting and trimming, rasps or files and planes
                    for fitting and jointing, a dressing and flatting tool for the purposes its name
                    expresses, iron hammers and wooden mallets for driving and fixing, ladles in
                    which to melt solder, grozing irons to assist in soldering, a hand-grate or
                    stove which may be conveniently moved from place to place for melting solder and
                    heating the grozing irons, a stock and bits for boring holes, and a rule of two
                    feet in length divided into three parts, two of boxwood, the third of steel, for
                    passing into places he may have to examine; also compasses, lines, and chalk for
                    setting out and marking, and centre-bits of all sizes for making perforations,
                    together with weighing apparatus, as the quantities of most of the materials
                    used by the plumber must be either proved or determined by weight. The waste of
                    lead in working is very trifling, as cuttings all go to the melting pot again
                    with little or no loss but that of refounding or casting; and even old lead is
                    taken by the lead merchant in exchange for new at a very trifling allowance for
                    tare and the cost of reworking. A plumber is always attended by a labourer, who
                    does the more laborious work of carrying the materials from place to place,
                    helps to move them when necessary, melts the solder and heats the grozing irons,
                    attends to hold the one or the other, as neither may be set down or put out of
                    hand when in use, and assists in some of the minor and coarser operations.</p>
                <p>In boarding roofs, flats, and gutters for lead, clasp-nails or flooring brads
                    should be used; and the first care of the plumber should be to punch them all in
                    from an eighth to a quarter of an inch below the surface, and stop the holes
                    carefully and completely with putty, or a chemical process will ensue on the
                    slightest access of moisture should the iron heads of the nails come in contact
                    with the lead, and the latter will, in the course of no long period, be
                    completely perforated over every one of them. Neither should lead in surfaces of
                    any extent be soldered, or in any manner fastened at the edges, without being
                    turned up so as to make sufficient allowance for the expansion and contraction
                    which it is constantly undergoing during the various changes in the temperature
                    of the atmosphere. It may be taken, indeed, as a general rule, that solder
                    should be dispensed with as much as possible. Like glue to the joiner, it is
                    indispensable in many cases; but like glue also, it is in common practice made
                    to cover many defects, and much bad work, that ought not to exist. The soft
                    solder used by plumbers on account of its melting easily is a composition of tin
                    and lead in equal parts, fused together, and run into moulds in shape not unlike
                    the bars of a gridiron. In the operation of soldering, the surfaces of the metal
                    intended to be joined are scraped and rendered very clean; they are then brought
                    close together, and sprinkled with resin or borax at the joints to prevent
                    oxidation while soldering. The heated solder is then brought in a ladle and
                    poured on the joint, and smoothed and finished by a hot grozing iron and rubbed
                    down with a cloth.</p>
                <p>Sheet lead, whether cast or milled, is supplied of various weight or thickness,
                    and is always described as of such weight (4 to 12 pounds) to the superficial
                    foot. There are very few purposes, indeed, in building, in which lead of less
                    than 6 lb to the foot should be used, and very few in which the weight needs to
                    exceed 10. For roofs, flats, and gutters, under ordinary circumstances, 7 or 8
                    ft&gt; lead is a very fair and sufficient average; for hips and ridges, lead of
                    6 ft&gt; to the foot is thick enough; and for flashings <hi rend="italic">5</hi>
                    ft&gt; lead need not be objected to. Cast lead has been preferred for the former
                    purposes, because its surface is harder, but milled lead is of more even
                    thickness throughout, bends without cracking, which is not always the case with
                    cast lead, and makes neater work. Sheets of cast lead run from 16 to 18 feet
                    long and 6 feet wide; milled sheets are made of about the same width, and 6 or 8
                    feet longer than cast sheets. Neither the one nor the other may be safely used
                    on flats, or in gutters exposed to the wide range of temperature of our climate,
                    in pieces of more than half the length and half the breadth of a sheet; that is
                    to say, from 8 to 12 feet long, and 3 feet wide, are the limits within which
                    sheet lead will expand and contract without puckering and cracking; and to allow
                    it to move freely it is laid with rolls and drips in such a manner that any
                    extent of surface may be covered with the effect of continuity, though the
                    pieces of lead forming the covering be of such small sizes as above stated. But
                    all <hi rend="italic">fixing,</hi> whether by soldering or otherwise, is to be
                    carefully avoided. A roll is a piece of wood made about 2 inches thick and 2∣
                    inches wide, rounded on one edge, and fixed with that edge uppermost, so as to
                    come 4 inches within half the width of a sheet, that the edges may be turned up
                    and folded round and over it, being lapped by, or lapping the edge of the
                    adjoining sheet (Plate XXVI. fig. 7). Lead sufficiently stout, dressed neatly
                    and closely down to the boards under it, and over the rolls at its edges, will
                    require no fastening of any kind, unless it be so light as to be movable by the
                    wind. Bolls are used mostly in roofs and flats; drips principally in gutters,
                    though they may bo required in long flats. The drip is formed in the first
                    instance by the carpenter in laying the , gutter boards, according to an
                    arrangement with the plumber. It is a difference made in the height of the
                    gutter of from 1∣ inches to 3 inches, where one sheet terminates in length, and
                    meets another in continuation. The end of the lower is turned up against the
                    drip, and that of the upper is dressed down over it, so as effectually to
                    prevent the water from driving up under it. Where the fall is not great, a piece
                    should be cut out across the higher gutter board, so that the top of the
                    under-lead may lie level with the board. Gutters should have a fall of at least
                    an eighth of an inch to the foot, and in flats it should be rather more, for
                    such a covering is only so called in contradistinction to the pitch of a roof;
                    ends and sides which are against a wall should <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n564/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0564-0503"/> turn up against it from 5 to 7 inches, according
                    to circumstances; and the turning up under the slates, tiles, or other roof
                    covering, to a gutter, should be to the level of that against the wall at the
                    least. The turning up against the wall should be covered by a flashing. This is
                    a piece of lead let into one of the joints of the wall above the edge of the
                    gutter lead, and dressed neatly down over it, to prevent water from getting in
                    behind it (Plate XXVI. fig. 6). Parallel or box-gutters are necessary next
                    parapets where a curb roof is formed, and are useful in valleys of small roofs
                    where the depth for it can be obtained. Fig. 117 is a section of such a gutter
                    next to a parapet wall, in which A is the wall plate; B the tiebeam of the roof;
                    C a bearer for carrying one end of the gutter bearer D, the other end being
                    tenoned into the pole plate K; E the gutter boards carried by its bearers; G the
                    lead gutter, laid in somewhat of an oval shape by the small angle fillets, which
                    are useful in preventing the lead being returned at a right angle, where it is
                    sometimes cracked in laying; H the flashing; I the eaves’ board for raising the
                    last row of slates, over which the lead is fixed; L the common rafter; M the
                    slating; N the principal rafter forming part of the truss of the roof; O the
                    saddleback coping of the wall, throated on both sides. Where thick walls could
                    be obtained, it was usual to form this sort of gutter below the timbers of the
                    roof, whereby they were kept dry, and damage from the overflowing of the gutter
                    prevented. The same result is occasionally achieved by a cornice projecting more
                    than usual, the gutter being formed on it in place of a real blocking course. If
                    the gutters and flats are to be often walked upon, they should be protected by
                    deal lattice work raised on fillets but not fixed. ' Snow falling down the
                    slopes is prevented by this from stopping the gutters, and it also lessens the
                    action of the sun upon the lead-work. Lead on ridges and hips and the top and
                    sides of dormers, not being in sufficient masses to be secured by its own
                    weight, must be fastened by nails bossed over.</p>
                <p>In making cisterns and reservoirs, unless they be cast (and these are now
                    disused), the sheets of lead must of necessity be joined by soldering; but the
                    water they are intended to contain protects the lead from the frequent and
                    sudden changes to which in other and more exposed situations it is exposed. The
                    lead-work forms a lining to a wood case, which has grooved and tongued sides and
                    a bottom. But cisterns are now commonly made of zinc, or of galvanized iron, or
                    of slate; the last two do not require a casing, but may perhaps be enclosed in a
                    closet. Service or water pipes to and from the cisterns, as also waste or
                    overflow pipes, are also made of lead, and described by their bore, as ⅜ in., ⅜
                    in., inch, and so on. They are generally supported and attached to the wall by
                    means of iron holdfasts. Iron water pipes are fixed where lead will probably be
                    stolen. The opinion that some waters are injured by coming in contact with the
                    lead of cisterns and pipes, has led to the formation of pipes of tin encased in
                    lead. The water companies are now requiring a water regulator to be put to each
                    closet, or a water waste preventor where the constant supply is obtained, but
                    these are a very troublesome addition to the plumber’s work, on account of the
                    difficulty of keeping them in working order. The constant supply system requires
                    taps of a different construction from those used in other cases; these are
                    called “screw down valves,” from their action, and resist the pressure of the
                    water. As repairs must occasionally be needed to the main pipes, it is
                    recommended that, to prevent inconvenience, one or more cisterns be always
                    provided in the house for containing two days’ supply of water.</p>
                <p>Rain-water trunks and pipes are made of a certain number of pounds weight to the
                    yard in length, according to the bore or calibre that is required. The pipes are
                    fitted with large case heads above, to receive the water from the gutter spouts,
                    and with shoes to deliver the water below; they are fixed or attached to the
                    walls of buildings of stone usually with flanges of lead, which are secured by
                    means of spike nails,—iron and other metals having superseded lead where brick
                    is used or economy requires the substitution.</p>
                <p>The varieties of water-closet apparatus, of which Under· hay’s patent is one of
                    the best, are too numerous to be here described. Pumps of all kinds and powers
                    are amongst the other matters coming within the plumber’s province, together
                    with cocks, bosses, ferules, washers, valves, balls, grates, traps, funnels,
                    service boxes, and a numerous collection of other articles.</p>
                <p>A metal occasionally used for roofs in lieu of lead is known by the name of
                    Wetterstedt’s patent marine metal. It is composed of lead and antimony. Its
                    advantages are its malleability, great tenacity, elasticity, and durability, and
                    its resistance to acids, oxidation, and the action of the sun and atmosphere. It
                    is manufactured in sheets of certain sizes, from 3 ft&gt; to 8 ounces per foot,
                    according to the purposes for which it is required, the latter weight being
                    useful for lining damp walls. It should be secured with wrought copper nails. A
                    patent metallic canvas is also manufactured of various substances and strength,
                    serving for waterproof and secure covering.</p>
                <p>Sheet copper was formerly used on account of its lightness to cover roofs and
                    flats. The thickness generally varied from 12 to 18 ounces per square foot. It
                    was laid like lead, but the plates being of small size were soldered together.
                    It will be well to notice that water collected from copper channels must not be
                    used for culinary purposes, as a film of verdigris is formed, which is
                    poisonous. Copper is much used for roofing in foreign countries.</p>
                <p>Lead and copper, where economy is required, are superseded by zinc, which is not
                    only much cheaper, but when good is nearly as durable, and is not so liable to
                    be corrugated by the action of the sun. Zinc is subject to oxidation; but the
                    oxide, instead of scaling off as that of iron does, forms a permanent coating on
                    the metal. Its expansion and contraction are greater than those of any other
                    metal. Zinc sheets as manufactured vary in quality, some being very brittle.
                    That supplied by the Vielle Montagne Zinc Mining Company possesses a high
                    reputation for purity and excellence. Zinc must be laid like lead, without
                    fixing either by nails or solder. No. 13 gauge, weighing 19 oz. 10 drs., is the
                    least for roofs, flats, and gutters on boarding. No. 14, a medium thickness,
                    weighing 21 oz. 13 drs., is used for roofs and flats; and No. 15 or 16, weighing
                    24 oz. and 26 oz. 3 drs. per foot superficial, for best work and roofs without
                    boards. Zinc pipes are extensively used as chimney pots; stamped and moulded
                    ornamental zinc for dormers, Mansard roofs, vanes, guttering, and rain-water
                    pipes, cisterns, &amp;c.; and perforated zinc for blinds and for
                    ventilation.</p>
                <p>Tin cannot class with the building materials in England, although it is
                    extensively used for covering roofs in America and in Russia.</p>
                <p>The best publications on this trade are the makers’ price books and lists of
                    articles made and sold by them. See also the article <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>No art in the economy of building contributes more to produce internal neatness
                    and elegance, and no one is less absolutely important, so far as the use and
                    stability of a structure are concerned, than that of the plasterer. The very
                    general application of plaster is of comparatively late date; for wainscoted
                    walls, and boarded or boarded and canvased ceilings, or naked joists alone, are
                    frequently found in houses of rather over a century old, both in England and on
                    the Continent; and a return to this state of completion in the present day is
                    the result of the attempts of the mediaeval school of architects, and their cry
                    of “no shams,” which has not been quite successful among themselves, for plaster
                    and cement are used by many. The walls of houses were formerly plastered above
                    the wainscoting and coloured, while the ornamented plaster ceilings of the time
                    of Henry VIII., Elizabeth, and .Tames I., are still the admiration of lovers of
                    the art. Still earlier specimens of the plasterer’s skill are extant in the
                    pargetted and ornamented fronts of halftimber houses.</p>
                <p>For the more common operations of plastering comparatively few tools and few
                    materials are required. The plasterer is attended by a labourer, who supplies
                    his boards with mortar, and by a boy on the scaffold with him to feed his hawk,
                    which is a piece of wood about 10 inches square with a handle under it, for
                    carrying up small portions of plastering mortar to the wall or ceiling, to be
                    there delivered and spread by the trowel, a thin plate of hardened iron or steel
                    with a wooden handle, similar to that used by the bricklayer. The plasterer is
                    obliged to keep this implement particularly clean and dry when he is not
                    actually using it, lest it rust in the slightest degree, as it is clear that the
                    brown oxide of iron would sadly discolour his finer work on touching it again
                    with the trowel. He is necessarily furnished with a lathing hammer, a hand
                    float, a quirk float, and a derby or darby, which is a long two-handled float
                    for forming the floated coat of lime and hair; brushes for fine or rough work;
                    three or four jointing trowels for mitres, &amp;c.; jointing rules; moulds for
                    cornices, which are of wood, but for work of any importance the frame is made of
                    wood and the outline cut out of a copper (or more usually zinc) plate,—these are
                    inserted in the wooden stock, and narrow pieces of wood are fixed to the moulds
                    transversely to guide and steady them along the screeds; a straight edge,
                    wherewith to bring the plastering on a wall or ceiling to a perfectly even
                    surface by traversing it in every direction; a screen, having metal wires to act
                    as a sieve for separating the coarser materials which enter into the composition
                    of plastering mortar,—these are thrown against its outer face, to separate the
                    particles which are too large for the purpose from the finer,—the sand and lime,
                    too, are mixed much more efficiently and completely by screening them together
                    than in any other manner; a spade and hod like those of the bricklayer’s
                    labourer; a rake to separate the hair used in the mortar and distribute it
                    throughout the mass; and a server for the hawk boy to beat up the mortar, and to
                    deliver it in small pats on the hawk.</p>
                <p>The plasterer, as the term imports, works in plastic, adhesive compositions,
                    which are laid on walls, both internally and externally, to stop crevices,
                    reduce inequalities, and produce an even, delicate surface, capable of receiving
                    any decoration that may be applied to it, either in colour or otherwise. These
                    compositions are as various as the modes of applying them, the rudest being a
                    compost of loam, a marly clay, and lime; this is used only for the commonest
                    purposes, and being laid on in one coat, is washed over with a thin mixture of
                    lime and water, a process termed lime-whiting. There are many grades from this
                    to the highest work of the plasterer,—the making imitations of marbles and other
                    costly stones, from the purest calcined gypsum mixed with a solution of gum and
                    isinglass and colouring matter to produce the required imitation. His materials
                    are laths, lath nails, lime, sand, hair, and plaster, a variety of stuccoes and
                    cements, together with various ingredients to form colouring washes, &amp;c.
                    Scaffolding is not generally required for new work, but with old work it is
                    sometimes necessary. Under ordinary circumstances, the plasterer is enabled to
                    wash, stop, and whiten the ceilings and walls of rooms from trestles, with
                    boards laid across them. In lofty saloons and halls, churches, &amp;c.,
                    scaffolding is indispensable. It is necessary, too, to a front that is to be
                    plastered in any way; but this may be afterwards washed, repaired, and coloured
                    from a ladder, without the intervention of a scaffold, except perhaps the
                    suspended scaffold now so much used.</p>
                <p>Laths are narrow strips of some straight-grained wood, generally of fir, though
                    oak laths are sometimes used, in lengths of 3 and 4 feet, or to suit the
                    distances at which the joists of a floor or the quarterings of a partition are
                    set, and in thickness from ⅜th to f ths of an inch; those of the greater
                    thickness are called lath and a half. Lath nails are either wrought or cut; cut
                    nails are in common use in England with fir laths. Coarse stuff is composed of
                    ox or horse hair from the hide, in addition to lime and sand mortar; this is
                    intended to act as a sort of mesh to net or tie it together, and form a coarse
                    but plastic felt. The hair should be long, and free from all grease and filth.
                    Road drift is unfit to be used in place of clean sharp sand in mortar, unless it
                    be completely cleansed from all animal and vegetable matter, and of mud and
                    clay. Fine stuff is made of fine white lime, exceedingly well slaked with water,
                    or rather macerated in water to make the slaking complete; for some purposes a
                    small quantity of hair is mixed up with this material. The mere paste, when
                    allowed to evaporate until it is of a sufficient consistence for working, is
                    called putty. Gauge stuff is composed of about three-fourths of putty and
                    one-fourth of calcined gypsum or plaster of Paris; this may be mixed only in
                    small quantities at a time, as the plaster or gauge renders it liable to set
                    very rapidly. Bastard stucco is made of two-thirds fine stuff, without hair, and
                    one-third of very fine and perfectly clean sand. Common stucco is composed of
                    about three-fourths of clean sharp sand and one-fourth of the best lime, well
                    incorporated. This must be protected from the air from the time it is made up
                    until it is required to be laid on the walls. Parker’s (or Parker’s Roman)
                    cement, when of good quality, with fine clean sharp sand, in the proportion of
                    about three of sand to one of cement, and well executed, forms a very good
                    external coating for walls. It is vulgarly called “comps,” a contraction of
                    “composition.” Portland cement, so called because the mortar formed by it when
                    mixed with sand is supposed to present the appearance of stone from the Portland
                    quarries, is in much esteem for an outside stucco, as the colour to which it
                    dries is sufficiently agreeable to the eye without any colouring wash, whereas
                    Parker’s cement is too often of a dark dirty tint, requiring painting or
                    colouring to render it tolerable. Portland cement is also much valued as being
                    proof against water when used as a mortar in setting brickwork, and in the
                    composition of concrete for foundations. The patent selenitic cement already
                    described (page 459), is stated to be an excellent substitute for Portland
                    cement; it takes double the usual quantity of sand, and is stronger even then
                    than ordinary mortar. Plastering is finished in much less time than by the
                    common mode.</p>
                <p>A class of cements capable of taking a brilliant polish resembling marble, and
                    consequently very suitable for internal decoration, deserves to be mentioned.
                    The chief <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n566/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0566-0505"/> of these are Keene’s marble cement and Parian
                    cement. They become excessively hard in a short time, and are capable of being
                    painted in a few days. The principal component is said to be obtained by the
                    precipitation of alum by an alkali, which gives a white powder of great
                    brilliancy. Tints can be made up with these cements for coloured decorative
                    work. Cements made by the mixture of oil with various substances were formerly
                    much used both here and abroad. The best known in England was called Hamelin’s
                    mastic, that in France the mastic de Dhil. These cements being very expensive,
                    and requiring to be constantly painted, have now gone nearly out of use. For
                    outside plastering they form a very fine clean surface, as may be seen in the
                    quadrant in Regent Street and other buildings of that date, but in many
                    instances it has been taken otf and Portland cement substituted.</p>
                <p>Blue lias lime was formerly greatly esteemed as a cement for outside work, but
                    the carelessness of the burners has tended much to limit its use, there being a
                    large proportion of underburnt stone left in it. The workmen also would not take
                    the requisite pains for slaking this lime, and manufacturers therefore ground
                    it, by which operation the core becomes mixed up with the properly burnt
                    material, and the efficiency of the lime is destroyed. The lumps should be
                    broken as small as nutmegs, then immersed in water on a sieve until air-bubbles
                    freely rise to the surface; the lime so wetted is to be left in a heap covered
                    by damp sand for twenty-four hours, after which time it should be screened and
                    mixed with the proper quantity of sand and the least possible quantity of water.
                    To one of lime may be put not more than from two to two and a half of sand. When
                    slaked it does not increase in bulk.</p>
                <p>The various coatings of plastering are distinguished thus. On laths, plastering
                    in one coat simply is said to be laid, and in two eoats, laid and set. In
                    three-coat plastering on laths, however, the first is called the pricking up,
                    the second is said to be floated, and the third set. On brick or stone walls,
                    plastering in one plain coat is termed rendering; with two coats, a wall is said
                    to be rendered and set; and in three, rendered, floated, and set.</p>
                <p>Before beginning to lath a ceiling, the plasterer proves the under face of the
                    joists, to which he has to work, by applying a long straight edge, and makes up
                    for any slight inequalities in them, when the work is not to be of a very
                    superior description, by nailing on laths or slips to bring them as nearly even
                    as he can. When the inequalities are great, or if the work is to be of fine
                    quality, he recurs to the carpenter, who takes off inordinate projections with
                    his adze, and nails on properly dressed slips w here the joists do not come down
                    low enough, and thus brings the whole to a perfect level. This operation is
                    called firring, or furring. If it be a framed floor with ceiling joists the
                    plaster has to work to, it is tolerably sure to be straight; but the carpenter
                    must have firred down on the beams or binders to the level of the ceiling
                    joists, unless the ceiling joists have been nailed to the beams or binders, when
                    nothing of this kind is necessary. If a ceiling is to be divided into
                    compartments or panels, the projecting or depending portions must be bracketed
                    or cradled down to receive the laths. It is an important point to be attended to
                    in plastering on laths, and in ceilings particularly, that the laths should be
                    attached to as small a surface of timber as possible, because the plastering is
                    not supported or upborne by its adhesion or attachment to the wood, but by the
                    keying of the mortar itself, which passes through between the laths, and bends
                    round over them. If then the laths are in constantly recurring contact with
                    thick joists and beams, the keying is as constantly intercepted, and the
                    plastering in all such places must depend entirely on the portions between them
                    which are properly keyed. Under a single floor, therefore, in w hich the joists
                    are necessarily thick, a narrow fillet should be nailed along the middle under
                    the whole length of them all, to receive the laths and keep them at a sufficient
                    distance from the timber to allow the plastering to key under it; thus too the
                    surface may be made more perfectly even, as it is in single floors that
                    inequalities mostly occur. This being all arranged, the plasterer commences
                    lathing. The laths should be of the stronger sort. Thin weak laths, if used in a
                    ceiling, are sure to produce inequalities, by sagging with or yielding to the
                    weight attached to them; one or two weak ones in a ceiling of otherwise strong
                    laths may be the ruin of the best piece of work. They should be previously
                    sorted, the weak, crooked, and knotty, if there be such, being reserved for
                    inferior works, andthe best and straightest selected for the work of most
                    importance, so that the workman shall find none to his hand that is not fit to
                    be brought in. Taking a lath that will reach across three or four openings, he
                    strikes a nail into it on one of the intermediate joists, at about three-eighths
                    of an inch from the one before it, and then secures the ends of that and the one
                    that it meets of the last row with one nail, leaving the other end of the lath
                    he has just set to be secured in the same manner with that which shall meet it
                    of the next bay in continuation. It is of importance also that in ceiling-w ork
                    he pay attention to the bonding of his work. In lathing on quartering partitions
                    and battened walls, the bonding is not a matter of much importance; nor is the
                    thickness of the timbers behind the latter of so much consequence as in a
                    ceiling, because the toothing which the thickness of the lath itself affords to
                    the plastering is enough to support it vertically; but, nevertheless, the more
                    complete the keying, even in works of this kind, the better, as the toothing
                    above will not protect it from any exciting cause to fall forwards, or away from
                    the laths. The thinner or weaker sort of lath is generally considered
                    sufficiently strong for partitions.</p>
                <p>When the lathing is completed, the work is either laid or pricked up, according
                    as it is to be finished with one, two, or three coats. Laying is a tolerably
                    thick coat of coarse stuff or lime and hair brought to a tolerably even surface
                    with the trowel only; for this the mortar must be well tempered, and of moderate
                    consistence,—thin or moist enough to pass readily through between the laths, and
                    bend with its own weight over them, and at the same time stiff enough to leave
                    no danger that it will fall apart,—a contingency, however, that in practice
                    frequently occurs in consequence of badly composed or badly tempered mortar,
                    unduly close lathing, or sufficient force not having been used with properly
                    consistent mortar to force it through and form keys. If the work is to be of two
                    coats, that is, laid and set, when the laying is sufficiently dry, it is roughly
                    swépt with a birch broom to roughen its surface, and then the set, a thin coat
                    of fine stuff, is put on. This is done with the common trowel alone, or only
                    assisted by a wetted hog’s bristle brush, which the workman uses with his left
                    hand to strike over the surface of the set, while he presses and smoothes it
                    with the trowel in his right. If the laid work should have become very dry, it
                    must be slightly moistened before the set is put on, or the latter, in
                    shrinking, will crack and fall away. This is generally done by sprinkling or
                    throwing the water over the surface from the brush. For floated or three-coat
                    work, the first, or pricking up, is roughly laid on the laths, the principal
                    object being to make the keying complete, and form a layer of mortar on the
                    laths to which the next coat may attach itself. It must, of course, be kept of
                    tolerably equal thickness throughout, and should stand about one-quarter or
                    three-eighths of an inch on the surface of the laths. When it is finished, and
                    while the mortar is still quite moist, the plasterer scratches or scores it all
                    over <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n567/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0567-0506"/> with the end of a lath in parallel lines from 3
                    to 4 inches apart. The scorings should be made as deep as possible without
                    laying bare the laths; and the rougher their edges are the better, as the object
                    is to produce a surface to which the next coat will readily attach itself. When
                    the pricked up coat is so dry as not to yield to pressure in the slightest
                    degree, preparations may be made for the floating. Ledges or margins of lime and
                    hair, about 6 or 8 inches in width, and extending across the whole breadth of a
                    ceiling or height of a wall or partition, must be made in the angles or at the
                    borders, and at distances of jιbout <hi rend="italic">4</hi> feet apart
                    throughout the whole extent; these must be made perfectly straight with one
                    another, and be proved in every way by the application of straight edges;
                    technically these ledges are termed <hi rend="italic">screeds.</hi> The screeds
                    are gauges for the rest of the work; for when they are ready, and the mortar in
                    them is a little set, the interspaces are filled up flush with them; and a derby
                    float or long straight edge being made to traverse the screeds, all the stuff
                    that projects beyond the line is struck off, and thus the whole is brought to a
                    straight and perfectly even surface. To perfect the work, the screeds on
                    ceilings should be levelled, and on walls and partitions plumbed. When the
                    floating is sufficiently set and nearly dry, it is brushed with a birch broom as
                    before described, and the third coat or set is put on. This for a fine ceiling
                    that is to be whitened or coloured must be of putty; but if it is to be papered,
                    which is very unusual, ordinary fine stuff, with a little hair in it, will be
                    better. Walls and partitions that are to be papered are also of this latter, or
                    of rough stucco, but for paint the set must be bastard stucco trowelled. This
                    coat must be worked of exactly the same thickness throughout, to preserve to the
                    external surface the advantage that has been obtained by floating. For all but
                    the last-mentioned, the set on floated work, the trowel and brush are considered
                    sufficient to produce fine and even work; but trowelled stucco must moreover be
                    hand floated. In this operation the stucco is set with the trowel in the usual
                    manner, and brought to an even surface with that tool to the extent of two or
                    three yards. The workman then takes the handfloat in his right hand, and rubs it
                    smartly over the surface, pressing gently to condense the material as much as
                    possible. As he works the float he sprinkles the surface with water from the
                    brush in his left hand, and eventually produces a texture as fine and smooth
                    almost as that of polished marble.</p>
                <p>But lathing and plastering on laths as practised in England is at best a very
                    flimsy affair, and greatly requires improvement. Stronger laths than the laths
                    commonly employed, put on further apart, and with headed wrought nails, and the
                    plastering laid on upon both sides in upright work, or both above and below the
                    ceilings at the same time, two men working against one another, will produce
                    work in some degree worthy of the name. The practice of the French in this
                    respect is well worthy the consideration, and to a great extent the imitation,
                    of English plasterers.</p>
                <p>The process of plastering on the naked brick or stone wall differs but little,
                    except in name, from that we have described as the mode on lath. The single coat
                    is called rendering, and it need differ only in the quantity of hair, which may
                    be less than is necessary for laying on lath, and in the consistence of the
                    mortar, which may be made more plastic, to work easier, and because in a moister
                    state it will attach itself more firmly to the wall; the wall, however, must
                    itself be well wetted before the rendering is applied. The set is the same, and
                    is put on in the same manner as to two-coat work on lath. For three-coat or
                    floated work, the first or rough rendering should be made to fill up completely
                    whatever crevices there may be in the work behind it, and be incorporated with
                    it as much as possible. As its name imports, its surface may, indeed should, be
                    rough; but it is not scratched or lined as the similar coat on lath is. For
                    this, too, the wall must be previously wetted, that the mortar may the better
                    attach itself to it. For the floating, screeds must be formed as before
                    described, and the consecutive process is exactly the same as on lath, both for
                    the floated and for the set coat. In almost every case in which plastering is to
                    be floated, the workman finds a guide for the feet of his wall screeds in the
                    narrow grounds which the joiner has previously fixed for his skirtings; from
                    these he plumbs upwards, and makes his work perfectly flush with them.</p>
                <p>Mouldings and cornices (as large combinations of mouldings and flat surfaces
                    immediately under the ceilings of rooms are called) are formed with running
                    moulds, and are generally executed before the setting coat is put on the walls
                    and ceiling. If the cornice do not project more than about an inch and a half,
                    or 2 inches, from the ordinary work, a backing of lime and hair will be
                    sufficient; and if any one part only happen to be more than ordinarily
                    protuberant, a row of nails from 6 to 12 inches apart stuck into the wall or
                    ceiling in the line of that part will give it sufficient support. But if the
                    general mass of the cornice be more than that amounts to, and extend more than 6
                    or 8 inches along the ceiling, it must be bracketed out, and the bracketing
                    lathed and pricked up, as for ordinary work. This pricking up, or other
                    preparation, must of course be perfectly set before the cornice is run; and
                    there should be one-fourth of an inch at least of clear space between the
                    preparation and the mould in the nearest part. A wooden screed or parallel
                    straight edge is tacked on with brads to the wall, and another on the ceiling,
                    if the cornice be large and heavy, as guides or gauges for the mould, whose
                    rests are chased to fit them; and then one man laying on gauge stuff in an
                    almost fluid state with an angular trowel, another works the mould backwards and
                    forwards over it, which strikes off what is superfluous, and gives the converse
                    of its form to the rest. The mould is never taken down from the work at right
                    angles to the line of it, but is drawn off at the end, so that none of the parts
                    of the moulding or cornice is injured or torn by it, which must otherwise
                    frequently be the case, from the peculiar forms at times given to the details.
                    If a cornice be too large and heavy to be executed at once, it may be done in
                    the same manner at two or more times, in so many parts; and if any part or parts
                    of a moulding or cornice is to be enriched, the space for it is left vacant by
                    the mould, and the enrichment is afterwards supplied. As a cornice cannot be
                    completed up to the angles by the mould, it is worked by hand in those
                    situations to a joint. The joinings are termed mitres, and in forming them the
                    plasterer uses the jointing tools we have already described.</p>
                <p>Models for enrichments are made by the modeller, according to the design or
                    drawing submitted to him, and from them the plasterer makes wax or gelatine
                    moulds, or, as in ordinary practice, the modeller supplies the moulds in which
                    the ornament is cast in plaster of Paris. If the ornament be in recurring
                    lengths or parts, as is usually the case, only one length or part is modelled,
                    and casts of as many as are required are taken from the mould; some single
                    ornaments, again, which are very large, require to be moulded and cast in parts,
                    which are put together by means of cement. When the cast ornaments are
                    sufficiently dry the pieces are scraped and trimmed, and the joints made clean
                    and even; and they are set in the cornice with plaster of Paris, with white
                    lead, or with a composition called iron cement, as the case may require. If the
                    castings have something in the cornice to rest upon, the first will do; but if
                    there is nothing to retain or attach them but the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n568/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0568-0507"/> cement, one of the last two must be used. Flowers
                    and other ornaments on ceilings which are too large and heavy to be trusted to
                    adhesive matter alone, must be screwed to wooden cradling behind and above
                    them.</p>
                <p>In plastering a wall with common stucco (and its use is mostly for outside work),
                    the first thing to be done is to remove the dust from it by brushing, and then
                    to wet very completely with water If the wall to be stuccoed be an old one, or
                    one of which the joints have been drawn, the mortar of the joints must be
                    chipped or even raked out, and the bricks picked, to expose a new and porous
                    surface to the plastering before brushing and wetting. The wall is then covered
                    with stucco in a fluid state, applied with a broad and strong hog’s bristle
                    brush, like common whitewashing. When this is nearly dry the stucco must be laid
                    on as in common rendering, unless the work is to be floated, when the process is
                    nearly similar to that in floated plastering. Screeds must be formed at ehe
                    highest and lowest extremities of the wall, or of that part of the wall which is
                    in the same vertical line, and is not intercepted by string courses, and be
                    returned at the angles, putting the whole surface into a sort of frame. These
                    must be made perfectly straight and plumb, so as to be quite out of winding by
                    the careful application of the plumb-rule and straight edge. Inner vertical
                    screeds must then follow at three or four feet apart across the whole surface,
                    and be made to range exactly with the outer ones, and then the interstices must
                    be filled in as before. As the work is made good it must be well rubbed with the
                    hand float, as in the execution of trowelled stucco internally, to compress the
                    material, and produce a hard, even, and glossy surface. Preparations for
                    cornices and other projections from the straight surface of the work must have
                    been previously made in or on the brick or stone-work by the protrusion of
                    bricks, tiles, or whatever may be best suited to form a core; and the mouldings
                    and cornices are run with moulds, in the manner described for the same things
                    internally, only that in work of this kind no plastic material but the stucco
                    itself is used,—that is, there is no preparation of any softer material than the
                    stucco itself put under it. In running cornices in this material, workmen are
                    very apt to mix a little plaster of Paris with the stucco to make it set under
                    the mould, and thus give sharpness and fulness to the mouldings; but this should
                    not be permitted; for the plaster is not qualified to stand the weather as the
                    stucco is, and, if mixed with it, will produce premature decay. When the stucco
                    is perfectly dry, it may be painted in oil colours, or be coloured in distemper;
                    and in either case it is generally (though not invariably) ruled over the
                    surface with a lead point, to give it the appearance of gauged stone-work.</p>
                <p>Rendering in the Roman and Portland cements is executed almost exactly in the
                    same manner as stucco rendering is, only that it is laid on the saturated wall
                    directly, without the preliminary operation of roughing in, or washing the
                    surface with a solution of the material. The same process, too, is followed in
                    floating this cement, and with the same exceptions; and as, in addition to its
                    superior hardness and capacity for duration, it is a quicksetting cement, it is
                    far preferable to any of the common stuccoes for running cornices, mouldings,
                    &lt;fcc. These cements may, like stucco, be painted in oil, or coloured; but
                    instead of a size colour, which is used for almost every other purpose in
                    plastering, the colour for this composition is mixed with diluted sulphuric
                    acid. This too may be lined and tinted to imitate stone and stone-work of any
                    description.</p>
                <p>It may not be amiss here to refer to some of the causes of the premature decay
                    which takes place in stuccoes and cements when used externally as a coating to
                    walls. The primary cause is the presence of muddy earth and decayed animal and
                    vegetable matter in the sand used with the lime and cement. To this may be added
                    frequent impurities in the limes and cements themselves, particularly of
                    argillaceous matter in the former, and sometimes the too great proportions of
                    lime or cement to sand. These things might, however, remain quiescent for a long
                    time, if the work were well protected from access of moisture, which is the
                    grand exciting cause. The paint, or distemper wash, on the surface, is generally
                    sufficient to prevent the rain which may beat against a vertical face from
                    penetrating, especially if the work have been well hand-floated and trowelled,
                    to make it close and compact; but the evil arises from exposure above, and from
                    the numberless horizontal unfloated surfaces which are constantly presented.
                    These receive and collect the water, and convey in streams over the vertical
                    surfaces what is not immediately absorbed; and the work thus becoming saturated,
                    frost seizes and bursts it, or warmth calls the vegetative powers of the
                    impurities in it into action, and the whole is covered with a green sward. Let
                    the sand of which a plaster composition is to be formed, whether with lime or
                    cement, be washed until it no longer discolours clean water, and be well
                    compounded with cementitious matter free from impurities with which it is so
                    frequently charged; let the work be well hand-floated and trowelled,
                    particularly on the backs or upper horizontal surfaces of projections, and
                    protected above by projecting eaves or otherwise; and the work, with common care
                    and attention to paint or distemper at intervals, will last as long as anything
                    of the kind can be expected, or is found, to last auywhere.</p>
                <p>A cheap and useful covering for external walls, which are protected by projecting
                    eaves, in plain buildings, is rough cast. This is executed in the following
                    manner :—The surface is first roughed, or indented, and then well brushed with a
                    stiff brush to remove all dust or loose earth. It is then covered with the rough
                    cast, which consists of a small quantity of mortar diluted with water, to which
                    a trowel of pure lime is added to make it about the thickness of cream. After
                    the workman has done all within his reach the scaffolding is lowered, and he
                    proceeds with the remainder. Another process is somewhat dearer. After having
                    been roughed or indented, the wall is sprinkled with water, and then rendered
                    with lime and hair; and when that is set, another coat of the same material is
                    superadded, laid as evenly as it can be without floating, and as soon as a piece
                    of two or three yards in extent is executed, the workman lays on it an almost
                    fluid mixture of clean fine gravel and strong lime, which have been well mixed
                    together. This is immediately washed with any ochreous colour that may be
                    desired, and the whole dries into one compact mass. A third process, called
                    stuccoing, is performed by the workman laying on a few trowels of stucco, which
                    he spreads as much as possible; a second workman provided with a brush and a
                    small wood float follows him, and after sprinkling the mortar with water he rubs
                    over that part he has wetted with the float, and at the same time it may be
                    whitened with lime alone. When the lime is very good this makes very good
                    work.</p>
                <p>In renovating and repairing plastering the whole surface is first well washed to
                    remove the dirt which may have attached itself, and as much of the earthy matter
                    of the previous coat of whitening or colouring as will come away; any injuries
                    the work may have received, such as cracks and fractures, are then repaired; and
                    when the new stuff is quite dry, the joinings are scraped to produce an even
                    surface, and the whole is again whitened or coloured once or twice or offener as
                    may be required, to make it bear out well. Stuccoed walls which have been
                    painted must <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0569-0508"/> be well rubbed with pumice stone, to take off the
                    old paint as much as possible before the new work is proceeded with.</p>
                <p>For a decoration to rooms having plastered walls, instead of papering or flat
                    painting, or for a suitable ornamentation for the interior of churches built at
                    small outlay, the old system of pargetting has been revived. The usual stucco or
                    other plaster finish is, while still wet, stamped over with a pattern made of
                    brass, or for rougher work of wood, to any geometrical or other form in
                    accordance with the style of architecture; this indents the surface. It may be
                    left all of one colour, or the open portions of the device may be filled in with
                    another coloured plaster.</p>
                <p>Another revived method, especially for outside work, now much in use is called
                    sgraffito. It was in vogue with the Italian artists about two centuries since,
                    who executed some very elaborate specimens of ornamentation with it. The process
                    is briefly as follows :—First, mix with the mortar some colouring substance of
                    the tint desired for the pattern of the design; then apply a thin coat of it to
                    the wall. When this coat is nearly dry, apply on it another coat similarly
                    prepared but of the colour intended for the grounding, and then, a mould having
                    been prepared in zinc of the exact outline of the pattern, it is to be applied
                    to the surface, its outer edge marked round, and with a sharp tool as much of
                    the upper coat of plaster is cut away as comes within the pattern, down to the
                    face of the lower coat. By a careful arrangement of pattern, a considerable
                    variety of colouring may be employed; and even three coloured coats can be put
                    on, cutting through sometimes one, sometimes two, as may be desired to represent
                    the design. As the colour is in the material itself, there is no fear of its
                    scaling and so presenting a bad appearance; and it is a comparatively cheap
                    process for the decoration of a new surface which cannot be painted for some
                    time. The process has been adopted in England with coloured cements for outside
                    work.</p>
                <p>Under the plasterer’s trade it may be desirable to mention some of the varieties
                    of artificial marbles, scagliola, and other similar work for the decoration of
                    buildings. Scagliola is a species of plaster or stucco invented about 1600-50 in
                    Italy. The work is lathed and plastered as usual, and then the artist commences,
                    preparing his material, which is composed of the purest gypsum broken into small
                    pieces and calcined, passed through a very fine sieve and mixed up with glue,
                    isinglass, &amp;c. In this solutiou the colours are diffused that are required
                    to be imitated in the marble; or the colours are prepared separately, and
                    afterwards mingled and combined nearly in the same manner that a painter mixes
                    the primitive colours on his palette to compose his different tints. When the
                    gypsum is prepared and mingled, it is laid on the plaster, and then floated with
                    proper moulds of wood, the artists during the floating using the colours
                    necessary for the imitation, by which means they become mingled and incorporated
                    with the surface. The process of polishing follows, first by means of pumice
                    stone, then with tripoli and charcoal and fine and soft linen; after this the
                    surface is rubbed with a piece of felt dipped in a mixture of oil and tripoli,
                    and last of all with pure oil. The imitation may be so good that except by
                    fracture or by sound it cannot be discovered to be a counterfeit.</p>
                <p>Marezzo marble is made of cement mixed with fibre for strength and to resist a
                    blow. Slabs are bedded on plaster of Paris, and with cramps and dowels like
                    marble. Every variety of marble can be imitated in it, and it receives a high
                    and permanent polish. The Marbre Universel Company have put forward a new
                    manufacture of a similar description.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Modelling, Carved Work, and Gilding.</hi></p>
                <p>The modeller copies the drawings of the designs which may have been prepared for
                    the enrichments, in whatever material they ai e to be cast, whether in plaster,
                    in metals, or in composition of any kind, for the plasterer, smith, or
                    decorator. The model is made of soft wood, by the usual chisels and gouges, or
                    in a finely-tempered and plastic clay called modelling clay, or in wax. The
                    modeller works the clay with his fingers, assisted by a few ivory, bone, or
                    steel tools for finishing off neatly and sharply, and for working in parts which
                    he cannot reach with his fingers. The best workman is one who can do most
                    towards producing the required forms with his fingers, unassisted by artificial
                    tools, as a greater degree of ease and freedom almost always results from the
                    use of the hands alone. The model being completed, it is moulded, that is, a
                    mould or moulds are made from it of a preparation of resin or of gelatine,
                    sometimes of plaster of Paris; the moulds, if they have to be formed in
                    portions, are fitted exactly to each other at the edges, and in these moulds
                    casts in plaster of Paris or other material are made to any extent that may be
                    required. For smith’s work the wood model is sent to the founder for casting in
                    metal. For carved work, such as caps of columns, shields, medallions, consoles,
                    &lt;kc., the model may be sent to the mason or stone carver for the completion
                    of the block, which may have been left in a boasted state by the mason when
                    setting it.</p>
                <p>The modeller having some pretensions to be considered an artist rather than a
                    mere artificer, is for the most part paid according to his merits, rather than
                    for so much time, according to the ordinary mode of determining the value of
                    artificers’ works.</p>
                <p>The carver is strictly an independent artist, whose business it is to cut
                    ornaments and enrichments in solid and durable material, such as stone and wood,
                    so that, like the modeller, he must be paid according to the taste and power he
                    may exhibit in his works, rather than as a common artificer. The art of carving
                    has, however, been in a great measure superseded by modelling and casting. In
                    works of a free style, or of a mediaeval character, the carver is often left
                    free to exercise his own taste and fancy or talents in the execution, with or
                    without a sketch by the architect before him. The decorator, in addition to
                    casts in plaster of Paris, now makes use of composition ornaments, which are
                    formed of a mixture of whiting and glue pressed into moulds; or of papier mâché,
                    which is paper pressed into moulds; or of a composition of a thin coat of
                    plaster of Paris poured into the mould, and then covered with coarse canvas, the
                    result being to all appearance a plaster cast, but it is far lighter in
                    weight,—a figure the size of life being readily moved about by one person. It
                    was an old process revived by the late Mr Owen Jones, and well carried out for
                    him by Μ. Desachy, in the elaborate ornamented ceiling at St James’s Hall,
                    Piccadilly.</p>
                <p>Gilding is applied to castings as well as to carvings; but the former being,
                    almost as a matter of course, less sharp and spirited in their flexures and
                    details, as well as less firm in substance than the latter, castings can less
                    bear to be further subdued by the application of foreign matters to their
                    surfaces than carvings may. Gilding is the application of gold leaf to surfaces,
                    which require, however, to be previously prepared for its reception. The work is
                    first primed with a solution of boiled linseed oil and carbonate of lead, and
                    then covered with a fine glutinous composition called gold size, on which, when
                    it is nearly dry, the gold leaf is laid in narrow slips with a fine brush, and
                    pressed down with a piece of cotton wool held in the fingers. As the slips must
                    be made to overlap each other slightly, to insure the complete covering of the
                    whole surface, the loose <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n570/mode/1up"

                    struck off with a large sable or camel-hair brush, fitted for the purpose; and
                    the joints, if the work be dexterously executed, will be invisible. This is
                    called oil gilding, and it is by far the best fitted for the enrichment of
                    surfaces in architecture, because it is durable, and is easily cleaned, and does
                    not destroy or derange the forms under it so much as burnished gilding does. The
                    latter requires the work to be covered with various laminae of gluten, plaster,
                    and bole, which last is mixed with gold size, to secure the ad hesion of the
                    leaf.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Glazing.</hi></p>
                <p>The business of the glazier, the manufacture of whose material has of late years
                    improved and progressed in a very remarkable degree, may be confined to the mere
                    fitting and setting of glass; even the cutting of the plates up into squares
                    being generally an independent art, requiring a degree of tact and judgment not
                    necessarily possessed by the building artificer.</p>
                <p>The glazier is supplied with a diamond or other cutting tool, laths or
                    straight-edges of various lengths, a square, a glazing-knive, a hacking knife, a
                    hammer, a duster, a sash-tool, a two-foot rule, and a machine called a glazier’s
                    horse, which he fixes outside a window sill, and stands on to reach the upper
                    panes for glazing or cleaning purposes, without removing the sash, and so
                    injuring the beads and paint.</p>
                <p>His materials are simply glass, putty, and priming or paint. The glass is
                    supplied by the glass-cutter, of the qualities and sizes required for the
                    particular work to be executed. The putty is made by the glazier himself, or by
                    a labourer, of fine clean powdered chalk or whitening, well mixed and combined
                    with linseed oil, and kneaded to the consistence of dough. No more putty should
                    be made at once than is likely to be worked up in the course of a few days, as,
                    the oil drying out, it becomes hard and partially set, and is therefore less
                    available for its purposes. Priming is a thin solution of white (with a little
                    red) lead, mixed in linseed oil. For ordinary glass, the sashes are sent to the
                    glazier from the joiner, after having been fitted into their places, and only
                    require to be glazed before they are permanently set or hung. Supposing that no
                    preliminary process is required, such as stopping (the result of bad joiners’
                    work) and knotting (and knotty stuff should not be admitted in sashes), the
                    sashes require to be primed. The priming is laid on every part of the sash
                    except the outer edges of the styles and of the bottom and top rails, with the
                    sash tool or painting brush, that is, if the sashes are intended to be painted;
                    for if not, the rebates only 1nu3tbe primed. The object of this is to prepare
                    the material of which the sash is composed for the reception of the putty, which
                    would not otherwise attach itself so firmly as it does after this preparation.
                    The priming being sufficiently dry, the workman cuts the panes of glass down
                    into their places, making every one fall readily into the rebates without
                    binding in any part; indeed the glass should fit so nicely as not to touch the
                    wood with its edges anywhere, and yet hardly allow a fine point to pass between
                    it and the sash-bar or rebate, the object being to encase it completely in
                    putty, and yet that the putty should not be in greater quantity than is
                    absolutely necessary. The glass being fitted or cut down, the workman takes the
                    glazing-knife in his right hand, and a lump of putty in the palm of his left,
                    the sash being laid on its face, that is, with the rebates upward, before him;
                    with the knife he lays a complete bedding of putty on the returning narrow stops
                    of the rebates, all round to every pane. This being done, the panes of glass are
                    put on it as they have been fitted, and every one is carefully rubbed down with
                    the fingers, forcing the putty out below and round the edges of the glass, until
                    they are nearly brought into contact with the wood or other material of the
                    sash. The rebates are then filled in with putty behind, the mass forming exactly
                    a right-angled triangle, its base being the extent of the stop of the rebate,
                    and its perpendicular the depth from the glass to the outer edge of the rebate;
                    and the third side or hypothenuse is neatly smoothed off. The sash being then
                    turned on its edge and held upright by the left hand, the protruded putty of the
                    bedding, or back putty as it is called, is struck off with the knife, and the
                    section of it neatly drawn. The sashes are now deposited on their faces to allow
                    the putty to set, and then they may be hung and painted.</p>
                <p>To very large squares, and to plate glass, needle points, or small nails called
                    sprigs, are used to retain the material securely in its place while the putty is
                    soft and yielding. These have to be carefully inserted, for if they fix the
                    glass it is apt to fly at any sudden vibration. Large squares and plate glass
                    are usually inserted after the sashes are hung, to prevent risks of breakage.
                    Where the bar and frame can be made to allow of it, large squares are secured in
                    their place by wood beads screwed to the rebate in lieu of putty. In this case
                    the edge of the glass is first covered with a piece of flannel, or thin
                    india-rubber, to fill up crevices, and so prevent admission of dust, and stop
                    any current of air.</p>
                <p>Lead-work, as it is termed, is the glazing of frames rather than of sashes with
                    small squares or quarries of glass, which are held together by reticulations of
                    lead; and these are secured to stout metal bars, which are fixed to the window
                    frames. Leaden reticulating bars are grooved on their edges to receive the
                    quarries, and are tied by means of leaden ribands or wires to the saddle bars,
                    which, in their turn, are affixed to the stouter bars before mentioned, if the
                    bay or frame be so large as to require both. This is now extensively carried on
                    in the painted glase window shops, where the glass is cut to patterns, and shows
                    outlines of figures, costumes, &lt;fcc. “Stained glass” is obtained by mixing
                    colours in the pot while in the furnace, hence the term “pot metal” for it. A
                    kind of coloured glass has only a skin of colour on one side of the white
                    material, and hence is termed “flashed glass.”</p>
                <p>Besides all the varieties of clear glass, the glazier has now at his command the
                    many qualities of obscured glass, beyond the ground and painted glass of former
                    days; the lace-pattern glass, executed by laying a pattern on the material
                    which'has been covered with a varnish, placing it in a box filled with a fine
                    powder, which when shaken adheres to the varnished portions, and then putting it
                    in a kiln where it becomes fixed; the patent rough plate for conservatories,
                    workshops, &lt;fcc,, and its fluted varieties; the rough cast plate for
                    workshops and storehouses; the stained ornamented quarry for church windows,
                    &amp;c. Lastly, there is the engraving on glass by aid of the sand blast,—a new
                    and easily managed method, consisting in a jet of air blown violently through a
                    tube, carrying with it particles of fine sand. The action is very rapid, and it
                    reduces the surface in a few minutes to the condition of ground glass. A piece
                    of lace, however, is sufficient to arrest the action of the sand. Reece’s patent
                    embossed and coloured glass is useful for screens and for windows which are not
                    meant to be looked through.</p>
                <p>Coming within the scope of the glazier’s business is the novel pavement light,
                    consisting of a frame of iron cast with small many-sided apertures, into which
                    are placed a series of dome-shaped or prism-shaped blocks of glass, reflecting
                    the light falling upon them. They distribute the light to a greater extent than
                    a piece of rough plate-glass, and like Chappuis’s and other reflectors require
                    to be kept clean. Moore’s window ventilator allows of the <pb break="no"

                <p>The smith is the worker in wrought metals of all kinds required chiefly by the
                    carpenter and joiner, λvho fixes them in the building. Smithery is the art of
                    uniting several lumps of iron into one lump or more, and forging them to any
                    desired shape. The earlier parts are done at the forge and on the anvil with the
                    hammer, and hence is produced “wrought work,” whether for useful or for
                    ornamental purposes. Machinery has been brought extensively to the smith’s
                    assistance, for rolling, drilling, planing, &amp;c. The ornamental portion of
                    his work is wrought iron shaped by hand into devices and patterns according to
                    the various styles of architecture, as in gates, railings, standards, hinge
                    bands, locks, handles, knockers, lanterns, candlesticks, and other lighting
                    contrivances, which are also executed in brass-work and in cast-iron.</p>
                <p>The founder’s work is all cast metal, such as for ornamental gates and railings,
                    rain-water pipes, cistern heads, and other portions, guttering, stable-fittings,
                    coal-plates, &amp;c. These commonly require to be fitted and fixed by the smith.
                    The founder supplies all fire-grates, stoves, and other apparatus for warming
                    and also for ventilation.</p>
                <p>The gasfitter is a smith who supplies and fixes cast-iron pipes for diameters
                    above two inches, and wrought iron for those of smaller bore, where gas is
                    required to be used. A three-quarter inch pipe is considered by some as the
                    least size to be used even for supplying rooms on an upper story; tin or
                    composition metal pipes are fixed for sizes under half an inch, and also
                    flexible tubes. It is recommended that no pipes should be embedded in the
                    plastering, as is usually the case. In Paris the gas pipes must be seen for
                    their whole length, and where passing through a floor or partition they must be
                    let through a larger pipe having both ends open. Lights should not be fixed
                    within 36 inches beneath wood-work. The solar or sun light is one of the modern
                    additions for lighting large halls, as well as for dwellingrooms; the globe
                    lights, and some others of the same kind, all assist also in ventilating the
                    apartments by tubes carrying off the products of combustion, which tubes are
                    ordinarily fixed in the thickness of the floor; and as the air therein is raised
                    to a very high temperature, great precautions are required to prevent danger by
                    fire to the timbers, and also where the tubes pass through the roof. The effect
                    of continued hot air on wood is little understood by the public generally. The
                    star light, an invention of the late Mr Owen Jones, consists of a number of jets
                    placed either horizontally or slightly inclining upwards at the jets; this is
                    productive of a pleasing and brilliant light. There are many varieties of gas
                    burners, such as the one called a fish tail, from which the form of the flame is
                    the worst as regards economical results; the bat’s-wing is better, and the
                    argand is the best. The latter is a metal ring, pierced with numerous small
                    holes, which divide the flame and allow of the proper combustion of the gas.
                    Besides the common metal burners, there are some made with a soapstone or other
                    cap, to prevent corrosion; and one of the better class is Bronner’s patent
                    burner, into which the gas is admitted through a very small opening adapted for
                    supplying only a certain quantity of gas per hour. The usual burners have a
                    large opening up to where the gas is consumed, and hence a waste of it.</p>

                <p>The real object of painting is to protect wood, metals, and stuccoes from the
                    action of the atmosphere, by covering them with a material which is capable of
                    resisting it. A continued succession of moisture and dryness, and of heat and
                    frost, soon effects the decomposition of woods, causes oxidation in most of the
                    metals used for economic purposes, and destroys the generality of stuccoes if
                    their surfaces be exposed nakedly to it. A solution of ceruse or white lead in
                    linseed oil spread over them prevents these injuries in a great measure, and for
                    a considerable period of time; and as the application of such an unction can be
                    repeated without much trouble or expense as often as occasion may require, it
                    may be said to furnish a protection against the contingencies named. In addition
                    to the utility of painting, it is also available as an ornament, by bringing
                    disagreeably or diversely coloured surfaces to a pleasing and uniform tint, or
                    by diversifying a disagreeable monotony of tint, to suit the taste and fancy;
                    and this is done in a great measure by the addition of various pigments to the
                    solution before mentioned.</p>
                <p>The painter works with brushes of various sizes, made of hog’s bristles, or of
                    hair with a mixture of bristles, and pencils made of badger’s hair; these, with
                    the addition of pots to hold his colours, a grinding-stone and grinder or muller
                    for grinding or triturating them, a pallet and a pallet knife, dusting brushes
                    and a scraping knife for cleaning iron-work before repainting, are almost his
                    only implements. In painting the outside of windows he sometimes uses the
                    glazier’s horse. His materials are comparatively few also; but for some purposes
                    these require a great variety of ingredients, the preparation and combination of
                    which, however, now devolves principally on the manufacturer or colourman, and
                    not on the painter himself. The colours are ground with a muller, which is
                    worked on the stone until they become a very fine powder; with some, the more
                    they are ground the better is the colour. The powder is moistened with a little
                    water or oil, as necessary, from time to time. They should all be ground
                    separately; it is not good to produce a tint by mixture until they are well
                    prepared. Only the quantities necessary for the work undertaken should be got
                    ready. Common colours are those which are produced by the addition to white lead
                    (or zinc white) and oil of lamp-black, red lead, or any of the common ochres;
                    blues, greens, rich reds, pinks, and yellows, &amp;c., being more costly, are
                    taken as such. Unflatted white is a common colour; flatted it classes with the
                    rich colours. If the same surface be painted of two different tints, it is said
                    to be in party colours. The substance generally constituting nine-tenths of the
                    body of paint is carbonate of lead, commonly called white lead, the quality of
                    which is therefore of the greatest importance <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n572/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0572-0511"/> to the durability of the work. It is said to
                    improve by being kept for several years before use. Three qualities are
                    manufactured, and there are six or more chief modes of adulteration recorded,
                    which accounts in some measure for the great difference in painters’ prices, and
                    the relative values of their work when done. The other metallic white paint
                    occasionally used, especially in water colour painting, is zinc white. It is
                    well known for its intense whiteness, its resistance to sulphurous and other
                    deteriorating causes, and its harmless qualities to the workman and the inmates
                    of the house under decoration. Zinc white possesses less body than white lead,
                    and great care is requisite that the colour when ground in oil is of sufficient
                    consistence to be laid on a flat surface without showing through; <hi
                    rend="italic">any</hi> oil in excess will form a slight glutinous coating on the
                    surface, retaining every particle of dust brought in contact with it, until it
                    has evaporated. In general this white does not dry so quickly as the other
                    colour, but this defect is remedied by the application of proper drying oils. It
                    is asserted that in consequence of the great durability of the colour, the paint
                    may be washed for a succession of three, four, and even five years; and that
                    after each successive washing the surface will be found as clear and bright as
                    when fresh painted.</p>
                <p>In painting or laying on the colour, the brush must be constantly at right angles
                    to the face of the work, only the ends of the hairs, in fact, touching it, for
                    in this manner the paint is at the same time forced into the pores of the wood
                    and distributed equally over the surface. If the brush be held obliquely to the
                    work, it will leave the paint in thick masses wherever it is first applied after
                    being dipped for a fresh supply into the pot, and the surface will be daubed,
                    but not painted. Painting, when properly executed, will not present a shining,
                    smooth, and glossy appearance, as if it formed a film or skin, but will show a
                    fine and regular grain, as if the surface were natural, or had received a mere
                    stain without destroying the original texture. Imitative grainings, however, and
                    the varnishes which are intended to protect them, and make them bear out,
                    necessarily produce a new and artificial texture; and for this reason some
                    consider them to a greater or less extent disagreeable, however well the
                    imitations may be effected. Carved mouldings and other enrichments have to be
                    picked out with a pencil or small brush, that the quirks, &lt;fcc., be not
                    choked up.</p>
                <p>As it must be presumed that all the wood submitted to the operations of a
                    painter, which has passed through the hands of the joiner, is already well
                    seasoned and properly dry, it is only necessary to say generally, that the work
                    should be free from moisture of any and every kind before paint is applied to
                    it, or it will at the least prove useless, and probably injurious rather than
                    beneficial. This remark applies alike to wood and to plastered work, both
                    internal and external; that is, whether they be subjected to the more violent
                    changes of the weather or not. Dampness or moisture in woods, stopped in or
                    covered up with paint, will, under ordinary circumstances, tend to their
                    destruction; and in stuccoes it will spoil the paint, and most probably injure
                    the plastering itself also. The first thing the workman has to attend to in
                    painting new wood-work is to prepare its surface for the reception of paint, by
                    counteracting the effect of anything that may tend to prevent it from becoming
                    identified with the material. Thus, in painting pine-wpods, the resin in the
                    knots which appear on the surface must be neutralized, or a blemish will appear
                    in the finished work over every resinous part. In best work the knots should be
                    cut out to a slight depth at the bench, and the holes filled up with a stiff
                    putty made of white lead, japan, and turpentine. The next best way is to cover
                    them with gold or silver leaf. The usual method is to cover them with a size
                    knotting, which is a preparation of red lead, white lead, and whitening made
                    into a thin paste with size. The common coating of red ochre is worth nothing.
                    The next process is that of priming, which consists in giving a coat of white
                    lead with red lead and a little drier in linseed oil. This is the first coat,
                    upon which the look of the finished work much depends. Inequalities or
                    unevennesses of surface must be reduced with sand-paper or pumice-stone, or made
                    up with putty. The necessary process for killing knots will generally leave a
                    film, which must be rubbed down; and the heads of nails and brads having been
                    punched in, will present indentations, which should be stopped, as well as any
                    cracks or other imperfections, with putty. A second coat is then given,
                    consisting of white lead and linseed oil. It should have a good body, and be
                    laid even. This coat, when thoroughly dry, is in best work rubbed down with fine
                    sand paper and carefully examined to ascertain if any further stopping be
                    required; and then the third coat or ground colour is applied, of a somewhat
                    darker tint than wanted when finished, having sufficient oil for easy working,
                    but not too fluid,—about two-thirds oil and one-third turpentine are used. The
                    flatting coat follows, the object of which is to do away with the gloss or glaze
                    of the oil, by obtaining a flat appearance. White lead is mixed with turpentine,
                    with sometimes a little copal varnish; the colouring matter is added, but always
                    lighter than the ground colour, or it would when finished appear in a series of
                    shades and stripes. Flatting must be executed quickly, on account of the
                    evaporation of the turpentine, and the brush is generally, if not always,
                    carried up the wall and not across it. Some painters use a large quantity of
                    turpentine in the several coats for quick work, as it dries more rapidly; but
                    for good and lasting work no turpentine should be used. Flatted work is
                    generally done only to best apartments, chief staircases, entrance halls,
                    &amp;c., and omitted in the upper rooms, in bedrooms, and in basements. All new
                    wood-work should be painted a sufficient number of coats to “bear out” as it is
                    called; this is a precaution against each coat being so much diluted with
                    turpentine or other fluid as not to cover sufficiently, which is seen by a
                    deadness in one part and a glaze in another. The priming coat and three others
                    should be sufficient. Sometimes plaster and new wood are first done over with
                    clearcole, which is white lead ground up in water and size added. This prevents
                    absorption of the oil, but the paint added subsequently is apt to blister or to
                    crack off; it therefore should not be allowed.</p>
                <p>Plaster and stucco to be painted requires some care in the workmanship of it, as
                    noticed under “Plaster-work,” <hi rend="italic">sτιpra,</hi> to prevent bubbles,
                    and must be quite dry. Some persons recommend a priming or a second coat of
                    strong double size; the next coat then consists of white lead in oil as stiff as
                    possible, and then another coat of size, and so on; but such work should be
                    repudiated. A good first coat of priming, as much as the stucco will absorb, is
                    essential.</p>
                <p>All new outside work should be primed with red lead or litharge, mixed in linseed
                    oil; the second coat is of the same mixture if four-coat work is to be done, and
                    in this coat all defects are to be made good; the third and fourth coats, as may
                    be determined upon, are generally of the tint required.</p>
                <p>In painting old work, where two coats are generally considered sufficient, the
                    surface must be well washed to get rid of all dirt and grease, and then rubbed
                    down with pumice-stone to remove all inequalities. The work then receives one
                    coat, after which any holes are stopped by the painter with putty; the second
                    and perhaps a third <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n573/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0573-0512"/> coat, or a flatting coat, are then applied.
                    Sometimes each of the earlier coats is rubbed down.</p>
                <p>Old ceilings and soffits of stairs are either washed to clean off the dirt and
                    grease, stopped (which is cutting out the cracks and stopping them with new
                    plaster), and whitened by a coat of whitening or Spanish white mixed with size;
                    or after the two first operations they are finished in distemper, which is white
                    lead and size; it presents a better appearance. Colouring is also done to
                    plastered walls, the white being mixed in half linseed oil and half turpentine,
                    and some earth added to make the tint required. Limewhiting is done by the
                    bricklayer’s labourer. Stucco or plaster-work, which is intended to be painted,
                    but which is not sufficiently dry to receive the oil, may have a coating of
                    water colours, or distemper colour, as it is called, in order to give a more
                    finished appearance to that part of the building. The colour selected should be
                    grouud very fine, and incorporated with the whiting and parchment, or other
                    strong size. Two coats will be required to make it bear out uniformly. When the
                    stucco is sufficiently dry, and it is desired to be painted, the whole of the
                    above colouring has to be washed off, and the painting proceeded with as
                    described for new work.</p>
                <p>Metal-work, not being absorbent, only requires when new to have a priming, and
                    one, two, or three coats of oil paints, as may be considered necessary. It
                    should have a coat as soon after it leaves the founder or smith as possible, to
                    prevent early stages of oxidation. Old w ork should be cleaned, scraped, and
                    filed if necessary, to remove rust, broken paint, and dirt.</p>
                <p>Graining is understood among painters to be the imitating of the several
                    different species of ornamental woods, as satin-wood, rose-wood, king-wood,
                    air-wood, mahogany, wainscot or oak, and others. After the necessary coats of
                    paint have been put on to the wood, a ground is then laid of Naples yellow and
                    ceruse, diluted with turpentine if for satin-wood, which is left to dry. The
                    painter then prepares small quantities of the same yellow and ochre with a
                    little brown, and boiled oil and turpentine, and having mixed this, spreads it
                    over some small part of his work. The flat hog’s hair brushes being dipped in
                    the liquid and drawn down the newly laid colour, the shades and grainings are
                    produced. To obtain the mottled appearance, the camel’s hair pencils are
                    applied, and when completed the work is left to dry, and afterwards covered by a
                    coat or two of good copal varnish. Imitation wainscot requires the use of combs
                    of various degrees of fineness to obtain the grain (whence the process is called
                    <hi rend="italic">combing</hi> by some persons), and the flower is got by wiping
                    off the colour with a piece of rag. When dry it is over-grained to obtain a more
                    complete representation of the natural wood, and then varnished. If the work be
                    done in water colour and not in oil, beer grounds to act as a drier are mixed
                    with the colour; this sets it ready for varnishing. A “patent graining-machine,”
                    a sort of roller with a pattern upon it, has lately been introduced. The writer
                    of this article suggested some years ago that deal well sized to prevent
                    absorption might be at once grained either wainscot or pollard oak, without the
                    preliminary operation, delay, and smell of painting. When dry it is to be
                    varnished as usual. The effect is somewhat better than that obtained by the
                    usual method of graining.</p>
                <p>Marbling is the imitation of real marbles, granites, &amp;c., some of which are
                    represented by splashing on the carefully prepared ground, which should have
                    been painted and often rubbed and polished to obtain an even surface; others
                    have to be painted in colours, and then well varnished. The most expert at this
                    sort of imitation do their work so as to prevent its easy detection except by
                    the touch.</p>
                <p>Ornamental painting embraces the execution of friezes and the decorative parts of
                    architecture on walls and ceilings in chiaroscuro (or light and shade) or
                    monochrome colouring. The ground is well prepared, and of the tint of the
                    proposed work; the ornament and figures are drawn upon it, and are then painted
                    and shaded to give them their due effect. This kind of work is sometimes painted
                    on cloth and then fastened up. When the ornamental work is of a similar pattern
                    throughout, as mouldings, fretwork, a running ornament, &lt;fcc., it is effected
                    by stencilling. This method consists in drawing a certain length of the pattern
                    on paper, which is pricked through with a large sized needle, then laid on the
                    wall to be ornamented, and struck with a small linen bag containing powdered
                    chalk; the chalk enters the apertures, and fixes itself against the paint. The
                    painter then draws it, or fills in the pattern with colours. Another method is
                    to cut out the pattern where possible, and the paper, being stiffened with size,
                    is laid on the surface, and a brush filled with the colour passed over it; the
                    paper is carefully removed and laid on a fresh place, and so on. The pattern may
                    then be touched up when dry with another tint, or with gold, or another pattern
                    with minuter detail laid on it, and the operation repeated. A wall surface may
                    be covered with such an ornamentation, of which paper hangings are a cheap
                    substitute.</p>
                <p>Many of these methods of decoration having been styled shams, the promoters of
                    real woods advocated the disuse of paints, &lt;fcc. This has led to the
                    increased use of deals and pines for inside doors, wainscots, linings, shutters,
                    and the like, which, if not left as completed by the tradesmen, are sized and
                    varnished or polished. But in such a case a good selection of the wood is
                    necessary, and it has to be picked. Another method is to stain the timber, as of
                    roofs, galleries, and the like, or the joiners’ work, so that it represents
                    various tints of oak, and this is protected by a coat or two of varnish. These
                    systems are open to the objection that the varnish, especially in towns, darkens
                    rapidly, and every coat of it adds to the defect, so that in a few years paint
                    is required to give the work the cleau and lively appearance the wood originally
                    possessed. Real wainscot, mahogany, and other woods are usually polished; the
                    first is sometimes varnished after being properly prepared to prevent the rise
                    of the grain which occurs when it is touched by a liquid.</p>
                <p>Varnishing having been frequently referred to, we must notice that there are many
                    varieties useful for various purposes. Like white lead, oil, and turpentine,
                    they are subject to much adulteration, whereby the work is deprived of its
                    proper consistency, and the painter and his employer dissatisfied with the
                    result. There are drying varnishes made with spirit of wine; these are applied
                    to some furniture, mouldings, &amp;c. Varnishes made with essential oils,
                    especially those made with oil of turpentine or ether and pure copal, are very
                    solid, and better than those made with fat drying oils, which, from their colour
                    being dark, are used only with grounds of a dark colour. Varnish can sometimes
                    be tinted to correct defects of colour in graining, &amp;c. For wood-work copal
                    varnish in oil should alone be used.</p>
                <p>It is not within our province to enter upon the higher class of painting on
                    walls, which comes under the trade of the decorator, including that of the
                    gilder and the artistic draughtsman and colourist, nor upon the higher class of
                    paper-hangings. Decorations must necessarily depend upon the taste and skill
                    required or employed in producing them. Paper-hangings are paid for by the piece
                    or yard, a piece being made in England twelve yards long and twenty inches wide,
                    and the hanging is charged at so much the piece. A dozen of borders is twelve
                    yards long; they are charged by the yard for the material, and by the dozen for
                    hanging. Sizing and otherwise preparing the <pb break="no"

                    and washing old papers from off the walls should always be insisted upon by the
                    owner of a house, as accumulations of paste, colours, and size are apt to breed
                    vermin, and, as some think, to give rise to fevers. French paper-hangings are
                    only eighteen inches wide and nine yards long. Wood-linings, old panelled
                    wainscoting, and other irregular surfaces, require to be canvased and papered
                    before the decorative paper is hung, otherwise it is liable to crack with the
                    shrinking of the wood.</p>
