                    languages. When only four years old he was sent to school, at which age he is
                    said to have been able to read Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, in which he had been
                    instructed by his father. At the age of twelve he entered the university, where
                    he speedily distinguished himself above not only his equals, but his seniors in
                    years, to so great a degree that when only sixteen he received the diploma of
                    master of arts from the hands of his own father. From this time he devoted
                    himself to the study of theology, turning his attention especially to the Hebrew
                    language and its cognate dialects, and then proceeding to the study of
                    rabbinical Hebrew, in which he soon attained such proficiency, that he is said,
                    while still a young man, to have read through not only the Mishna, but also the
                    Jerusalem and Babylonian Gemaras, or commentaries upon the text of the Talmud.
                    In conformity with the excellent custom, so long prevalent on the Continent, of
                    visiting several universities before finally settling down to life-long
                    professional work, Buxtorf proceeded to Heidelberg in 1617, where he listened to
                    the prelections of the theologians Pareus, Scultetus, and the elder Alting. In
                    1619 he repaired to Dort, while the famous Synod was still sitting, and there
                    made the acquaintance of many of the divines who took part in its proceedings.
                    At the close of the Synod he made a short journey in company with the deputies
                    from Basel, through the Netherlands and England, and thence through France back
                    to Basel. On his return he found that his father’s great Rabbinical Bible was in
                    course of publication, and as there was no lexicon suitable for the study of the
                    Chaldee Targums, comprised in the work, he undertook the compilation of such a
                    lexicon, which appeared at Basel in 1622 under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lexicon</hi><hi rend="italic">Chaldaicum, et Syriacum,</hi> with a
                    recommendatory preface from his father, detailing the circumstances under which
                    the work had been executed. Still thirsting for knowledge, he repaired in 1623
                    to Geneva, to enjoy the instructions of the elder Turretin, Diodati, and
                    Tronchin; while in return Turretin and Dav. Clericus did not disdain to avail
                    themselves as pupils of his pre-eminent knowledge of Hebrew and of the
                    rabbinical dialect. So great by this time had become his reputation as a
                    scholar, that he was offered by the authorities of the city of Bern the chair of
                    logic at Lausanne, which he declined, preferring to return to Basel, where in
                    1624, he was appointed general deacon to the church of Basel <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Communis</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesioe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Basileensis</hi><hi rend="italic">Diaconus'),</hi> and three years later deacon
                    of St Peter’s church. On the death of his father in 1629, Buxtorf was
                    unanimously designated as the fittest person to succeed so distinguished a
                    Hebraist; and by the advice of his physicians, who were of opinion that the
                    labours involved in the discharge of the duties of a public preacher would be
                    injurious to one whose constitution was feeble, he finally accepted the office.
                    From this date until his death he remained at Basel, declining two offers which
                    were made to him from Groningen and Leyden, to accept the Hebrew chair in these
                    two celebrated schools. To mark their appreciation of his patriotic conduct, the
                    governing body of the university founded in 1647, specially for his behoof, a
                    third theological professorship, that of “Commonplaces and Controversies,” the
                    duties of which Buxtorf discharged for seven years along with those of the
                    Hebrew chair. When, however, the professorship of the Old Testament became
                    vacant in 1654 by the death of Theodore Zuinger, Buxtorf resigned the chair of
                    theology, and accepted that of the Old Testament instead, holding both offices,
                    and for some time that also of chief librarian to the university, until his
                    death in 1664. The course of his private life was chequered by many domestic
                    bereavements. He was four times married <pb break="no"

                    marriage, and the fourth predeceasing her husband by seven years. His children
                    also all died young, with the exception of two boys, the younger of whom, John
                    James, became first his father’s colleague, and shortly after his successor in
                    the chair of Hebrew.</p>
                <p>A considerable portion of his public life was spent in controversy regarding
                    disputed points in Biblical criticism, in reference to which he had to defend
                    the views advanced by his father. The attitude of the Reformed churches at that
                    time, as opposed to the Church of Rome, led them to take up and maintain many
                    opinions in regard to Biblical questions, which were not only erroneous in point
                    of fact, but which were altogether unnecessary for the stability of their
                    position. Having renounced the dogma of an infallible church, it was deemed
                    necessary to maintain as a counterpoise, not only that of an infallible Bible,
                    but, as the necessary foundation of this, of a Bible which had been handed down
                    from the earliest ages to the present time without the slightest alteration or
                    change in its text. The letters in which the Old Testament was written, were, it
                    was asserted, the same as those in which the two tables of the law had been
                    written; the vowel points and accents which accompanied them had been given by
                    divine inspiration; and the words themselves had not undergone the slightest
                    change from the time they had ilowed from the pens of the respective writers.
                    The Masoretic text of the Old Testament, therefore, as compared either with that
                    of the recently discovered Samaritan Pentateuch, or of the Septuagint, or of the
                    Vulgate, was alone the “Hebrew Verity,” wherein the true words of the sacred
                    writers were to be found. Although many of the Reformers, as well as learned
                    Jews, had long seen that these assertions could not be made good, there had been
                    as yet no formal controversy upon the subject. It was reserved for a learned and
                    acute Frenchman, Ludovicus Cappellus the younger, professor of Hebrew at Saumur,
                    to enter the field, and by a series of controversial writings effectually to
                    dispel the illusions which had long prevailed in many minds As early as 1622 or
                    1623, Cappellus had submitted in manuscript to the elder Buxtorf a work on the
                    modem origin of the vowel points and accents, which he had been led to undertake
                    in consequence of the statements made by the Swiss professor in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Tiberias,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Commentary on the Masora,</hi>
                    in which he had controverted the views of Elias Levita on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >late</hi> origin of the points. Buxtorf saw the force of the arguments employed
                    by Cappellus, but counselled him not to publish his work, pointing out the
                    injury which it would do to the Protestant cause, and the advantage which it
                    would afford to Romish controversialists on the question of the infallible
                    accuracy of the text of Scripture. Cappellus, however, was not to be deterred by
                    fear of consequences. He sent his MS. to Thomas Erpenius of Leyden, the most
                    learned Orientalist of his day, by whom it was published in 1624, under the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Arcanum Punctationis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >revelatum,</hi> with a laudatory preface, but without the author’s name In this
                    work Cappellus adduced those arguments and considerations which have satisfied
                    most scholars since his day that the vowels and accents are the invention of the
                    Masoretes, and that they are not older than the fifth century of the Christian
                    era. It is worth noting that although the elder Buxtorf lived five years after
                    the publication of the work, he made no public reply to it, and it was not until
                    1648, nearly a quarter of a century afterwards, that Buxtorf, junior, published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Tractatus</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >punctorum origine, antiquitate,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >authσritate,</hi><hi rend="italic">oppositus Arcano punctationis revelato
                    Ludovici Cappelli.</hi> In this treatise he endeavoured to prove by copious
                    citations from the rabbinical writers, and by arguments of various kinds, that
                    the points, if not so ancient as the time of Moses, were at least as old as that
                    of Ezra, and thus possessed the authority of divine inspiration. In the course
                    of the λvork he allowed himself frequently to employ contemptuous epithets
                    towards Cappellus, such as “innovator,” “prophet,” “revealer,” “a seer of
                    visions,” “dreams,” &amp;c. Cappellus was not the man to remain silent in such
                    circumstances. He speedily prepared a second edition of his work, in which,
                    besides replying to the arguments of his opponent, and fortifying his position
                    with new ones, he retorted his contumelious epithets with interest. Owing to
                    various causes, however, among which may be mentioned the distrust with which
                    Cappellus was coming to be regarded on account of his critical opinions among
                    Protestants themselves, this second edition did not see the light until thirty
                    years after his death; when it was published at Amsterdam in 1685, in the
                    edition of his collected works. Besides this controversy, Buxtorf engaged in
                    three others with the same antagonist, on the subject of the integrity of the
                    Masoretic text of the Old Testament, on the antiquity of the present Hebrew
                    characters, and on the Lord’s Supper. Into the details of these, however, our
                    space does not allow us to enter. In the two former Buxtorf supported the
                    untenable position that the text of the Old Testament had been transmitted to us
                    without any errors or alteration, and that the present square or so-called
                    Chaldee characters were coeval with the original composition of the various
                    books. These views were triumphantly refuted by his great oppo nent in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Critica</hi><hi rend="italic">Sacra,</hi> and in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Diatriba</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">veris et
                    antiquis</hi><hi rend="italic">Ebraicorum literis.</hi> Besides the works which
                    have been already mentioned in the course of this article, Buxtorf edited the
                    great <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi><hi rend="italic">Chaldaicum,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Talmudicrum,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rabbinicum,</hi> on which his father had spent the labour of twenty years, and
                    to the completion of which he himself gave ten years of additional study, and
                    the great Hebrew <hi rend="italic">Concordance,</hi> which his father had little
                    more than begun. In addition to these, he published new editions of many of his
                    father’s works, as well as others of his own, complete fists of which may be
                    seen in the <hi rend="italic">Athence</hi><hi rend="italic">Rauricoe,</hi> and
                    other works enumerated at the close of the preceding article. (F. C.)</p>
