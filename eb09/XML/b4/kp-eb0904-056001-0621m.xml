                    Burman empire, is situated between 10° and 22° N. lat., aud 92° and 100° E.
                    long. It is bounded on the N. by Independent Burmah, on the E. by Siam, on the
                    S. by the Indian Ocean, and on the W. by the Bay of Bengal and the Chittagong
                    division of Bengal. The province of British Burmah extends along the eastern
                    shore of the Bay of Bengal, and is geographically divided into four portions,—
                    Arakân, extending from the Nâf estuary to Cape Negrais, and consisting of a
                    narrow strip of country between the sea and the high mountain chain called Yoma;
                    the valley of the Irawadi, which, divided from the Sittang valley by the Pegu
                    Yoma range, unites with it in its southern portion; the valley of the Sal win;
                    and Tenasserim, a narrow strip, separated from Siam by a lofty chain of hills
                    running from north to south. For administrative purposes the country is divided
                    into three commissionerships, Arâkân, Pegu, and Tenasserim, and into fifteen
                    districts, viz., Akyab, Ramree, Sandoway, Northern Arâkân, Rangoon, Bassein,
                    Myanoung, Prome, Thayet-myo, Toungoo, Shwegyen, Amherst, Tavoy, Mergui, and Sal
                    win.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Aspects.—</hi> The greater part of the province is
                    covered with hills, forests, estuaries, and river beds. The eastern and southern
                    part is particularly mountainous, thinly populated, and much intersected by
                    streams. In the central part of the province the valley of the Irawadi unites
                    with the valley of the Sittang at its lower end, and forms an extensive plain,
                    stretching from Cape Negrais on the west to Martaban on the east. The more
                    northern of these valleys are rugged and hilly, and are so densely covered with
                    jungle that but little cultivation can be carried on. A chain of mountains
                    called the Yoma range forms the boundary of the Arakân division on the east. It
                    is the continuation of the Pâtkoi and Barâil range, which shoots forth from the
                    Himâlayas at their north-eastern extremity, runs south, forms the eastern
                    boundary of Assam and Bengal, and turning south-east, gradually diminishes both
                    in breadth and elevation till it ends in the rocky promontory of Cape Negrais.
                    Blue Mountain, one of its peaks, on the northern boundary of the province, is
                    said to rise 8000 feet above the sea-level; but within the province the range
                    nowhere attains a height much above 4000 feet. The same Yoma range forms the
                    western boundary of the Irawadi valley; and the Poung Loung range, rising to a
                    supposed height of 7000 feet, bounds the Sittang valley towards the east The
                    Pegu Yoma range forms the watershed between these two streams. The mountains of
                    Tenasserim rise to a height of 5000 feet, with a breadth varying from 10 to 40
                    miles; they are covered with pathless jungle, and devoid of human habitations of
                    any kind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hivers.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Beginning from the extreme
                    west the following are the principal rivers :—The Nâf estuary is on the western
                    boundary. The Mroo River, an arm of the sea, about 40 miles to the eastward, is
                    from 3 to 4 miles broad at its mouth, The Koladan or Arakân River rises near the
                    Blue Mountain in about 23° N. lat., and is navigable for 40 miles from its mouth
                    by vessels of 300 or 400 tons burden. The Talak, Aeng, Sandoway, Toungoop, and
                    Gwa are streams of minor importance. The mouth of the last, however, forms a
                    good port and haven for steamers or vessels of from 9 to 10 feet draught. The
                    Irawadi rises in about 28° N. lat. and 97° 30' E. long., and flows for upwards
                    of 600 miles before reaching the British possessions, through which it has a
                    course of 240 miles to the sea in a S.S.W. direction. As it approaches the coast
                    it divides into numerous branches, converting the lower portion of the valley
                    into a net-work of tidal creeks. Its principal branches are the Bassein River,
                    Thekkay-thoung, Yuay, Dayaybhyoo, Pycnmaloo, Pyengazaloo, Dalia, Phyapoon,
                    Donyan, Thanateat, and China Buckir rivers. It is navigable for river steamers
                    as far as Bhamo, nearly 400 miles beyond the British frontier. The river when
                    full runs about five miles an hour. The Hieing rises close to Prome, where it is
                    called the Myitmakat stream, and flowing in a southerly direction nearly
                    parallel to the Irawadi, it next takes the name of the Hieing, and finally of
                    the Rangoon River, and falls into the sea a few miles below Rangoon. Its
                    principal tributaries arc the Nyoungdon, an offshoot of the Irawadi, and the
                    Pegu and Poozoondoung rivers. It is navigable by vessels of the largest size for
                    some distance above Rangoon, but owing to the Hastings shoal, formed at the
                    junction of the Pegu, the Poozoondoung, and the Rangoon rivers, vessels of more
                    than 6 feet draught cannot ascend beyond the shoal at low tide. The Sittang
                    River rises far north of British territory, which it enters just about Toungoo,
                    and flowing southwards, falls into the Gulf of Martaban, when it widens so
                    rapidly that it is impossible to tell where the river ends and the gulf begins.
                    Its principal tributary is the Shwegyen River. A bore, or tidal wave, sweeps up
                    this river, and its effect is felt as far as Shwegyen town. The Riling River
                    rises in the Poungloung hills, flows southward, and falls into the Gulf of
                    Martaban. The Salwin River rises in Tibet, flows south through the Shan states,
                    and falls into the sea at Moulmein. The Attaran rises in the chain of hills
                    which forms the boundary between the kingdom of Siam and British Burmah, and
                    flows in a south-westerly direction through dense teak forests and an almost
                    uninhabited country. The Gyne has numerous villages on its banks, and is
                    navigable for 180 miles by country boats. The Tenasserim River falls into the
                    sea by two mouths, the northern of which is navigable for large ships.</p>
                <p>There is only one canal in the province, connecting the Pegu and the Sittang
                    rivers. The lakes are the Thoo, Lahgyin, and Kandaugyee.</p>
                <p>A large part of the province is covered with forests, but the state reserved area
                    only amounts to 133 square miles. The teak plantations lie in the Rangoon
                    division. The total receipts from the forests in 1871-72 amounted to
                    £77,240.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The total area of the province is 88,556
                    square miles; the population was returned by the census of 1872 at 2,747,148,
                    giving an average of 31 inhabitants to the square mile. The Buddhists numbered
                    2,447,831, Mahometans 99,846, Hindus 36,658, Christians 52,299, and aborigines
                    110,514. The villages, townships, &lt;fcc., numbered 14,107; the inhabited
                    houses, 535,533. Only ten towns in the province had a population exceeding
                    10,000,—Rangoon, the capital, containing 98,745.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Productions. —</hi> Rice is the staple product of the province,
                    and in 1871—72 1,836,021 acres were devoted to its cultivation. Other food
                    grains covered 4860 acres; sesamum, 25,502 acres; sugar-cane, chiefly cultivated
                    in the gardens around the cultivators’ houses, 3179 acres; and cotton,
                    principally grown in the hill clearings, 14,120 acres. The fibre of the
                    indigenous cotton is short but strong, and it adheres with great tenacity to the
                    seed. The export of cotton is increasing. Tobacco, grown on sandbanks or in the
                    dry beds of streams, inferior in quality, and wholly used for home consumption,
                    occupied 12,866 acres. The other crops produced in the province are indigo,
                    vegetables, hemp, mixed fruits, &amp;c. The system of cultivation known in
                    Bengal as the <hi rend="italic">jüm,</hi> that is clearing virgin soil by
                    burning, cultivating it for one or two years, and then leaving it again to the
                    jungle, is here extensively practised under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >toungya</hi> cultivation. Although discouraged on account of its wasteful
                    character it cannot be altogether prohibited, as it is the only means of
                    subsistence for a large part of the population. Seven great embankments have
                    been constructed in the province for the protection and extension <pb break="no"

                    of rice land varies from Is. to 10s., while the high land, on which other grains
                    can be cultivated, fetches generally from 3s. to 4s. per acre Of the total area
                    of the province (88,556 square miles) only 3414 square miles are cultivated;
                    51,117 square miles are cultivable, and the rest uncultivable waste <hi

                    Steamers ply on the Irawadi between Thayetmyo, Prome, Myanoung, Henzada, and
                    Rangoon. There is also steam communication from Calcutta, <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> Akyab, to Rangoon and Moulmein, and between Tavoy and Mergui. There
                    were, however, 814 miles of road in the province in 1871-72.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mines —</hi> The only mines in the province are those worked
                    for tin in the southern portion of the Tenasserim division. This mineral (a
                    binoxide) exists over a large extent of country in the Mergui and Tavoy
                    districts, and is obtained by removing and washing the pebble and boulder
                    deposits of the river beds. Samples of the tin-stone, once washed, have produced
                    about 70 per cent, of metal, and twice washed 75 per cent. The ore is therefore
                    very rich, and the metal produced is of excellent quality. Hitherto these
                    deposits have been washed by Chinese and natives of the country in a very rough
                    and unscientific manner, and the tinstone is smelted in a most primitive way,
                    the produce realized being 68 per cent, of metal. European capitalists have now
                    begun to turn their attention to the subject, and arrangements are being made to
                    lease out certain tracts. Coal exists on the banks of the Tenasserim River, and
                    in other parts of the province, but it has never been worked to any extent. Lead
                    has been found in Toungoo, and on Maingay’s Island in the Mergui Archipelago,
                    but nothing has been done towards utilizing it. This mineral also exists in the
                    Shwegyen district, as well as gold, antimony ore, and iron-stone. The quantity
                    of the precious metals is, however, very small, and the workers make but a poor
                    living Limestone exists in several parts of the province, and quarries are
                    worked pretty extensively in Thayetmyo and Bassein; stone might also be
                    excavated in Sandoway if a demand existed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Mills are employed in the seaport towns for
                    husking rice and for sawing timber. There were in 1871-72 twenty-six steam rice
                    mills in the province; five years before there were only three; and the number
                    rapidly increases with the demand for rice for shipment to Europe, to the
                    Straits, and to China. Silk and cotton goods are manufactured in large
                    quantities, chiefly, however, for home use, and by small haud-looms. A loom
                    forms a regular piece of furniture in a Burmese household; it is worked by the
                    female members of the family. The cotton cloths thus manufactured are rough but
                    strong; some of the silk goods fetch a high price. A coarse description of salt
                    is made on the sea-coast, used chiefly in the preparation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ngapee</hi> (a mess of half-salted, half-decomposed fish and other
                    ingredients), which forms a favourite article of food among the Burmese. The
                    manufacture of salt has lately fallen off, owing to the introduction of
                    Liverpool salt, which undersells the local article. The other manufactures of
                    the province consist of gold and silver bowls (of peculiar and elaborate
                    workmanship), lacquered ware, carved and gilt work, and dyes, especially cutch,

                    >Trade.—</hi> The total value of the trade of the province in 1871-72 was
                    £10,777,705; exports, £5,452,148; imports, £5,325,557. The value of the
                    sea-borne trade wa3—exports, £4,236,997; imports,£4,220,723—total,£8,457,721;
                    and of the inland trade—exports, £1,245,150; imports, £1,104,832. The most
                    important article of sea-borne exports is rice. The trade increased from 380,009
                    tons in 1865 to 470,893 tons in 1871, and made a sudden rise to 700,784 tons in
                    1872. Next in importance is the timber trade, shipments of which during the year
                    1872 amounted to 87,545 tons, of the value of £51,210. The other articles of
                    export are cotton, cutch, hides, horns, ivory, jade stone, petroleum, rice and
                    paddy, precious stones, stick-lac, tobacco, &amp;c. The articles of import
                    consist of betel-nut, cotton twist and yarn, crockery ware, cutlery, gunny bags,
                    hardware; cotton, silk, and woollen piece goods; raw silk, spirituous liquors
                    wines, beers, &amp;c., sugar and tobacco.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Finances.—</hi> The gross revenue from all sources in 1871-72,
                    £1,363,452, of which £1,217,053 was from imperial taxation, £37,320 for
                    provincial services, and £109,079 from local funds. The land revenue of the
                    province was £344,523. Owing to the sparse population and vast extent of country
                    cultivable but uncultivated, the rates of assessment range low. No class of
                    landed proprietors, like the zamindars of Bengal, exists in Burmah. The
                    cultivators themselves hold the land from Government, the extent of their
                    holdings averaging about 5 acres, The exceptions are, where grants of waste land
                    have been made to Europeans or natives of India, but such grants are but little
                    cultivated. The light land tax of the province is supplemented by a capitation
                    tax, peculiar to Burmah; and by the rice duty, which, from the circumstances of
                    the local trade, falls on the producer, and is equivalent to a tax of 14 per
                    cent, <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> on this article of export. The
                    capitation tax is a poll-tax on the male population of the province, from 18 to
                    60 years of age, with the exception of immigrants during the first five years of
                    their residence, religious teachers, schoolmasters, Government servants, and
                    those unable to obtain their own livelihood. In 1871-72 it was levied on 556,035
                    persons, and yielded a revenue of £226,954. The expenditure on the civil
                    administration of the province in 1871-72 was £497,002. For the protection of
                    British Burmah 5016 fighting men, Europeans and natives, were maintained in 1871
                    at a total cost of £276,200. The strength of the police in 1871 was 5319. The
                    prisons consist of two great central gaols, Rangoon and Moulmein, chiefly for
                    long-term convicts, with twelve subordinate gaols and lock-ups.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education</hi> has not made much progress in British Burmah
                    under the English plan of public instruction; but the people have a wide spread
                    system of primary education of their own in the monastic schools. Setting aside
                    these monastic schools, the educational machinery of the province consists of
                    seven Government schools, educating 505 boys; fifteen aided missionary schools,
                    teaching 1494 pupils; and twenty-two other unaided schools under Government
                    inspection, teaching 499 pupils.</p>
                <p>Christianity has spread largely among the Karen tribes, chiefly through the work
                    of American missions.</p>

                    depressing for part of the year, but cooler than that of India. Some of the
                    forest tracts during the monsoons, and after the cold weather has set in, are
                    impregnated with deadly malaria; but the coast and the frontier ranges are not
                    unhealthy. The prevalent complaints amongst Europeans are fever, dysentery, and
                    hepatic diseases, from which the natives also suffer. On the whole, however, the
                    climate of British Burmah seems better adapted to the European constitution than
                    any part of India, and of late the statistics of the British troops show a very
                    low rate of disease and mortality. The rainfall varied in 1871 from 245*85
                    inches at Moulmein to 54*85 inches at Thayetmyo. The average temperature is
                    greatly affected by the sea breeze,—being 80° Fahr, at the sea-coast, and 90° in
                    the interior.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Form of Government.—</hi> The highest authority in the province
                    of British Burmah is the chief commissioner and agent to the Governor-General of
                    India, established under a resolution of the Government of India, dated January
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n623/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0623-0562"/> 1862. The chief commissioner is assisted by a
                    secretary and assistant-secretary, three commissioners of revenue and circuit,
                    thirteen deputy-commissioners, one superintendent of hill-tracts, twenty-two
                    assistant-commissioners, four collectors of sea-customs, a director of public
                    instruction, an inspector-general of police, an inspector-general of prisons,
                    and a conservator of forests. A political agent is established at the court of
                    Mandalay, and an assistant political agent at Bhamo, for facilitating British
                    trade with Independent Burmahand China. The judicial officers are—the recorder
                    of Rangoon, the judicial commissioner, the judge of the town of Moulmein, the
                    judge of the Small Cause Court, Rangoon, and three town magistrates. For
