                    energy may be expended in overcoming friction. It is used for several entirely
                    different purposes, the principal of these being (a) to limit or decrease the
                    velocity of, or in some cases to bring completely to rest, the body or system
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n253/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0253-0212"/> of bodies imparting tllê eiiêfgy; (i) to measure
                    directly the amount of frictional resistance between two bodies; or (c) to
                    measure, indirectly, the amount of energy given out by the body or system of
                    bodies producing it.</p>
                <p>The first case is the familiar one occurring in tho brakes of locomotives,
                    railway carriages, and wheeled vehicles generally, and in those applied to such
                    machines as cranes, winches, &amp;c. Here some system of bodies,—or for
                    simplicity’s sake we may say some body,—originally at rest has been set in
                    motion, and has received acceleration up to a certain velocity, the work which
                    has been done in that acceleration being stored up as “actual energy” in the
                    body itself. Before it can be brought to rest it must part with this energy,
                    expending it in overcoming some external resistance. Very frequently the actual
                    energy is very large in proportion to the usual resistance opposing the motion
                    of the body, so that that motion would continue for a long time, or through a
                    great distance, before the whole energy had been expended and the body brought
                    to rest. For the sake of convenience, and in certain cases for the sake of
                    safety, it is often necessary that this time or distance should be greatly
                    shortened. This may be done by artificially increasing the resistance for the
                    time being, and the most convenient method of doing this is the use of a
                    brake.</p>
                <p>The construction of railway brakes falls to be treated in detail in the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Railways.</hi> In other vehicles the brake belongs
                    generally to one of two classes—it is either a block which can be pressed
                    against a wheel by a suitable arrangement of levers under the control of the
                    driver, or a slipper or “skid” which can be placed under a wheel, and which is
                    attached by a chain or otherwise to the body of the vehicle. The increased
                    resistance is due in the one case to the friction between the block and the
                    wheel, and in the other to that between the skid and the road.</p>
                <p>In the case of hoisting-machines the brake is used very frequently as a means of
                    controlling the velocity of the descent of the load. In the process of “lowering
                    by a brake,” its frictional resistance is alone opposed to the load, and
                    suitable mechanical means are provided for varying that resistance so that the
                    velocity of the descending weight may be kept within the desired limits. The
                    brake used in these machines very frequently consists of a cylindrical pulley or
                    narrow drum encircled by a flexible belt of iron or steel. One end of this belt
                    is fastened to the framing, and it is so formed that in ordinary work the drum
                    revolves in it without touching it. When necessary, however, the position of the
                    movable end can be so altered as to bring a larger or smaller area into contact,
                    the surfaces being held together with a pressure which can be varied to suit the
                    requirements of each case. This is effected either by a simple lever (in small
                    machines worked by the foot), or for heavier work by the aid of a screw and
                    hand-wheel.</p>
                <p>In what are known as “differential” brakes the brakeband is not fixed to the
                    frame of the machine, but both its ends are attached to points in a movable
                    lever in such a way that motion of the lever affects them unequally, tightening
                    one more than it loosens the other, or loosening one more than it tightens the
                    other. The principle of such an arrangement is shown in fig. 1. Here A is the
                    pulley, B the brakeband, and C the working lever; B being attached to the latter
                    at points <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> unequally
                    distant from the fulcrum D. It is obvious that for any motion of C the angular
                    motions of the arms Dα and D&amp; are equal, but the instantaneous linear
                    motions of the points <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in
                    the directions of the band are unequal, varying directly as Dα, D6, the ratio of
                    the normals from D upon those directions. Thus any motion of C to the right
                    tends to tighten the lower part of the belt and to slacken the upper part, but
                    the slackening takes place through a larger distance than the tightening, and
                    the belt is therefore released from the drum. By moving the lever to the left,
                    on the other hand, the opposite action occurs, and the belt is correspondingly
                    tightened.</p>
                <p>Instead of using the friction between two solid bodies, in some special cases the
                    frictional resistance of a fluid is employed, as in what Professor Rankine
                    called fan brakes and pump brakes. In the one case the motion of revolving
                    blades (commonly) is opposed by the resistance of the atmospheric or liquid
                    medium surrounding them, and in the other the motion of a liquid is opposed by
                    the resistance due to a narrow passage or orifice.</p>
                <p>The measurement of the frictional resistance between two bodies of known material
                    or form is often of great importance, and it is still more often of importance
                    to measure, by means of the frictional resistance which it can balance, the
                    amount of energy given out by some engine or machine. Both these measurements
                    can be and are frequently made by means of brakes. For this purpose the
                    apparatus must be so made that the actual resistance can be accurately
                    measured,—that this resistance can be kept sensibly constant for any length of
                    time, but can be altered at will,—and also that the brake can be kept
                    continuously at work for any desired period. The brake used for this; purpose
                    commonly takes the form of a revolving drum of iron, encircled by a ring of hard
                    wood blocks connected together by thin iron bands. To this ring is attached a
                    weight of known magnitude, at a known distance from the centre of the pulley.
                    The wheel being set in motion the blocks can be gradually pressed upon it by a
                    screw until the friction occurring is just sufficient to lift the weight and
                    keep it off the ground or its support. So long as these conditions can be
                    maintained the frictional resistance is exactly known, for its magnitude must be
                    to that of the weight inversely as their distances from tho centre of the wheel,
                    and the energy expended in any given time will be equal to this resistance
                    multiplied by the space passed through in the time by any point in the periphery
                    of the drum. ' _</p>
                <p>Figs. 2 and 3 show the construction of a brake of this kind, copied from drawings
                    kindly furnished by MrW. H. Maw, the designer. The drum A has a turned
                    cylindrical surface 39 inches in diameter and 3⅜ inches wide; it is fixed upon
                    the shaft B with which it revolves. The brake-ring consists of fourteen wooden
                    blocks CO, connected <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n254/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0254-0213"/> by the straps DD of hoop-iron, and so arranged
                    that they can be tightened up by the screw E. To the ring there is attached at G
                    a pin with pointed ends, from the centre of which hangs the rod II carrying, by
                    means of the plate at K, the weights. The blocks are made to exert such a
                    pressure upon the wheel that the pin G, from which the weights are suspended,
                    remains always in the position shown, its pointed ends coinciding with the top
                    of gauges upon the fixed wooden beams beside the brake. This apparatus is made
                    to a certain extent self-adjusting by means of two compensating levers. The
                    upper end of one of these, M, moves freely through an eye N some distance below
                    the centre of the shaft; the hoop-iron rings are attached to its lower end at 0
                    and P, the latter further from N than the former. If N coincided with the centre
                    of the shaft the lever would cause no impediment to the motion of the ring along
                    with the drum; as it is actually placed, however, if any motion occur the point
                    0 must move through a relatively smaller distance than in the other case,
                    because the ratio is less than pg∙ The consequence of this is, that if through
                    any cause the drum carry the ring round with it through any small distance, 0
                    tends to tighten the belt, and P to slacken it, but the relatively larger
                    movement of the latter causes the final result to be a slackening, so that the
                    weight drops back into <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> its proper place. If, on
                    the other hand, the ring begins to slide back on the drum, a similar, but
                    reversed, action at OP increases the pressure on the blocks, and the drum again
                    gripping them, brings the weight back into its original position. The dash-pot L
                    contains a piston very nearly fitting it, below which is water or oil, its
                    object being to prevent too sudden a fall of the weight. It is really a little
                    brake in itself, in which the energy given out by the descending weight is
                    expended in overcoming the frictional resistance encountered by the water in
                    passing upwards through the narrow space round the piston.</p>
                <p>In order that a machine of this kind may be run continuously at a high velocity
                    it requires careful and abundant lubrication. If the surface be too small, water
                    will have to be used, but with a well-designed and not over-worked brake, tallow
                    is the best lubricant.</p>
                <p>With regard to the proper proportioning of surface, numerous experiments with
                    brakes of different sizes run at different speeds seem to show that the surface
                    required varies as the energy transmitted, and (approximately) inversely as the
                    peripheral velocity of the drum. The conclusions drawn from them, put in the
                    most general form, are (for a brake having a cast-iron drum and wooden blocks)
                    as follows: —Let E be the energy (in foot lbs) to be absorbed per minute (that
                    is, the work done per minute by the machine driving the brake), T the number of
                    revolutions of the drum per minute, R its radius (in feet), and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> the area (square inches), and δ the breadth (inches) of the
                    drum; then in order that the latter may not heat, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    should not have a smaller value than ’ 286 jp, while it is frequently and very
                    properly made as much as ’ 357 . Expressing the same relation in</p>
                <p> E E </p>
                <p>other terms, we have <hi rend="italic">b =</hi> from ’ 0038 to ∙0048 , or

                <p>’ 024 y to ‘03 y , V being the peripheral velocity of the drum in feet per
                    minute. If the work be expressed in horses’ power (P) tho equation is very
                    nearly equivalent to δ=from to .</p>
                <p>A brake may have automatic apparatus attached to it for showing or registering
                    its speed or performance. (A. B. W. K.)</p>
