                    brothers Schlegel, was full of enthusiasm for Indian wisdom and philosophy. And
                    further, Fr. Schlegel’s book, <hi rend="italic">Ueber die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sprache und Weisheit der Inder</hi> (Heidelberg, 1808), which was just then
                    exerting a powerful influence on the minds of German philosophers and
                    historians, could not fail to stimulate also Bopp’s interest in the sacred
                    language of the Hindus. He was, however, too strictly trained in grammatical and
                    philological studies, and too eager for the scientific analysis of language, to
                    allow the clearness of his judgment to be warped by the romantic and speculative
                    predilections of Windischmann and Fr. Schlegel. In 1812 he went to Paris at the
                    expense of the Bavarian Government, with a view to devote himself vigorously to
                    the study of Sanskrit. There he enjoyed the society of such eminent men as
                    Cliézy, S. de Sacy, Langlès, and, above all, Al. Hamilton, who had acquired,
                    when in India, a respectable acquaintance with Sanskrit, and bad brought out,
                    conjointly with Langlès, a descriptive catalogue of the Sanskrit manuscripts of
                    the Imperial library. At that library Bopp had access not only to the rich
                    collection of Sanskrit manuscripts, most of which had been brought from India by
                    Father Pons early in the 18th century, but also to the Sanskrit books which had
                    up to that time issued from the Calcutta and Serampore presses.</p>
                <p>The first fruit of his four years’ study in Paris appeared at
                    Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1816, under the title <hi rend="italic">Ueber das
                    Conjugationssystem</hi><hi rend="italic">der Sanskritsprache</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Vergleichung mit jenem der Griechischen,
                    Lateinischen, Persischen, und Germanischen Sprache,</hi> and it was accompanied
                    with a preface from the pen of Windischmann, bearing date 16th May of that year.
                    In this first book, Bopp entered at once on the path on which the philological
                    researches of his whole subsequent life were concentrated. It was not that he
                    wished to prove the common parentage of Sanskrit with Persian, Greek, Latin, and
                    German, for that had long been established; but his object was to trace the
                    common origin of their grammatical forms, of their inflexions from
                    composition,—a task which had never been attempted. By a historical analysis of
                    those forms, as applied to the verb, he furnished the first trustworthy
                    materials for a history of the languages compared.</p>
                <p>After a brief sojourn in Germany, Bopp came to London, where he made the
                    acquaintance of Wilkins and Colebrooke, and became the friend of Wilhelm von
                    Humboldt, then Prussian ambassador at the court of St James’s, to whom he gave
                    instruction in Sanskrit. He brought out, in the <hi rend="italic">Annals of
                    Oriental Literature</hi> (London, 1820, pp. 1-65), an essay entitled “Analytical
                    Comparison of the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Teutonic Languages,” in which he
                    extended to all parts of the grammar what he had done in his first book for the
                    verb alone. He had previously published a critical edition, with a Latin
                    translation and notes, of the story of <hi rend="italic">Nala and Damayanti</hi>
                    (London, 1819), the most beautiful episode of the Mahâbhârata, which he had with
                    genial tact culled from the tangled labyrinth of that gigantic epic. Other
                    episodes of the Mahâbhârata— <hi rend="italic">Indra-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lokâgamanam,</hi> and three others, Berlin, 1824; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diluvium,</hi> and three others, Berlin, 1829; and a new edition of <hi
                    rend="italic">Nala,</hi> Berlin, 1832—followed in due course, all of which, with
                    A. W. Schlegel’s edition of the <hi rend="italic">Bhagavadgitâ,</hi> 1823,
                    proved excellent aids in initiating the early student into the reading of
                    Sanskrit texts. On the publication, in Calcutta, of the whole Mahâbhârata, Bopp
                    discontinued editing Sanskrit texts, and confined himself thenceforth
                    exclusively to grammatical investigations.</p>
                <p>After a short residence at Göttingen, Bopp was, on the recommendation of W. von
                    Humboldt, appointed to the chair of Sanskrit and comparative grammar at Berlin
                    in 1821, and was elected member of the Royal Prussian Academy in the following
                    year, both which posts he held up to his death, Oct. 23, 1867. In his quality as
                    Sanskrit professor he brought out, in 1827, his <hi rend="italic">Ausführliches
                    Lehrgebäude der</hi><hi rend="italic">Sanskrita-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sprache,</hi> on which he had been engaged since 1821. A new edition, in Latin,
                    was commenced in the following year, and completed in 1832. A shorter grammar
                    <hi rend="italic">(Kritische Grammatik der Sanskrita-Sprache</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">kürzerer Fassung)</hi> has run through
                    three editions (Berlin, 1834, 1845, 1863). At the same time he compiled a
                    Sanskrit and Latin glossary (1830) in which, more especially in the second and
                    third editions (1847 and 1867), account has also been taken of the cognate
                    languages. His chief activity, however, centred on the elaboration of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Comparative Grammar,</hi> which appeared in six parts at
                    considerable intervals (Berlin, 1833, 1835, 1842, 1847, 1849,- 1852; 1511 pages
                    in small 4to), under the title <hi rend="italic">Vergleichende Grammatik</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Sanskrit, Zend,</hi><hi rend="italic">Griechischen,
                    Lateinischen,</hi><hi rend="italic">Litthauischen, Altslavischen,
                    Gothischen,</hi><hi rend="italic">und Deutschen.</hi> How carefully this work
                    was matured may be gathered from the series of monographs printed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Berlin Academy</hi> (1824 to 1831), by which
                    it was preceded. They bear the general title, <hi rend="italic">Vergleichende
                    Zergliederung</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sanskrits</hi><hi rend="italic">und der
                    mit ihm verwandten Sprachen.</hi> Two other essays (on the “Numerals,” 1835)
                    followed the publication of the first part of the <hi rend="italic">Comparative
                    Grammar.</hi> The Old-Slavonian began to take its stand among the languages
                    compared from the second part onwards. At the instance of the earl of Ellesmere
                    (then Lord Francis Egerton) the work was translated into English by Mr E. B.
                    Eastwick (3 vols., 1845; second edition, 1854). A second German edition,
                    thoroughly revised (3 vols., 1856-1861), comprised also the Old-Armenian. From
                    this edition an excellent French translation was made by Professor Michel Bréal,
                    which came out in 5 vols, in 1866, ff. A third German edition has been published
                    since the author’s death, in 1871, ff.</p>
                <p>The task which Bopp endeavoured to carry out in his <hi rend="italic">Comparative
                    Grammar</hi> was threefold,—to give a description of the original grammatical
                    structure of the languages as deduced from their intercomparison, to trace their
                    phonetic laws, and to investigate the origin of their grammatical forms. The
                    first and second points were subservient to the third. As Bopp’s researches were
                    based on the best available sources, and incorporated every new item of
                    information that came to light, so they continued to widen and deepen in their
                    progress. Witness his monographs on the vowel system in the Teutonic languages
                    (1836), on the Celtic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n59/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0059-0050"/> languages (1839), on the Old-Prussian (1853) and
                    Albanian lan°ua"es (1854), on the accent in Sanskrit and Greek (1854)7 on the
                    relationship of the Malayo-Polynesian with the Indo-European languages (1840),
                    and on the Caucasian languages (1846). In the two last-mentioned the impetus of
                    his genius had led him on a wrong track. They show the rocks against which the
                    student of comparative philology has to guard.</p>
                <p>As for the charge that has been made against Bopp of neglecting the study of the
                    native Sanskrit grammars, every excuse ought to be made in his favour. In those
                    early days of Sanskrit studies the requisite materials were not accessible in
                    the great libraries of Europe; and if they had been, they would have absorbed
                    his exclusive attention for years, while the grammars of Forster, Wilkins, and
                    Colebrooke, from which his grammatical knowledge was derived, were all based on
                    native grammars. The further charge that Bopp, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comparative Grammar,</hi> gave undue prominence to Sanskrit may be disproved by
                    his own words; for, as early as the year 1820, he gave it as his opinion that
                    frequently the cognate languages serve to elucidate grammatical forms lost in
                    Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">{Annals of Or. Lit.,</hi> i. 3),—an opinion which he
                    has further developed in all his subsequent writings. In his translations from
                    the Sanskrit Bopp was not successful. He seems to have felt this himself; for,
                    after the publication, in 1838, of his metrical translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Story of Nala,</hi> he resigned that task to more skilful
                    hands.</p>
                <p>The method of tracing the life and growth of language, so successfully applied by
                    Bopp in the case of the Indo-European languages, has become the corner stone on
                    which all modern linguistic science rests. His researches, carried with
                    wonderful penetration into the most minute and almost microscopical details of
                    linguistic phenomena, have led to the opening up of a wide and distant view into
                    the original seats, the closer or more distant affiuity, and the tenets,
                    practices, and domestic usages of the ancient Indo-European nations, and form
                    the only safe basis on which further investigations in each direction are
                    possible. The outlines of his great work had been distinctly traced by him in
                    his very first publication, from which the science of comparative grammar may
                    truly be said to date. In grateful recognition of that fact, on the fiftieth
                    anniversary of the date of Windischmann’s preface to that work, a fund called
                    <hi rend="italic">Die Bopp-Stif tuny,</hi> for the promotion of the study of
                    Sanskrit and comparative grammar, was established at Berlin, to which liberal
                    contributions were made by his numerous pupils and admirers in all parts of the
                    globe.</p>
                <p>Bopp was specially favoured by fortune in living to see the resuite of his
                    labours everywhere accepted, and his name justly celebrated. But the sun that
                    gilds the writer’s pen did not shine upon him, and he died a poor man,—by his
                    genuine kindliness and unselfishness, his devotion to his family and friends,
                    and his rare modesty, endeared to all who knew him. <hi rend="italic">{B real's
