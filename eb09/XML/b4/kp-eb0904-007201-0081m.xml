                    rend="italic">Flavia Caesariensis,</hi> but of this sufficient evidence does not
                    seem to exist. According to the Saxon Chronicle, St Botolph, the patron of
                    sailors, founded a monastery at Icanhoa in 654, which was destroyed by the Dane3
                    in 870. From this Boston is said to have taken its name (Botolph’s town). It
                    became a place of considerable commercial importance after the Norman Conquest,
                    and, in 1204, when the <hi rend="italic">quinzième</hi> tax wa3 imposed on the
                    ports of England, that of Boston amounted to £780, and was exceeded only by that
                    of London, which was £836. A great annual fair was held in the town at this
                    period. By 27th Edward III. it was made a staple for wool, woolfells, leather,
                    and lead. Its prosperity about this time induced merchants from the Hanseatic
                    and other Continental commercial cities to settle here; a century later,
                    however, these foreigners were obliged to leave, in consequence of a quarrel
                    with the townsmen. From this time it rapidly declined. The dissolution of the
                    monasteries by Henry VIII. injured the town, though compensation was in some
                    degree made by granting it a charter of incorporation; and Philip and Mary
                    endowed it with upwards of 500 acres of land. It afterwards suffered from the
                    plague and from inundations, to which its low situation rendered it particularly
                    liable. It was for some time the headquarters of Cromwell’s army.</p>
                <p>Boston is well built, paved, and lighted. It is divided iuto two nearly equal
                    parts by the Witham, here crossed by au elegant iron bridge of one arch, 86 feet
                    in span. At one time the supply of water was very deficient; but, in virtue of
                    an Act passed in 1847, there is now a plentiful supply conveyed by pipes from a
                    distance of twelve miles. The principal building is the parish church of St
                    Botolph, founded in 1309, and partly restored in 1857 at the expense of the
                    inhabitants of Boston in America, in memory of their connection with the English
                    city. It is one of the largest churches without aisles in the kingdom, being 290
                    feet by 98 within the walls. The tower, 290 feet in height, resembles that of
                    Antwerp cathedral, and is crowned by a beautiful octagonal lantérn, forming a
                    landmark seen forty miles off. A chapel of ease was erected in 1822. There is a
                    free grammar school, founded in 1554, a charity school for the sons of poor
                    freemen, a blue-coat, national, and other schools. There is also a dispensary, a
                    town-hall, a market-house, a custom-house, assembly rooms, a theatre, a borough
                    gaol, a house of correction, a union poor-house, Vauxhall gardens, a mechanics’
                    institution, public baths, subscription libraries, an athenaeum, and a
                    freemason’s hall, built in imitation of Egyptian architecture. The manufactures
                    consist chiefly of sail-cloth, canvas, sacking, ropes, beer, leather, hats, and
                    bricks. There are also iron and brass foundries, and ship-yards, with patent
                    slips, where vessels of 200 tons are built.</p>
                <p>From neglect to clear the river, it became so obstructed that in 1750 a sloop of
                    40 or 50 tons could with difficulty come up to the town at spring tides. Since
                    that period great improvements have been made, and vessels of 300 tons are
                    enabled to unload in the town. The imports arc chiefly timber, pitch, tar, and
                    hemp from the Baltic, and coal and manufactures coastwise; the exports, wool,
                    wood, corn, and other agricultural produce. The total value of the former was in
                    1873, £200,825, and of the latter £86,571. By means of the river and the canals
                    connected therewith, Boston has navigable communication with Liucoln,
                    Gainsborough, Nottingham, and Derby. The East Lincolnshire Railway connects it
                    with Louth, Grimsby, and other towns in the north, and the Great Northern with
                    Peterborough and the south; another line extends to Lincoln. It has returned two
                    members to parliament since the reign of Edward IV. The title of Baron of Boston
                    is borne by the Irby family. In 1871 the population within the parliamentary
                    boundaries was 18,279; within the municipality, 14,526.</p>
