                    literature, was born on the 11th December 1781 at Jedburgh, where his father, a
                    teacher of high reputation, was rector of the grammar school. At the early age
                    of twelve he was sent to the University of Edinburgh, being intended for the
                    clerical profession. Even before this, however, he had shown a strong
                    inclination for physical inquiries, which had been fostered by his intimacy with
                    a “self-taught philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician,” as Sir Walter Scott
                    called him, of great local fame—James Veitch of Inchbonny. Veitch was
                    particularly skilful in making telescopes, and may thus have had some influence
                    in determining the precise direction of his young companion’s future researches.
                    Though he duly finished his theological course and was licensed to preach,
                    Brewster’s natural preference for other pursuits, combined with a constitutional
                    nervousness, prevented him from engaging in the active duties of his profession.
                    In 1799 he was induced by his fellow-student, Brougham, to study the inflection
                    of light, repeating Newton’s experiments; and from this date he carried on,
                    almost without interruption, the course of original discovery in the science of
                    physical optics which constitutes one of his chief claims to distinction. The
                    results of his investigations were communicated from time to time in papers to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> of London and other
                    scientific journals, and were admirably and impartially summarized by Professor
                    James D. Forbes in his preliminary dissertation to the eighth edition of this
                    Encyclopaedia. The fact that other philosophers, notably Malus and Fresnel, were
                    pursuing the same investigations contemporaneously in France does not invalidate
                    Brewster’s claim to independent discovery, even though in one or two cases the
                    priority must be assigned to others.</p>
                <p>The most important subjects of his inquiries are enumerated by Forbes under the
                    following five heads :—1. The laws of polarization by reflection and refraction,
                    and other quantitative laws of phenomena; 2. The discovery of the polarizing
                    structure induced by heat and pressure; 3. The discovery of crystals with two
                    axes of double refraction, and many of the laws of their phenomena, including
                    the connection of optical structure and crystalline forms; 4. The laws of
                    metallic reflection; 5, Experiments on the absorption of light. In this line of
                    investigation the prime importance belongs to the discovery (1) of the
                    connection between the refractive index and the polarizing angle, (2) of biaxal
                    crystals, and (3) of the production of double refraction by irregular heating.
                    These discoveries were promptly acknowledged by those best qualified to estimate
                    their value. So early as the year 1807 the degree of LL.D. was conferred upon
                    Brewster by Marischal College, Aberdeen; in 1815 he was made a member of the
                    Royal Society of London, and received the Copley medal; in 1818 he received the
                    Rumford medal of the Society; and in 1816 the French Institute awarded him
                    one-half of the prize of three thousand francs for the two most important
                    discoveries in physical science made in Europe during the two preceding years.
                    Among the non-scientific public his fame was spread more effectually by the
                    invention, in 1816, of the elegant philosophical toy, the kaleidoscope, for
                    which there was so great a demand both in England and America that for some time
                    the supply could not meet it. An instrument of higher interest, the stereoscope,
                    which, though of much later date (1849-50), may be mentioned here, since along
                    with the kaleidoscope it did more than anything else to popularize his name, was
                    not, as has often been asserted, the invention of Brewster. Wheatstone
                    discovered its principle and applied it as early as 1838 to the construction of
                    a cumbrous but effective instrument, in which the binocular pictures were made
                    to combine by means of mirrors. To Brewster is due the merit of suggesting the
                    use of lenses for the purpose of uniting the dissimilar pictures; and,
                    accordingly, the lenticular stereoscope, now in exclusive use, may fairly be
                    said to be his invention. A much more valuable practical result of Brewster’s
                    optical researches may be traced in the vast improvement of the lighthouse
                    system during the last half century. It is true that the dioptric apparatus was
                    perfected independently by Fresnel, who had also the satisfaction of being the
                    first to put it into operation, the French Government being in this, as in many
                    other cases, quicker than the English to perceive the value of new scientific
                    discoveries. But it is indisputable that Brewster was earlier in the field than
                    Fresnel; that he described the dioptric apparatus in 1812; that he pressed its
                    adoption on those in authority at least as early as 1820, two years before
                    Fresnel suggested it; and that it was finally introduced into British
                    lighthouses mainly by his persistent efforts. The tribute paid to his memory by
                    his successor at the head of the University of Edinburgh was therefore as just
                    as it was graceful “Every lighthouse that burns round the shores of the British
                    empire is a shining witness to the usefulness of Brewster’s Hfe. <hi

                <p>Brewster’s own discoveries, important though they were, were not his only,
                    perhaps not even his chief, service to science. The extent and variety of his
                    contributions to scientific literature were little short of marvellous. He
                    commenced literary work in 1799 as a regular contributor to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Magazine,</hi> of which he acted as editor at the age of
                    twenty. In 1807 he entered on a much larger undertaking, which cost him long
                    continued labour, and, especially towards its close, great vexation and anxiety.
                    The chance suggestion of a friend, who knew his varied powers, led to the
                    projection, under his editorship, of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Encyclopaedia,</hi> of which the first part appeared in 1808, and the last not
                    until 1830. The work was, as might have been expected, strongest in the
                    scientific department, and many of its most valuable articles were from the pen
                    of its editor. At a later period he was one of the leading scientific
                    contributors to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannica</hi> (seventh and eighth editions), the articles Electricity,
                    Hydrodynamics, Magnetism, Microscope, Optics, Stereoscope, Voltaic Electricity,
                    &amp;c., being from his pen. In 1819 Brewster undertook further editorial work
                    by establishing, in conjunction with Jameson, the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Philosophical Journal,</hi> which took the place of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Magazine.</hi> After a time the title was again changed to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Journal of Science,</hi> sixteen volumes of which
                    appeared under Brewster’s sole editorship, with very many articles from his own
                    pen. To the transactions of various learned societies he contributed from first
                    to last between three and four hundred papers, and few of his contemporaries
                    wrote so much for the various reviews. In the <hi rend="italic">North British
                    Beviev)</hi> alone seventy-five articles of his appeared. A list of his larger
                    separate works will be found below. Special mention, however, must be made of
                    the most important of them all —his biography of Newton. In 1831 he published a
                    short popular account of the philosopher’s life in Murray’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Family Library;</hi> but it was not until 1855 that he was able to issue the
                    much fuller <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Discoveries of
                    Sir Isaac Neu ton,</hi> a work which embodied the results of more than twenty
                    years’ patient investigation of original manuscripts and all other available
                    sources.</p>
                <p>Brewster’s relations as editor brought him into frequent communication with the
                    most eminent scientific men, and he was naturally among the first to recognize
                    the benefit <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n320/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0320-0277"/> that would accrue from regular intercourse among
                    labourers in the field of science. In an article in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly Review</hi> he threw out a suggestion for “an association of our
                    nobility, clergy, gentry, and philosophers,” which was taken up by others and
                    found speedy realization in the British Association for the Advancement of
                    Science. Its first meeting was held at York in 1831; and Brewster, along with
                    Babbage and Herschel, had the chief part in shaping its constitution. It was
                    this service mainly that was referred to when it was said of him after his death
                    that “the improved position of men of science in our times is chiefly due to Sir
                    David Brewster.” In the same year in which the British Association held its
                    first meeting Brewster received the honour of knighthood and the decoration of
                    the Guelphic order of Hanover. In 1838 he was appointed principal of the united
                    colleges of St Salvator and St Leonard, St Andrews. Two of the highest honours
                    of the scientific world were conferred upon him in 1849, when he filled the
                    office of president of the British Association and was elected one of the eight
                    foreign associates of the Institute of France in succession to Berzelius. In
                    1859 he accepted the office of principal of the University of Edinburgh, the
                    duties of which he continued to discharge vigorously until within a few months
                    of his death, which took place at Allerly, Melrose, on the 10th February
                    1868.</p>
                <p>In estimating Brewster’s place among scientific discoverers the chief thing to be
                    borne in mind is that the bent of his genius was not characteristically
                    mathematical. His method was empirical; he was a painstaking and accurate
                    observer and classifier of facts rather than a theorizer; and the laws which he
                    established, some of them, as has been pointed out, of prime importance, were
                    generally the result of repeated experiment. To the ultimate explanation of the
                    phenomena with which he dealt he contributed nothing, and it is noteworthy in
                    this connection, that if he did not maintain to the end of his life the
                    corpuscular theory he never explicitly adopted the undulatory theory of light
                    These limitations, however, are to be taken as characterizing his genius rather
                    than as detracting from it. Few will be inclined to dispute the verdict of
                    Forbes :—“His scientific glory is different in kind from that of Young and
                    Fresnel; but the discoverer of the law of polarization, of bιaxal crystals, of
                    optical mineralogy, and of double refraction by compression, will always occupy
                    a foremost rank in the intellectual history of the age.” In addition to the
                    various works of Brewster already noticed the following may be mentioned :—Notes
                    and Introduction to Carlyle’s translation of Legendre’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements of Geometry</hi> (1824); <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Optics</hi>
