                <p><label type="entry">BUTTERFLIES <hi rend="smallcaps">and</hi></label> MOTHS, the
                    common English names applied respectively to the two groups of Insects which
                    together form the order <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi> (Gr. λ∈πις, a scale,
                    and <hi rend="italic">πτfpov,</hi> a wing), an order characterized by the
                    constant presence, in a greater or less degree, of scales on the wings. The two
                    groups may, as a rule, be readily distinguished from each other, although, so
                    far as our present knowledge goes, there is nothing in the structure or habits
                    of either group which divides it entirely from the other. All butterflies are
                    diurnal in their flight, while moths, with many exceptions, are crepuscular or
                    nocturnal.</p>
                <p>The bodies of butterflies and moths, like those of all other insects, consist of
                    three distinct parts—the head, bearing the organs of sense; the thorax, the
                    organs of locomotion; and the abdomen, the organs of generation. On the head are
                    placed (1) the antennae, composed of numerous articulations, and supposed to be
                    organs of hearing. They differ greatly in form among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera</hi>; those of butterflies, however, agreeing generally in having
                    their ends knobbed or clubbed, hence the term Rhopalocera (ρόπαλον, a club; <hi
                    rend="italic">κepaς,</hi> a horn), often applied to this group. The antennae of
                    moths assume a great variety of forms—prismatic, serrate, pectinate, moniliform,
                    and filiform,—and are often beautifully feathered, especially in the males,
                    whose antennae arc usually ampler than those of the females; but in no case are
                    they knobbed, as in the great majority of butterflies. Owing to this vaιiety iu
                    the form of their antennae, moths have been termed l·leterocera (cτcpos,
                    various; κepαs, a horn). In butterflies these organs are also straight, and
                    stand out rigidly in front of the head, while in moths they are usually curved
                    and can generally be folded back on the body. (2) The eyes in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi> consist of two masses of hexagonal facets, placed
                    one on each side of the head, and forming what are known as compound eyes. These
                    contain in some cases no fewer than 16,000 facets each, while in many species a
                    pair of <hi rend="italic">ocelli, or</hi> simple eyes, are found concealed among
                    the scales and placed between the compound organs. The hairy appearance of the
                    eyes in many of the <hi rend="italic">Nymphalidce</hi> is owing to the presence
                    of minute hairs planted at the angles of the numerous facets. Compound eyes are
                    not found among the larvae of butterflies and moths, but they are in most cases
                    provided with six ocelli on each side of the head. (3) The mouth, the parts of
                    which in insects are considered by comparative anatomists to be typically
                    developed in the masticatory mouth of beetles <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Coleoptera),</hi> assumes in butterflies and moths the suctorial form—the
                    latter being merely a modification of the former; thus the mandibles, labium,
                    and labrum, which are fully developed when the nature of the food renders
                    mastication necessary, are in a rudimentary condition in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera,</hi> whose chief food is the nectar of flowers, while the
                    maxillae, on the other hand, are enormously developed; being concave on their
                    inner sides, these by approximating form a tube known as the proboscis or
                    tongue. This when at rest is coiled up into a ball in front of the head, and is
                    partly concealed by the palpi projecting on both sides. In the moths belonging
                    to the family <hi rend="italic">Bombycidoe,</hi> the organs of the mouth are
                    rudimentary, so that these insects after entering upon the imago state are
                    incapable of feeding.</p>
                <p>The thorax bears the organs of locomotion, consisting of three pairs of legs and
                    two pairs of wings. The former are covered with hairs and scales, and terminate
                    in hooks modified to suit the habits of the various species. Butterflies use the
                    legs almost entirely for resting, very rarely for walking, and in some groups,
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Nymphalidce,</hi> the front pair is rudimentary. The
                    wings consist of a double layer of colourless membrane traversed by numerous
                    nervures (Plate XXVII. fig. 1), and covered with minute scales implanted in the
                    wing membrane by a short stalk, and placed together like tiles on a roof. The
                    scales vary in form in different species and in different portions of the wings
                    of the same species, while under a high power of the microscope they are seen to
                    be minutely corrugated; and it is to these corrugations acting upon the
                    colourless rays of light, and producing the phenomena of “interference,” that
                    many of the loveliest butterflies owe the brilliancy of their wings. The
                    splendour of those organs in the majority of butterflies, and in some moths, is
                    sometimes equally shared by both sexes, but more usually the females are less
                    conspicuously coloured than the males. This difference, amounting often to total
                    dissimilarity, Darwin, in accordance with his descenttheory, attributes in great
                    part to the action of sexual selection. “Several males,” he says, “may be seen
                    pursuing the same female.” The latter he supposes selects the most
                    gaily-coloured, and thus the plainer coloured males have been gradually
                    eliminated; but there is no proof whatever that the female shows any such
                    discrimination in selecting a mate, while many known facts seem to point in an
                    opposite direction. Mr A. R. Wallace maintains, on the other hand, that the
                    duller colours of the females have been acquired for protective purposes, the
                    females requiring such protection more than the males owing to their generally
                    slower flight, and to the fact that after imprégna-tion<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n656/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0656-0593"/> they take several days to deposit their <hi
                    rend="italic">eggs,</hi> during which the life of the male is of no further
                    consequence to the perpetuation of the species. Whatever may be the true
                    interpretation of this phenomenon, it is certain that many butterflies and moths
                    of both sexes are so coloured as to be to a greater or less extent protected
                    thereby. Many moths, which rest by day clinging to the trunks of trees, so
                    exactly resemble in the colour of their upper wings the bark on which they rest
                    as only to be distinguished on close examination; while many small species which
                    habitually rest on leaves are often mistaken for the dropping3 of birds. The
                    upper surfaces of the wings of butterflies are in almost all cases the more
                    gaily coloured, and when at rest, these are raised perpendicularly over the
                    back, so as only to expose the under surfaces, which are often dull coloured,
                    and in some cases have been shown to be directly imitative of surrounding
                    objects. The best example of this is to be found in the Malayan butterfly, <hi
                    rend="italic">Kallima paralekta,</hi> and its Indian ally, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kallima inachis,</hi> both brilliant and conspicuous insects on the wing, but
                    which no sooner alight than they become invisible. The under surfaces of their
                    wings, though varying greatly, yet form in every case a perfect representation
                    of a leaf in some stage or other of decay, the butterfly at the same time
                    disposing of the rest of its body so as to bear out the deception. How this is
                    effected is best told by Mr Wallace, who was the first to observe it, in his
                    valuable work on the Malay Archipelago.</p>
                <p>“The habit of the species is always to rest on a twig and among dead or dried
                    leaves, and in this position, with the wings closely fιressed together, their
                    outline is exactly that of a moderately sized eaf slightly curved or shrivelled.
                    The tail of the hind wings forms a perfect stalk and touches the stick, while
                    the insect is supported by the middle pair of legs, which are not noticed among
                    the twigs anti fibres that surround it. The head and antennae are drawn back
                    between the wings so as to be quite concealed, and there is a little notch
                    hollowed out at the very base of the wings, which allows the head to be
                    retracted sufficiently.”</p>
                <p>Moths, when at rest, have the hind wings folded close to the body, while the fore
                    wings cover all, and it is the latter that usually show an assimilation in
                    colour to surrounding nature. Many butterflies and moths, there seems good
                    reason to believe, are coloured in imitation of other and often widely different
                    species possessing some special means of protection, as sting or nauseous
                    juices, the mimetic forms, it is supposed, sharing with their models in immunity
                    from the attacks of insectivorous animals. The phenomena of mimickry were first
                    observed by Bates among the <hi rend="italic">Heliconidoe,</hi> a family of
                    South American butterflies, remarkable for their great numbers, the gaudiness of
                    their colouring in both sexes and on both surfaces of their wings, and for their
                    comparative slowness of flight. It was found that, owing to the nauseous nature
                    of their juices, those brilliant butterflies were left unmolested by
                    insect-eaters. It was also observed that several species of a genus closely
                    allied to our Cabbage Butterflies, totally different both in the colour and form
                    of the wings from the <hi rend="italic">Heliconidoe,</hi> so closely resembled
                    particular species of the latter as not to be distinguishable from them on the
                    wing. Exactly similar phenomena have been observed in the tropical regions of
                    Asia and Africa, where the similarly protected <hi rend="italic">Danaidoe</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Acroeidoe</hi> find imitators among the otherwise
                    unprotected Papilios and Diademas. There are two families of clay-flying moths,
                    <hi rend="italic">Sesiidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aegeriidoe,</hi> with
                    clear transparent wings, the scales being confined mainly to the margins and
                    nervures, which in their wings and in the form and colour of their bodies might
                    be readily mistaken for bees or wasps, a similarity recognized in such specific
                    names as <hi rend="italic">l)ombiciformis, apiformis, vespiformis,</hi> &lt;kc.,
                    applied to different species of these moths. Other species of the same “clear
                    wing” group have opaque wings closely resembling those of certain species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleoptera</hi> found in the same neighbourhood, and these have
                    their wings when at rest closed over their bodies like the elytra of
                    beetles.</p>
                <p>Butterflies and moths undergo complete metamorphosis, that is, after emerging
                    from the egg, and before attaining the full development of the imago, they pass
                    through the larva and pupa stages—the latter being one of total inactivity in so
                    far as the outward manifestations of life are concerned. The eggs vary greatly
                    in shape, and are deposited in a great variety of situations—on the under sides
                    of leaves, on the outside of the cocoon, as in the Vapourer Moth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Orgyia</hi><hi rend="italic">antiqua),</hi> the female of which
                    is wingless, glued together in rings round the smaller branches of fruit trees,
                    as in <hi rend="italic">Clisiocampa neustria,</hi> or in the interior of hives,
                    the larvae afterwards feeding on the wax, as in the Honey-comb Moth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Galleria cerelld),</hi> They thus show a remarkable instinct in
                    depositing their eggs in situations where the larvae may afterwards obtain their
                    appropriate food, although they themselves can have no knowledge of that food.
                    The caterpillar emerges from the egg usually in a week or ten days. Unlike the
                    perfect insect it is provided with a masticatory mouth. It has three pairs of
                    legs on the anterior segments of its body, corresponding to the six legs of the
                    future imago, besides which it is provided with a variable number of conical
                    feet or <hi rend="italic">prolegs</hi> placed posteriorly, and which are merely
                    processes of the external covering of the caterpillar. Goossens, a Continental
                    naturalist, has recently observed that the number of prolegs in some species
                    differs at different ages, and gives a case in which a caterpillar with
                    originally six prolegs acquired two additional pairs after the third moult. The
                    body cavity is almost entirely occupied with the digestive system, and with that
                    concerned in the production of the silky material used in forming the cocoon.
                    Silk is secreted as a viscous fluid in tubes, which after many convolutions
                    widen into a large reservoir filled with the yellow liquid, narrowing again into
                    a tube extending to the mouth, where it communicates with the outside by means
                    of a conical and jointed papilla known as the <hi rend="italic">spinneret.</hi>
                    Through this organ the viscous fluid is forced in two exceedingly delicate
                    streams, which coalesce, and on exposure to the atmosphere harden into a single
                    continuous thread. The silky material is not completely formed till the
                    caterpillar reaches maturity. Caterpillars are either smooth skinned or more or
                    less covered with hairs; in the former case they are a favourite food of
                    insectivorous animals, while in the latter they are almost universally
                    rejected,—recent investigations on this subject going to prove that the hairs on
                    certain species of caterpillars have a power of stinging, somewhat analogous to
                    that possessed by the hairs on the surface of a nettle.</p>
                <p>No sooner does the caterpillar emerge from the egg than it begins to eat
                    voraciously, and in a few days has grown so large that a change of skin becomes
                    necessary. The old skin is cast off, and with it the entire internal lining of
                    the alimentary canal, and in the majority of butterflies and moths five such
                    changes take place before the caterpillar has attained its full growth, while
                    the Tiger Moth <hi rend="italic">(Arctia caja)</hi> is said to cast its skin at
                    least ten times. Those moultings do not usually affect the appearance of the
                    caterpillar, except in enlarging it; but in the case of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Samia</hi><hi rend="italic">cecropia,</hi> a species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bombycidoe,</hi> the larvae are said to pass from black to various shades of
                    green and azureblue in the course of their moultings. The larvae of the family
                    <hi rend="italic">Psychidoe</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the larger members of
                    which are found in America and Australia—have the curious habit of constructing
                    cases which they carry about with them, and within which they afterwards undergo
                    transformation. Each larva has but a single case, and when this gets too narrow
                    it splits longitudinally and is enlarged by interpos <pb break="no"

                    remain in the larva) condition for periods varying from three years, as in the
                    Goat Moth <hi rend="italic">(Cossus</hi><hi rend="italic">ligniperda),</hi> to a
                    few weeks, as in tbe Cabbage Butterfly <hi rend="italic">(Pieris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">brassicoe),</hi> which usually has two broods in the season, while
                    many species whose larvae leave the egg in autumn, as the Blue Butterfly <hi
                    rend="italic">(Polyommatus alexis),</hi> remain torpid throughout winter at this
                    stage, and waken up to resume feeding in spring. During this period they
                    increase enormously in weight; thus the larva of the Privet Hawk Moth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sphinx</hi><hi rend="italic">ligustri)</hi> which casts its sixth
                    and last skin on the twenty-second day after emerging from the egg, attains its
                    greatest size ten days after, having in the meantime increased to 11,312
                    timesits original weight; while the Goat Moth <hi rend="italic">(Cossus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ligniperda),</hi> which remains in the larval condition for three
                    years, has grown in that period 72,000 times heavier. Having attained its full
                    growth the instincts of the caterpillar undergo a change; it ceases to eat and
                    begins to weave a couch or cocoon by which it is more or less enclosed. It then
                    throws off its skin and appears as a pupa or chrysalis incapable of eating or of
                    locomotion, the only apparent sign of life which it manifests being a convulsive
                    twitching when irritated. Examined more closely, however, life is seen to be
                    exerted in very great intensity in this stage of apparent quiescence. The
                    immense digestive system of the caterpillar dwindles greatly, the rudiments of
                    wings begin to show themselves, forming slight prominences on each side of the
                    chrysalis shell, while the organs of the masticatory mouth are being transformed
                    into those of the suctorial. In assuming the pupa condition caterpillars dispose
                    of themselves in a great variety of ways. Many, like the common Cabbage
                    Butterfly, ascend walls and palings, to which they attach themselves by a silken
                    belt, others, as silkworms, spin around them a solid cocoon of pure silk; while
                    the majority of Sphinx Moths form burrows in the ground, which they line with
                    silk and afterwards varnish to keep out the moisture,—one of these <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sphinx</hi><hi rend="italic">ligustri)</hi> remaining thus buried
                    from August till June. Those larvae which feed on the wood of trees, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Cossus</hi><hi rend="italic">ligniperda,</hi> generally form tough
                    cocoons of chips of wood and of silk within the tunnels which they have bored in
                    the tree, and their pupae have the power of forcing themselves along those
                    passages till they reach the bark, where they remain until about to emerge from
                    the egg, when they pierce it also. The cocoon of the Puss Moth <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cerura υinula),</hi> composed of the same materials as in the preceding
                    instance, is usually placed in a crevice of the bark of a tree, where by
                    exposure to the atmosphere it becomes hard as horn, the moth only making its
                    escape after discharging a liquid by which one end of the cocoon is softened.
                    Hairy caterpillars are usually deficient in silk, and in forming their cocoons
                    mix what they have of this with the hairs of their body. A beautiful net-like
                    cocoon is woven by a South American moth belonging to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bombycidoe,</hi> which it suspends from the top of an outstanding leaf. “When
                    the caterpillar,” says Bates, “begins its work it lets itself down from the tip
                    of the leaf which it has chosen by spinning a thread of silk, the thickness of
                    which slowly increases as it descends Having given the proper length to the cord
                    (about 6 inches) it proceeds to weave its elegant bag, placing itself in the
                    centre and spinning rings of silk at regular intervals, connecting them at the
                    same time by means of cross threads, so that the whole when finished forms a
                    loose web with quadrangular meshes of nearly equal size throughout.” The
                    duration of the pupa stage varies from a few weeks to several months; it varies
                    also in the same species according to the season at which it becomes encased;
                    thus the pupa of <hi rend="italic">Vanessa</hi><hi rend="italic">urticoe</hi> at
                    the beginning of summer usually develops in fourteen days, and at midsummer in
                    eight or nine days, while if it becomes encased in autumn it remains a pupa
                    during the winter. By applying heat the process can be accelerated, and it can
                    be equally retarded by refrigeration. When mature the pupa case cracks towards
                    the anterior end, and the butterfly or moth crawls forth with wings which,
                    though at first small and crumpled up, in a few hours attain their full size.
                    The male insect goes in search of the female, and when the latter has deposited
                    her eggs the main object in the life of the imago is attained and both sexes
                    die. Among the <hi rend="italic">Bombycidoe</hi> this occurs in two or three
                    days, owing to the atrophied condition of the organs of the mouth. W ith
                    butterflies courtship is generally a more prolonged affair, several males
                    pursuing the same female, and breaking each others wings in the conflicts that
                    thus frequently ensue. Butterflies appear in many cases to be gregarious, flying
                    in great flocks. Bates states that at one place in South America he noticed
                    eighty different species flying about in enormous numbers in the sunshine, and
                    these, with few exceptions, were males, the females remaining within the forest
                    shades. Darwin also describes a “butterfly shower,” which he observed ten miles
                    off the South American coast, extending as far as the eye could reach; “even by
                    the aid of the telescope,” he adds,“it was not possible to see a space free from
                    butterflies. That they are occasionally migratory as well as gregarious is borne
                    out by the observations of Sir J. Emerson Tennent, who witnessed in Ceylon a
                    mighty host of butterflies of a white or pale yellow hue, “apparently miles in
                    breadth and of such prodigious extension as to occupy hours and even days
                    uninterruptedly in their passage.”</p>
                <p>The food of Lepidopterous insects consists chiefly of the sweet liquids drawn
                    from the nectaries of flowers, which they reach by means of their long proboscis
                    or tongue. Many of the <hi rend="italic">Sphingidoe</hi> are said to do this
                    without settling on the flowers, and one of these, the Humming Bird Hawk Moth of
                    South America <hi rend="italic">(Macroglossa titan),</hi> in its mode of flight
                    and of poising itself before a flower while extracting the juice, bears such
                    close resemblance to certain of the smaller humming birds inhabiting the same
                    district, that Bates often shot it for one of the latter, and it was only after
                    considerable experience that he learnt to distinguish the bird from the moth
                    when on the wing. Although their food is thus usually the sweetest liquids drawn
                    from loveliest vessels, still some of the most brilliant species seem to prefer
                    more vulgar fare. Thus the showy Purple Emperor <hi rend="italic">(Apatura
                    iris)</hi> prefers above all things to suck the juices of putrid animal
                    substances, and the surest way to secure specimens of this butterfly is by
                    setting such baits near its haunts. Mr Wallace states that in Malacca he caught
                    a large and brilliant butterfly which had settled on the dung of some
                    carnivorous animal, where he had also observed it on the previous day, and he
                    adds that it is a habit of many of the finest butterflies to suck up the liquid
                    from muddy spots on the roadside.</p>
                <p>Butterflies and moths are widely distributed all over the globe, occurring,
                    however, in greatest variety and abundance in tropical lands. They are found as
                    far north as Spitzbergen, on the Alps to a height of 9000 feet, and to double
                    that height on the Andes. In Britain there are only 66, and in the whole of
                    Europe 390 species of butterflies; while within one hour’s walk of Paré, in
                    Brazil, Bates found no fewer than 700 species. There are 1910 species of British
                    moths, the majority of which are nocturnal and crepuscular; while in tropical
                    America day-flying moths seem to be most common, and may be seen in company with
                    the sunshineseeking butterflies. This paucity of nocturnal moths has been
                    attributed to the great number of night-flying or crepuscular insectivorous bats
                    and birds which haunt those regions. Many species both of moths and of
                    butterflies have a very wide distribution; the Painted Lady (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Vanessa</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n658/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0658-0595"/><hi rend="italic">cardui),</hi> a common British
                    species, being found in every quarter of the globe; and our finest butterfly,
                    the Swallow Tail <hi rend="italic">(Papilio</hi><hi rend="italic">machaon),</hi>
                    occurring throughout Europe, Asia as far as the Himalayas, and South Africa.
                    Other species are extremely local, as the Scotch Argus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Lycoena</hi><hi rend="italic">artaxerxes),</hi> confined to a few Scottish
                    hillsides. Keferstein estimates the total number of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera</hi> at 66,000 species—6000 butterflies and 60,000 moths. That such
                    estimates, how ever, are not to be relied on is sufficiently proved by the fact
                    that Bates gives the number of species as above 200,000. The geographical
                    distribution of certain groups of <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi> has been
                    well wrought out by Mr Wallace and other naturalists who have studied them in
                    their native homes; but the division of this great order into geographical zones
                    has still to be satisfactorily accomplished. Koch has recently proposed to place
                    them in five such groups—(1) the European or Western fauna, including Northern
                    Asia, the North of Africa (a region exceedingly poor in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera,</hi> owing probably to the want of great forests, and to the
                    marshy nature of vast tracts of land), and the northern parts of North America;
                    (2) the African fauna, allied to the preceding; (3) the South Asiatic or Indian;
                    (4) the Australian and Polynesian, allied to the Indian; and (5) the American
                    fauna, distinguished by its exceeding richness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Butterflies.</hi> —Linnaeus included all butterflies under
                    the single genus <hi rend="italic">Papilio,</hi> but later writers have divided
                    them into several well-defined families, and into numerous genera. The largest
                    and most magnificent species belong to the <hi rend="italic">Ornithoptera</hi>
                    or “Bird-winged Butterflies,” a genus of <hi rend="italic">Papilionidoe,</hi>
                    whose wings, measuring fully 7 inches across, are of a velvety black and
                    brilliant green colour, the latter in such species as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithoptera crcesus</hi> being replaced by fiery orange, while the body is
                    golden, and the breast crimson. They are distributed over the islands of the
                    Malay Archipelago, reaching, according to Mr Wallace, their maximum of size and
                    beauty in the Moluccas. <hi rend="italic">ThePapilios</hi> are a closely allied
                    group, smaller in size but equally brilliant in the colour and form of their
                    wings. They are exceedingly numerous and are widely distributed over both
                    hemispheres. One species only is found in Britain, the handsome Swallow Tail <hi
                    rend="italic">(Papilio</hi><hi rend="italic">machaon)</hi> (Plate XXVII. figs.
                    1, 2), formerly abundant in many parts of England, but now confined to the fen
                    districts of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Huntingdon. When alarmed the larvae of
                    this and of other species of Papilios protrude from the upper part of the neck a
                    soft forked horn that usually diffuses a penetrating and unpleasant odour. One
                    of the most elegant of exotic species is the Malayan <hi rend="italic"
                    >Papilio</hi><hi rend="italic">memnon,</hi> with black and blue wings, 6 inches
                    in expanse, and with the edges of the hind pair gracefully scalloped. This
                    butterfly, though common enough in collections, has recently gained additional
                    interest from the fact, discovered by Mr Wallace, of the remarkable variety in
                    the form of the females, a variety which has led to their being described under
                    several specific names. In one group the females resemble the males in shape,
                    though differing greatly—as many female butterflies do—in colour. In another
                    group they differ both in colour and in the form of the hind-wings. These, Mr
                    Wallace says, are “lengthened out into large spoonshaped tails, no rudiment of
                    which is ever to be perceived in the males or in the ordinary form of the
                    females.” He also found that in shape and colouring those tailed females when on
                    the wing, closely resembled another butterfly belonging to a different section
                    of the same genus, <hi rend="italic">Papilio</hi><hi rend="italic">coön,</hi>
                    which he considers is thus mimicked by the erratic females of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Papilio</hi><hi rend="italic">memnon.</hi> Strange to say both forms of female
                    are produced from the eggs of either form. The genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parnassius,</hi> which seems peculiar to the Alpine or subalpine countries of
                    Europe and the North of Asia, belongs also to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Papilionidoe.</hi> One species, <hi rend="italic">Parnassius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">apollo</hi> (Plate XXVII., fig. 3), has semi-transparent wings,
                    spotted with black and vermilion, and is common in most of the mountain ranges
                    of Europe, where it forms a very striking object. The Brimstones <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gonepteryx),</hi> the Clouded Yellows <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Colias,</hi> Plate XXVII. fig. 4), and the White Butterflies <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pieris,</hi> Plate XXVII. fig. 6), many of which are abundant in Britain, and
                    the larvae of which in most cases make great havoc among garden vegetables,
                    belong to the family <hi rend="italic">Pieridoe.</hi> That the caterpillars of
                    this group are not fatal to the very existence of certain of our most useful
                    vegetables is due solely to the ravages of the ichneumon flies, the larvae of
                    which are parasitic upon these caterpillars, to such an extent that in every
                    hundred larvae of the common Cabbage Butterfly, there are probably not more than
                    two or three entirely free from the ichneumon fly <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Microgaster</hi><hi rend="italic">glomerata),</hi> and few caterpillars so
                    attacked ever reach maturity. The species belonging to the family <hi
                    rend="italic">Nymphalidoe</hi> have only four legs fitted for walking, the
                    anterior pair being rudimentary. They include the majority of the showy
                    butterflies of temperate regions, as the Peacock Butterfly <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Vanessa io,</hi> Plate XXVII. fig. 9), conspicuous from the “eyes” on the
                    upper surface of its wings. The brilliant colouring of the upper surface is in
                    marked contrast to the sombre hues of the under, which give it when resting on
                    the branch of a tree the appearance of a dried leaf, and so is to a considerable
                    degree protective. The Fritillaries <hi rend="italic">(Argynnis,</hi> Plate
                    XXVIII. fig. 2) have the under surfaces of the wings ornamented with shining
                    silvery disks, and, except a few tropical species, are the only butterflies
                    which have the under surface more gaily coloured than the upper. The Purple
                    Emperor <hi rend="italic">(Apatura iris)</hi> is one of the largest and most
                    striking of British species. It is a powerful flyer, frequenting the tops of the
                    highest trees, and is thus difficult of capture unless when brought near the
                    ground by the attraction of some putrid carcase. To the same family belongs <hi
                    rend="italic">Nymphalis jasius(P∖ote</hi> XXVIII. figs. 7 and 9), one of the
                    most beautiful of European species. The <hi rend="italic">Heticonidoe</hi>
                    (Plate XXVII. fig. 7) are a family of South American butterflies, so numerous
                    both in species and in individuals, and of such showy colours on both surfaces
                    of the wings, as to form, says Bates, “a feature in the physiognomy of the
                    forest compensating for the absence of flowers.” Their wings are long and
                    narrow, they fly lazily, and might thus be supposed to be specially liable to
                    the attacks of insectivorous animals. As already stated, such is not the case,
                    these insects being apparently protected by the nauseous character of their
                    juices. It is this group which is chiefly mimicked in South America, finding
                    imitators in several species of <hi rend="italic">Leptalis,</hi> a genus of
                    butterflies belonging to the family <hi rend="italic">Pieridoe,</hi> also in
                    several species of <hi rend="italic">Erycinidoe,</hi> and in no fewer than three
                    genera of day-flying moths all belonging to edible groups. The family <hi
                    rend="italic">Morpliidoe</hi> (Plate XXVIII. fig. 8) contains the largest and
                    most splendid of the South American butterflies. Their wings, often 7 inches in
                    expanse, are generally of a brilliant metallic blue, which, as the insect flies,
                    flashes in the sunlight so as to be visible, it is said, a quarter of a mile
                    off. They are found most abundantly in forest glades, through which they sail,
                    only flapping their wings at considerable intervals at a great height, “seldom,”
                    says Bates, “descending nearer the ground than 20 feet.” The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satyridoe</hi> (Plate XXIX. fig. 6) are found in every quarter of the globe,
                    and seem equally at home on open plains, in forests, and on the slopes of
                    mountains. Their larvae feed chiefly on grass, and have the almost unique habit

                    species oftenest met with in Britain. The <hi rend="italic">Hetairoe</hi> of

                    esmeralda,</hi> says Bates, “has one spot only of opaque colouring on its wings,
                    which is of a violet and rose hue; this is the only part visible when the insect
                    is flying low over dead leaves in the gloomy shades where alone it is fouud, and
                    it then looks like the wandering petal of a flower.” The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hesperidoe</hi> or Skippers (Plate XXIX. figs. 13 and 15), so called from their
                    jerky hesitating mode of flight, show, in the thickness of their bodies, the
                    only partially erect way in which they hold their wings when at rest, and the
                    enclosure of their pupa in a cocoon, a distinct approach to the other great
                    division of the <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the
                    moths.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moths.</hi> —The vast collection of species included under
                    this term form eight principal groups, divided into numerous families.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Sphingina</hi> or Sphinx Moths (Plate XXX. figs. 5 and
                    6), so called from the curious habit which the larvae have of raising the
                    anterior segments of their bodies, and remaining motionless in this position for
                    hours, thus bearing a fanciful resemblance to the fabled Sphinx, are for the
                    most part crepuscular and day-flying. They are also known in the type family as
                    Hawk Moths from the strength and velocity of their flight. In common with the
                    vast majority of moths they are furnished with aspine or strong bristle on the
                    anterior margin of the inferior wings, which being received by a process of the
                    under surface of the superior pair, maintains them in a horizontal or somewhat
                    inclined position in repose. They are also usually provided with a greatly
                    elongated tongue, with which they sip their food from flowers, and some species
                    have the power’ of producing a humming sound. To this group belong the
                    clear-winged moths, <hi rend="italic">Sesiidae</hi> (Plate XXX. fig. 12) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Aegeriidae,</hi> all day-fliers, and looking more like the bees,
                    wasps, and ichneumons which they are supposed to imitate, than moths; also the
                    family <hi rend="italic">Uraniidoe</hi> (Plate XXIX. figs. 9 and 14), the
                    species of which are among the most brilliant of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> their wings being of velvety black,
                    relieved by numerous bars of golden green, and the inferior pair prolonged into
                    an elegant tail, closely resembling the same appendage in many of the Papilios.
                    They are all day-fliers, and tlιis, together with their gay colouring and airy
                    forms, led to their being at first classed among butterflies, a position which
                    fuller acquaintance with them in the larva and pupa stages showed to be
                    untenable. The typical species occur in tropical America, where they fly with
                    amazing rapidity and perform annual migrations. The Death’s-Head Moth <hi
                    rend="italic">{Aclιerontia atropos)</hi> is the largest of European Sphinges,
                    and owing to the peculiar squeaking sound which it utters when alarmed, the
                    death’s-head-like markings on the upper surface of its thorax, and its sudden
                    appearance in districts where it may not have been noticed for years, it has for
                    centuries been an object of superstitious dread to the uneducated. Its
                    beautifully marked larvae feed upon the leaves of the potato, and bury
                    themselves in the ground preparatory to undergoing metamorphosis. The
                    Death’s-Head is fond of honey, in search of which its instinct leads it to enter
                    hives, the inmates of which do not attempt to drive it out by means of their
                    stings, but make every endeavour to raise a waxen wall between the moth and
                    their food stores. It is widely distributed over Europe, Asia, and Africa, while
                    closely allied, but still larger forms occur in Australia.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Bombycina</hi> (Plate XXX. figs. 14, 20-25) are
                    nocturnal moths, with the organs of the mouth in many cases so atrophied as to
                    be unfit for use. These live but a few days, during which the male seeks the
                    female and the latter deposits her eggs. They include the silkworm moths, so
                    important to man from the silken cocoons in which they enclose their pupae. The
                    silk-producing species are very numerous, but only a few of them have as yet
                    been turned to useful account. The chief of these are the common Silkworm Moth
                    <hi rend="italic">{Bombyx mori),</hi> a native of China, where its cocoons
                    appear to have been utilized by man from time immemorial. During the 6th century
                    it was introduced into Europe, where it soon flourished wherever the mulberry
                    tree, the leaves of which are the sole food of the silkworm, abounded. On these
                    the larvae feed for thirty days, after which they begin to spin an oval cocoon
                    of a close tissue of the finest silk, usually of a golden yellow colour, but
                    sometimes white, and which when unravelled forms a continuous thread 1100 yards
                    long. In order tn obtain a fresh supply of eggs, the silkworm breeder allows a
                    few of the pupae to develop into moths; and such is the change wrought upon this
                    species by centuries of domestication that, it is said, they rarely if ever
                    attempt to use their wings. They pair, and the female at once settles on the
                    leaves provided for her, where she deposits her eggs and dies. The Aιτindy
                    Silkworm <hi rend="italic">{Attacus cynthid),</hi> so called from the native
                    name of the castor-oil plant on which its larvae feed, is a native of India. The
                    cocoon is very large, but the thread is too fine to be readily wound off, and it
                    is therefore usually carded, the yarn being woven into a coarse silk cloth of
                    great durability. The Tusseh or Tussur Moth <hi rend="italic">{Antheroea
                    mylitta)</hi> is also a native of Upper India, occurring abundantly in the
                    jungles, where its cocoons, so concealed by the leaves as only to be detected by
                    the presence of the dung of the larvae on the ground, are collected. The Tusseh
                    silk is darker and coarser than that of the common silkworm, but resembles it in
                    being readily wound off. In China there are two oak silkworms from which a
                    coarse silk is obtained, used for the clothing of the Chinese poorer classes;
                    but the most important of the oak-feeding species is the Yama-maï <hi
                    rend="italic">{Antheroea yama-mdi)</hi> of Japan, the silk produced from which
                    was, at least until lately, reserved for the use of the Japanese imperial
                    family. This moth is a beautiful insect, about 6 inches across the wings, of a
                    brilliant golden-yellow colour, with a transparent spot or “eye” near the centre
                    of each wing. Its cocoon is nearly as large as a pigeon’s egg, and is of a
                    silvery white within, although externally of a yellowish green. In 1861 it was
                    introduced into France, where it now flourishes, and there is good reason to
                    believe, from the nature of its food and its hardiness, that the Yama-maï may
                    yet be profitably reared in Great Britain. <hi rend="italic">Tropoea luna,</hi>
                    which feeds upon the liquidambar trees in the southern parts of the United
                    States, with wings of a lemon colour, each with a “transparent eye,” and the
                    hind pair prolonged into an elegant tail, is one of the loveliest species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bombycina.</hi> Its cocoon is formed of the finest silk. Other
                    well-known forms are the Eggars <hi rend="italic">{Lasiocampa,</hi> Plate XXX.
                    fig. 26); the Processional Moth <hi rend="italic">{Cηethocampa
                    processioned),</hi> so. called from the habit its caterpillars have of
                    congregating in companies of several hundreds, and of marching to their
                    feeding-grounds in regular columns; the Vapourers <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Orgyia,</hi> Plate XXXI. figs. 2, 3, 4), whose females being almost wingless
                    deposit their eggs on the outside of their cocoons, and the Psyches <hi
                    rend="italic">{Psychidae),</hi> whose females in many cases have neither wings,
                    legs, nor antennae, and never leave the tubes in which they have passed the
                    larva and pupa stages.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Noctuina</hi> (Plate XXXI. figs. 9 and 14) form an
                    exceedingly large group of nocturnal moths, although even here there are a few
                    exceptional instances of day-flying species. They are distinguished by their
                    stout bodies and narrow forewings, under which when reposing they conceal the
                    inferior and in many cases more brightly-coloured pair. The majority of the
                    species are small and dull in their colours, while a few are among the largest
                    of known insects—the Great Owl Moth of Brazil <hi rend="italic">{Erebus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">strix)</hi> measuring nearly a foot from tip to tip of its
                    wings.</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Geometriηa</hi> (Plate XXXI. figs. 13 and 151 in the <pb

                    usual number being ten, and in moving these are brought close up to the last
                    pair of thoracic limbs, thus giving the caterpillar a looped appearance, hence
                    the term “loopers” usually applied to these moths; they then hold on by the
                    prolegs, and releasing those in front carry the body forward until the arched
                    appearance is gone. They thus move by an alternate process of looping and
                    straightening their bodies. The larvae of Geometers have also the curious habit
                    of fixing themselves by their hind feet to the branch of a shrub, throwing the
                    remainder of their bodies out, and remaining motionless in this position for
                    hours, thus exhibiting an enormous amount of muscular energy. They are all
                    protectively coloured, and in the attitude just described so resemble the
                    surrounding twigs as to be readily mistaken for them. Geometers are to be found
                    in sunshine and by night, in midsummer and at midwinter, the Early Moth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hybernia rupicapraria)</hi> being caught in January.</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">Pyralidina</hi> (Plate XXXI. figs. 17, 19, 20, 23) are a
                    group of small moths readily distinguished by their long slender bodies and
                    large forewings. One of these, <hi rend="italic">Pyralis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vitis,</hi> is very destructive to vines, and another, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyralis fαrinalis,</hi> feeds upon meal and flour. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gallerídae,</hi> a family of Pyralidine moths, deposit their eggs in the hives
                    of bees, where the caterpillars, enclosed in silken cases, devour the wax; but
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hydrocampidoe</hi> (Plate XXXI. fig. 12), which also
                    belong to this section, are probably the most wonderful of all Lepidopterous
                    insects, their larvae being aquatic, living and feeding in the water, and many
                    of them breathing by gills similar to those of caddisworms.</p>
                <p>6. The <hi rend="italic">Tortriciηa</hi> (Plate XXXI. fig. 16) include a great
                    number of small moths exceedingly injurious to orchard and other trees. They are
                    known as “leaf-rollers” from the habit which most of their larvae have of
                    rolling up the leaves on whicli. they feed, and thus forming a shelter for
                    themselves. The Green Tortrix <hi rend="italic">(Tortrix virùlana)</hi> occurs
                    in the larva state on the oak, to which it often does great injury by stripping
                    the trees of their leaves in the month of J une. Throughout Southern Europe the
                    vine is liable to the ravages of another species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oenectra</hi><hi rend="italic">pillariana,</hi> while few of our fruit trees
                    are exempt from the occasional attacks of some species or other of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Carpocay)sidoe,</hi> the fruit-eating family of this group.</p>
                <p>7. The <hi rend="italic">Tiηeiηa</hi> (Plate XXXI. figs. 21, 24, 25) contain the
                    smallest of the’ <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera,</hi> and are best known as
                    clothes moths. These clothe themselves at our expense in the warmest woollen
                    garments, which they traverse in all directions, leaving behind a gnawed and
                    worn-out path, so thin and bare as to yield to the slightest pressure. They also
                    destroy furs, hair, feathers, and many other articles of domestic economy, and
                    are the exterminating pests of zoological museums. To them we no doubt owe the
                    destruction of the most perfect specimen of the Dodo known, which was once
                    preserved in the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford. By means of their maxillae these
                    little larvae shear down the surface of various substances, and uniting the
                    particles by means of their glutinous silk, they thus form protecting
                    habitations, which partake of the nature of the woollen or other stuffs on which
                    the foresight of their parents has placed them. When they themselves increase in
                    bulk, so as to find their abodes as inconvenient as a strait waistcoat, they
                    split them down the middle, and interpose a piece proportioned, no doubt, to
                    their expected as well as actual increase. They add to the length also by fresh
                    materials to the anterior end. The <hi rend="italic">Tinea granella</hi> lives
                    in granaries, where it forms an abode for itself by enveloping several grains in
                    a silken web. These it afterwards eats.</p>
                <p>8. The insects of the remaining group, <hi rend="italic">Pterop&gt;hοrma,</hi>
                    are remarkable from the peculiar conformation of their wings. Each of these
                    organs is split longitudinally into several branches, all of them delicately
                    fringed. In the genus <hi rend="italic">Pterophora</hi> (Plate XXXI. fig. 26)
                    the fore wings are divided into two, and the hind wings into three branches;
                    while in <hi rend="italic">Orneodes</hi> (Plate XXXI. fig. 27) each wing is
                    split into six, and these when the insect is at rest are folded together after
                    the manner of a fan.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">of Lepidopterλ.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">—</hi> Butterflies
                    affect special localities with which it is well for the collector to make
                    himself acquainted. A suitable hunting ground having been selected, the
                    following apparatus is necessary :—a bag-net made of gauze or some equally light
                    material, with a wooden or metal ring and a handle, which may also be used as a
                    walking-stick, for capturing the specimens; pill boxes into which to transfer
                    them from the net; and a wide-mouthed glass stoppered bottle, into which about
                    forty leaves of the common laurel, bruised and cut into shreds, have been
                    previously put. Exposure for a short time to the fumes arising from these shreds
                    will cause the death of the inmates of the pill boxes. They may also be readily
                    killed by pressing the thumb-nail against their thorax. For “setting”
                    Lepidoptera, which if possible should be done before the insect stiffens,
                    entomological pins are required, and these should be gilt in order to prevent
                    the appearance of <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> verdigris at the point where the
                    pin enters the specimen; also a setting-board, with an upper layer of cork, and
                    having a groove in which to lay the body of the insect; and small triangular
                    strips of cardboard known as braces with which to set the wings. The process of
                    drying should not be artificially hastened, as by exposure to heat the wings are
                    certain to warp and the body to shrivel. Should the insect have stiffened before
                    setting, or lιave been badly set, it can readily be softened again by placing
                    it, as is done in the British Museum, in a shallow earthen vessel containing a
                    layer of damp sand, and covering it with a close-fitting lid until sufficiently
                    soft for resetting. Day-flying moths must be sought for in much the same way as
                    butterflies, while nocturnal species may be regularly met with on the sallow,
                    the honeysuckle, the lime-tree, and the ivy, when these are in flower; and when
                    these and similar natural sources fail, the moth-collector has in <hi
                    rend="italic">sugar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">light</hi> two admirable devices
                    for securing specimens. A quantity of the coarsest brown sugar reduced by the
                    addition of beer and water to a syrup, and to which a little rum is added as
                    required, is applied with a brush to the sheltered aspect of the trunks of trees
                    on the outskirts of woods or in the neighbourhood of heaths. At nightfall the
                    collector, lamp in hand, visits the sugared locality, and if the evening be
                    favourable, that is, if it be warm and dull, he is almost certain to have his
                    pains rewarded by an abundance of specimens, chiefly belonging to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Noctuina.</hi> Moths, it is well known, are readily attracted by
                    light, and in a country or suburban house, in the vicinity of trees, a lamp
                    placed outside an open window, which is sheltered from the wind, with another
                    lamp in the interior of the room, will, if the night be close and dark, be
                    almost certain to attract numbers of moths. Mr Wallace adopted this plan while
                    collecting in Borneo, and he states that in twenty-six nights he collected 1386
                    moths, “but that more than 800 of these were collected on four very wet and dark
                    nights.” In towns moths may often be caught flying about lamp-posts. In
                    preserving the larger moths, especially the <hi rend="italic">Sphingina,</hi> it
                    is necessary to slit up their stout bodies and remove the contents, replacing
                    these with wadding or paper. The drawers of cabinets containing <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepidοptcra</hi> should be provided with a layer of cork and then
                    papered, with a small bag of camphor attached to a corner to ward off the
                    attacks of the dust-lice, or “mites” as they arc usually, but incorrectly,
                    called, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n667/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0667-0598"/> presence of which is made known by the appearance
                    of a fine powder lying underneath the infected specimens. Insects in this
                    condition should be thoroughly soaked in a solution of spirits of wine and
                    camphor. The appearance of grease on thick-bodied moths is by no means uncommon,
                    but may be removed by dipping the insect in spirits of turpentine and embedding
                    it in calcined magnesia till dry. The collector should be careful to keep a
                    register of all his specimens, giving the localities where they were found, and
                    recording any observations that may have been made at the time on their food,
                    habits, &amp;c. A small ticket attached to the pin of each specimen, and bearing
                    its number in the register, is the best way of connecting the specimens in the
                    cabinet with the entries in the register <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> Gi.)</p>
