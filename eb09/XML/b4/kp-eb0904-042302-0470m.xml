                    royal free town of the kingdom of Hungary, is situated in 47° 29' 10" N. lat.
                    and 19° 2' 55" E. long., on the right bank of the Danube, opposite the capital
                    Pesth, with which it has been united since 1849 by a suspension bridge of much
                    beauty, 1227 feet long and 39 feet wide. The nucleus of the town is the
                    “fortress,” which occupies an oblong elevation of porphyry rock, not unlike the
                    Acropolis of Athens. It contains the royal palace, the mansions of Counts
                    Sandor, Teleki, and Erdödy, the residence of the governor in command, the
                    arsenal, and several buildings for official purposes. The palace includes the
                    court church—where the regalia of Hungary are preserved, a picture gallery, and
                    a library. Around this central portion there have grown up various suburbs,
                    known respectively as the Wasserstadt, the Landstrasse, the Neustift, the
                    Christinenstadt, and the Taban or Rascian town, the last of which derives its
                    name from its Servian inhabitants, who are mainly vineyard owners. In the
                    Wasserstadt are the church of St Anne and Elizabeth, and the military hospital;
                    in Christinenstadt, the Horvath gardens, with the summer theatre, and the large
                    mansionhouse of Count Caracsonyi; and in Old Buda are the royal barracks, part
                    of which was once the monastery of <pb break="no"

                    fifteen churches, as well as several convents, and a Jewish synagogue. The
                    educational establishments include a gymnasium of the highest class, an upper
                    commercial school, five normal institutions, a school of design, a school of
                    music, and about sixteen schools of lower grade. There is also an observatory in
                    the town. Buda has long been celebrated for its mineral baths, which are five in
                    number. The Bruckbad and the Kaiserbadwere both founded by the Turks, and the
                    buildings retain traces of Turkish occupation. The temperature of the water is
                    about 118° Fahr. The town is commanded by the eminences known as the Spiessberg
                    or Nap Hegy, and the Blocksberg or Gellert Hegy, the latter of which is crowned
                    by a citadel. The industry of Buda comprises the making of cannon,
                    type-founding, silk-weaving, coach-building, and the manufacture of majolica,
                    copper wares, and gunpowder. A somewhat active trade is carried on in the red
                    wine produced in the neighbouring vineyards, and Old Buda is the seat of a good
                    deal of river traffic. The Danube Steam-Navigation Company have a considerable
                    establishment there, in which a number of their vessels are built. In 1869 the
                    population of the commune was 53,988. Old Buda was known to the Romans for its
                    mineral springs; but the modern town dates only from the Middle Ages. In 1247
                    King Bela built a castle, which was originally regarded as belonging to Pesth;
                    but the town which gradually gathered round it soon acquired an independent
                    importance. In 1526 it was captured by the Turks, and in their hands became a
                    place of pilgrimage, as well as an important military post. In 1686 it was
                    wrested from them by Charles of Lorraine. During the Hungarian wars of the
                    present century it played a distinguished part. In January 1849 the fortress was
                    seized by the Austrian general Windischgrätz; but in May it was taken by storm
                    by the Hungarians under Gυrgey. On their departure the Russians took possession,
                    but shortly afterwards handed the place over to the Austrian forces.</p>
