                    died at Paris on the 15th April 1788. His father, Μ. Leclerc de Buffon, was
                    councillor of the Burgundian parliament, and his mother, Anne Christine Marlin,
                    appears to have possessed considerable natural gifts. Buffon was the eldest of
                    five children, and does not seem to have been in any way a precocious child. On
                    the contrary, he seems from his earliest years to have been characterized more
                    especially by great perseverance, patience, knowledge of the value of time, and
                    exceptional powers of steady application and protracted labour. He was
                    originally destined to his father’s profession, and studied law at the college
                    of Jesuits at Dijon; but he soon exhibited a marked predilection for the study
                    of the physical sciences, and more particularly for mathematics. Whilst at Dijou
                    he made the acquaintance of Lord Kingston, a young Englishman, who was at the
                    time staying there along with his tutor, a man of ability and discernment. In
                    this agreeable companionship, Buffon travelled through Italy, being then
                    nineteen years of age. Returning to France, he commenced to study at Angers,
                    still in company with Lord Kingston; but having quarrelled with a young
                    Englishman at play, and subsequently wounded him, he was compelled to leave this
                    town. He thereupon removed to Paris, and during his sojourn in the capital he
                    translated Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Fluxions</hi> and Hales’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Vegetable Statics,</hi> which he subsequently presented to the
                    Academy of Sciences. From Paris he proceeded to England, where he remained three
                    months; but his travels seem to have ended here. At twenty-five years of age he
                    succeeded to a considerable property, inherited from his mother, and from this
                    time onward his life was a completely independent one, and he was enabled to
                    devote himself entirely to his scientific pursuits. He returned now to France,
                    and lived partly at Montbard and partly at Paris.</p>
                <p>Though loving pleasure, and not keeping himself free from the prevalent vices of
                    the age in which he lived, Buffon spent the remainder of his life in regular
                    scientific labour, employing an amanuensis, and thus securing a permanent record
                    of his work. At first he directed his attention more especially to mathematics,
                    physics, and agriculture, and his chief original papers are connected with these
                    subjects. In the spring of 1739 he was elected a member of the Academy of
                    Sciences; and at a later period of the same year he was appointed keeper of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Jar din du Roi</hi> and of the Royal Museum. This appears to
                    have finally determined him to devote himself to the biological sciences in
                    particular, and he commenced to collect materials for his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Natural History.</hi> In the preparation of this voluminous work, he associated
                    with himself Daubenton, to whom the descriptive and anatomical portions of the
                    treatise were entrusted, and the first three volumes made their appearance in
                    the year 1749. In the year 1752 (not in 1743 or 1760, as sometimes stated), he
                    married Marie Françoise de Saint-Belin. He seems to have been fondly attached to
                    her, and felt deeply her death, which took place at Montbard in 1769. The
                    remainder of Buffon’s life, as a private individual, presents nothing of special
                    interest. He belonged to a very long-lived race, his father having attained the
                    age of ninety-three, and his grandfather eighty-seven years. He died himself at
                    the age of eighty-one, of vesical calculus, having refused to allow of any
                    operation for his relief. He left one son, George Louis-Marie Leclerc, who was
                    an officer in the French army, and who died by the guillotine, at the age of
                    thirty, on the 10th July 1793 (22 Messidor, An II.), having espoused the party
                    of the duke of Orleans.</p>

                <p>Buffoù was a member of the French Academy, perpetual treasurer of the Academy of
                    Sciences, Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and member of the Academies of
                    Berlin, St Petersburg, Dijon, and of most of the learned societies then existing
                    in Europe. Of handsome person and noble presence, endowed with many of the
                    external gifts of nature, and rejoicing in the social advantages of high rank
                    and large possessions, he is mainly known by his published scientific writings.
                    Without being a profound original investigator, in the modern sense of this
                    term, Buffon possessed considerable power of generalization, along with the art
                    of expressing his ideas in a clear and generally attractive form. His chief
                    defects as a scientific writer are, that he was given to excessive and hasty
                    generalization, so that his hypotheses, however seemingly brilliant, are often
                    destitute of any sufficient basis in observed facts, whilst his literary style
                    is not unfrequently theatrical and turgid, and a great want of method and order
                    is commonly observable in his writings.</p>
                <p>His great work is the <hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle, générale et
                    particulière;</hi> and it can undoubtedly claim the merit of having been the
                    first work to present the previously isolated and apparently disconnected facts
                    of natural history in a popular and generally intelligible form. The sensation
                    which was made by its appearance in successive parts was very great, and it
                    certainly effected much good in its time by generally diffusing a taste for the
                    study of nature. For a work so vast, however—aiming, as it did, at being little
                    less than a general encyclopaedia of the sciences,—Buffon’s capacities may,
                    without disparagement, be said to have been insufficient, as is shown by the
                    great weakness of parts of the work (such as that relating to mineralogy). The
                    <hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle</hi> passed through several editions, and
                    was translated into various languages. The edition most highly prized by
                    collectors, on account of the beauty of its plates, is the first, which was
                    published in Paris (1749-1804) in forty-four quarto volumes, the publication
                    extending over more than fifty years. In the preparation of the first fifteen
                    volumes of this edition (1749-67) Buffon was assisted by Daubenton,' and
                    subsequently by Guéneau de Montbéliard, the Abbé Bexon, and Sonnini de
                    Manon-court. The following seven volumes form a supplement to the preceding, and
                    appeared in 1774-89. These were succeeded by nine volumes on the Birds
                    (1770-83), and these were followed by five volumes on Minerals (1783-88). The
                    remaining eight volumes, which complete this edition, appeared after Buffon’s
                    death, and comprise Reptiles, Fishes, and Cetaceans. They were executed by
                    Lacépède, and were published in successive volumes between 1788 and 1804. A
                    second edition was commenced in 1774 and completed in 1804, in thirty-six
                    volumes quarto. It is in most respects similar to the first edition, except that
                    the anatomical descriptions are suppressed, and the supplement recast. Of the
                    remaining editions of Buffon, the best is that which was commenced under the
                    editorship of Lamouroux, and completed under that of Desmarets, in forty volumes
                    octavo (1824-32). It is the only modern edition in which the anatomical
                    descriptions of Daubenton are preserved. Though not without his
                    enemies—scientific and clerical—Buffon had many warm friends, and his death was
                    marked by the delivery of highly laudatory addressess, by Condorcet at the
                    Academy of Sciences, Vicq-d’Azir at the Académie Française, and Bressonet before
                    the Society of Agriculture. Extravagantly belauded by some, and vehemently
                    attacked by others, we can recognize his merits without blinding ourselves to
                    his defects.</p>
                <p>This brief notice of his life may be fitly closed by the following quotation from
                    Cuvier, in which the great French naturalist, whilst rejecting some speculations
                    which recent science has generally accepted as probable, ascribes to Buffon the
                    honour of being the first to clearly apprehend what is now admitted as the true
                    principle of guidance in investigating the order of the universe :—“It is
                    impossible to defend, in all their details, either the first or the second of
                    Buffon’s theories of the earth. This comet which strikes off portions of the
                    sun, these vitrified and incandescent planets which refrigerate by degrees, some
                    more rapidly than others, those organized beings which appear successively on
                    the surface of the planets, as their temperature becomes sufficiently lowered,
                    can only be regarded as flights of fancy. But Buffon has not less the merit of
                    having been the first to point out clearly that the actual condition of the
                    globe is the result of a succession of changes, of which we can find the
                    evidences to-day; and it is he who first drew the observation of all
                    investigatore to the phenomena by which these changes can be unravelled.” <hi
