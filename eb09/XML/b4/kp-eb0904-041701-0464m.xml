                    of</hi></label> (1592- 1628), born August 20, 1592, was a younger son of Sir
                    George Villiers of Brooksby. His mother, who was left a widow early, educated
                    him for a courtier’s life, and the lad, being by nature little studious and
                    contemplative, took kindly to the training. He could dance well, fence well, and
                    talk a little French, when in August 1614 he was brought before the king’s
                    notice, in the hope that he would take a fancy to him.</p>
                <p>The moment was favourable. Since Salisbury’s death James had taken the business
                    of government upon himself. But he wanted some one who would chat with him, and
                    amuse him, and would also fill the office of private secretary, and save him
                    from the trouble of laying No to importunate suitors. It would be an additional
                    satisfaction if he could train the youth whom he might select in those arts of
                    statesmanship of which he believed himself to be a perfect master. His first
                    choice had not proved a happy one. Robert Carr, who had lately become earl of
                    Somerset, had had his head turned by his elevation. He had grown peevish toward
                    his master, and had placed himself at the head of the party which was working
                    for a close alliance with Spain.</p>
                <p>The appearance of Villiers, beaming with animal spirits and good humour, was
                    therefore welcomed by all who had an interest in opposing the designs of Spain.
                    With such powerful backing Villiers prospered at court, became a gentleman of
                    the bed-chamber, was knighted, and received a pension of £1000 a year. For some
                    little time, however, Somerset’s pre-eminence was maintained. But the charge of
                    murder brought against him completed his ruin, and Villiers at once stepped into
                    the place which he had vacated. In August 1616 he was raised to the peerage as
                    Viscount Villiers. In January 1617 he became earl of Buckingham. In January 1618
                    he was a marquis by the same title. Estates to the value of some £15,000 a year
                    were settled on him. With the exception of the earl of Pembroke he was the
                    richest nobleman in England.</p>
                <p>Those who expected him to give his support to the antiSpanish party were at first
                    doomed to disappointment. As yet he was no politician, and he contented himself
                    with carrying out his master’s orders, whatever they were. In his personal
                    relations he was kindly and jovial towards all who did not thwart his wishes.
                    But James had taught him to consider that the patronage of England was in his
                    hands, and he took good care that no man should receive promotion of any kind
                    who did not in one way or another pay court to him. As far as can be
                    ascertained, he cared less for money than for the gratification of his vanity.
                    But he had not merely himself to consider. His numerous kinsfolk were to be
                    enriched by marriage, if in no other way, and Bacon, the great philosopher and
                    statesman, was all but thrust from office, because he had opposed a marriage
                    suggested for one of Buckingham’s brothers, whilst Cranfield, the first
                    financier of the day, was kept from the Treasury till he would forsake the woman
                    whom he loved, to marry a penniless cousin of the favourite.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile Buckingham had found an appropriate position in the mastership
                    of the horse, which gave him control over the royal stables. In January 1619
                    James made him lord high admiral of England, hoping that the ardent, energetic
                    youth would impart something of his own fire to those who were intrusted with
                    the oversight of that fleet which had been almost ruined by the peculation and
                    carelessness of the officials. Something of this, no doubt, was realized under
                    Buckingham’s eye. But he himself never pretended to the virtues of an
                    administrator, and he was too ready to fill up appointments with men who
                    flattered him, and too reluctant to dismiss them, if they served their country
                    ill, to effect any permanent change for the better.</p>
                <p>It was about this time that he first took an independent part in politics. All
                    England was talking of the revolution in Bohemia in the year before, and men’s
                    sympathy with the Continental Protestants was increased when it was known that
                    James’s son-in-law had accepted the crown of Bohemia, and that in the summer of
                    1620 a Spanish force was preparing to invade the Palatinate. Buckingham at first
                    had thrown himself into the popular movement. Before the summer of 1620 was at
                    end he had swung round, and was in close agreement with Gondomar, the Spanish
                    ambassador. He had now married Lady Catherine Manners, the daughter of the earl
                    of Rutland, who was at heart a Roman Catholic, though she outwardly conformed to
                    the English Church, and this alliance may have had something to do with the
                    change.</p>
                <p>Buckingham’s mistakes were owing mainly to his levity. If he passed briskly from
                    one camp to the other, an impartial observer might usually detect some personal
                    motive at the bottom. But it is hardly probable that he was himself conscious of
                    anything of the sort. When he was in reality acting under the influence of
                    vanity or passion it was easy for him to persuade himself that he was doing his
                    duty ito his country.</p>
                <p>The Parliament which met in 1621 broke out into a loud outcry against the system
                    of monopolies, from which Buckingham’s brothers and dependants had drawn a
                    profit, which was believed to be greater than it really was. At first he pleaded
                    for a dissolution. But he was persuaded that it would be a wiser course to offer
                    to put himself at the head of the movement, and when he came forward to say that
                    he would rather sacrifice his brother than countenance wrong doing, he only gave
                    utterance to those sentiments of patriotism which he really felt, when
                    patriotism did not call upon him to sacrifice his own wishes. When, at a later
                    period of the session, Bacon’s case was brought forward, he made no attempt to
                    meet the attack directly, but he did his best to shield the falling chancellor
                    from the extreme penalties demanded by his adversaries. It was not long before
                    he showed on how shallow a basis impulsive gener-ositv rests. Bacon clung, after
                    his fall, to the possession of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n465/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0465-0418"/> York House, the home of his childhood. Buckingham
                    desired to purchase it, and he stood in the way of the king’s favour to the
                    great philosopher till he had consented to sell him the house.</p>
                <p>In the winter of 1621, and the succeeding year, Buckingham was entirely in
                    Gondomar’s hands; and it was only with some difficulty that in May 1622 Laud
                    argued him out of a resolution to declare himself a Roman Catholic. In December
                    1621 he actively supported the dissolution of Parliament, and there can be
                    little doubt that when the Spanish ambassador left England the following May, he
                    had come to an understanding with Buckingham that the Prince of Wales should
                    visit Madrid the next year, on which occasion the Spanish Court hoped to effect
                    his conversion to the Roman Catholic Church before giving him the hand of the
                    Infanta Maria. By this time Buckingham had gained over Charles an influence
                    which he never lost; and when he carried him in February 1623 to Madrid it was
                    with the hope of effecting a great political, object. The Palatinate had
                    gradually fallen into the possession of Spain and of the Catholic League, and
                    the two young men fondly expected that the grave statesmen of the Spanish
                    monarchy would break with their co-religionists in Germany in order to present
                    the Palatinate as a marriage gift to Charles.</p>
                <p>It was not long before it became plain to Buckingham that the Palatinate was not
                    to be gained at Madrid. From that time he urged the prince to return. Charles
                    was not to be persuaded so soon to relinquish the hope of carrying his bride
                    home with him to England. But at last his eyes were opened, and when the two
                    young men sailed together from Santander in September, it was with the final
                    resolution to break entirely with Spain.</p>
                <p>James had gratified his favourite in his absence by raising him to the highest
                    title known in the English peerage. But the splendour which gathered round the
                    new duke was owing to another source than James’s favour. He had put himself at
                    the head of the popular movement against Spain, and when James, acknowledging
                    sorely against his will that the Palatinate could only be recovered by force,
                    summoned the Parliament which met in February 1624, Buckingham, with the help of
                    the heir apparent, took up an independent political position. James was half
                    driven, half persuaded to declare all negotiations with Spain at an end. For the
                    moment Buckingham was the most popular man in England.</p>
                <p>It was easier to overthrow one policy than to construct another. The Commons
                    would have been content with sending some assistance to the Dutch, and with
                    entering upon a privateering war with Spain. James, whose object was to regain
                    the Palatinate, believed this could only be accomplished by a Continental
                    alliance, in which France took part. As soon as Parliament was prorogued,
                    negotiations were opened for a marriage between Charles and the sister of Lewis
                    XIII., Henrietta Maria. But a difficulty arose. James and Charles had engaged to
                    the Commons that there should be no concessions to the English Catholics, and
                    Lewis would not hear of the marriage unless very large concessions were made.
                    Buckingham, impatient to begin the war as soon as possible, persuaded Charles,
                    and the two together persuaded James to throw over the promises to the Commons,
                    and to accept the French terms. It was no longer possible to summon Parliament
                    to vote supplies for the war till the marriage had been completed, when
                    remonstrances to its conditions would be useless.</p>
                <p>Buckingham, for Buckingham was now virtually the ruler of England, had thus to
                    commence war without money. He prepared to throw 12,000 Englishmen, under a
                    German adventurer, Count Mansfeld, through France into the Palatinate. The
                    French insisted that he should march through Holland. It mattered little which
                    way he took. Without provisions, and without money to buy them, the wretched
                    troops sickened and died in the winter frosts. Buckingham’s first military
                    enterprise ended in disastrous failure.</p>
                <p>Buckingham had many other schemes in his teeming brain. He had offered to send
                    aid to Christian IV., king of Denmark, who was proposing to make war in Germany,
                    and had also a plan for sending an English fleet to attack Genoa the ally of
                    Spain, and a plan for sending an English fleet to attack Spain itself.</p>
                <p>Before these schemes could be carried into operation James died on March 27,
                    1625. The new king and Buckingham were at one in their aims and objects. Both
                    were anxious to distinguish themselves by the chastisement of Spain, and the
                    recovery of the Palatinate. Both were young and inexperienced. But Charles,
                    obstinate when his mind was made up, was sluggish in action and without
                    fertility in ideas, and he had long submitted his mind to the versatile and
                    brilliant favourite, who was never at a loss what to do next, and who unrolled
                    before his eyes visions of endless possibilities in the future. Buckingham was
                    sent over to Paris to urge upon the French Court the importance of converting
                    its alliance into active co-operation.</p>
                <p>There was a difficulty in the way. The Huguenots of Rochelle were in rebellion,
                    and James had promised the aid of English ships to suppress that rebellion.
                    Buckingham, who seems at first to have consented to the scheme, was anxious to
                    mediate peace between the king of France and his subjects, which would set him
                    free from foreign enterprises, and save Charles from compromising himself with
                    his Parliament by the appearance of English ships in an attack upon Protestants.
                    When he returned his main demands were refused, but hopes were given him that
                    peace would be made with the Huguenots. On his way through France he had the
                    insolence to make love to the Queen of France. Unless the testimony of his
                    warmest admirers is false, he had convinced himself by a sad experience that
                    women found it difficult to resist his seductive tongue and his handsome
                    face.</p>
                <p>Soon after his return Parliament was opened. It would have been hard for Charles
                    to pass through the session with credit. Under Buckingham’s guidance he had
                    entered into engagements involving an enormous expenditure, and these
                    engagements involved a war on the Continent, which had never been popular in the
                    House of Commons. The Commons, too, suspected the marriage treaty contained
                    engagements of which they disapproved. They asked for the full execution of the
                    laws against the Catholics, and voted but little money in return. Charles
                    adjourned then to Oxford, that he might plead with them more persuasively.
                    Before they met there, the English ships had found their way into the hands of
                    the French, to be used against Rochelle. The Commons met in an ill-humour. They
                    had no confidence in Buckingham, and they asked that persons whom they could
                    trust should be admitted to the king’s council before they would vote a penny.
                    Charles stood by his minister, and on August 12 he dissolved his first
                    Parliament.</p>
                <p>Buckingham and his master set themselves to work to conquer public opinion. On
                    the one hand, they threw over their engagements to France on behalf of the
                    English Catholics. On the other hand they sent out a large fleet to attack
                    Cadiz, and to seize the Spanish treasure-ships. Buckingham went to the Hague to
                    raise an immediate supply by pawning the crown jewels, to place England at the
                    head of a great Protestant alliance, and to enter into fresh obligations to
                    furnish money to the king of Denmark. It all ended in failure. The fleet
                    returned from Cadiz, having effected nothing. The crown jewels produced but a
                    small sum, and the money for the king of Denmark could only be raised by an
                    appeal to Parliament. In the meanwhile the king of France was deeply offended by
                    the treatment<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n466/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0466-0419"/> of the Catholics, and by the seizure of French
                    vessels on the ground that they were engaged in carrying goods for Spain.</p>
                <p>When Charles’s second Parliament met on February 6, 1626, it was not long before,
                    under Eliot’s guidance, it asked for Buckingham’s punishment. He was impeached
                    before the House of Lords on a long string of charges. Many of these charges
                    were exaggerated, and some were untrue. But as long as Charles refused to listen
                    to the complaints of his minister’s incompetency, the only way in which the
                    Commons could reach him was by bringing criminal charges against him. Charles
                    dissolved his second Parliament as he had dissolved his first.</p>
                <p>To find money was the great difficulty. Recourse was had to a forced loan, and
                    men were thrown into prison for refusing to pay it. There had been disasters to
                    Charles’s allies in Germany, and a French war was impending in addition to the
                    Spanish one. The French were roused to reprisals by Charles’s persistence in
                    seizing French vessels. Unwilling to leave Rochelle open to the entrance of an
                    English fleet, Richelieu laid siege to that stronghold of the French Huguenots.
                    On June 27, 1627, Buckingham sailed from Portsmouth at the head of a numerous
                    fleet, and a considerable land force, to relieve the besieged city.</p>
                <p>His first enterprise was the siege of the fort of St Martin’s, on the Isle of
                    Rhé. The ground was hard, and the siege operations were converted into a
                    blockade. On September 27, the defenders of the fort announced their readiness
                    to surrender the next morning. In the night a fresh gale brought over a flotilla
                    of French provision boats, which dashed through the English blockading squadron.
                    The fort was provisioned for two months more. Buckingham resolved to struggle
                    on, and sent for reinforcements from England. Charles would gladly have answered
                    to his call. But England had long since ceased to care for the war. There was no
                    money in the exchequer, no enthusiasm in the nation to supply the want. Before
                    the reinforcements could arrive the French had thrown a superior force upon the
                    islaud, and Buckingham was driven to retreat with heavy loss.</p>
                <p>His spirits were as buoyant as ever. Ill luck, or the misconduct of others, was
                    the cause of his failure. He had new plans for carrying on the war. But the
                    Parliament which met on March 17, 1628, was resolved to exact from the king an
                    obligation to refrain from encroaching for the future on the liberties of his
                    subjects.</p>
                <p>In the parliamentary battle, which ended in the concession of the Petition of
                    Right, Buckingham took an active share as a member of the House of Lords. He
                    resisted as long as it was possible to resist the demand of the Commons, that
                    the king should abandon his claim to imprison without showing cause. When the
                    first unsatisfactory answer to the petition was made by the king on June 2, the
                    Commons suspected, probably with truth, that it had been dictated by Buckingham.
                    They prepared a remonstrance on the state of the nation, and Coke at last named
                    the duke as the cause of all the misfortunes that had occurred. Though on June 7
                    the king granted a Satisfactory answer to the petition, the Commons proceeded
                    with their remonstrance, and on June 11 they informed the king that Buckingham
                    had <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> so abused his powers,” that it was no longer
                    safe to continue him in office.</p>
                <p>Once more Charles refused to surrender Buckingham, and a few days later he
                    prorogued Parliament in anger. The popular feeling was greatly excited. Lampoons
                    circulated freely from hand to hand, and Dr Lambe, a quack doctor, who dabbled
                    in astrology, and was believed to exercise influence over Buckingham, was
                    murdered in the streets of London. Rude doggerel lines announced that the duke
                    should share the doctor’s fate.</p>
                <p>With the clouds gathering round him, Buckingham went down to Portsmouth to take
                    the command of one final expedition for the relief of Rochelle. For the first
                    time even he was beginning to acknowledge that he had undertaken a task beyond
                    his powers. There was a force of inertia in the officials which resisted his
                    efforts to spur them on to an enterprise which they believed to be doomed to
                    failure. He entered gladly into a scheme of pacification proposed by the
                    Venetian ambassador. But before he could know whether there was to be peace or
                    war, the knife of an assassin put an end to his career. John Felton, who had
                    served at Rhé, had been disappointed of promotion, and had not been paid that
                    which was due to him for his services, read the declaration of the Commons that
                    Buckingham was a public enemy, and eagerly caught at the excuse for revenging
                    his private wrongs under cover of those of his country. Waiting, on the morning
                    of August 23, beside the door of the room in which Buckingham was breakfasting,
                    he stabbed him to the heart as he came out. The man who for four years had been
                    practically the ruler of England fell dead upon the ground. He had only
                    completed his thirty-sixth year three days before, (s. <hi rend="smallcaps">r.
