                    millennium intervening between the death of Theodosius and the Turkish conquest
                    of Constantinople, are collectively classed together under the above
                    designation. Until, however, the middle of the 6th century, they are, with one
                    conspicuous exception, too merely fragmentary to deserve special notice. This
                    exception is <hi rend="smallcaps">Procopius,</hi> the Polybius of his age, whose
                    histories are of such importance as to demand a separate article. We shall
                    arrange his successors in chronological order, distinguishing between the
                    historians properly so called and the chronologers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Historians.</hi> —I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Agathias</hi> of
                    Myrina in Aetolia, was born under Justinian, about 536 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> and is believed to have died under Tiberius the Second, about 580.
                    His character as an epigrammatist and an editor of poetry has been already
                    considered under the head <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthology.</hi> We are indebted
                    to him in his historical capacity for an extremely valuable narrative of six of
                    the most eventful years of the Greek empire, 553-558. The first book details the
                    conquest of Italy from the Goths by Justinian’s general Narses; the remainder
                    describe, along with other incidents, the Persian war of 554-556, the two great
                    earthquakes of 554 and 557, the great plague, the rebuilding of St Sophia, and
                    Belisarius’s last exploits against the Bulgarians. The history terminates
                    abruptly, and was probably left unfinished. As a narrator, Agathias is sensible
                    and impartial, but deficient in general knowledge, and far below the standard of
                    a philosophic historian. His style is rhetorical, but not unpleasing. II. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Menander Protector,</hi> the far inferior imitator of Agathias,
                    lived under Mauricius, whose reign began in 581, and continued the history of
                    Agathias to the date of the accession of that emperor. His work was comprised in
                    eight books, which are entirely lost, with the exception of numerous extracts
                    relating to embassies preserved in the collection ∏∈pι <hi rend="italic"

                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Theophylactus</hi> of Simocatta, a sophist and civilian
                    of Egyptian extraction, wrote the history of the Emperor Mauricius (582-602) in
                    eight books, all of which are preserved. The work seems to have been completed
                    under Heraclius. Theophylactus lived until 628 or 629. He is an accurate and not
                    inelegant writer, but frequently trivial and frigid. IV. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Joannes</hi> of Epiphaneia, a contemporary of Theophylactus, wrote the history
                    of the wars of the Greeks and Persians from the latter part of Justinian’s reign
                    until the restoration of Chosroes II. by Mauricius (591). His history has never
                    been printed, but is said to exist in MS. at Heidelberg. V. The Emperor <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Constantine Porphyrogenitus</hi> (reigned 911-959). Among the
                    many services rendered to literature by this learned sovereign is to be
                    enumerated his history of his grandfather Basil the Macedonian, emperor from 867
                    to 886. VI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Genesius,</hi> who lived in the time of
                    Constantine Porphyrogenitus, wrote by his order the history of Basil II. and of
                    his four immediate predecessors (813-886). The work is brief and meagre, but is
                    almost the only authority we possess for a portion of the period described. VII.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Joannes Cameniata,</hi> a native of Thessalonica, and
                    cross-bearer to the archbishop, wrote an account, which has been preserved, of
                    the sack of that wealthy city by the Saracens in 904. Cameniata himself was one
                    of the captives, and his narrative is very lively and valuable. VIII. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Leo</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Diaconus,</hi> an ecclesiastic in
                    the latter half of the 10th century, is the author of an indifferently written,
                    but honest and instructive, narrative of the remarkable period of national
                    recovery under the emperors Romanus IL, Nicephorus Phocas, and John Zimisces,
                    when Crete was reconquered, Syria invaded, and the Russians driven out of
                    Bulgaria (959-975). Leo wrote at least as late as 993. IX. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Nicephorus Bryennius,</hi> the son-in-law of the Emperor Alexius Comnenus, and
                    one of the first statesmen and generals of his time, wrote in four books the
                    history of the empire under the Comneni from 1057 to 1081. X. His still more
                    celebrated wife, <hi rend="smallcaps">Anna Comnena,</hi> daughteι∙ of the
                    Emperor Alexius, and the marvel of her sex at that extremely low period of
                    female education, wrote (1148) the history of her father in fifteen books. The
                    period of Alexius is peculiarly interesting as that in which the barrier of
                    Byzantine isolation was broken down, and the East and West brought into contact
                    by the encroachments of the Normans on the Eastern empire and by the Crusades.
                    We cannot be too grateful to the Princess Anna for her vivid sketclι of the
                    arrival of tlιe Crusaders at Constantinople, and the relations between them and
                    the Byzantine court. Her work, however, must be used with great caution.
                    Gibbon’s employment of it is an example of his usual discernment. XI. Her
                    history was continued by <hi rend="smallcaps">Joannes Cinnamus,</hi> one of the
                    m &gt;st eminent of all the Byzantine historians. He was one of the imperial
                    notaries under the reign of Manuel Comnenus (1143-1180), an office nearly
                    corresponding to that of a modern secretary of state. He had, consequently,
                    great administrative experience, and a thorough knowledge of the relations of
                    the empire with foreign states, and of the internal affairs of the latter. He is
                    thus in an excellent position for writing history, besides which his own
                    judgment and sagacity are of a very superior order, and his style is commonly
                    terse and clear. Like most writers who have themselves participated in the
                    transactions they describe, he is not altogether exempt from partiality. His
                    history comprehends the period from the death of Alexius Comnenus in ∏18 to the
                    siege of Iconium by Manuel Comnenus in 1176, four years before the death of that
                    emperor. There is little doubt that Cinnamus brought his work down to the close
                    of Manuel’s reign, and that the conclusion is lost. XII. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Nicetas Acominatus,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Choniates,</hi> a patrician
                    and holder of many important public offices under the emperor Isaac Angelus at
                    the beginning of the 13th century, described the same period as Cinnamus, but
                    continued his narrative to 1206. The latter books of Nicetas’s history possess
                    especial importance, inasmuch as they contain the Byzantine account of the
                    taking of Constantinople by the Latins in the fourth crusade (1204). Nicetas’s
                    own palace was burned and plundered, and he escaped with difficulty to Nicaea,
                    where he composed his history under the protection of the emperor Theodore
                    Lascaris. His narrative, though too rhetorical, is striking and pathetic; it
                    necessarily requires careful comparison with the Latin accounts. The remainder
                    of his history is also valuable. He is also said to be the author of an account
                    of the statues destroyed by the Latins, which, however, is thought to have been
                    interpolated by a later writer. It has been published by Wilken (Leipsic, 1830).
                    XIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Georgius Acropolita,</hi> an eminent scholar and
                    diplomatist, who lived from 1220-1282, wrote the history of the Eastern empire
                    during its subjugation by the Latins (1204-1261). The work is so brief that it
                    has been regarded as merely an epitome of Acropolita’s original history. XIV.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Georgius Pachymeres,</hi> a priest and ecclesiastical
                    jurist under Michael and Andronicus Palaeologus, wrote the history of these
                    emperors (1258-1308) in thirteen books. Pachymeres is one of the best of the
                    Byzantine historians; his style is singularly good for his age, and his tone
                    dignified and impartial. XV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nicephorus Gregoras,</hi> a
                    man of great learning, but passionate and untrustworthy as an historian, wrote
                    the history of his country from 1204-1358, in thirty-eight books, the last
                    fourteen of which remained unpublished until 1855, when they were edited at Bonn
                    by Immanuel Bekker. After the recovery of Constantinople by the Greeks in 1261,
                    Byzantine politics entered into a new phase; the feeble and distracted empire,
                    unable to make head against the Turks, was compelled to lean for support upon
                    the European powers, which it sought to obtain by patching up the long-standing
                    religious schism. Greeks and Latins, however, were equally resolved to concede
                    nothing save in appearance, and the history of the time is to a great extent
                    that of hollow negotiations, meant only to deceive. In these Gregoras had a
                    considerable share; he also took an active part in the internal religious
                    controversies of his church, and his personal knowledge of affairs imparts
                    considerable value to his history. He was at one time a favourite of the Emperor
                    Cantacuzenus, but was subsequently persecuted by him. He possessed extensive
                    attainments, and is especially celebrated for having anticipated the astronomers
                    of Pope Gregory XIII. in the correction of the Julian Calendar. XVI. The Emperor
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">John Cantacuzenus,</hi> after his abdication, wrote the
                    history of his times from 1320-1357, including the fifteen years of his own
                    eventful reign. This “is written,” as Dr Plate observes, “with elegance and
                    dignity, and shows that the author was a man of superior intelligence, fully
                    able to understand and judge of the great events of history;” but Gibbon’s
                    remark is no less just that Cantacuzenus “presents, not a confession, but an
                    apology of the life of an ambitious statesman. Instead of unfolding the true
                    counsels and characters of men, he displays the smooth and specious surface of
                    events, highly varnished with his own praises and those of his friends.” The
                    truth is arrived at by a comparison of Cantacuzenus with the rival and inimical
                    narrative of Nicephorus Gregoras, so far as they cover the same ground. XVII.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Joannes Cananus</hi> wrote an account of the siege of
                    Constantinople by Amurath II. in 1422; and XVIII. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the prince of that island, and wrote his history after the reduction of Lesbos
                    by the Turks in 1462. It commences in 1342, and goes down to the conquest of
                    Lesbos. Ducas is the most difficult and barbarous of all the Byzantine
                    historians, and the only one who appears entirely unacquainted with classical
                    models. At the same time he is among the most intelligent, impartial, and
                    sagacious. The ruin of the Greek empire has also been recorded by XX. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Georgius Phrantzes</hi> and XXL <hi rend="smallcaps">Laonicus
                    Chalcocondyles</hi> Both of these were eminent among the statesmen of their
                    disastrous period, and Phrantzes in particular played a very important part in
                    diplomacy. Broken hearted at the capture of his native city and the death of his
                    son and daughter in slavery, he retired to a monastery in Corfu, where he wrote
                    his <hi rend="italic">Chronicon</hi> about 1477, to which year it extends. It
                    commences at the year 1259, but by far the most valuable portion is that which
                    records the transactions of the author’s lifetime, and the value of this is very
                    great. Chalcocondyles, beginning at 1298, brings his history down to the
                    invasion of the Morea by the Turks in 1463. He also is an accomplished man, of
                    much experience in public business; and although his digressions respecting the
                    affairs and manners of other nations are irrelevant, and betray ignorance, they
                    are interesting as an index to the knowledge possessed by his countrymen at his
                    time.</p>

                    usually published’ in the Byzantine collection are frequently very valuable, but
                    neither their lives nor their writings need detain us long. They are I. <hi

                    Malalas</hi> extends from the beginning of the world to the year 566. Malalas is
                    usually supposed to have lived in the 9th century, and to have left his work
                    incomplete, but some regard him as contemporary of Justinian. VI. <hi

                    of Constantinople under Leo the Armenian, early in the 9th century, compiled a

                    There has been considerable difficulty in settling the respective claims to

                    rend="smallcaps">Georgius Cedrenus,</hi> but the latter was probably the
                    copyist. The contrary opinion has prevented the publication of Scylitza’s work,
                    with the exception of the portions not transcribed by Cedrenus. These extend
                    from 1057 to 1080. The chronicle of Cedrenus reaches from the Creation to the
                    former of these dates. XII. The chronicle of <hi rend="smallcaps">Constantine
                    Manasses</hi> is written in political verses, and extends from the beginning of
                    the world to the accession of Alexius Comnenus in 1281. XIII. <hi

                    associated with a compilation respecting the antiquities of the city, which is
                    of much greater value.</p>
                <p>The contribution of the Byzantine historians to literature may be compared with
                    the part enacted by the Byzantine empire in the history of the world. That
                    empire added nothing to the treasures of civilization, but it preserved much.
                    Like the earth in winter, it seemed barren and unlovely, but it kept the good
                    seed hidden in its bosom for better days. Had it perished before the
                    intellectual revival of Western Europe, the solution of continuity between
                    ancient and modern culture would have been irreparable. In like manner the
                    Byzantine historians preserved the traditions of historical composition, while
                    their brethren of the West were merely chroniclers and annalists. They have
                    safely embalmed in their generally unattractive pages a vast mass of most
                    valuable information, for which we are in most cases solely dependent upon them,
                    and they aid us to reconstruct the polity, and to some extent the social life,
                    of what was for several centuries the only really civilized Christian state in
                    the world. They are undoubtedly for the most part perfectly ignorant of the
                    significance of their own times; they have postponed what was really interesting
                    to barren details of battles and court intrigues, and have wasted opportunities
                    which would have been invaluable to a philosophic historian. Cinnamus and Ducas
                    are the only two with any claim to this character, and Anna Comnena is the only
                    artist. When, however, all their disadvantages are taken into consideration, it
                    will probably be deemed that they are much better than might have been expected.
                    They were isolated from all the rest of the known world by prejudice, policy,
                    and religious hatred. There was no scientific or other intellectual movement in
                    their times, no aspiration for liberty, no conception of a more liberal culture;
                    they were crushed by a rigid despotism, and enthralled by an abject
                    superstition. Under these circumstances the good sense and sagacity of many
                    among them are very remarkable, and are chiefly to be explained by the large
                    proportion among them of men accustomed to practical life and public affairs.
                    Their roll includes sovereigns, generals, prime ministers, secretaries of state,
                    diplomatists, and other important public officers; even the ecclesiastics among
                    them are not recluses but men versed in business. The Byzantine civil service
                    was the strong point of the empire, and its solid if prosaic qualities are
                    admirably reflected by its literary representatives.</p>
                <p>The first collective edition of the Byzantine historians was published at Paris,
                    1648-1702, in 27 volumes, with a preface by Labbe, and notes and translations by
                    Fabrotus, Combefisius, and others. It was reprinted, with additions, at Venice,
                    1729-33. These editions are superseded by the great edition of Bonn, 1828-55, in
                    48 volumes, undertaken at the recommendation and under the superintendence of
                    Niebuhr, and continued after his death under the patronage of the Royal Prussian
                    Academy. The separate volumes are edited by Bekker, Dindorf, Hase, and other
                    distinguished scholars; nevertheless, according to Brunet, “de bons textes des
                    historiens byzantins restent encore à donner.” Like former collections it
                    contains several works of value not strictly belonging to Byzantine history, but
                    illustrative of it. No guide to Byzantine history is comparable to Gibbon, whose
                    narrative of this period is an unparalleled literary feat of masterly and
                    impartial condensation. See likewise Lebeau, <hi rend="italic">Histoire du
                    Bas</hi><hi rend="italic">Empire,</hi> Paris, 1824-36. Mr Finlay’s volumes are
                    also invaluable companions to the Byzantine historians. Of special works on the
                    subject, the most important is Hankius, <hi rend="italic">Be</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Byzantinarum</hi><hi rend="italic">rerum scriρtorilηιs
                    Groecis,</hi> Leipsic, 1677, a book distinguished by extensive and accurate
                    erudition, but necessarily deficient as respects the writers not published in
                    the author’s day. It contains notices of Byzantine ecclesiastical writers also.
                    Special points of interest are discussed in Von Hammer’s essay in the Göttingen
                    <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> (vol. 6) on the correction of the Byzantine
                    historians from Ottoman sources; in Heyne’s <hi rend="italic">Antiquatates
                    Byzantinoe</hi> (1808-11); and in Hullman’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des
                    Byzantinischen</hi><hi rend="italic">Handels</hi> (1808). Sabatier’s great work
                    on Byzantine numismatics also affords much illustrative matter, and there is a
                    lively sketch of the general social condition of the Eastern Empire in Áugustin
                    Marrasvs <hi rend="italic">Esquisses Byzantines.</hi> (Paris, 1874.) (R∙ G.) <pb
