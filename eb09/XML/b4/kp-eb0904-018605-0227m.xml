                    which formerly constituted a separate duchy, but is now divided between Belgium
                    and Holland. The Belgian portion includes the provinces of Brabant and Antwerp,

                    the Bearded, count of Louvain, who lived in the beginning of the 12th century,
                    was the first to assume the title of count of Brabant, which his great-grandson,
                    Henry I. the Warrior (1190-1235) exchanged for that of duke. The duchy passed in
                    regular succession to Henry II. the Magnanimous (1235-1248), and Henry III. the
                    Debonnair (d. 1261); but on the death of the latter the natural heir was
                    supplanted by his younger brother John I. the Victorious, who added the district
                    of Limburg to his possessions by the battle of Woeringen in 1288, in which he
                    killed his competitor Henry of Luxembourg with his own hand. The next duke, John
                    II., is memorable for the privileges he bestowed on his subjects by the statute
                    of the Common Weal and the charter of Cortemberg. His successor, John III. the
                    Triumphant, had to contend against a rebellion of Brussels and Louvain, and an
                    offensive alliance of his neighbours, but managed to make himself not only
                    secure but formidable. His three sons having died before him without issue, he
                    was succeeded by his daughter, who had married Wenceslas of Luxembourg. The
                    count of Flanders laid claim to the duchy, and, after a considerable struggle,
                    was only bought off by the surrender of Antwerp. In 1404 the whole of Brabant
                    was handed over to the countess of Flanders, and in 1406 her son took the title
                    of duke. On his death at the battle of Agincourt, in which he fought on the side
                    of the French, he was succeeded by John IV., whose marriage and divorce created
                    much excitement in his day. In 1430, on the decease of Philip, second son of
                    John IV., the duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, was also recognized as duke of
                    Brabant; and in 1440 the country passed to the house of Austria by the marriage
                    of Mary of Burgundy his granddaughter to Maximilian the emperor, who transmitted
                    it to Charles V. and thus to the crown of Spain. In 1648 the northern portion of
                    the duchy succeeded in freeing itself from the Spanish tyranny, while southern
                    Brabant continued under the yoke till 1714. Brabant possessed a liberal
                    constitution known as the <hi rend="italic">Joyeuse Entrée,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Blyde Inkomst,</hi> or Joyous Entrance, which, <hi rend="italic"
                    >inter alia,</hi> prevented the duke from raising the clergy above the other
                    states of the realm, from prosecuting his subjects except in the regular courts,
                    and from appointing foreigners to political office. A consent of the three
                    states—the clergy, the nobles, and the representatives of the chief cities—was
                    necessary for the passing of a law; and the towns had the right of refusing
                    assistance <pb break="no"

                    which they had not been previously made acquainted. The states usually met every
                    two years, and a permanent committee of tho three orders held its session in
                    Brussels. The Brabantine court, under the native dynasty, was famous for the
                    encouragement which it afforded to learning and literature; and more than one of
                    the dukes have left proof of personal culture in the shape of songs. (See
