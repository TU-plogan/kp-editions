                <p><label type="entry">BUENOS AYRES</label>, the largest and most important province
                    of the Argentine Republic, is bounded on the N. by the Parana, which separates
                    it from the province of Entre Rios, and by the provinces of Santa Fé, Cordova,
                    and San Luis; on the E. by the Atlantic; on the S. by Patagonia; and on the S.
                    and W. by the country of the Indians, which extends westwards to the Andes. The
                    area of the province is estimated at about 440,000 square miles. Its seaboard
                    along the Rio de la Plata and the ocean is upwards of 900 miles in length.
                    According to the last census of 1869 the population was 488,706, of which
                    171,404 belong to the city of Buenos Ayres; in the present year (1876) it may be
                    estimated at 600,000, of which 220,000 belong to the city, and 380,000 to the
                    province. By the last returns the number of immigrants is from 60,000 to 90,000
                    per annum, the greater part of whom remain in the province of Buenos Ayres.</p>
                <p>The general aspect of the country, as viewed from the sea, is eminently
                    uninteresting. From the mouth of the Plata to the Bahia Blanca the sea-line
                    presents an unbroken series of sand-dunes, varied here and there with low ridges
                    of rock. From this latter point to the Patagonian frontier, the aspect of the
                    coast is less monotonous, though equally destitute of life or interest. Though
                    Buenos Ayres is the only province of the Argentine Republic that borders upon
                    the sea, and though all the exports and imports of the country pass through it,
                    it possesses very few harbours. One of these (that of the city of Buenos Ayres)
                    is extremely bad; another (that of Bahia Blanca, near the southern <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n487/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0487-0440"/> extremity of the province), possesses great
                    natural advantages, which are by no means adequately appreciated. It might be
                    turned to good account as a starting-point for vessels engaged in trade with the
                    South American states that border upon the Pacific, but the difficult and
                    sometimes dangerous navigation of the adjoining seas counterbalances in the
                    meantime the other advantages which it offers. The interior of the couutry,
                    except where it is intersected by the low mountain ranges of the Ventana and
                    Vaulcan in its southern portions, and the spurs of the Andes in the west, is one
                    vast plain, of which by far the larger part is laid out in <hi rend="italic"
                    >estancias,</hi> or cattle farms, though the soil is in itself well adapted for
                    producing all the European cerealia. Agricultural pursuits, however, are by no
                    means in favour with the natives, who cannot bring themselves to engage in any
                    pursuit that cannot be prosecuted on horseback. “Every man, woman, and child in
                    the country rides,” says Parish. “One might fancy one’s self in the land of
                    centaurs, amidst a population half-men, half-horses. Even beggars ride on
                    horseback.” Some of the cattle-farms are of immense extent; one in particular is
                    mentioned by travellers as comprising more than 300 square miles of land, and
                    yielding an enormous revenue to the proprietor. Some of the largest of them
                    belong to British settlers, and are worked by British servants. The cattle were
                    formerly hunted down and killed merely for the sake of their hides and tongues,
                    while the carcases were abandoned to beasts and birds of prey. They are now
                    slaughtered in abattoirs, where every part of the animal is made available. The
                    beef Î3 salted for exportation; the tallow is boiled down, and now forms an
                    important item in the farmer’s revenue; and the trade in hides is steadily
                    increasing. Beef and an infusion of the native tea are the staple food of the
                    natives. In the province of Buenos Ayres there are 45,500,000 sheep, which give
                    a yield of 136,500,000 lb unwashed wool; 5,116,000 cows; and 1,500,000 horses.
                    This give3 the unusual average of 200 sheep, 20 cows, and 6 horses to every
                    inhabitant. The sheep-farms cover over 40,000,000 acres; and the number of
                    shepherds may be estimated at 30,000, of whom at least a quarter are Irish or
                    Scotch. The total value of exports from Buenos Ayres in 1872 was £9,148,638,—the
                    most important being wool 203,610,000 lb, sheep-skins 72,970,000 lb, ox and
                    cow-hides 3,121,758, jerked beef 916,220 qq., tallow 1,182,240 qq. The value of
                    imports in 1872 may be stated approximately at £12,000,000, of which Great
                    Britain contributed £3,800,000, France £3,200,000, Spain £800,000, Brazil
                    £700,000, United States £700,000, Italy £600,000, Belgium £600,000, Germany
                    £100,000, other countries £1,200,000.</p>
                <p>Of the cereals grown in Buenos Ayres the most important is maize, which is
                    indigenous to the country, Wheat thrives well in the southern parts of the
                    province, but the inhabitants rarely grow more than enough to supply their own
                    necessities. In the event of a surplus it is commonly exported to Brazil. The
                    vine, fig, orange, and olive have been introduced from the Old World, and are
                    found to suit the climate admirably; but the most valuable of European fruits is
                    the peach. A considerable fruit trade is carried on in coasting vessels by
                    merchants for the most part Italian or French,</p>
                <p>The geographical position of Buenos Ayres is such as to enable it completely to
                    control the foreign commercial relations of the entire republic of which it
                    forms a part. The exclusive policy which it has always pursued on this point has
                    often involved it in serious quarrels, not only with many of the South American
                    states and the other provinces of the Argentine Republic, but with England and
                    France. Since the expulsion of General Rosas, the navigation of the Parana and
                    Uruguay has been thrown open, and other measures have been taken to place both
                    the province and city of Buenos Ayres on a level with the other provinces of the
                    republic.</p>
                <p>The only towns of any importance, besides the capital, are San Nicolas, which is
                    situated on the Parana, about 200 miles N.W. of Buenos Ayres, and contains a
                    population of about 10,000; San Pedro, also on the Parana, about 150 miles from
                    the capital, in the same direction, with a population of 1000; Chascomus, on a
                    lake of the same name, a place of considerable importance; Dolores, 150 miles
                    south of Buenos Ayres; Villa de Mercedes, Chivilcoy, Las Flores, and
                    Belgrano.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Buenos Ayres,</hi> the capital of the Argentine Republic and
                    of the province of Buenos Ayres, is situated on the right bank of the estuary of
                    the La Plata, in 34° 39' S. lat. and 58° 18' W. long. The river is at this point
                    so wide that it is quite impossible with the naked eye to distinguish the
                    opposite bank, and at the same time so shallow, that ships drawing 15 or 16 feet
                    of water must anchor seven or eight miles from the city. Small craft generally
                    anchor in what are called the inner roads, abreast of the city. The depth of
                    water is never sufficient to admit of their coming to shore.</p>
                <p>The town of Buenos Ayres is situated in a vast plain extending westwards to the
                    Andes. The level uniformity of its outline is only broken by the spires of the
                    various churches. The stranger, on landing, is struck with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n488/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0488-0441"/> regularity of the streets, which are quite
                    straight, and intersect each other at distances of 150 yards, forming squares
                    like those of a chess-board, with the cleanly appearance of the houses, and the
                    general air of independence that distinguishes the inhabitants. The houses till
                    lately had never more than two stories, and commonly only one, the rooms of
                    which open into each other, and were chiefly supplied with furniture of a very
                    inferior description from the United States. A chimney was a thing unknown, and
                    the old Spanish brazero alone was employed in heating the damp and white washed
                    rooms. A great change has, however, taken place in these respects within the
                    last few years. A rage for building has prevailed, and now splendid edifices of
                    three and four stories may be seen in every street. The furniture is now
                    supplied from Europe, the walls are papered, grates and chimneys have come into
                    fashion, and English coal is burned. These comforts are all the more valuable,
                    as the climate of Buenos Ayres is one of the most humid and changeable in the
                    world. The streets of the city are now tolerably paved with granite. They exceed
                    eighty in number, thirty-one of them running from the river side due west, and
                    fifty-one from north to south. The city is being provided with drainage and
                    water supply, and is well lighted with gas. There are eleven parishes,
                    containing sixteen Roman Catholic churches. There are two city hospitals,
                    supported by the municipality, and four for foreigners, belonging to the
                    English, French, Italian, and Irish communities. The theatres are five in
                    number, and there is also a concert-hall. Five markets for the daily supply of
                    the city with provisions are placed at convenient distances; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">plazas</hi> “11 de Setiembre” and <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>
                    Constitution,” are the great wool markets for the north and south districts of
                    the camp. Floriculture is a favourite pursuit; and many English and Scotch
                    gardeners have nurseries in the neighbourhood of the town.</p>
                <p>Of the public buildings may be noticed the Government house, which is situated on
                    the beach, a residence for the president of the Republic; the cathedral, which
                    is surmounted by a handsome dome, and has a large portico with twelve Corinthian
                    pillars; the cabildo or town-house, in which justice is administered; the
                    churches of La Merced, San Francisco, and San Domingo; and the custom-house. The
                    Plaza de la Victoria, round which some of these edifices are grouped, is the
                    handsomest square in Buenos Ayres. In the centre of it is a handsome monument,
                    erected as a memorial of the War of Independence. When the number of British
                    residents in the town began rapidly to increase application was made to General
                    Rosas for a site for a church. This was immediately granted, and the minister
                    for the time being set an example of liberality and toleration to his countrymen
                    by laying the foundation-stone of the edifice, which cost in all about £4000,
                    half of which was defrayed by the British Government. The Scottish residents
                    have built a small Presbyterian chapel, and the Roman Catholic portion of the
                    English subjects are allowed the use of one of the national churches, in which a
                    priest performs the service. In 1842 the Methodists erected a meeting-house,
                    which is used by all denominations of the British Dissenters. The Protestant
                    Germans, who are pretty numerous, have a church in connection with the
                    Established Church of Prussia. To each of these places of worship schools are
                    attached for children of both sexes. The facilities for education are very
                    considerable, and of these the inhabitants avail themselves extensively. Besides
                    the denominational schools already alluded to, there is a university, attended
                    by about 500 students, and possessing a valuable library. The sons of the
                    wealthier families of the city are very frequently sent to Europe to complete
                    their education at some of the great schools and colleges in France and England.
                    The Buenos Ayreans inherit from their ancestors much of that passion for music
                    which characterizes the Spaniard. Poetry also is much cultivated among them.
                    Besides its university, Buenos Ayres contains many literary and scientific
                    institutions. Of these the most important are the school of medicine, the
                    academy of jurisprudence, a special academy of mathematics and the physical
                    sciences, a normal school, and a society for the promotion of agriculture. The
                    charitable societies, though not very numerous, are rather important. Spanish is
                    the language spoken by the Buenos Ayrean descendants of the old Spanish
                    settlers.</p>
                <p>Buenos Ayres was founded in 1535 by a Spanish expedition under Don Jorge de
                    Mendoza, who landing at this place after many hardships, bestowed upon it the
                    name it now bears in commemoration of the fine weather which prevailed at that
                    time. At first he endeavoured to conciliate the native Indians, but hostilities
                    soon broke out, and, despite their utmost efforts, the Spaniards were obliged to
                    abandon the new settlement; and after almost incredible difficulties succeeded
                    in reaching Asuncion in Paraguay, with their numbers reduced by three-fourths.
                    In 1580 another expedition under Don Juan de Garay took possession of the site
                    of the old fort and established themselves there, founding cities and
                    establishing settlements in every direction with such success that in 1620 a new
                    government was erected, under the name of the government of the Rio de la Plata.
                    Buenos Ayres became the capital, and the seat of a new bishopric created at this
                    time by Pope Paul V., at the request of Philip HI. of Spain. After the lapse of
                    a century, Buenos Ayres began to rise into such importance as to excite the
                    jealousy and alarm of the home Government. The insane restrictions imposed upon
                    her foreign and internal commerce led only to continual heart-burnings with the
                    parent country, and Buenos Ayres soon became a rendezvous for the smugglers of
                    such nations as were strong enough to set Spain at defiance. After numerous
                    modifications of its government, and of its relations to the parent state, the
                    provinces of the Rio de la Plata were in 1776 erected into a vice-royalty, of
                    which Buenos Ayres continued to be the capital. Two years later the old
                    commercial restrictions were abolished and a new commercial code promulgated, so
                    liberal as to be called the “Free-Trade Regulations.” According to the old
                    system the Buenos Ayreans were only allowed to export merchandise to the
                    Portuguese settlements in Brazil, and the quantity was limited to 2000 fanegas
                    of wheat, 500 quintals of jerked beef, and 500 of tallow. All intercourse with
                    other countries was strictly prohibited. By the new system, nine ports in Spain,
                    and twenty-four in the colonies were declared <hi rend="italic">pτιertos
                    habilitados,</hi> or ports of entry. The effects of the new policy was
                    immediately visible. Of hides, for instance, the staple commodity of the
                    country, the exports to Spain before 1778 only amounted to 150,000 annually;
                    after that year they rose to from 700,000 to 800,000. - In 1805, and again in
                    1807, the British invaded Buenos Ayres; and though the natives applied for
                    assistance to the home authorities, they were told that they must defend
                    themselves as they best might, as Spain could send them no help. They
                    accordingly rose in arms, and twice expelled the invaders. In the following year
                    they were threatened with invasion by the prince regent of Portugal. The
                    resolution which they displayed on the occasion prevented that prince from
                    insisting upon his claims. In 1810 the circumstances of the country involved the
                    establishment of a provisional junta,— a policy which was construed by the
                    Spanish Cortes into an act of rebellion. A civil war ensued; and Ferdinand, on
                    his restoration after the expulsion of the French from Spain, instead of trying
                    to conciliate the malcontents by timely concessions, obstinately refused to
                    accede to their lawful demands. The result of this was that, on the 9th of July
                    1816, deputies from the provinces of the Rio de la Plata assembled in congress
                    at Tucuman, solemnly declared their separation from Spain, and their
                    determination to constitute a free and independent state. Buenos Ayres continued
                    to be the capital of the new republic, which was governed by authorities
                    constituted in that city. The exclusive policy of the capital soon bred
                    discontent in the provinces, the governors of which began to cry out for a
                    federation in opposition to the Central Government of Buenos Ayres. By their
                    influence the new constitution, which conferred on a chief magistrate residing
                    in the capital very extensive civil and military powers over the whole republic,
                    was repudiated, and a civil war was the consequence. Various assemblies were
                    held, and attempts were made to establish the constitution on a sufficiently
                    wide basis to reconcile the interests of all parties—but always without success;
                    and from 1827 till the expulsion of Rosas in 1852, no meetings of the
                    constituent assembly took place. After 1827, the confederation was obliged to
                    delegate to the Executive Government of Buenos Ayres the undivided charge of the
                    national business, such as the management of the public debt, the maintenance of
                    relations with foreign pow ers, <pb break="no"

                    &amp;c. While these internal dissentions were going on, war was declared between
                    the young confederation and the empire of Brazil, and Buenos Ayres was blockaded
                    for a year, and a half by a Brazilian fleet. In 1828, however, the siege was
                    raised by the intervention of the English, and by the decisive battle that took
                    place at Ituzaingo favourable to the Argentine arms. This foreign war thus
                    ended, the civil war broke out once more, and was only temporarily checked by
                    the accession of General Rosas to power in 1835. Aiming at territorial
                    aggrandizement, Rosas soon became involved in war witlι the neighbouring states
                    of Paraguay and Uruguay. England, France, and Brazil interfered, with the
                    intention of effecting an amicable an <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> ange-ment
                    between the belligerents. Rosas rejected their mediation; and the united fleets
                    of England and France took . possession of the Buenos Ayrean fleet which was
                    engaged in the siege of Monte Video, and opened the navigation of the Parana to
                    the merchantmen of all nations. In the subsequent operations Rosas sustained
                    severe losses, yet obstinately refused to yield. In 1848 the English fleet
                    returned home, and was followed by the French in the following year. Brazil was
                    now left to carry on the war alone, but she found ready allies in some of the
                    provinces of the Argentine Confederation, which had long regarded with hatred
                    and aversion the supremacy arrogated by Buenos Ayres. With the assistance of
                    these and the adjoining states of Uruguay and Paraguay, a large army was raised,
                    which, under the command of General Urquiza, defeated Rosas at the battle of
                    Monte Caseros, February 3, 1852. Rosas after his downfall fled to England.
                    Urquiza was appointed provisional director of the confederation; but the Buenos
                    Ayreans protested against his policy, which threatened to undermine the
                    prerogatives they had been long struggling to secure. Civil war again broke out;
                    and in 1853 Buenos Ayres was besieged by the forces of the other states of the
                    confederation. On the 20th of June the siege was raised, and a temporary
                    accommodation effected.</p>
                <p>Since the establishment of the Argentine Republic in 1861 the city and province
                    of Buenos Ayres have both very considerably developed their resources. In the
                    province there are now 450 miles of railway, and 2228 miles of telegraph lines;
                    in the city there are six lines of tramway, which traverse the town in every
                    direction. Most of the railways and three of the tramway Unes belong to English
                    companies. There are thirteen different lines of steamers trading between Europe
                    and the Port of Buenos Ayres. Population (1876) estimated at about 220,000.</p>
