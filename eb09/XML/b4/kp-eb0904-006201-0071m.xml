                    which along with the <hi rend="italic">defensor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >civitatis</hi> appear to have existed in vigour until the reign of Leo the
                    Philosopher <hi rend="italic">(Const.,</hi> 46, 47), yet as the local power was
                    gradually subordinated to the imperial, and as both in France and Italy it seems
                    almost universally to have disappeared when the territorial jurisdictions, as
                    well as the feudal fiefs, became hereditary, it is impossible to trace an
                    historical connection between these institutions and the modern borough. In
                    Spain and Languedoc, perhaps, the forms of ancient independence may have been
                    continuously preserved, but the system of government by <hi rend="italic"
                    >comes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scabini</hi> (or assessors), which was pursued
                    in both France and Italy by the successors of Charlemagne, was obviously opposed
                    to the freedom of towns. It is during the 11th and 12th centuries that we begin
                    to read in charters of the <hi rend="italic">citizens</hi> of Narbonne, the <hi
                    rend="italic">burgesses</hi> of Carcassonne, the <hi rend="italic">consuls</hi>
                    of Beziers, the <hi rend="italic">magistrates</hi> of Rouergues, the <hi
                    rend="italic">capitols</hi> of Toulouse. It is during the reigns of Louis the
                    Fat, Louis the Lion, and Philip Augustus that charters of <hi rend="italic"
                    >commune</hi> become frequent. These charters, which sometimes bear to be
                    granted on account of the poverty of the townsfolk, the enormities of the
                    clergy, or the attacks of the local <hi rend="italic">Seigneurs,</hi> were
                    probably dictated by the pecuniary needs of the Crown; but they attest the
                    growing power—the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> rights of the industrial
                    population. They distinguish between <hi rend="italic">Bourgeoisies</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Communes</hi> proper: the former obtained a confirmation of
                    ancient customs, of exemption from feudal jurisdiction, of personal liberty, but
                    they did not obtain an elective municipal government. In Italy the revival of
                    civic autonomy was much more rapid. Although Frederic Barbarossa reserved to
                    himself in the peace of Constance the right of nominating consuls in the Italian
                    towns, Bishop Otho of Frisirlgen tells us that the imperial influence did not
                    count for much; and in 1288, at least, we have in the Potestas (Podesta), the
                    Concilium Generale, and Concilium Novem Dominorum of Siena, a type of the
                    independent republican city.</p>
                <p>The Saxon <hi rend="italic">byrig</hi> or <hi rend="italic">burh</hi> is properly
                    the fortified house of the powerful man. Related forms are <hi rend="italic"
                    >burgus</hi> (latin of 4th century); <hi rend="italic">burg</hi> (High German);
                    <hi rend="italic">baurgs</hi> (Gothic); <hi rend="italic">borg</hi> (Gaelic);

                    rend="italic">burgensis,</hi> or inhabitant of a walled town, was opposed to <hi
                    rend="italic">υillanus,</hi> or inhabitant of the <hi rend="italic">villa,</hi>
                    or open town. The Gemot, or assembly of the original township, had the power of
                    making δy-laws (the Danish prefix means " town ”), and of electing the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gerefa</hi> (Reeve), the <hi rend="italic">Bydel,</hi> and the
                    Tithing-man or constable, the first of whom represented the assembly in the
                    courts of the hundred and the shire. The <hi rend="italic">Gemot</hi> also saw
                    to the collection of taxes imposed by the higher courts, the pursuit of
                    criminals, and the search for stolen goods. In mercantile places, such as London
                    and Bath, the chief officer was called Port-Gerefa from the gates in which the
                    market was held.</p>
                <p>The freeholder of this period had undoubtedly political as well as personal
                    liberty. Generally speaking, however, although common property may have been
                    held by a guild or corporation, and special privileges of trade or inheritance
                    may have been enjoyed, there is before the Conquest little trace of municipal
                    organization. The Lagemanni of Lincoln and the Justices of Chester were
                    apparently among the most ancient resident magistrates, but the manner of their
                    election is unknown. The Conquest divided the boroughs into those which formed
                    part of the royal demesne and those which held of the barons and dignified
                    churchmen,—the interest of the Crown and its grantees in the property and in the
                    profits of fairs and markets, &amp;c., being, at first absolute, but latterly
                    con verted into a <hi rend="italic">firma burgi</hi> or perpetual rent from the
                    whole borough in lieu of tribute from individual <hi rend="italic"
                    >burgesses.</hi> The non-elective bailiff succeeded to the reeve, and proved a
                    useful agent in carrying out the oppressive and arbitrary <hi rend="italic"
                    >tallagia,</hi> which were often the price of new or confirmed privileges. The
                    bailiwicks were sometimes farmed out, and this led to still more severe
                    exaction. To the bailiff succeeded the mayor (major), who accounted to Exchequer
                    for the annual rents of the borough. Grants of jurisdiction, of <hi

                    John, and are probably included along with the various exemptions from tolls,
                    &amp;c., granted by Henry II. in the “liberties and free customs” guaranteed by
                    the Qreat Charter. The terms aiderman, capital citizen, capital burgess, and
                    jurat were of fluctuating signification; but the last three were finally applied
                    to members of the Common Council which gradually took the place of the assembly
                    of incorporated burgesses. The rights of a free burgess might be acquired by
                    birth, apprenticeship, marriage, or purchase; and as prior to Edward III.’s Laws
                    of the Staple thèse rights included exclusive privileges of trade, they were
                    properly connected with the payment of local taxation and the performance of
                    local duties, from which nôn-freemën (strangers and temporary residents) were
                    exempt. In mauy cases it is probable that the “civitas,” or community of
                    freemen, was identical with the <hi rend="italic">convivium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">conjuratum,</hi> or Secular Frith Guild of traders and craftsmen,
                    possessing portions of town land. Such voluntary associations for protection of
                    trade, the administration of common property, or for religious and charitable
                    purposes, were more highly developed in England than in any other part of
                    Europe. The members of the leading industry naturally assumed the direction of
                    municipal affairs, and when their guild was recognized by the Crown their
                    bye-laws acquired a binding force. For instance, in deeds of the 12th century
                    relating to the magistrates of Paris the terms <hi rend="italic">burgenses</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">mercatores</hi><hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aquam</hi> are used as synonymous. (Brentano on Gilds.) Such guilds gave
                    compensation to brethren who had incurred losses by shipwreck or undeserved
                    misfortune, and made gratuitous loans to poorer brethren for carrying on their
                    trade. In was their special endeavour to obtain staple right, the right of
                    coinage, immunity from tolls, &amp;c. Gradually, however, the distinction arose
                    between the merchants proper who formed the <hi rend="italic">gildae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mercatoriae,</hi> and the craftsmen, who had at first trafifed in
                    the räw materials they worked with, but who were now oppressed and deprived of
                    civic rights by their wealthier brethren. The man “with dirty hands” or “blue
                    nails,” the man “without hearth or honour, who lives by his labour,” or “hawks
                    his wares in the streets,” was threatened with a serfdom like that which the
                    barons and bishops had imposed. But at this juncture the great craft guilds
                    arose to assert the rights of manufacture. In the time of Henry VI. their
                    victory in England was complete, and thé Crown, which had previously recognized
                    the constitution and liberties of a town by confirming the guild, now used in
                    its charters the words of express incorporation <hi rend="italic">{communitas
                    perpetua et corporata).</hi> A glance at the names and forms of the most modern
                    municipality will show how closely trade organization and burghal government
                    have been intertwined.</p>
                <p>In Ireland the earliest traces of burghal life are connected with the maritime
                    settlements on the southern and eastern coast. The invasion of Henry II.
                    colonized these Ostman ports with Anglo-Norman communities, who brought with
                    them, or afterwards obtained, municipal charters of a favourable kind. The
                    English settlement obviously depended on the advantages which the burgesses
                    possessed over the native population outside. Quite different from these were
                    the new close boroughs which during the plantation of Ulster James I. introduced
                    from England. The conquest was by this time completed, and by a rigorous
                    enforcement of the Supremacy and Uniformity Acts the existing liberties of the
                    older boroughs were almost entirely withdrawn. By the new rules published (in
                    terms of the Acts of Settlement and Explanation) in 1672 resident traders were
                    permitted to become freemen, but neither this regulation nor the ordinary
                    admissions through birth, marriage, and apprenticeship succeeded in giving to
                    Ireland free and vigorous municipalities. The corrupt admission of non-resident
                    freemen, in order to outvote the ancient freeholders in parliamentary elections,
                    and the systematic exclusion of Roman Catholics, soon divorced the “commonalty”
                    from true local interests, and made the corporations, which elected themselves
                    or selected the constituency, dangerously unpopular.</p>
                <p>In Scotland burghs or burrows are divided into Royal Burghs, Burghs of Regality,
                    and Burghs of Barony. The first were erected by Royal Charter, and every burgess
                    held direct of the Crown. It was, therefore, impossible to subfeu the burgh
                    lands,—a distinction still traceable in modern conveyancing. Where perhaps no
                    charter ever existed, the law or proof of immemorial possession of the
                    privileges of a Royal Burgh has presumed that a charter of erection once
                    existed. The charter gave power to elect provost, bailies (French terms which
                    superseded the ancient mayor and aidermen), and council, a power long exercised
                    under the Act 1469, which directs the new council to be chosen annually by the
                    retiring council, and the magistrates by both councils. The jurisdiction of
                    these magistrates, which was specially reserved in the Act of 1747 abolishing
                    heritable jurisdictions, was originally cumulative with, and as large as, that
                    of the sheriff. It is now confined to police offences, summary ejections, orders
                    for <hi rend="italic">interim</hi> aliment (for prisoners), payment of burgh
                    dues, and delivery of title deeds. Three head courts were held in the year, at
                    which all burgesses were obliged to attend, and at which public business was
                    done and private transactions were ratified. There were three classes of
                    burgesses—burgesses <hi rend="italic">in sua arte,</hi> members Of one or other
                    of the corporations; burgesses who are guild brothers; and simple bürgesses. The
                    Leges Burgorum apparently contemplate that all respectable inhabitants should
                    have the franchise, but a ceremony of admission was required, at which the
                    applicant swore fealty and promised to watch and ward for the community, and to
                    pay his “maill” to the king. These borough maills, or rents, and the great and
                    small customs of burghs, formed a large part of the royal revenue, and, although
                    frequently leased or feued out for a fixed duty, were on the accession of James
                    I. annexed to the Crown as an alimentary fund. Burgh customs still stand in the
                    peculiar position of being neither adjudgeable nor arrestable; they are
                    therefore bad security. The early charters contain the usual privileges of
                    holding a market, of exemption from toll or tribute, and that distraint will be
                    allowed only for the burgess’s own debts. There was also the usual strife
                    between the guildry and the craftsmen, who were generally prohibited from
                    trading, and of whom dyers, fleshets, and shoemakers were forbidden to enter the
                    guildry. Deacons, wardens, and visitors were appointed by the crafts, and the
                    rate of wages was fixed by the magistrates. The crafts in Scotland were
                    frequently incorporated, not by Royal Charter, but, as in the case of the
                    cordiners of Edinburgh, by seals of cause from the corporation. The trade
                    history of the free burghs is very important. Thus in 1466 the privilege of
                    importing and exporting merchandize was confined to freemen, burgesses, and
                    their factors. Ships are directed to trade to the king’s free burghs, there to
                    pay the customs, and to receive their <hi rend="italic">cocquets</hi> or
                    custom-house seals; and in 1503 persons dwelling outside burghs are forbidden to
                    “use any merchandize,” or to sell wine or staple goods. An Act of 1633,
                    erroneously called a <hi rend="italic">Ratification</hi> of the Privileges of
                    Burghs, extended these privileges of buying and selling to retail as well as
                    wholesale trade, but restricted their enjoyment to Royal Burghs. Accordingly, in
                    1672, a general declaratory Act was passed confirming to the freemen in Royal
                    Burghs the wholesale trade in wine, wax, silk, dyeing materials, ιfcc.,
                    permitting <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n73/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0073-0064"/> generally to all persons the export of native raw
                    material, specially permitting the burgesses of Barony and Regality to export
                    their own manufactures, and such goods as they may buy in <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ti</hi> markets,” and to import against these consignments certain materials
                    for tillage, building, or for use in their own manufactures, with a general
                    permission to retail all commodities. This extraordinary system was again
                    changed in 1690 by an Act which declared that freemen of Royal Burghs should
                    have the sole right of importing everything by sea or land except bestial, and
                    also of exporting by sea everything which was not native raw material, which
                    might be freely exported by land. The gentry were always allowed to import for
                    their personal consumption and to export an equal quantity of commodities. The
                    Act mentions that the Royal Burghs as an estate of the kingdom contributed
                    one-sixth part of all public impositions, and were obliged to build and maintain
                    prison-houses. Some of these trade privileges were not abolished till the Act 9
                    and 10 Vict. c. 17.</p>
                <p>In the north of Scotland there was an association of Free Burghs called the Hanse
                    or <hi rend="italic">Ansus;</hi> and the Lord Chamberlain, by his <hi
                    rend="italic">Iter,</hi> or circuit of visitation, maintained a common standard
                    of right and duties in all burghs, and examined the state of the “common good,”
                    the accounts of which in 1535 were appointed to be laid before the auditors in
                    Exchequer. The Chamberlain latterly presided iu the Curia Quatuor Burgorum
                    (Edinburgh, Berwick, Stirling, Roxburgh), which not only made regulations in
                    trade, but decided questions of private right (e.y., succession), according to
                    the varying customs of burghs. This court frequently met at Haddington; in 1454
                    it was fixed at Edinburgh. The more modern Convention of Royal Burghs (which
                    appeared as a judicial <hi rend="italic">persona</hi> in the Court of Session so
                    late as 1839) probably dates from the Act of James III. (1487, c. Ill), which
                    appointed the Commissioners of Burghs, both north and south, to meet yearly at
                    Inverkeithing “to treat of the welfare of merchandize, the good rule and
                    statutes for the common profit of burghs, and to provide for remeid upon the
                    skaith and injuries sustained within the burghs.” Among the more important
                    functions of this body (on whose decrees at one time summary diligence
                    proceeded) were the prohibition of undue exactions within burghs, the révisai of
                    the “set” or mode of municipal election, and the <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi>
                    division among the burghs of the parliamentary subsidy required from the Third
                    Estate. The Convention still meets, but the reform of the municipalities, and
                    the complete representation of the mercantile interests in the United
                    Parliament, have deprived it of importance. In its great days it negotiated a
                    treaty with Campvere, and one of its judgments was given effect to by Edward I.
                    in the Parliament of Newcastle, 1292.</p>
                <p>Burghs of Regality and of Barony held in vassalage of some great lordship, lay or
                    ecclesiastical, but were always in theory or in practice created by Crown grant.
                    They received jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, generally cumulative
                    with that of the Baron or the Lord of Regality, who in some cases obtained the
                    right of nominating magistrates. Powers to hold markets and to levy customs were
                    likewise given to these Burghs.</p>
                <p>The Scotch burghs emerged slowly into political importance. In 1295 the
                    procurators of six burghs ratified the agreement for the marriage of Edward
                    Balliol; and in 1326 they were recognized as a Third Estate, granting a tenth
                    penny on all rents for the king’s life, if he should <hi rend="superscript">
                    a</hi> pply it for the public good. The Commissioners of Burghs received from
                    the Exchequer their costages or expenses of attending Parliament. The burghs
                    were represented in the Judicial Committee, and in the Committee on Articles
                    appointed during the reign of James V. After the Reformation, in spite of the
                    annexation of kirk lands to the Crown, and the increased burdens laid on
                    temporal lands, the proportion of general taxation borne by the burghs (viz.,
                    Is. 6d.) was expressly preserved by Act 1587, c. 112. The number of
                    commissioners, of course, fluctuated from time to time. Cromwell assigned ten
                    members to the Scotch burghs in the second Parliament of Three Nations (1654).
                    The general practice until 1619 had been, apparently, that each burgh should
                    send two members. In that year (by an arrangement with the Convention of Burghs)
                    certain groups of burghs returned one member, Edinburgh returning two. Under
                    Art. 22 of the Treaty cf Union the number of members for Royal Burghs was fixed
                    at fifteen, who were elected in Edinburgh by the Magistrates and Town Council,
                    and in the groups of burghs by delegates chosen <hi rend="italic">ad hoc.</hi>
