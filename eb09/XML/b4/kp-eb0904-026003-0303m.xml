                    not only of the man himself, but of the times in which he lived, and of the
                    influences by which he was surrounded. His father was pastor of the village of
                    Gersdorf, but was translated to Lichtenstein when Bretschneider was only four
                    years of age. He gives ar interesting account of his early childhood and school
                    training, of the impression produced upon him by his father’s dignified bearing,
                    and of the agricultural pursuits and piscatorial amusements by which the
                    clerical and paedeutic labours of the latter were diversified. On the death of
                    his father, in 1789, he was sent to Hohenstein to reside with his uncle Tag. It
                    is in keeping with th&lt; mental characteristics of the man who afterwards
                    became famous for that cool and deliberate exercise of the reason on theological
                    subjects, which has led many to place him among the extreme school of
                    rationalist divines, to find hin at the early age of fourteen, when he was
                    confirmed by the pastor of Hohenstein, criticizing the religious teaching of his
                    instructor, and pointing out that the order in which the various doctrines were
                    taught from the Dresden catechism was not such as could commend itself to his
                    own experience, or the course of moral education which he had undergone. He
                    remarks that he deems the circumstance worthy of mention, “because it was the
                    first time that, having turned his thoughts to the subject of religion, he could
                    not persuade himself of the truth of what he was taught, and that a similar
                    process may be going on in the minds of many a youth in similar circumstances,
                    without the instructor being at all aware of it.”</p>
                <p>In 1790 Bretschneider was sent to the lyceum of Chemnitz, where the celebrated
                    Heyne had received his classical education. Here he remained four years. The
                    account which he gives of the state of education in this school (which had
                    greatly fallen away from its former reputation), and of the capacity of his
                    instructors, is interesting, and is strikingly illustrative of the growth of
                    that critical faculty which became so prominent a feature <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n304/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0304-0261"/> in his character. It was while at Chemnitz that
                    Bretschneider became acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">Wolfenbüttel</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fragments.</hi> The conrector Lessing, a brother of the great
                    Lessing, who was the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Fragments,</hi> and who was
                    believed for some time to be their real author, was inconsiderate enough to warn
                    his pupils against reading any of his brother’s works. The natural result
                    followed. The prohibited books were eagerly sought after, and perused with
                    avidity. Contrary, however, to what might at first have been expected, the
                    persual of the <hi rend="italic">Fragments</hi> made no impression on the mind
                    of Bretschneider. The independent judgment of the youth is seen in the criticism
                    which he passed upon the book :—“I read the portion,” he says, “which treats of
                    the miracles of the Old Testament. But the reading made no impression upon me,
                    for Christianity did not appear to me to rest at all upon the miracles of the
                    Old Testament.”</p>
                <p>In 1794 Bretschneider entered the university of Leipsic, having resolved to
                    devote himself to the study of theology. His resolution to adopt this profession
                    was purely the result of circumstances. “His father had expressed a wish that he
                    should do so, and all his mother’s brothers were clergymen.” The lectures which
                    he attended w ere those of Platner on philosophy, of Keil and Beck and Burscher
                    on various branches of theology, and of Meisner and Kuhnoel on Hebrew. His
                    autobiography contains minute and severe criticisms upon the various professors,
                    in which the defects and mistakes of their teaching are pointed out. One or two
                    of these may be quoted as indicative of the mental tendencies of the writer.
                    Speaking of the lectures on philosophy, and after pointing out the defects of
                    Platner’s method, lie says,—“Even at this early period, I learned from
                    experience the impossibility for me of adopting any doctrine, except on
                    condition of its standing fully and clearly developed before me,—a peculiarity
                    which has adhered to me during my whole life, and has always pre÷- served me
                    from mysticism and the theology of feeling.” Again, in referring to the lectures
                    of Beck on the exegesis of Scripture, the future lexicographer of the New
                    Testament appears in the remark,—“I well remember how burdensome the word
                    7rveυ∕zα and <hi rend="italic">ιrvevga aγιov</hi> became, which he explained now
                    as expressing <hi rend="italic">seiιsum christianum,</hi> and now as <hi
                    rend="italic">fervorem animi,</hi> and then, again, as something else. I felt
                    that these explanations were not correct, and consequently could not accept
                    them.” With the lectures of Keil, the successor of the celebrated Morus,
                    Bretschneider appears to have been better satisfied. He adopted his principle of
                    the historical interpretation of Scripture, and entered, as he says, “with the
                    greatest zeal upon the study of the Jewish theology and its <hi rend="italic"
                    >usus</hi><hi rend="italic">loquendi.</hi> In consequence of this, a multitude
                    of arbitrary explanations were set aside, and neither for Teller’s dictionary,
                    nor for other modern interpretations, in which new ideas are attached to the
                    words of Scripture, could I acquire the least relish. The efforts to explain
                    away the devil from the Bible, to reduce the passages respecting Christ’s
                    pre-existence and higher nature to a moral sense, to make the miracles of the
                    New Testament by exegetical subtleties mere natural events, were odious to me as
                    denials of divine truth.”</p>
                <p>After spending four years at Leipsic, Bretschneider accepted the office of tutor
                    to the sons of a Saxon nobleman, a post which he retained for some years. During
                    tliis period his resolution to make the church his profession seems to have been
                    somewhat shaken. His difficulties, however, were removed by reading the
                    observations on assent to creeds in Reinhard’s <hi rend="italic">Christian
                    Ethics,</hi> and also " by the thought that many great and estimable theologians
                    varied widely from the church faith, and that in general society, and in the
                    learned world, the <hi rend="italic">enlightened</hi> theologians (for the term
                    rationalist was not common then) stood in the highest repute, and were regarded
                    with universal respect. This state of things I supposed would be permanent, and
                    I could not then have believed that only a single generation would pass before
                    the enlightened theologians would be assailed with such violence and bespattered
                    with filth as they nowarc. Had I been able to foresee this, I should certainly
                    have devoted myself to the study of law’.”</p>
                <p>In 1802 Bretschneider passed with great distinction the examination for <hi
                    rend="italic">candidatus theologice,</hi> and on that occasion attracted the
                    favourable regard of Reinhard, the celebrated court-preacher at Dresden, who
                    became his warm friend and patron during the remainder of his life. In 1804
                    Bretschneider established himself as <hi rend="italic">privat-docent</hi> at the
                    university of Wittenberg, where he remained about two years, giving lectures on
                    philosophy and theology. It was during this time that he began his career as an
                    author. The first production of his pen was his <hi rend="italic">Dogmatische
                    Entwicklung aller</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">der Dogmatik
                    vorkommenden Begriffe nach den Symbolischen Schriften der
                    evangelisch-lutherischen und reformirten Kirche und den wichtigsten dogmatischen
                    Lehrbüchern ihrer Theologen, nebst</hi><hi rend="italic">dei'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Literatur vorzüglich der neueren über alle Theile der
                    Dogmatik,</hi> w hich appeared in 1805, and reached a fourth edition in 1841,
                    and which is distinguished for the complete account which it contains of the
                    literature of the subject. This w as follow ed by other works, among which may
                    be named an edition of the hook of Ecclesiasticus with a commentary in Latin,
                    which was intended to form part of a larger work upon the Apocryphal books of
                    the Old Testament,—an undertaking that was never carried out. The advance of the
                    French army under Napoleon into Prussia after the battle of Austerlitz
                    determined Bretschneider to leave Wittenberg, which as a fortified town was
                    liable to be exposed to all the horrors of a siege. He accordingly abandoned his
                    university career, and, through the good offices of his friend Reinhard,
                    obtained the pastorate of Schneeberg in Saxony, on the duties of which he
                    entered in March 1807. In 1808 he was promoted to the office of superintendent
                    of the church of Annaberg, which, in addition to the properly clerical duties
                    which belonged to the charge, involved the consideration of many matters
                    belonging to the department of ecclesiastical law, which had to be decided in
                    accordance with the canon law of Saxony. Bretschneider, however, devoted himself
                    energetically to his duties. “The <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris Saxonici,”</hi>
                    he says, “was almost always on my table, and I soon became perfectly acquainted
                    with its contents.” In Annaberg he passed eight years, during which time he
                    twice declined the offer of a professorship of theology, once from Königsberg
                    and once from Berlin. The climate, how ever, did not agree with him, and in
                    consequence of the demands made upon him by the discharge of his official
                    duties, he was prevented from devoting sufficient time to his theological
                    studies. He, therefore, began to desire a change. With a view’ to this, he
                    publicly took the degree of doctor of theology in Wittenberg in August 1812. The
                    subject of his thesis was “Capita Theologiae Judaicae,” as gathered chiefly from
                    the writings of Josephus. It was the last public doctorate of the kind, and cost
                    him 300 thalers (&lt;£45), “an expense,” he remarks, “which he often regretted,
                    as the title w as shortly after made common.” It may have been some little
                    consolation to him that the people of Annaberg on his return commemorated his
                    promotion in a number of poems composed for the occasion.</p>
                <p>The desired change came at last. In 1816, on the death of Loeffler, general
                    superintendent at Gotha, he was appointed, on the recommendation of Von Ammon,
                    Reinhard’s successor at Dresden, to the vacant post, in which he remained until
                    his death in 1848. This was the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n305/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0305-0262"/> great period of his literary activity. By a
                    careful economy of time, he was able to discharge his official duties, and yet
                    to possess sufficient leisure for theological study. Of the various productions
                    of his pen, which appeared during his residence at Gotha, the following are
                    specially worthy of note. In 1820 was published his treatise on the gospel of St
                    John, entitled <hi rend="italic">Probabilia</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Evangelii</hi><hi rend="italic">et Epistolarum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Joannis</hi><hi rend="italic">Apostoli</hi><hi rend="italic">indole</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et origine</hi><hi rend="italic">eruditorum judiciis modeste
                    subjecit</hi><hi rend="italic">K.</hi><hi rend="italic">G. Bretschneider.</hi>
                    The sensation which this work produced was immense. In it he collected together
                    with great fulness, and discussed with marked moderation of tone, the various
                    arguments which seem to prove the non-Johannine authorship of the gospel. As
                    might have been expected, it called forth a host of replies, several of which
                    proceeded from some of the ablest scholars and divines of the day. To the
                    astonishment of every one, Bretschneider announced in the preface to the second
                    edition of his <hi rend="italic">Dogmatik</hi> in 1822, that he had never
                    believed in the non-authenticity of the gospel, that he had only published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Probabilia</hi> to draw attention to the subject, and to call
                    forth a more complete defence of its genuineness, an object which he considered
                    had now been fully accomplished. Whatever may have been the effect produced on
                    the mind of Bretschneider himself by the various replies which appeared, they
                    certainly did not remove the doubts of others, for the controversy still appears
                    as far from being definitely settled as it was when the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Probabilia</hi> appeared more than half a century ago. Bretschneider remarks in
                    his autobiography that the publication of this work had the effect of preventing
                    his appointment as successor to Tittmann in Dresden, the minister Von Einsiedel
                    violently opposing the proposal of the city council to call Bretschneider to the
                    office, and denouncing him as the “slanderer of John” <hi rend="italic">(Der
                    Johannis Schänder).</hi></p>
                <p>The work by which Bretschneider conferred the greatest service upon the science
                    of exegesis was his <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Manuale</hi><hi rend="italic">Groeco-Latinum</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi

                    >Testamenti,</hi> which appeared in 1824, and which attained a third edition in
                    1840. This work is valuable for the use which its author made of the Greek of
                    the Septuagint, of the Old and New Testament Apocrypha, of Josephus, and of the
                    apostolic fathers in illustration of the language of the New Testament.</p>
                <p>Bretschneider’s dogmatic writings were very numerous, aud many of them passed
                    through several editions. The only one which has been translated into English is
                    his <hi rend="italic">Manual of the Religion and History of the Christian
                    Church,</hi> which appeared in 1857.</p>
                <p>The dogmatic position of Bretschneider seems to be intermediate between the
                    extreme school of naturalists, such as Paulus, Röhr, and Wegscheider on the one
                    hand, and that of Strauss and Baur on the other. Recognizing a supernatural
                    element in Scripture, he nevertheless allowed to the full the critical exercise
                    of reason in the interpretation of its dogmas. As a theologian he was deficient
                    in speculative power, and his writings are marked by a certain dryness. His
                    mental strength lay in the possession of a clear, cool judgment, which he never
                    allowed to be influenced by feeling, and in the faculty of untiring
                    industry.</p>
