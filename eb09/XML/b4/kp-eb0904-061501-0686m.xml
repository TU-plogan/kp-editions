                    Megarians, 667 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but the original settlement
                    having been destroyed in the reign of Darius Hystaspes by the Satrap Otanes, it
                    was recolonized by Pausanias, who wrested it from the hands of the Medes after
                    the battle of Plataea (479 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)— a circumstance which
                    has led several ancient chroniclers to ascribe its foundation to him. Its
                    situation, said to have been fixed by the oracle of Apollo, was remarkable for
                    beauty and security. Its position on the Bosphorus gave it complete control over
                    the extensive corn-trade carried on by the merchants of the West with the
                    northern shores of the Euxine; the absence of tides and the depth of its harbour
                    rendered its quays accessible to vessels of large burden; while the tunny and
                    other fisheries at the mouth of the Lycus were so lucrative as to procure for
                    the deeply-curved bay into which that river fell the appellation of the Golden
                    Horn. The greatest hindrance to its continued prosperity consisted in the
                    miscellaneous character of the population, partly Lacedaemonian and partly
                    Athenian, who flocked to it under Pausanias. From this circumstance it was a
                    subject of dispute between these states, and was alternately in the possession
                    of each, till it achieved its independence of both only to fall into the hands
                    of the Macedonians; and from the same cause arose the violent contests of its
                    intestine factions, which ended in the establishment of a rude and turbulent
                    democracy. About seven years after its second colonization, Cimon wrested it
                    from the Lacedaemonians; but in 440 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> it revolted
                    and returned to its former allegiance. Alcibiades, after a severe blockade (408
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), gained possession of the city through the
                    treachery of the Athenian party; and it continued an ally of Athens until 405
                    B.C., when it was retaken by Lysander after the battle of Aegos-potami, and
                    placed under a Spartan harmost. It was under the Lacedaemonian power when the
                    Ten Thousand, exasperated by the conduct of the governor, made themselves
                    masters of the city, and would have pillaged it had they not been repressed by
                    the firmness and promptitude of Xenophon. In 390 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Thrasybulus, with the assistance of Heraclides and Arche-bius, succeeded in
                    expelling the Lacedaemonian oligarchy, and in restoring democracy and the
                    Athenian influence both in Byzantium and Chalcedon. After having withstood an
                    attempt under Epaminondas to restore it to the Lacedaemonians, Byzantium joined
                    with Rhodes, Chios, Cos, and Mausolus, king of Caria, in throwing off the yoke
                    of Athens, but soon after sought Athenian assistance when Philip of Macedon,
                    having overrun Thrace, advanced against it. The succours which were sent from
                    Athens under Chares, on their arrival suffered a severe defeat from Amyntas, the
                    Macedonian admiral, but in the following year gained a decisive victory under
                    Phocion, and compelled Philip to raise the siege. The deli verandi of the
                    besieged from a surprise, by means of a flash of light which revealed the
                    advancing masses of the Macedonian army, has rendered this siege peculiarly
                    memorable. As a memorial of the miraculous interference the Byzantines erected
                    an altar to Torch-bearing Hecate, and stamped a cresc,ent on their coins as a
                    symbol of the portent, a device which is retained by the Turks to this day. They
                    also granted the Athenians extraordinary privileges, and erected a monument in
                    honour of the event in a public part of the city. During the reign of Alexander,
                    Byzantium was compelled to acknowledge the Macedonian supremacy; after the decay
                    of the Macedonian power, it regained its independence, but suffered from the
                    repeated incursions of the Scythians. The losses which they sustained by land
                    roused the Byzantines to indemnify themselves on the vessels which still crow
                    ded the harbour, and the merchantmen which cleared the straits; but this had the
                    effect of provoking a war with the neighbouring naval powers. The exchequer
                    being drained by the payment of 10,000 pieces of gold to buy off the Gauls who
                    had invaded their territories about 279 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and by
                    the imposition of an annual tribute which was ultimately raised to 80 talents,
                    they were compelled to exact a toll on all the ships which passed the
                    Bosphorus,— a measure which the Rhodians resented and avenged by a war, wherein
                    the Byzantines were defeated. The retreat of the Gauls enabled Byzantium to
                    render considerable services to Rome in the contests with Philip II., Antiochus,
                    and Mithridates. During the first years of its alliance with Rome it held the
                    rank of a free and confederate city; but having sought the arbitration of the
                    capital on some of its domestic disputes, it was subjected to the imperial
                    jurisdiction, and gradually stripped of its privileges, until reduced to the
                    status of an ordinary Roman colony. In recollection of its former services, the
                    Emperor Claudius remitted the heavy tribute which had been imposed on it; but
                    the last remnant of its independence was taken away by Vespasian, who, in answer
                    to a remonstrance from Apollonius of Tyana, taunted the inhabitants with having
                    “forgotten to be free.” During the civil wars, it espoused the party of
                    Pescennius Niger; and though skilfully defended by the engineer Periscus, it was
                    besieged and taken (196 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> by Severus, who
                    destroyed the city, demolished the famous wall, which was built of massive
                    stones so closely rivetted together as to appear one block, put the principal
                    inhabitants to the sword, and subjected the remainder to the Perinthians. This
                    overthrow of Byzantium was a great loss to the empire, since it might have
                    served as an effective protection against the Goths, who afterwards sailed past
                    it into the Mediterranean. Severus, however, afterwards relented, and,
                    rebuilding a large portion of the town, gave it the name of Augusta Antonina. He
                    ornamented the city with baths, and surrounded the hippodrome with porticoes;
                    but it was not till the time of Caracalla that it was restored to its former
                    political privileges. It had scarcely begun to recover its former flourishing
                    position when, from the capricious resentment of Gallienus, the inhabitants were
                    once more put to the sword, and the town given up to be pillaged. From this
                    disaster the inhabitants recovered so far as to be able to give an effectual
                    check to an invasion of the Goths in the reign of Claudius II., and its
                    fortifications were greatly strengthened during the civil wars which followed
                    the abdication of Diocletian. Licinius, after his defeat before Adrianople,
                    retired to Byzantium, where he was besieged by Constantine, and compelled to
                    surrender. To check the inroads of the barbarians on the north of the Black Sea,
                    Diocletian had resolved to transfer his capital to Nicomedia; but Constantine,
                    struck with the advantages which the situation of Byzantium presented, resolved
                    to build a new city there on the site -of the old, and transfer the seat of
                    government to it. The design was quickly put into execution, and the new capital
                    was inaugurated with special ceremonies 330 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Constantinople.</hi></p>
                <p>The ancient historians invariably note the profligacy of the inhabitants of
                    Byzantium. They are described as an idle and depraved people, spending their
                    time for the most part in loitering about the harbour, or carousing over the
                    fine wine of Maronea. In war they trembled at the sound of a trumpet, in peace
                    they quaked before the shouting of their own demagogues; and during the assault
                    of Philip II. they could only be prevailed on to man the walls by the savour of
                    extempore cook-shops distributed along the ramparts. The modern Greeks attribute
                    the introduction of Christianity into Byzantium to St Andrew; and it cer-*
                    tainly had some hold there in the time of Severus.</p>
