                    Bándá; the semi-independent states of Orchhá or Tehrí, Datiyá, and Samthar; and
                    the following petty states held under grants from the British Government,
                    viz.:—Ajegarh, Alípurá, Ashtgarhí Jágír, Tori-Fathpur, Bijná and Pahárí Banká,
                    Bárondá, Báwaní, Berí, Bíhat, Bijáwar, Charkhárí, seven Chaubiyáná Kalinjár
                    Jágírs, Chhatrapur, Garraulí, Gáuríhar, Jasú, Jigní, Khaniyá Dháná, Lughásí,
                    Naigáon Ribahí, Panná, and Sarilá. Length of Bundelkhand—200 miles from S.E. to
                    N.W.; breadth, 155 miles; area variously estimated from 18,099 to 23,817 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The surface of the country is uneven and hilly, except in the N.E. part, which
                    forms an irregular plain cut up by ravines scooped out by torrents during the
                    periodical rains. The plains of Bundelkhand are intersected by three mountain
                    ranges, the Bindháchal, Panná, and Bander chains, the highest elevation not
                    exceeding 2000 feet above sea-level. Beyond these ranges the country is further
                    diversified by isolated hills rising abruptly from a common level, and
                    presenting from their steep and nearly inaccessible scarps eligible sites for
                    castles and strongholds, whence the mountaineers of Bundelkhand have frequently
                    set at defiance the most powerful of the native states of India. The general
                    slope of the country is towards the north-east, as indicated by the course of
                    the rivers which traverse or bound the territory, and finally discharge
                    themselves into the Jumna.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers are the Sindh, Betwá, Ken, Baighin, Paisuní, Tons, Pahuj,
                    Dhasán, Bermá, Urmal, and Chandra-wál. The Sindh, rising near Sironj in Málwa,
                    marks the frontier line of Bundelkhand on the side of Gwalior. Parallel to this
                    river, but more to the eastward, is the course of the Betwá. Still further to
                    the east flows the Ken, followed in succession by the Baighin, Paisuní, and
                    Tons. The Jumna and the Ken are the only two navigable rivers. Notwithstanding
                    the large number of streams, the depression of their channels and height of
                    their banks render them for the most part unsuitable for the purposes of
                    irrigation,—which is conducted by means of <hi rend="italic">jhils</hi> and
                    tanks. These artificial lakes are usually formed by throwing embankments across
                    the lower extremities of valleys, and thus arresting and accumulating the waters
                    flowing through them. Some of the tanks are of great capacity: the Barwá Ságar,
                    for instance, is 2½ miles in diameter. Diamonds are found, particularly near the
                    town of Panná, in a range of hills called by the natives Band-Ahil.</p>
                <p>The mines of Mahárájpur, Rájpur, Kimerá, and Gadásiá contain the finest diamonds;
                    one dug from the last is reputed to be the largest in the world. It was kept in
                    the fort of Kalinjas among the treasures of Rájá Himmat Bahádur. In the reign of
                    the Emperor Akbar the mines of Panná produced diamonds to the amount of £100,000
                    annually, and were a considerable source of revenue, but for many years they
                    have not been so profitable.</p>
                <p>The tree vegetation consists rather of jungle or copse than forest, abounding in
                    game which is preserved by the native chiefs. There are also within these
                    coverts several varieties of wild animals, such as the tiger, leopard, hyena,
                    Wild boar, <hi rend="italic">nilg</hi><hi rend="italic">á</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >i,</hi> and jackal.</p>

                <p>British Bundelkhand contains a population of 2,161,495 souls. The total
                    population of Bundelkhand, British and native, has been estimated at 2,260,714.
                    The people represent various races. The Bundelâs,—the race who gave the name to
                    the country,—still maintain their dignity as chieftains, by disdaining to
                    cultivate the soil, although by no means conspicuous for lofty sentiments of
                    honour or morality. An Indian proverb avers that “one native of Bundelkhand
                    commits as much fraud as a hundred Dandis” (weighers of grain, and notorious
                    rogues). About Datiyá and Jhánsi the inhabitants are a stout and handsome race
                    of men, well off and contented.</p>
                <p>The prevailing religion in Bundelkhand is Hinduism.</p>
                <p>The principal crops are wheat, <hi rend="italic">jo</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Allahábád to Nasirábád through Bándá; (2), from Fathipur to Ságar through Bándá;

                    line of the East Indian Railway passes through the native states of Bundelkhand.

                    Mahobá, and Tehárí. The climate of Bundelkhand is sultry and unhealthy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">History.</hi> —Chandra Varma, chief of the Chandel R á
                    jputs, appears to have established the earliest paramount power in Bundelkhand
                    towards the close of the 9th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Under his
                    dynasty the country attained its greatest splendour in the early part of the
                    11th century, when its R á j á, whose dominions extended from the Jumna to the
                    Nerbudda, marched at the head of 36,000 horse and 45,000 foot, with 640
                    elephants, to oppose the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni. In 1183 the Chandel
                    dynasty was overthrown by Pirthwi R á j, the ruler of Ajmir and Delhi, after
                    which the country remained in ruinous anarchy until the close of the 14th
                    century, when the Bundel á s, a spurious offshoot of the Garhw á tribe of
                    Rajputs, established themselves on the right bank of the Jumna. One of these
                    took possession of Urch á by treacherously poisoning its chief. His successor
                    succeeded in further aggrandizing the Bundel á state, but he is represented to
                    have been a notorious plunderer, and his character is further stained by the
                    assassination of the celebrated Abulfazl, the prime minister and historian of
                    Akbar. Jajhar Sinh, the third Bundel á chief, unsuccessfully revolted against
                    the court of Delhi, and his country became incorporated for a short time with
                    the empire. The struggles of the Bundel á s for independence resulted in the
                    withdrawal of the royal troops, and the admission of several petty states as
                    feudatories of the empire on condition of military service. The Bundel á s,
                    under Champat Râi and his son Chhatra Sâl, offered a successful resistance to
                    the proselytizing efforts of Aurungzebe. On the occasion of a Mahometan invasion
                    in 1732, Chhatra Sâl asked and obtained the assistance of the Marhattâ Peshwâ,
                    whom he adopted as his son, giving him a third of his dominions. The Marhattâs
                    gradually extended their influence over Bundelkhand, and in 1792 the Peshwâ was
                    acknowledged as the lord paramount of the country. The Marhattâ {&gt;ower was,
                    however, on the decline; the flight of the Peshwâ from ιis capital to Bassein
                    before the British arms changed the aspect of affairs, and by the treaty
                    concluded between the Peshwâ and the British Government, the districts of Bândâ
                    and Hamirpur were transferred to the latter. Two chiefs then held the ceded
                    districts, Himmat Bahâdur, the leader of the Sanyâsïs, who promoted the views of
                    the British, and Shamsher, who made common cause with the Marhattâs. In
                    September 1803, the united forces of the English and Himmat Bahadur compelled
                    Shamsher to retreat with his army. In 1809 Ajaigarh was besieged by a British
                    force, and again three years later Kalinjâr was besieged and taken aftςr a heavy
                    loss. In 1817, by the treaty of Poonah the British Government acquired from the
                    Peshwâ all his rights, interests, and pretensions, feudal, territorial, or
                    pecuniary, in Bundelkhand. In carrying out the provisions of the treaty, an
                    assurance was given by the British Government that the rights of those
                    interested in the transfer should be scrupulously respected, and the host of
                    petty native principalities in the province is the best proof of the sincerity
                    and good faith with which this clause has been carried out. During the mutiny'of
                    1857, however, many of the chiefs rose against us, especially the Râni of
                    Jhânsi.</p>
