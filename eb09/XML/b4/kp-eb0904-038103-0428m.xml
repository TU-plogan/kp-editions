                    Lord</hi></label>, an English statesman, was the eldest son of Sir Benjamin
                    Hobhouse, first baronet, and was born at Redlands, Bristol, June 27, 1786. He
                    was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took
                    his degree of B.A. in 1808. During his residence at Cambridge he became the
                    intimate friend of Lord Byron; and in the summer of 1809 the two friends set out
                    together on a tour in the South of Europe. They visited Spain (then the theatre
                    of the great war with Napoleon), Portugal, Greece. Albania, and Turkey. The
                    winter was spent at <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0429-0382"/> Athens, and in 1810 Hobhouse returned home. In
                    the campaigns of 1813 and 1814 he accompanied the allied armies, and was present
                    at the great battle of Dresden. In the winter of 1816-17 he rejoined Byron in
                    Italy, and they visited Venice and Rome together. Hobhouse had been trained in
                    the Liberal school of politics, and had written pamphlets and .review articles
                    in defence of liberal doctrines. He had by this time become what was then
                    contemptuously called a “downright radical.” In 1816 he published anonymously a
                    work in two volumes entitled, <hi rend="italic">The Substance of some Letters
                    written by an English Gentleman Resident at Paris during the last Reign of the
                    Emperor Napoleon.</hi> His aim in it was to correct certain misrepresentations
                    which were current of the events of the Hundred Days. The tone of the book gave
                    great offence to the English Government; and being translated into French was
                    equally offensive to the Government of the Restoration. The French translator
                    and printer were both prosecuted in 1819 for “atrocious libel” on the
                    Government; and were sentenced to fine and imprisonment, the former for twelve
                    months, the latter for six. On l 3th December of the same year the speaker’s
                    warrant was issued for the arrest of Hobhouse, and he was committed to Newgate.
                    He made an unsuccessful application to Chief-Justice Abbott (Lord Tenterden) for
                    discharge by <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus,</hi> and he was not liberated till
                    about the end of February. The treatment which he had suffered gave him the
                    prestige of a martyr to the dominant Toryism, and in the eyes of the multitude
                    this was his glory. At the close of 1818 he had contested the borough of
                    Westminster, Sir Francis Burdett desiring him as a colleague, and giving
                    J&gt;1000 towards the necessary expenses of his candidature. But he was beaten
                    by his rival, George Lamb, the brother of Lord Melbourne. He now came forward
                    again, and was returned by a large majority (1820). In the first session of
                    parliament he produced a powerful impression, first by his severe speech on the
                    suppression of a Liberal meeting at Oldham, and soon after by the vigorous
                    support he gave to the bill for disfranchising the borough of Grampound. During
                    the next twelve years he was the ardent and courageous advocate of all Liberal
                    measures,—among them, of the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, and of
                    Catholic Emancipation. In August 1831 he succeeded to the baronetcy, and six
                    months later was called to office as Secretary for War under the ministry of
                    Earl Grey. In April 1833 he was named Chief-Secretary for Ireland, but lost his
                    seat at the new election. In the following year he was returned M.P. for
                    Nottingham, and received the appointment of Chief-Commissioner of Woods and
                    Forests under Lord Melbourne. Retiring with the Liberal party in the autumn, he
                    resumed office in April 1835 as President of the Board of Control, a post for
                    which lie was well qualified, and which he held till September 1841. He was
                    recalled to the same office under the Russell Administration in 1846, and held
                    it till 1852. Meanwhile he had lost his seat for Nottingham and had been
                    returned for Harwich. In 1851 he was raised to the peerage, and from that time
                    showed himself disposed to “rest and be thankful.” He gradually ceased to take
                    part in public affairs, and returned to the studies and literary enjoyments of
                    his youth. Lord Broughton published a volume of <hi rend="italic">Imitations and
                    Translations from the Classics</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> an account of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Journey through Albania and other Provinces</hi> o∕ <hi
                    rend="italic">Turkey with Lord Byron</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi

                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Childe HaroldP</hi> He was also a
                    contributor to periodical literature. In 1828 he married Lady Julia Hay,
                    youngest daughter of the Marquis of Tweeddale, by whom he had three daughters,
                    but no son. His wife died many years before him. Lord Broughton died in London,
                    June 3, 1869. As he left no male issue his peerage became extinct.</p>
