                    It is bounded on the N. by the River Mâhi, on the E. and S. by the territory of
                    the Gaikwar, and on the W. by the Gulf of Cambay. Consisting chiefly of the
                    alluvial plain at the mouth of the River Nerbudda, the land is rich and highly
                    cultivated, and though it is without forests it is not wanting in trees. The
                    district is well supplied with rivers, having in addition to the Nerbudda, the
                    Mahi in the north and the Kini in the south. The area is 1320 square miles; the
                    population 350,322, of whom 248,343 are Hindus, 69,033 Mahometans, 3986
                    Buddhists, 3116 Fàrsis, and 24,703 belong to the aboriginal tribes. The
                    population comprises several distinct races or castes, who, while speaking a
                    common dialect, Gujarâthi, inhabit separate villages. Thus there are Koli Kembi
                    or Voro (Borah) villages, and others whose lands are almost entirely held and
                    cultivated by high castes, such as Râjputs, Bréh-mans, or Pârsfs.</p>
                <p>Except in the city of Broach, which has two steam ginning factories and a
                    considerable general trade, agriculture is almost the sole industry of the
                    district. The export of cotton, the principal agricultural product, amounted in
                    1872 to 88,471 bales. The most important cereal and pulse corps are—for the

                    £318,972, of which £266,936 was imperial land revenue; £20,568 on account of the
                    local land cess; stamps yielded £22,714; excise, £6823; and assessed taxes,
                    £193. The imperial expenditure in the district amounted during the same time to
                    £72,025. Of the whole area of the district, viz., 1320 square miles, 7 2 per
                    cent, are returned as cultivated, 3 per cent, cultivable but not actually under
                    tillage, and 25 per cent., including the sites of villages, river-beds, &amp;c.,
                    as uncultivable. There are five towns with a population of over 5000
                    inhabitants,—Broach, 36,932; Jambusar, 14,924; Ankleswar, 9414; Amod, 6125; and
                    Gajera, 5239. In the first two of these towns municipalities have been
                    established. The district contains 191 schools, with an attendance of 6525
                    scholars. The total number of persons receiving or who have received some
                    education amounts to 9 ’ 5 per cent, of the entire population. The strength of
                    the district police force is 415, giving to each man the charge of three square
                    miles and 844 inhabitants. The principal criminal class is the Bhils, numbering
                    about 24,000. The difficulty of arresting offenders of this race is increased by
                    the fact that they are in league with members of their tribe in the native
                    states of Baroda and Rajpιpla, and can therefore with ease escape into foreign
                    territory.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Broach,</hi> the principal place of the district of the same
                    name, situated on an elevated mound, supposed to be artificial, on the northern
                    bank of the Nerbudda, about 30 miles above its mouth, in 21° 42' N. lat. and 73°
                    2' E. long. The river is here a noble sheet of water, two miles wide at ebb
                    tide, but shallow for the most part even at flood-tide, though there is then a
                    deep but intricate channel admitting vessels of considerable burden. In 1872 the
                    population of the town and municipality was returned at 36,932. As in the
                    generality of eastern towns, the streets are narrow and the houses lofty. It has
                    a considerable trade, and annually exports large quantities of raw cotton to
                    Bombay. Broach is thought with some appearance of probability to have been the
                    Barygaza of Ptolemy and Arrian. Upon the conquest of Guzerat by the Mahometans,
                    and the formation of the state of that name, Broach formed part of the new
                    kingdom. On its overthrow by Akbar in 1572, it was annexed to the Mughul empire
                    and governed by a Nawáb. The Marhattás became its masters in 1685, from which
                    period it was held in subordination to the Peshwá until 1772, when it was
                    captured by a force under General Wedderburn (brother to Lord Loughborough), who
                    was killed in the assault. In 1783 it was ceded by the British to Sindhiá in
                    acknowledgment of certain services. It was stormed in 1803 by a detachment
                    commanded by Colonel Woodington, and was finally ceded to the East India Company
                    by Sindhiá under the treaty of Serji Anjangáon. Distance north from Bombay 190
                    miles.</p>
