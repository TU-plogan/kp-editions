                    from Bristol Channel, with which the port communicates by the Avon. That river,

                    to Loudon. On this second visit he became acquainted with some of the leading
                    Abolitionists, and attempted to set up in Paris a <hi rend="italic">Society of
                    the Friends of the Blacks.</hi> As an agent of this society he paid a visit to
                    the United States, and returned just at the outbreak of the Revolution. Into
                    this great movement Brissot threw himself heart and soul. He edited the <hi

                    soon began to take a prominent part in affairs. In the National Assembly he
                    leagued himself with the party, well known in history as the Girondists, but
                    then frequently called the <hi rend="italic">Brissotins.</hi> Of this party he
                    was in many respects the ruling spirit. Vergniaud certainly was far superior to
                    him in oratory, but Brissot was quick, eager, impetuous, and a man of wide
                    knowledge. But he was at the same time timid and vacillating, and not qualified
                    to struggle against the fierce energies roused by the events of the Revolution.

                    constituted a distinct county in itself by a charter of Edward III. Its
                    geological position is on the New Red Sandstone, which rises above the alluvial
                    deposit of the rivers, while deep beneath these layers would be found the coal
                    measures that succeed the millstone grit beds of the adjacent hills (250 feet in
                    height) of Brandon and Kingsdown. The origin of the name is doubtful. Mr Seyer,
                    the historian of Bristol, gives forty-two variations in the spelling of the
                    word, and after showing attempted derivations from Brennus, the legendary
                    founder of the town, Brictric, its Saxon lord, &lt;tc., finally decides for

                    vestiges of Roman occupation, however, on the site of the ancient city are
                    scanty, and consist almost solely in the discovery at different spots of some
                    coins of Severus and other emperors. <hi rend="italic">Caer Brito,</hi> one of
                    the thirty-three early cities of Britain mentioned by Nennius, is interpreted by
                    Henry of Huntingdon (1154 A.D.) to mean Bristol. If (as now municipally) the
                    name include the outlying heights of Clifton this interpretation may be adopted
                    with less hesitation. 300 feet above the surface of the Avon, on both sides of
                    the river, are Belgic British camps, with traces of superadded Roman work, one
                    of which is comparatively perfect, a second of well-marked outline, while a
                    third lias been wantonly destroyed within the last two or three years. The
                    existence of coins of Canute, of Harold I., of Hardicanute, of Edward the
                    Confessor and of Harold IL, of Bristol mintage, shows that the place was a
                    centre of population under the Danes and Anglo-Saxons, but there is no positive
                    mention of a Danish invasion except by Polydore Vergil, a 16th century
                    historian</p>
                <p>The history of the town hardly begins till the subjugation of Gloucestershire by
                    the Conqueror, in 1068. Bristol is not specially named, but there is no reason
                    to believe that it offered any futile resistance to the sweeping tide of
                    conquest. Early in the following year, three sons of Harold, —Godwin, Edmund,
                    and Magnus,—resolving to reconquer the kingdom their sire had lost with his
                    life, came at the head of fifty-two ships from Ireland up the Bristol Channel,
                    and laying waste the coast on their way, sailed up the Avon to Bristol. Here
                    they were sharply repulsed by the townsmen, and afterwards more thoroughly
                    routed by Geoffry Mowbray, bishop of Coutance, nephew to the famous Tancred the
                    crusader <hi rend="italic">(Biog.</hi><hi rend="italic">Univers.)</hi> Though
                    Bristol is mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Domesday,</hi> Bristol Castle is not,
                    but appears first in history in connection with the constableship of the martial
                    prelate just named, who held the fortress for Robert duke of Normandy against
                    William Rufus. When the king had crushed the insurrection and driven the rebel
                    churchman out of the realm, he granted the royalty, or Honour of Gloucester,
                    which included Bristol, to his kinsman Robert Fitzhamon, who thus became feudal
                    chief of the territory. Fitzhamon’s daughter, Mabel, marrying Robert earl of
                    Gloucester, natural son of Henry I., that noble, upon the death of his
                    father-in-law, became lord of the tower and town of Bristol. He rebuilt the
                    castle, which soon received as captive within its walls Robert duke of Normandy,
                    who was afterwards removed to Gloucester’s stronghold at Cardiff. The red earl
                    of Gloucester, as he was called, was the most powerful baron of his age; and
                    among his successes in war, was the capture .of king Stephen at the battle of
                    Lincoln, who was brought to Bristol, and, like Curthose, imprisoned in the
                    castle, where he remained in chains till exchanged for Gloucester himself, who
                    in his turn was defeated and captured by Stephen’s queen at Winchester. Earl
                    Robert died in 1147</p>
                <p>and was succeeded by William his son, whose daughter, Avisa, marrying John earl
                    of Moreton, afterwards king John, the town and castle of Bristol became an
                    apanage to the crown, and as such it continued to the time of Charles I. John
                    was as many as nineteen times at Bristol, the neighbouring forest of Kingswood,
                    which stretched 14 miles square to the east of the city, no doubt resounding
                    frequently to the cry of his hunt.</p>
                <p>Henry I IL, upon the death of John, came for security to Bristol Castle, when he
                    permitted the town to choose a mayor after the manner of London; and in like
                    usage that the mayor of London was sworn before the constable of the Tower, so
                    here he was directed to be sworn before the constable of the castle of Bristol,
                    each fortress being distinct from its respective city. This feudal custom was
                    continued here until Edward III. conceded, among other chartered benefits, that
                    the new mayor should take oath of office before the retiring mayor in the
                    Guildhall of Bristol in the presence of the commonalty. Other privileges from
                    the same monarch were the establishment here of the woolstaple, and the
                    empowering of the mayor and sheriff to elect from time to time forty of the
                    “better and more honest” men of the town, as a council to rate and levy taxes,
                    &amp;c., which common council, in nearly the same form as instituted, is yet
                    maintained.</p>
                <p>Richard II. confirmed all the grants of his predecessors, and directed that the
                    steward and marshal and clerk of the royal household should not sit in the town
                    of Bristol, as before had been granted to the city of London. In 1387 the king
                    was at Bristol castle “with,” says Froissart, “the queen and all the ladies and
                    damsels of her court,” having accompanied thus far his favourite, De Vere,
                    towards Ireland. Two years later Henry Bolingbroke, with his vast northern army,
                    surrounded the walls of this important western city which immediately
                    surrendered. After four days’ siege the castle also capitulated, one of the
                    terms of the treaty with the duke of York, agreed to by its governor, Sir
                    William Courtnay, being that Lord Scrope, earl of Wilts, Sir Henry Green, and
                    Sir John Busbie, who were within its walls, should be delivered into the hands
                    of the duke of Lancaster. In Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">Richard II.</hi> is
                    a scene wherein Bolingbroke denounces these minions of the falling cause, and
                    orders Lord Northumberland to sçe them despatched. They were beheaded in the
                    centre of the town, where then stood the high cross. Only a few years since an
                    unsuccessful attempt was made in the House of Lords to revive the peerage of
                    Wilts, which included the right to wear a kingly crown in the Isle of Man, that
                    peerage having been dormant from the time Sir William Scrope here lost his head.
                    In 1408 Lord Spencer, another adherent of the ruined dynasty, was also executed
                    at the same spot.</p>
                <p>By a charter of Henry VI. the town of Bristol, with its gates, ditches, walls,
                    and markets, was farmed to the mayor and burgesses for sixty years at the annual
                    rent of £102, 15s. 6d. to the king’s household, and £57, 4s. 6d. to the abbot of
                    Tewkesbury and to the castle. This yearly fine of £160 was granted by Edward IV.
                    to Elizabeth his queen consort Richard III. released £60 of this rent, and the
                    remainder was redeemed in the reign of Charles I.</p>
                <p>The doctrines of the Reformation were preached here by Tyndale, Cranmer, and
                    Latimer. The issue of the dissolution of religious houses, of which thirteen
                    encircled the outer walls of the city, was the erection here of a bishopric
                    (1542) by the conversion of the abbey church of Austin canons into a cathedral.
                    It has singularly escaped the notice of every writer that the episcopate was
                    refounded in 1551, by power of letters apostolic directed by Pope Paul IV. to
                    Cardinal Pole; a MS. copy of the original Bull is in the Bristol Museum. The
                    transitional epoch from the Papal to the Protestant faith was stained here by
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n397/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0397-0350"/> blood of five martyrs; to which number we may add
                    a sixth, James Duke, who belonged to Bristol, but suffered in Kent. About the
                    beginning of autumn 1559 “the church wardens of all the churches of Bristow,”
                    says an unpublished chronicle noticed below, “and apme of the ministers, brought
                    forth their roods and other images, which were in their churches, to the High
                    Cross where they were burnt.”</p>
                <p>The detachment of the castle from the county of Gloucester, and its grant to and
                    incorporation with the town of Bristol by Charles I. (1629) at the request of
                    Henrietta Maria, was another important surrender from the Crown, but the charter
                    cost the city .£949, and the castle was to be holden at a fine of £40 yearly. As
                    London was called the King’s Royal Chamber, so Bristol was called the Queen’s
                    Royal Chamber; but courtly favours were all practically cancelled by the
                    infliction of the ship-money tax. By the king’s writ (of October 20, 1634),
                    £6500 was charged on Bristol for this impost, and there were further taxations
                    in successive years. The payment of these assessments became at length so
                    dilatory as to draw down (1638) a sharp reprimand from Government upon the
                    mayor, with the threat,—“if you give not his majesty better satisfaction we
                    shall take a course to make you sensible of your duty” <hi rend="italic">{Cal.
                    State Papers).</hi></p>
                <p>The hurtful interference with the trade of the place (such as the limitation in
                    the manufacture of soap to 600 tons yearly, which article had been from the 12
                    th century, and is even now, one of the chief of Bristol productions) prepared
                    the way for the easy admission of Col. Essex and his troops, when in 1643 he
                    presented himself before the gates of the city. The Parliament held the place
                    from 5th December 1642 to 26th July in the following year, when Prince Rupert,
                    with his cavaliers, surrounded the walls, and storming at all points frightened
                    the governor, Col. Fiennes, who had succeeded Essex, into capitulation. In
                    August 1645 the city was assaulted by Fairfax and Cromwell, and on the 20th day
                    of the siege, it having been heard that the king was in full march upon the
                    west, a storm was decided upon, and after a sharp assault on the 11th of
                    September, Rupert surrendered. “We had not killed of ours in the storm,” says
                    Cromwell, “nor in all this siege, two hundred men. He who runs may read that all
                    this is none other than the work of God. He must be a very atheist that doth not
                    acknowledge it.” Ten years later the castle was demolished by order of the
                    Protector. The history during the next century and a half ⅛ unmarked by any very
                    striking events. The rise of Nonconformity; the persecution of the Quakers, of
                    whom 103 were in Bristol prisons at the accession of Charles II.; the visit of
                    the sanguinary Jefferies on his famous western assizes, when six persons were
                    condemned and executed on Redcliff hill, are some of the chief phases and
                    incidents during this period. In 1684 was given the charter granting that “the
                    citizens and inhabitants of Bristol and their successors hereafter for ever may
                    and shall be a body corporate in deed, fact, and name, by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">the Mayor, Burgesses, and Commonalty of the City of Bristol,</hi>
                    with a common seal.” In 1685 James II. stopped here on hi&amp;way to Sedgemoor;
                    and he again visited Bristol in the following year, and was handsomely
                    entertained. The bishop of Bristol at the time was Lake, one of the historical
                    seven, who was succeeded by Trelawny, another of the seven. The greatest
                    merchant in Bristol at this period was Edward Colston, whose profuse benevolence
                    has made his name splendid among the citizens. In the foundation of schools and
                    almshouses, repairs of churches, &amp;c., he gave £70,695, a vast sum in these
                    days. He died in 1721. Three influential societies instituted to his memory
                    yearly assemble at public dinners, where they collect alms for lying-in women,
                    for apprenticing boys, &amp;c. Up to the end of 1874 the amounts collected from
                    their commencement by these—the Dolphin, Anchor, and Grateful societies—have
                    attained an aggregate of £118,013. At the election of 1774 Bristol was
                    represented in the person of the famous Edmund Burke, but his policy did not
                    please all his constituents, and he consequently lost his seat here for the next
                    Parliament. His defensive speech on the hustings of Bristol “is one of the most
                    convincing pieces of popular oratory on record,” The Bridge Riots of 1793 and
                    the Reform Riots of 1831 are dark spots on the history of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bright-stow,</hi> or Bright-place, as old Fuller interpreted the name. The
                    former were the result of opposition to the prolonged impost of toll which it
                    was prevalently understood was to cease by a certain day. About forty persons
                    lost their lives by a charge of the military on this occasion. The Reform Riots
                    have been called “The Bristol Revolution,” but were simply a revolt of the
                    lowest stratum of society, in whom mania for plunder superseded all political
                    principle. Forty-five houses, the bishop’s palace, and the prisons were burnt to
                    the ground; twelve of the rioters were killed by the soldiers, several perished
                    in their own fires, four were hanged, thirty were imprisoned; the colonel of the
                    troops committed suicide, and the city was mulcted in £68,208 damages. The next
                    year the cholera visited the people, when 626 died of the malady.</p>
                <p>The nautical enterprise of Bristol has been worthy of a place that “seems to swim
                    on’ the waters” and struck the eye of Pope the poet as having its streets full
                    of ships. Some remarkable voyages from the port are recorded, but perhaps none
                    more memorable than that of Sebastian Cabot in 1497, who was the first
                    Englishman (for he was born in Bristol) who landed in America, and the earliest
                    to discover that portion of the continent now called the United States, and
                    thereby to secure its English colonization. The notice in a hitherto unpublished
                    local chronicle is as follows :— “This year (1497), on St John the Baptist’s
                    day, the land of America was found by the merchants of Bristowe in a ship of
                    Bristol called the ‘Matthew,’ the which said ship departed from the port of
                    Bristowe the 2d of May, and came home again 6th August following.” <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> A Bristol privateer brought home from Juan Fernandez
                    the real Robinson Crusoe. The saucy “Arethusa” frigate, celebrated for naval
                    daring by Dibdin in song and by Capt. Charnier in romance, was built at and
                    belonged to Bristol. The first steamboat built and fitted at the same port was
                    the “Wye,” in 1827. Bristol was the first city in the kingdom that established
                    regular steam communication with the United States, the first voyage having been
                    made by the “Great Western” in 1838. This vessel was built at Bristol at a cost
                    of £60,000. The “Great Britain” and the ill-fated “Demerara” were also built
                    here, the former costing £120,000.</p>
                <p>The creation of Bristol a free port in 1848 has resulted in great increase of
                    trade. The tonnage of foreign vessels (exclusive of Ireland) with cargoes
                    entering the town, was in 1846, 100,722; in 1873, 411,014; in 1874, 432,940.-
                    The quantity of grain of all kinds imported between April 1874 and April 1875
                    was 1,062,007 quarters; of wine, 7459 pipes; of timber, 34,740 tons; of sugar,
                    83,858 tons. With respect to the shoe manufacture, in January 1657, leave was
                    given by Government to Mr Ellis of Bristol, to send 1000 dozen of shoes to
                    Barbadoes, and another 1000 dozen in December. The combined shoe trade now
                    employs 5000 hands, one,firm, Derham’s, alone paying in wages £50,000 per annum.
                    Fry’s chocolate and cocoa works occupy between 500 and 600 hands. The soap trade
                    engages about 400 hands. In the Great Western Cotton Works about 1500 are
                    employed; in the stay trade 2000 people.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Architecture and Public Buildings.—</hi> To a few great
                    baronial families—the earls of Gloucester, the Berkeleys, and the Gaunts—in its
                    early history, and to a few great merchants—the Canyngs, the Shipwards, and
                    Framptons —in its later career, the architecture, principally ecclesiastical,
                    for which Bristol is famous, has been due. Though much of this has been
                    destroyed, much remains. Robert Fitzhamon’s Norman tower of St Peter, the oldest
                    church tower in Bristol, still presents its massive square to the eye. Of the
                    castle of Robert earl of Gloucester, the walls of which were 25 feet thick at
                    the base, nothing remains, but there still exist some walls and vaults of the
                    later stronghold, including a fine Early English cell. The grand nave of St
                    James’s church, which the same noble also erected, and wherein he was buried,
                    yet stands. Of Fitz Harding’s abbey of Austin canons, founded in 1142, the
                    stately entrance gateway, with its sculptured mouldings, has hardly been injured
                    by seven centuries’ exposure to rudeness of weather and greater rudeness of men.
                    The abbot’s gateway, the vestibule to the chapter room, and the chapter-room
                    itself, which is carved with Byzantine exuberance of decoration, and
                    acknowledged to be one of the grandest Norman rooms in Europe, are also perfect.
                    The Early English lady chapel, the geometrical east window, and the side aisles
                    in their singular design and beauty are other specific features of the abbey
                    church, now the cathedral. The nave just added to the 14th century structure has
                    cost to the present time £40,000. Besides the canopied tombs of the Berkeleys
                    with their effigies in chain mail, and similarly unique tombs of the crosiered
                    abbots, there are memorials. to Bishop Butler, to Sterne’s Eliza, and to Lady
                    Hesketh the friend of Cowper, who are all here interred. Also there is here
                    Mason’s touching epitaph: “Take holy earth, &amp;c.,” and monuments by Baily and
                    Chantrey. All Hallow’s church has a modern Italian campanile, but is in the main
                    15th century, with the retention of four Norman piers in the nave; and is
                    interesting from its connection with the ancient guild of calendars, whose
                    office it was “to convert Jews, instruct youths,” and keep the archives of the
                    town. Theirs was the first free library in the city, possibly in England. The
                    records of the ,church contain a singularly picturesque representation of the
                    ancient customs of the fraternity. The chapel of the Gaunts is 13 th and 14th
                    century, and presents with its rich panelled roof, pictured windows, carved
                    tabernacles and tombs, a concentration of mediaeval Gothic art. Of St Michael’s,
                    St Thomas’s, and Werburgh’s, only the towers (15th century) are preserved of the
                    old structures. St Nicholas church is modern, on a crypt of the date 1503 and
                    earlier. Temple church, with its leaning tower, 5 feet off the perpendicular,
                    retains nothing of the Templars’ period, but is a fine building of the Decorated
                    and following style. The tower and spire of St John’s (15th century) stand on
                    one of the gateways (same date) of the city. This church is a parallelogram,
                    without east or west windows or aisles, but is built upon a groined crypt. St
                    Mary le Port and St Augustine the Less are churches of the Perpendicular era,
                    and not the richest specimens of their kind. St Philip’s has an Early English
                    tower, but its external walls and windows are for the most part debased
                    Perpendicular. St Stephen’s church, built between 1450 and 1490, is a dignified
                    structure, but is chiefly interesting for it fan-traceried porch and stately
                    tower, the latter being hardly surpassed by any parish tower in England. It wàs
                    built entirely by the munificence of John Shipward, a wealthy merchant. The
                    crown of Bristol architecture is, however, the church of St Mary Redcliff, which
                    for grandeur of proportion, and elaboration of design and finish, is entitled to
                    stand in the selectest rank of English parish churches, and might be compared
                    with a lesser cathedral. It was built for the most part in the latter part of
                    the 14 th century by William Canyng, but the sculptured north porch, which has
                    cost £2535 to restore, is externally Decorated, and internally Early English.
                    The fine tower is also Decorated. The spire !just added has cost £5500. The
                    restoration of the church has extended over thirty years, at an expense of
                    £40,000.</p>
                <p>Among conventual remains, of the Dominican priory there exist the Early English
                    refectory and dormitory, the latter comprising a row of fifteen original windows
                    and an oak roof of the same date; and of St Bartholomew’s hospital there is a
                    double arch, with intervening arcades, also Early English. The small chapel of
                    the Three Kings of Cologne, and Holy Trinity Hospital, both Perpendicular,
                    comprise, with the remains of. the Austin canonry attached to the cathedral,
                    nearly the whole of the monastic relics.</p>
                <p>There are many good specimens of ancient domestic architecture,—notably some
                    arches of a grand Norman hall and some Tudor windows of Colston’s house, Small
                    Street; Canyng’s house, with good,Perpendicular oak roof; and St Peter’s
                    Hospital, Jacobean and earlier.</p>
                <p>In all there are 42 Episcopal churches, and 81 dissenters’ chapels,—the latter
                    comprising 10 Baptist, 19 Congregationalist, 11 Wesleyan, and 5 Roman Catholic
                    (besides 6 convents). The Exchange is a quadrangular colonnade, with a noble
                    frontage by Wood of Bath. The Guildhall is modern Tudor Gothic. The Bristol
                    Museum and Library is a fusion of the two leading » philosophical and literary
                    societies of the district, a spacious building in the Venetian Gothic style,
                    having been built for their joint purposes. The geological collection is among
                    the best provincial collections; the library (40,000 vols.) is the largest in
                    the west of England. There is also a free library, under the Act.</p>
                <p>Among the endowed public schools are (1), the Cathedral school, founded 1542, and
                    Cathedral college (1876); (2), the Grammar school, which lias secured a high
                    position, and has right of presentation to two university scholarships;. (3),
