                    prevailed through a large part of India, and is now professed by the inhabitants
                    of Ceylon, Siam, and Burma (the southern Buddhists), and of Nepal, Tibet, China,

                    befallen the founders of other religions; and as late as the year 1854 the late
                    Professor Wilson of Oxford read a paper before the Royal Asiatic Society of
                    London in which he maintained that the supposed life of Buddha was a myth, and
                    “Buddha himself merely an imaginary being." No one, however, would now support
                    this view; and it is admitted that, under the mass of miraculous tales which
                    have been handed down regarding him, there is a basis of truth already
                    sufficiently clear to render possible an intelligible history, which will become
                    clearer and clearer as older and better authorities are made accessible.</p>

                    in Calcutta, and a translation through the Tibetan into French by Μ. Foucaux in
                    Paris (1848). The first three books represent the views of the southern
                    Buddhists, whose sacred books are in Pali, and last the two those of the
                    northern Buddhists, whose sacred books are in Sanskrit. The former are much the
                    more reliable and complete, the latter being inflated to a great length by
                    absurd and miraculous legends, the kernel of fact at the centre of which agrees
                    in the main with the account found in the former. These have their miraculous
                    incidents too, the relation of the Sanskrit sources to the Pâli resembling in
                    many respects that of the apocryphal gospels to the New Testament.</p>
                <p>As there has been little or no intercommunication between the two churches since
                    the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> great reliance may reasonably be
                    placed on those statements in which they agree; not indeed as a proof of the
                    actual facts of the Buddha’s biography, but as giving us the belief of the early
                    Buddhists concerning it. It is to be regretted that the books we have to compare
                    are, as yet, of so comparatively modern a date; but, after the respective canons
                    had once been fixed, it is not likely that translators would deviate very
                    materially from the text of the biographies, so sacred to them, with which they
                    had to deal. The southern canon—usually called the Tripitaka or three
                    collections—was finally determined about 250 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> at
                    the Council of Pätaliputra on the Ganges, held under the auspices of the Emperor
                    Asoka the Great; and the northern about the commencement of our era at the
                    Council of Jâlandhara, in Kashmir, held under Kafiishka, a powerful
                    Indo-Scythian monarch. To the former belongs the Buddhavansa, or History of the
                    Buddhas, on which, together with its commentary, our three southern' accounts
                    are chiefly based; to the latter belongs the Lalita Vistara, the last of the
                    authorities mentioned above.</p>

                <p>At the end of the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Aryan tribes
                    from the Panjäb had long been settled on the banks of the Ganges; the pride of
                    race had put an impassable barrier between them and the conquered aborigines;
                    the pride of birth had built up another between the chiefs or nobles and the
                    mass of the Aryan people; and the superstitious fears of all yielded to the
                    priesthood an unquestioned and profitable supremacy; while the exigencies of
                    occupation and the ties of family had further separated each class into smaller
                    communities, until the whole nation had became gradually bound by an iron system
                    of caste. The old child-like joy in life so manifest in the Vedas had died away;
                    the worship of nature had developed or degenerated into the worship of new and
                    less pure divinities; and the Vedic songs themselves, whose freedom was little
                    compatible with the spirit of the age, had faded into an obscurity which did not
                    lessen their value to the priests. The country was politically split up into
                    little principalities, each governed by some petty despot, whose interests were
                    not often the same as those of the community. A convenient belief in the
                    doctrine of the transmigration of souls satisfied the unfortunate that their
                    woes were the natural result of their own deeds in a former birth, and though
                    unavoidable now, might be escaped in a future State of existence by present
                    liberality to the priests. While hoping for a better fate in their next birth,
                    the oppressed people turned for succour and advice in this to the aid of
                    astrology and witchcraft—a belief in which seems to underlie all religions, and
                    is only just dying out among ourselves. The philosophy of the day no longer
                    hoped for an immortality of the soul, but looked for a release from the misery
                    which it found inseparable from life, in a complete extinction of individual
                    existence. The inspiriting wars against the enemies of the Aryan people, the
                    infidel deniers of the Aryan gods, had given place to a succession of
                    internecine feuds between the chiefs of neighbouring clans; and in literature an
                    age of poets had long since made way for an age of commentators and grammarians,
                    who thought that the old poems must have been the work of gods. But the darkest
                    period was succeeded by the dawn of a reformation; travelling logicians were
                    willing to maintain theses against all the world; whilst here and there ascetics
                    strove to raise themselves above the gods, and hermits earnestly sought for some
                    satisfactory solution of the mysteries of life. These were the teachers whom the
                    people chiefly delighted to honour; and though the ranks of the priesthood were
                    for ever firmly closed against intruders, a man of lower caste, a Kshatriya or
                    Vaisya, whose mind revolted against the orthodox creed, and whose heart was
                    stirred by mingled zeal and ambition, might find through these irregular orders
                    an entrance to the career of a religious teacher and reformer.</p>
                <p>The population was most thickly scattered within 150 miles of Benares, which was
                    already celebrated as a seat of piety and learning; and it was at Kapilavastu, a

                    rice-fields could see the giant Himalayas looming up against the clear blue of
                    the Indian sky. Their supplies of water were drawn from the River Rohini, the
                    modern Kohäna; and though the use of the river was in times of drought the cause
                    of disputes between the Säkyas and the neighbouring Koliyans, the two clans were
                    then at peace; and two daughters of the räja of Koli, which was only 11 miles
                    east of Kapilavastu, were the principal wives of Suddhödana. Both were
                    childless, and great was the rejoicing when, in about the forty-fifth year of
                    her age, the elder sister, Mahämäyä, promised her husband a son. In due time she
                    started with the intention of being confined at her parent’s home, but ⅛the
                    party halting on the way under the shade of some lofty satin trees, in a
                    pleasant garden called Lumbini on the river side, her son, the future Buddha,
                    was there unexpectedly born. The marvellous stories which gathered round the
                    belief in his voluntary incarnation and immaculate conception, the miracles at
                    his birth, the prophecies of the aged saint at his formal presentation to his
                    father, and how nature altered her course to keep a shadow over his cradle,
                    whilst the sage3 from afar came and worshipped him, will be referred to
                    hereafter under the head of later Buddhism.</p>
                <p>He was in after years more generally known by his family name of Gautama, but his
                    individual name was Siddhartha. When he was nineteen years old he was married to
                    his cousin Yasodharä, daughter of the Koliyan räja, and gave himself up to a
                    life of Oriental luxury and delight. Soon after this, according to the southern
                    account, his relations formally complained to the rajä that his son lived
                    entirely for pleasure without learning anything, and asked what they should do
                    under such a leader if war arose. Gautama, hearing of this, is said to have
                    appointed a day for a trial of his prowess, and by defeating all his competitors
                    in manly exercises, and surpassing even his teachers in knowledge, to have won
                    back the good opinion of the disaffected Säkyas. This is the solitary record of
                    his youth; we hear nothing more till, in his twenty-ninth year, it is related
                    that, driving to his pleasure-grounds one day, he was struck by the sight of a
                    man utterly broken down by age, on another occasion by the sight of a man
                    suffering from a loathsome disease, and some months after by the horrible sight
                    of a decomposing corpse. Each time his charioteer, whose name was Channa, told
                    him that such was the fate of all living beings. Soon after he saw an ascetic
                    walking in a calm and dignified manner, and asking who that was, was told by his
                    charioteer the character and aims of the ascetics. The different accounts of
                    this vary so much as to cast great doubts on their accuracy.<note

                    inspired to say what he did. Some make all four visions appear on the same day,
                    others on different days, and there are other discrepancies. Compare <hi

                    It is, however, clear from what follows, that about this time the mind of the
                    young Räjput must, from some cause or other, have been deeply stirred. Many an
                    earnest heart full of disappointment or enthusiasm has gone through a similar
                    struggle, has learnt to look upon all earthly gains and hopes as worse than
                    vanity, has envied the calm life of the cloister, troubled by none of these
                    things, and has longed for an opportunity of entire selfsurrender to abstinence
                    and meditation.</p>
                <p>Subjectively, though not objectively, these visions may be supposed to have
                    appeared to Gautama. ⅛ After seeing the last of them, he is said to have spent
                    the afternoon in his pleasure-grounds by the river side; and having bathed, to
                    have entered his chariot in order to return home. Just then a messenger arrived
                    with the news that his wife Yasodharä had given birth to a son, his only child.
                    “This,” said Gautama quietly, “is a new and strong tie I shall have to break.”
                    But the people of Kapilavastu were greatly delighted at the birth of the young
                    heir, the räja’s only grandson. Gautama’s return became an ovation; musicians
                    preceded and followed his chariot, while shouts of joy and triumph fell on his
                    ear. Among these sounds one especially attracted his attention. It was the voice
                    of a young girl, his cousin, who sang a stanza, saying, “Happy the father, happy
                    the mother, happy the wife of such a son and husband.” In the word “happy” lay a
                    double meaning; it meant also freed from the chains of existence, delivered, <hi

                    hopes, Gautama, to whom such things had no longer any value, took off his collar
                    of pearls and sent it to her. She imagined this was the beginning of a
                    courtship, and began to build day-dreams about becoming his principal wife, but
                    he took no further notice of her and passed on. That evening the dancing-girls

                    occasions in many parts of India; but he paid them no attention, and gradually
                    fell into an uneasy slumber. At midnight he awoke; the dancing-girls were lying
                    in the ante-room; an overpowering loathing filled his soul. He arose instantly
                    with a mind fully made up,—“roused into activity,” says the Sinhalese chronicle,
                    “like a man who is told that his house is on fire.”<note anchored="true"

                    charioteer Channa, he told him to saddle his horse. While Channa was gone
                    Siddhärtha gently opened the door of the room where Yasodharä was sleeping,
                    surrounded by flowers, with one hand on the head of their child. He had hoped to
                    take the babe in his arms, for the last time before he went, but now he stood
                    for a few moments irresolute on the threshold looking at them. At last the fear
                    of awakening Yasodharä prevailed; he tore himself away, promising himself to
                    return to them as soon as his mind had become clear, as soon as he had become a
                    Buddha,— <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> Enlightened,— and then he could return to
                    them not only as husband and father, but as teacher and saviour. It is said to
                    have been broad moonlight on the full moon of the month of July, when the young
                    chief, with Channa as his sole companion, leaving his father’s home, his wealth
                    and power, his wife and child behind him—went out into the wilderness to become
                    a penniless and despised student, and a homeless wanderer. This is the
                    circumstance which has given its name to the Sanskrit work, the fourth of those
                    mentioned above, of which Mr Beal has given us a version through the Chinese,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mahäbhinishkramana Sütra,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sütra</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Great Renunciation.</hi></p>
                <p>Next is related an event in which we may again see a subjective experience given
                    under the form of an objective reality. Mära, the great tempter, appears in the
                    sky, and urges Gautama to stop, promising him, in seven days, a universal
                    kingdom over the four great continents if he will but give up his enterprise.
                    When his words fail to have any effect, the tempter consoles himself by the
                    confident hope that he will still overcome his enemy, saying, “Sooner or later
                    some lustful or malicious or angry thought must arise in his mind; in that
                    moment I shall be his master;” and from that hour, adds the Burmese chronicle,
                    “as a <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n474/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0474-0427"/> shadow always follows the body, so he too from
                    that day always followed the Blessed One, striving to throw every obstacle in
                    his way towards the Buddhahood.’’ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Gautama rides a
                    long distance that night, only stopping at the banks of the Anomä beyond the
                    Kυliyan territory. There, on the sandy bank of the river, at a spot where later
                    piety erected a dâgaba (a solid dome-shaped relic shrine), he cuts off with his
                    sword his long flowing locks, and taking off his ornaments, sends them and the
                    horse back in charge of the unwilling Channa to Kapilavastu. The next seven days
                    were spent alone in a grove of mango trees near by, whence the ascetic walks on
                    to Räjagriha, the capital of Magadha, and residence of BimbisΓιra, one of the
                    then most powerful rulers in the valley of the Ganges. He was favourably
                    received by the räja, a friend of his father’s; but though asked to do so, he
                    would not as yet assume the responsibilities of a teacher. He attached himself
                    first to a Brahman sophist named Alära, and afterwards to another named Udraka,
                    from whom he learnt all that Hindu philosophy had then to teach. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> Still unsatisfied, he next retired to the jungle of
                    Uruvela, on the most northerly spur of the Vindhya range of mountains, and there
                    for six years, attended by five faithful disciples, he gave himself up to the
                    severest penance and self-torture, till his fame as an ascetic spread in all the
                    country round about “like the sound,” says the Burmese chronicle “of a great
                    bell hung in the canopy of the skies.” <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> At last
                    one day, when he was walking in a much enfeebled state, he felt on a sudden an
                    extreme weakness, like that caused by dire starvation, and unable to stand any
                    longer he fell to the ground. Some thought he was dead, but he recovered, and
                    from that time took regular food and gave up his severe penance, so much so that
                    his five disciples soon ceased to respect him, and leaving him went to
                    Benares.</p>
                <p>There now ensued a second struggle in Gautama’s mind, described in both southern
                    and northern accounts with all the wealth of poetry and imagination of which the
                    Indian mind is master. The crisis culminated on a day, each event of which is
                    surrounded in the Buddhist accounts with the wildest legends, on which the very
                    thoughts passing through the mind of Buddha appear in gorgeous descriptions as
                    angels of darkness or of light. To us, now taught by the experiences of
                    centuries how weak such exaggerations are compared with the effect of a plain
                    unvarnished tale, these legends may appear childish or absurd, but they have a
                    depth of meaning to those who strive to read between the lines of such rude and
                    inarticulate attempts to describe the indescribable. That which (the previous
                    and subsequent career of the teacher being borne in mind) seems to be possible
                    and even probable, appears to be somewhat as follows.</p>
                <p>Disenchanted and dissatisfied, Gautama had given up all that most men value, to
                    seek peace in secluded study and self-denial. Failing to attain his object by
                    learning the wisdom of others, and living the simple life of a student, he had
                    devoted himself to that intense meditation and penance which all philosophers
                    then said would raise men above the gods. Still unsatisfied, longing always for
                    a certainty that seemed ever just beyond his grasp, he had added vigil to vigil,
                    and penance to penance, until at last, when to the wondering view of others he
                    had become more than a saint, his bodily strength and his indomitable resolution
                    and faith had together suddenly and completely broken down. Then, when the
                    sympathy of others would have been most welcome, he found his friends falling
                    away from him, and his disciples leaving him for other teachers. Soon after, if
                    not on the very day when his followers had left him, he wandered out towards the
                    banks of the Nairanjara, receiving his morning meal from the hands of Sujätä,
                    the daughter of a neighbouring villager, and set himself down to eat it under
                    the shade of a large tree (a <hi rend="italic">Ficus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >religiosa),</hi> to be known from that time as the sacred Bo tree or tree of
                    wisdom. There he remained through the long hours of that day debating with
                    himself what next to do. All his old temptations came back upon him with renewed
                    force. For years he had looked at all earthly good through the medium of a
                    philosophy which taught him that it, without exception, contained within itself
                    the seeds of bitterness, and was altogether worthless and impermanent; but now
                    to his wavering faith the sweet delights of home and love, the charms of wealth
                    and power, began to show themselves in a different light, and glow again with
                    attractive colours. He doubted, and agonized in his doubt; but as the sun set,
                    the religious side of his nature had won the victory, and seems to have come out
                    even purified from the struggle. He had become clear in his mind, the Buddha,
                    the Enlightened One, and had determined in the main to adhere to his belief; but
                    from that night he not only did not claim any merit on account of his
                    selfmortification, but took every opportunity of declaring that from such
                    penances no advantage at all would be derived. All that night he is said to have
                    remained in deep meditation under the Bo tree; and the orthodox Buddhists
                    believe that for seven times seven nights and days he continued fasting near the
                    spot, when the archangel Brahma came and ministered to him. As for himself, his
                    heart was now fixed,—his mind was made up,—but be realized more than he had evër
                    done before the power of temptation, and the difficulty, the almost
                    impossibility, of understanding and holding to the truth. For others subject to
                    the same temptations, but without that earnestness and insight which he felt
                    himself to possess, faith might be quite impossible, and it would only be waste
                    of time and trouble to try to show to them “the only path of peace.” To one in
                    his position this thought would be so very natural, that we need not hesitate to
                    accept the fact of its occurrence as related in the books. It is quite
                    consistent with his whole career that it was love and pity for
                    humanity—otherwise, as it seemed to him, helplessly doomed and lost—which at
                    last overcame every other consideration, and made Gautama resolve to announce
                    his doctrine to the world.</p>
                <p>Gautama had intended to proclaim his new gospel first to his old teachers Alära
                    and Udraka, but finding that they were dead, he determined to address himself to
                    his former five disciples, and accordingly went to the Deer-forest near Benares
                    where they were then living. An old <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The word
                    Buddha is always used in the Pâli texts as a title, not as a name. The
                    historical Buddha, the Gautama of this article, taught that he was one of a long
                    series of Buddhas, who appear at intervals in the world, and all teach the same
                    doctrine. After the death of each Buddha his religion flourishes for a time and
                    then decays, and is at last completely forgotten; until a new Buddha appears,
                    who again preaches the lost truth (or Dharmma). The next Buddha will be Maitreya
                    Buddha, the Buddha of kindness. A short account of each of the twenty-four

                    Buddhism and Hindu philosophy is one of extreme interest, but also of extreme
                    difficulty. Except in its elementary principles Buddhist philosophy is at
                    present very little understood; and our knowledge of the Hindu systems is
                    derived from text books, all of which are probably post-Buddhistic, and are
                    ascribed to authors of whom absolutely nothing is known. It seems clear that
                    before the time of Buddha there was much philosophical activity in Northern
                    India, and that his system and that of the six orthodox Hindu sects grew up side
                    by side. Many of the technical terms are common to Buddhism and to one or more
                    of the other systems, of which the Sânkhya and the Yoga, ascribed toKapila and
                    Patanjali respectively, come the nearest to Buddhism in their general views. A
                    popular account of the six systems will be found in Professor Monier Williams’s

                <p>gäthä or hymn of the northern Buddhists tells us how the Buddha meets, full of
                    his newly-discovered mission, an acquaintance on the way, who, struck with his
                    appearance, asks him what religion it is that makes him so glad and yet so calm.
                    Gautama tells him that he has now become free from all desires, &amp;c. But his
                    acquaintance, apparently not caring much about these details, further asks him
                    where he is going. The reply is striking. <hi rend="italic">“I</hi> am now
                    going,” says Buddha, “to the city of Benares to establish the kingdom of
                    righteousness, to give light to those enshrouded in darkness, and open the gate
                    of immortality to men.” His acquaintance only sneers at his high-flown
                    pretensions, asking what he means by all this. The Buddha adds, <hi
                    rend="italic">“I</hi> have completely conquered all evil passions, and am no
                    longer tied down to material existence; and I now only live to be the prophet of
                    perfect truth.” His acquaintance replies, “In that case, venerable Gautama, your
                    way lies yonder,” and turns away in the opposite direction.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Beal, p. 245. Mr Beal translates the first
                    clause, “to turn the wheel of the excellent law;” but the chakra is no ordinary
                    wheel, it is the royal chariot wheel, and the expression rendered “turn,” from
                    the root <hi rend="italic">vrit,</hi> is more exactly “to set rolling onward.” A

                    undoubtedly means that Buddha was about to set rolling the royal chariot wheel
                    of a universal kingdom of right, or, in other words, to start or found such a
                    kingdom. Compare Beal, p. 244, note, and p. 142; and Childers’s <hi

                <p>Nothing daunted, the new prophet walked on to Benares, and in the cool of the
                    evening went on to the Deer-forest where the five ascetics were living. Seeing
                    him coming, they resolved not to recognize as a superior one who had broken his
                    vows; to address him by his name, and not as “master” or “teacher;” only, he
                    being a Kshatriya, to offer him a seat. He understands their change of manner,
                    calmly tells them not to mock him by calling him “the venerable Gautama;” that
                    they are still in the way of death, where they must reap sorrow and
                    disappointment, whereas he has found the way to salvation and can lead them to
                    it. They object, naturally enough, from a Hindu point of view, that he had
                    failed before while he was keeping his body under, and how can his mind have won
                    the victory now, when he serves and yields to his body. Buddha replies by
                    explaining to them the principles of his new gospel; and it will be necessary
                    here to anticipate somewhat, and explain very briefly what this was, as the
                    narrative will otherwise be difficult to follow.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Buddhist Way of Salvation.—</hi> Everything corporeal is
                    material, and therefore impermanent, for it contains within itself the germs of
                    dissolution. So long as man is bound up by bodily existence with the material
                    world he is liable to sorrow, decay, and death. So long as he allows unholy
                    desires to reign within him, there will be unsatisfied longings, useless
                    wearines3, and care. To attempt to purify himself by oppressing his body would
                    be only wasted effort; it is the moral evil of a man’s heart which keeps him
                    chained down in the degraded state of bodily life,—of union with the material
                    world. It is of little avail to add virtue to his badness, for so long as there
                    is evil, his goodness will only ensure him for a time, and in another birth, a
                    higher form of material life; only the complete <hi rend="italic">eradication of
                    all evil</hi> will set him free from the chains of existence, and carry him to
                    the “other side,” where he will be no longer tossed about on the waves of the
                    ocean of transmigration. But Christian ideas must not be put into these Buddhist
                    expressions. Of any immaterial existence Buddhism knows nothing. The foundations
                    of its creed have been summed up in the very ancient formula probably invented
                    by its founder, which is called <hi rend="italic">the Four great Truths.</hi>
                    These are—1, That misery always accompanies existence; 2, That all modes of
                    existence (of men or animals, in earth and heaven) result from passion or desire
                    (tanhâ); 3, That there is no escape from existence except by destruction of
                    desire; 4, That this may be accomplished by following the fourfold way to
                    Nirvana. Of these four stages, called “<hi rend="italic">the Paths,"</hi> the
                    first is an awakening of the heart. There are few that do not acknowledge that
                    no man can be really called happy, and that men are born to trouble as the
                    sparks fly upwards, but the majority glide through life filling up their time
                    with business or with pleasure, buoyed up with ever-changing hopes in their mad
                    pursuit of some fancied good. When the scales fall from their eyes, when they
                    begin to realize the great mystery of <hi rend="italic">Sorrow,</hi> that pain
                    is inseparable from existence, and that all earthly good leads to vexation of
                    spirit, when they turn for comfort and for guidance to the Enlightened One, then
                    they may be said to be awake, and to have entered the <hi rend="italic">first
                    stage</hi> of the Buddhist way of salvation. When the awakened believer has gone
                    further, and got rid, firstly, of all <hi rend="italic">impure desires,</hi> and
                    then of all <hi rend="italic">revengefid feelings,</hi> he has reached the
                    second stage; in the third he successively becomes free (1) from <hi
                    rend="italic">all evil desires,</hi> (2) from <hi rend="italic">ignorance,</hi>
                    (3) from <hi rend="italic">doubt,</hi> (4) from <hi rend="italic">heresy,</hi>
                    and (5) from <hi rend="italic">unkindliness and vexation.</hi> “As even at the
                    risk of her own life a mother watches over her child, her only child, so let him
                    (the Buddhist saint) exert good-will without measure towards all beings.”<note

                <p>The order here observed is very remarkable. The way to be freed from doubt and
                    heresy lies through freedom from impurity and revenge and evil longings of all
                    kinds; or, in other words, if a man awakened to a deep sense of the mystery of
                    sorrow wishes to understand the real facts of existence, wishes to believe not
                    the false or the partly false, but the true altogether, Buddha tells him not to
                    set to work and study, not to torture himself with asceticism or privation, but
                    to purify his mind from all unholy desires and passions; right actions spring
                    from a pure mind, and to the pure in heart all things are open. Again, the first
                    enemy which the awakened believer has to fight against is sensuality, and the
                    last is unkindliness; it is impossible to build anything on a foundation of
                    mire; and the topstone of all that one can build, the highest point he can
                    reach, the point above purity, above justice, above even faith is, according to
                    Buddha, <hi rend="italic">Universal charity.</hi> Till he has gained that the
                    believer is still bound, he is not free, his mind is still dark; true
                    enlightenment, true freedom are complete only in Love.</p>
                <p>The believer who has gone thus far has reached the last stage; he has cut the
                    meshes of ignorance, passion, and sin, and has thus escaped from the net of
                    transmigration; Nirvana is already within his grasp; he has risen above the laws
                    of material existence; the secrets of the future and the past lie open before
                    him; and when this one short life is over, he will be free for ever from birth
                    with its inevitable consequences, decay, and death. No Buddhist now hopes to
                    reach this stage on earth; but he who has once entered the “paths” cannot leave
                    them; the final perseverance of the saints is sure; and sooner or later, under
                    easier conditions in some less material world, he will win the great prize, and,
                    entering Nirvana, be at rest for ever.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>But to return to the narrative. For reasons too long to be specified here, it is
                    nearly certain that Buddha had a commanding presence, and one of those deep,
                    rich, thrilling <pb break="no"

                    men have possessed. We know his deep earnestness, and his thorough conviction of
                    the truth of his new gospel. When we further remember the relation which the
                    five students mentioned above had long borne to him, and that they already
                    believed those parts of his doctrine that are most repugnant to our modern
                    feelings,—the pessimist view of life and the transmigration of souls,—it is not
                    difficult to understand that his persuasions were successful, and that his old
                    disciples were the first to acknowledge him in his new character. The later
                    books say that they were all converted at once; but, according to the most
                    ancient Pâli record,—though their old love and reverence had been so rekindled
                    when Gautama came near that their cold resolutions quite broke down, and they
                    vied with each other in such acts of personal attention as an Indian disciple
                    loves to pay to his teacher,—yet it was only after the Buddha had for five days
                    talked to them, sometimes separately, sometimes together, that they accepted in
                    its entirety his plan of salvation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Gautama then remained at the Deer-forest near Benares until the number of his
                    personal followers was about threescore, and that of the outside believers
                    somewhat greater. The principal among the former was a rich young man named
                    Yasa, who had first come to him at night out of fear of his relations, and
                    afterwards shaved his head, put on the yellow robe,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See on this point below, p. 435.</p></note>
                    and succeeded in bringing many of his former friends and companions to the
                    teacher, his mother and his wife being the first female disciples, and his
                    father the first lay devotee. It should be noticed in passing that the idea of a
                    priesthood with mystical powers is altogether repugnant to Buddhism; every one’s
                    salvation is entirely dependent on the modification or growth of his own inner
                    nature, resulting from his own exertions. The life of a recluse is held to be
                    the most conducive to that state of sweet serenity at which the more ardent
                    disciples aim; but that of a layman, of a believing householder, is held in high
                    honour; and a believer who does not as yet feel himself able or willing to cast
                    off the ties of home or of business, may yet “enter the paths,” and by a life of
                    rectitude and kindness ensure for himself a rebirth under more favourable
                    conditions for his growth in holiness.</p>
                <p>After the rainy season Gautama called together those of his disciples who had
                    devoted themselves to the higher life, and whom, for want of a better name, we
                    may call monks, and said to them, Beloved Rahans, I am free from the five
                    passions which, like an immense net, hold men and angels in their power; you
                    too, owing to my teaching, enjoy the same glorious privilege. There is now laid
                    on us a great duty, that of working effectually for men and angels, and gaining
                    for them also the priceless blessing of salvation. Let us, therefore, separate,
                    so that no two of us shall go the same way. Go ye now and preach the most
                    excellent law, explaining every point thereof, unfolding it with diligence and
                    care. . . . For my part I shall go to the village of Sena, near the deserts of
                    Uruwela.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare

                    same plan, collecting his disciples round him in the rainy season, and after it
                    was over travelling about as an itinerant preacher; but in subsequent years he
                    was always accompanied by some of his most attached disciples.</p>
                <p>In the solitudes of Uruwela, there were at this time three brothers,
                    fire-worshippers and hermit philosophers, who had gathered round them a number
                    of scholars, and enjoyed a considerable reputation as teachers. Gautama settled
                    among them, and after a time they became believers in his system,—the elder
                    brother, Käsyapa, taking henceforth a principal place among his followers. His
                    first set sermon to his new disciples is related by Bishop Bigandet under the
                    name of the Sermon on the Mount, the subject of which was a jungle-fire which
                    broke out on the opposite hillside. He warned his hearers against the fires of
                    concupiscence, anger, ignorance, birth, death, decay, and anxiety; and taking
                    each of the senses in order he compared all human sensations to a burning flame
                    which seems to be something it is not, which produces pleasure and pain, but
                    passes rapidly away, and ends only in destruction.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Accompanied by his new disciples, Gautama walked on to Räjagriha, the capital of
                    King Bimbisära, who, not unmindful of their former interview, came out to
                    welcome him. Seeing Käsyapa, who as the chronicle puts it, was as well known to
                    them as the banner of the city, the people at first doubted who was the teacher
                    and who the disciple; but Käsyapa put an end to their hesitation by stating that
                    he had now given up his belief in the efficacy of sacrifices either great or
                    small; that Nirvana was a state of rest only to be attained by a change of
                    heart; and that he had become a disciple of the Buddha. Gautama then spoke to
                    the king on the miseries of the world which arise from passion, and on the
                    possibility of release by following the way of salvation, which has been briefly
                    sketched above. The räja invited him and his disciples to eat their simple
                    mid-day meal at his house on the following morning; and then presented Gautama
                    with a garden called Veluvana or Bamboo-grove, afterwards celebrated as the
                    place where the Buddha spent many rainy seasons, and preached many of his most
                    complete discourses. There he taught for some time, attracting large numbers of
                    hearers, among whom two, Säriputra and Moggalläna, who afterwards became
                    conspicuous leaders in the new crusade, then joined the Sangha, or Society, as
                    Buddha’s order of mendicants was called.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the old Räja Suddhödana, who had anxiously watched his son’s career,
                    heard that he had given up l∣is asceticism, and had appeared as an itinerant
                    preacher and teacher. He sent therefore to him urging him to come heme, that he
                    might see him once more before he died. The Buddha accordingly started for
                    Kapilavastu, and stopped according to his custom in a grove outside the town.
                    His father and his uncles and others came to see him there, but the latter were
                    angry and would pay him no reverence. It was the custom to invite such teachers
                    and their disciples for the next day’s meal, but they all left without doing so.
                    The next day, therefore, Gautama set out at the usual hour, carrying his bowl to
                    beg for a meal. As he entered the city he hesitated whether he should not go
                    straight to the raja’s house, but determined to adhere to his custom. It soon
                    reached the räja’s ears that his son was walking through the streets begging.
                    Startled at such news he rose up, seizing the end of his outer robe, and
                    hastened to the place where Gautama was, exclaiming, “Illustrious Buddha, why do
                    you expose us all to such shame? Is it necessary to go from door to door begging
                    your food? Do you imagine that I am not able to supply the wants of so many
                    mendicants?” “My noble father,” was the reply, “this is the custom of all our
                    race.” “How so ?” said his father, “Are you not descended from an illustrious
                    line of kings? no single person of our race has ever acted so indecorously.” “My
                    noble father,” said Gautama, “you and your family may claim the privileges of
                    royal descent; my descent is from the prophets (Buddhas) of old, and they have
                    always acted so; the customs of the law (Dharma) are good both for this <pb

                    father, when a man has found a treasure it is his duty to offer the most
                    precious of the jewels to his father first. Do not delay; let me share with you
                    the treasure I have found.” Suddhödana, abashed, took his son’s bowl and led him
                    to his house. There the women of the palace came to welcome him, but not
                    Yasodharä, whom he had not seen since he had watched her sleeping in their
                    chamber with their new-born babe by her side on that eventful night now seven
                    long years ago. “I will wait and see,” she had said; “perhaps I am still of some
                    value in his eyes; he may ask, or come. I can welcome him better here.” Gautama
                    noticed her absence, and remembering, doubtless, that a recluse could not touch
                    or be touched by a woman, he said, “The princess is not yet free from desire as
                    I am; not having seen me so long she is exceeding sorrowful. Unless her sorrow
                    be allowed to take its course, her heart will break. She may embrace me; do not
                    stop her.” He then went to her, and when she saw him enter,—not the husband she
                    had mourned so long, but a recluse in yellow robes with shaven head and shaven
                    face,—though she knew it would be so, she could not contain herself, and fell on
                    the ground, and held him by the feet, and wept; then remembering the impassable
                    gulf between them, she rose and stood on one side. The räja thought it necessary
                    to apologize for her, telling Gautama how entirely she had continued to love
                    him, refusing to enjoy comforts which he denied himself, taking but one meal a
                    day, and sleeping on a hard uncanopied bed. The different accounts often tell us
                    the thoughts of the Buddha on any particular occasion; here they are silent,
                    only adding that he then told a Jâtaka story, showing how great had been her
                    virtue in a former birth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    And then they parted: she became an earnest hearer of the new doctrines; and
                    when long afterwards the Buddha was induced, much against his inclination, to
                    established an order of female recluses, his widowed wife Yasodharä became one
                    of the first of the Buddhist nuns.</p>
                <p>The next day a great festival was to take place to celebrate the marriage of
                    Gautama’s half-brother, Nanda. Gautama went to the pavilion and said to Nanda,
                    “the greatest festival after all is the destruction of all evil desires, the
                    life of a recluse, the knowledge of truth, and the attainment of Nirvana.” He
                    then gave him his alms-bowl, and Nanda followed him to the Nigrodha grove where
                    he was staying. On their arrival there Gautama asked him if he would not enter
                    the Society; but Nanda, though tenderly attached to his half-brother, with whom
                    he had been brought up as a play-fellow (Gautama having no brothers of his own),
                    did not yet desire to give up the world After much persuasion, however, he
                    consented, and became a disciple. A few days afterwards Yasodharä dressed
                    Rähula, her child and Gautama’s, in his best, and told him to go and ask his
                    father for his inheritance. <hi rend="italic">“I</hi> know of no father,” said
                    the child, “but the räja. Who is my father? ’ Yasodharä took him in her arms,
                    and holding him up to the window pointed out to him the Buddha, who was then
                    taking his mid-day meal at the palace. “That monk,” she said, “whose appearance
                    is so glorious, is your father; he has fournîmes of wealth; go to him, and
                    entreat him to put you in possession of your inheritance.” Rähula went up to
                    Gautama and said to him, without fear and with much affection, “My father, how
                    happy I am to be near you.” Gautama silently gave him his blessing; but
                    presently, when he rose to go, Rähula followed him asking for his inheritance.
                    None of the people stopped him, and Gautama still said nothing. When they
                    reached the Nigrodha grove, he called Sâriputra, and said, “Beloved disciple,
                    Rähula is asking for a worldly inheritance which would avail him nothing; I will
                    give him a spiritual inheritance which will not fade away; let him be admitted
                    among us.” When Suddhödana heard this he was exceedingly grieved; he had lost
                    his two sons as far as all worldly hopes were concerned, and now his grandson
                    was taken from him. Full of sorrow he determined to save other parents a similar
                    affliction, and going to Gautama asked him to establish a regulation that no one
                    should in future be admitted to the Society unless he had the consent of his
                    parents. Gautama granted this request, and after some more interviews with his
                    father returned to the Bambu grove at Räjagriha.</p>
                <p>Eighteen months had now elapsed since the turning-point of Gautama’s career—his
                    great struggle under the Bo tree. Thus far all the accounts agree, and follow
                    chronological order. From this time they simply narrate disconnected stories
                    about the Buddha, or the persons with whom he was brought into contact,—the same
                    story being usually found in more than one account, but not often in the same
                    order. It is not as yet possible, except very partially, to arrange
                    chronologically the snatches of biography to be gleaned from these stories. They
                    are mostly told to show the occasion on which some memorable act of Gautama’s
                    took place, or some memorable saying was uttered, and are as exact as to place
                    as they are indistinct as to time. It would be impossible within the limits of
                    this article to give any large number of them, but space may be found for one or
                    two.</p>
                <p>A merchant from Sünaparanta having joined the Society was desirous of preaching
                    to his relations, and is said to have asked Gautama’s permission to do so. “The
                    people of Sünaparanta,” said the teacher,“are exceedingly violent. If they
                    revile you what will you do?”“I will make no reply,” said the mendicant. “And if
                    they strike you ?” “I will not strike in return,” was the reply. “And if they
                    try to kill you ?” “Death 13 no evil in itself; many even desire it, to escape
                    from the vanities of life, but I shall take no steps either to hasten or to
                    delay the time of my departure.” These answers were held satisfactory, and the
                    monk started on his mission.</p>
                <p>At another time a rich farmer held a harvest home, and Gautama, wishing to preach
                    to him, is said to have taken his alms-bowl and stood by the side of the field
                    and begged. The farmer, a wealthy Brähman, said to him, “Why do you come and
                    beg? I plough and sow and earn my food; you should do the same.” “I, too, 0
                    Brahman,” said the beggar, “plough and sow; and having ploughed and sown I eat.”
                    “You profess only to be a farmer; no one sees your ploughing, what do you mean
                    ?” said the Brahman. “For my cultivation,” said the beggar, “faith is the seed,
                    self-combat is the fertilizing rain, the weeds I destroy are the cleaving to
                    existence, wisdom is my plough, and its guiding-shaft is modesty; perseverance
                    draws my plough, and I guide it with the rein of my mind; the field I work in is
                    the law, and the harvest that I reap is the never-dying nectar of Nirväna. Those
                    who reap this harvest destroy all the weeds of sorrow.”</p>
                <p>On another occasion he is said to have brought back to her right mind a young
                    mother whom sorrow had for a time deprived of reason. Her name was Kisägotami.
                    She had been married early, as is the custom in the East, and had a child when
                    she was stilla girl. When the beautiful boy could run alone he died. The young
                    girl in her love for it carried the dead child clasped to her bosom, and went
                    from house to house of her pitying friends asking them to give ⅝r medicine for
                    it. But a Buddhist convert thinking <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n478/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0478-0431"/> “she does not understand,” said to her, “My good
                    girl, I myself have no such medicine as you ask for, but I think I know of one
                    who has.” “Oh, tell me who that is!” said Kisâgotamî. “The Buddha can give you
                    medicine; go to him,” was the answer. She went to Gautama; and doing homage to
                    him said, “Lord and master, do you know any medicine that will be good for my
                    child <hi rend="italic">1”</hi> “Yes, I know of some,” said the teacher. Now it
                    was the custom for patients or their friends to provide the herbs which the
                    doctors required; so she asked what herbs he would want. “I want some
                    mustard-seed,” he said; and when the poor girl eagerly promised to bring some of
                    so common a drug, he added, “you must get it from some house where no son, or
                    husband, or parent, or slave has died.” “Very good,” she said; and went to ask
                    for it, still carrying her dead child with her. The people said, “Here is
                    mustard-seed, take it;” but when she asked, “In my friend’s house has any son
                    died, or a husband, or a parent, or slave <hi rend="italic">1”</hi> They
                    answered, “Lady! what is this that you say? the living are few, but the dead are
                    many.” Then she went to other houses, but one said “I have lost a son,” another
                    “We have lost our parents,” another “I have lost my slave.” At last, not being
                    able to find a single house where no one had died, her mind began to clear, and
                    summoning up resolution she left the dead body of her child in a forest, and
                    returning to the Buddha paid him homage. He said to her, “Have you the mustard
                    seed Î” “My lord,” she replied, “I have not; the people tell me that the living
                    are few, but the dead are many.” Then he talked to her on that essential part of
                    his system, the impermanency of all things, till her doubts were cleared away,
                    she accepted her lot, became a disciple, and entered the “first path.”</p>
                <p>For forty-five years after entering on his mission Gautama itinerated in the
                    valley of the Ganges, not going further than about 150 miles from Benares, and
                    always spending the rainy months at one spot—usually at one of the vihäras, or
                    homes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These houses were
                    at first simple huts, built for the mendicants in some grove of palm trees as a
                    retreat during the rainy season; but they gradually increased in splendour and
                    magnificence till the decay of Buddhism set in. See the authorities quoted in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Itoyal Asiatic Society</hi> for 1875, p. 22
                    of the article on “Two Sinhalese Inscriptions.’</p></note> which had been given
                    to the Society. In the twentieth year his cousin Ananda became a mendicant, and
                    from that time seems to have attended on Gautama, being constantly near him, and
                    delighting to render him all the personal service which love and reverence could
                    suggest. Another cousin, Dewadatta, the son of the räja of Koli, also joined the
                    society, but became envious of the teacher, and stirred up Ajâtasatru (who
                    having killed his father, Bimbisära, had become king of Räjagriha) to persecute
                    Gautama. The account of the manner in which the Buddha is said to have overcome
                    the wicked devices of this apostate cousin and his parricide protector is quite
                    legendary; but the general fact of Ajätasatru’s opposition to the new sect and
                    of his subsequent conversion may be accepted. The rival teachers, or sophists,
                    as might be expected, were bitter enemies of the new philosophy, and the
                    Brahmins did all they could to put down a faith which inculcated such dangerous
                    doctrines as the equality within the Society of all ranks and castes, and the
                    possibility of salvation without sacrifices or the assistance of the priests.
                    They instigated certain men to murder Moggalläna, one of the two chief
                    diβciples, and made several attempts on the life of the teacher himself; but
                    many of the chiefs, and the great bulk of the common people, are represented,
                    with probable truth, as being uniformly in favour of his doctrine, though the
                    number of those who actually joined the Society was comparatively small.</p>
                <p>The confused and legendary notices of the journeyings of Gautama are succeeded by
                    tolerably clear accounts of the last few days of his life. On a journey towards
                    Kusinagara, a town about 120 miles N.N.E of Benares, and about 80 miles due E.
                    of Kapilavastu, the teacher, being then eighty years of age, had rested for a
                    short time in a grove at Pâwâ, presented to the Society by a goldsmith of that
                    place named Chunda. Chunda prepared for the mendicants a mid-day meal,
                    consisting of rice and pork; and it may be noticed in passing how highly
                    improbable it is that any Buddhist would have invented the story of the Buddha’s
                    last illness having been brought on by such a cause. He started for Kusi-nagara
                    in the afternoon, but had not gone far when he was obliged to rest, and soon
                    afterwards he said, “Ananda, I am thirsty;” and they gave him water to drink.
                    Half-way between the two towns flows the River Kukushtä. There Gautama rested
                    again, and bathed for the last time. Feeling that he was dying, and careful lest
                    Chunda should be reproached by himself or others, he said to Ananda, “After I am
                    gone tell Chunda that he will receive in a future birth very great reward; for,
                    having eaten of the food he gave me, I am about to pass into Nirvana; and if he
                    should still doubt, say that it was from my own mouth that you heard this. There
                    are two gifts which will be blest above all others, namely, Sujätä’s gift before
                    I attained wisdom under the Bo tree, and this gift of Chunda’s before I enter
                    the final rest of Nirvana.” After halting again and again the party at length
                    reached the River Hiranyavatι, close by Kusi-nagara, and there for the last time
                    Gautama rested; and lying down under some Sal trees, with his face towards the
                    south, he talked long and earnestly with Ananda about his burial, and about
                    certaiu rules which were to be observed by the Society after his death. Towards
                    the end of this conversation, when it was evening, Ananda broke down and went
                    aside to weep, but Gautama missed him, and sending for him comforted him with
                    the promise of Nirvana, and repeated what he had go often_said before about the
                    impermanence of all things,— “0 Ananda! do not weep; do not let yourself be
                    troubled. You know what I have said; sooner or later we must part from all we
                    hold most dear. This body of ours contains within itself the power which renews
                    its strength for a time, but also the causes which lead to its destruction. Is
                    there anything put together which shall not dissolve 1 But you, too, shall be
                    free from this delusion, this world of sense, this law of change. Beloved,”
                    added he, speaking to the rest of the disciples, “Ananda for long years has
                    served me with devoted affection. He knows all that should be done; after I am
                    gone listen to his word.” And he spoke to them at some length on the insight and
                    kindness of Ananda.</p>
                <p>About midnight Subhadra, a Brahman philosopher of Kusbnagara, came to ask some
                    questions of the Buddha; but Ananda, fearing that this might lead to a longer
                    discussion than the sick teacher could bear, would not admit him. Gautama heard
                    the sound of their talk, and asking what it was, told them to let Subhadra come.
                    He began by asking whether the six great teachers<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These are perhaps the teachers of the six
                    systems of orthodox Hindu philosophy referred to above (note 2, p. 427); but the

                    great disciples,” is not clear.</p></note> knew all laws, or whether there were
                    some that they did not know, or knew only partially. “This is not the time,” was
                    the answer, “for such discussions. To true wisdom there is only one way, the
                    path that is laid down in my law. Many have already followed it, and conquering
                    the lust and pride and anger of their own hearts, have become free from
                    ignorance and doubt and wrong belief, have entered the calm state of universal
                    kindliness, and reached Nirvana even in this life. Save in my religion the

                    deliver it from <pb break="no"

                    do not speak to you of things I have not experienced. Since I was twenty-nine
                    years old till now I have striven after pure and perfect wisdom, and following
                    the good path, have found Nirvana.” A rule had been made that no follower of a
                    rival system should be admitted to the Society without four months’ probation.
                    So deeply did the words or the impressive manner of the dying teacher work upon
                    Subhadra that he asked to be admitted at once, and Gautama granted his request.
                    Then turning to his disciples he said, “When I have passed away and am no longer
                    with you, do not think that the Buddha has left you, and is not still in your
                    midst. You have my words, my explanations of the deep things of truth, the laws
                    I have laid down for the Society; let them be your guide; the Buddha has not
                    left you.” Soon afterwards he again spoke to them, urging them to reverence one
                    another, and rebuked one of the disciples who spoke indiscriminately all that
                    occurred to him. Towards the morning he asked whether any one had any doubt
                    about the Buddha, the law, or the Society; if so, lie would clear them up. No
                    one answering, he said, “Beloved mendicants, if you revere my memory, love all
                    the disciples as you love me and my doctrines.” Ananda expressed his surprise
                    that amongst so many none should doubt, and all be firmly attached to the law.
                    But Buddha laid stress on the final perseverance of the saints, saying that even
                    the least among the disciples who had entered the first path only, still had his
                    heart fixed on the way to perfection, and constantly strove after the three
                    higher paths. “No doubt,” be said, “can be found in the mind of a true
                    disciple.” After another pause he said, “Beloved, that which causes life, causes
                    also decay and death. Never forget this; let your minds be filled with this
                    truth. I called you to make it known to you.” These were the last words Gautama
                    spoke; shortly afterwards he became unconscious, and in that state passed
                    away.</p>

                <p>The accounts of Gautama’s cremation and of the distri bution of his relics are
                    full of the miraculous, but it seems that the body was burnt with great
                    reverence by the local räjas of Malva. Even before this ceremony had taken place
                    dissensions began to break out in the Society,—one member of the order, Subhadra
                    (not the Brahman mentioned above), having even gone so far as to rejoice that
                    now at last they were free from control, and could not always be told to do
                    this, or not to do that. Struck by this language, the chief disciples began at
                    once to consider the expediency of holding a council, where all points of
                    difference should be definitively set at rest. Chief among the leaders was the
                    aged Käsyapa of Uruvela, whose distinguished position before his conversion, and
                    his great learning, were not the only grounds of the respect in which he was
                    held by the infant Society. He had been one of those most intimate with Gautama;
                    so much so, that on one occasion, when walking together and talking of the
                    deepest truths of their belief, the two friends had entered into a more than
                    usual confidence and intercommunion of thought and feeling, aud had then changed
                    robes with one another in token of their sympathy and love. Säriputra and
                    Moggallâna were dead; but Ananda, the beloved disciple, and Upäli, who though of
                    low caste origin was looked up to in the Society as the greatest authority on
                    points of conduct and discipline, were of one opinion with Käsyapa as to the
                    advisability of a council. This was agreed upon; the disciples first separated
                    and went to their homes, and when they met again for the rainy season in that
                    vihära at Räjagriha, which had been the first gift to the Society, the council
                    was held under the presidency of Käsyapa, and with the patronage and assistance
                    of Âjâtasatr’u, the powerful raja of Magadha. The number of believers present
                    was five hundred, but if any discussion took place no tradition of it has
                    survived. We are only told that at each daily sitting of the council, which
                    lasted seven months, Ananda or Upäli repeated some portion of the law, and the
                    whole assembly chanted it after them. A second council is said to have been held
                    one hundred years later in Vaisäli, about 70 miles N. of Räjagriha, and another
                    was certainly held about 250 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> under the Buddhist
                    emperor Asoka, in his capital Pätaliputra, the Palibothra of the Greeks and the
                    modern Patna. There is reasonable ground for belief that the sacred books of the
                    Buddhists at present existing in Ceylon are substantially the same as the canon
                    settled at this last council of Pätaliputra, and it is from these books that the
                    modern accounts on which we are as yet obliged to depend purport to have been
                    and, with some alterations and additions, undoubtedly have been derived. The
                    orthodox Buddhists hold the present canon to be identically the same as that
                    settled at the first council of Räjagriha; but the internal evidence of those
                    parts of the canon which have as yet been published tends to show that they
                    cannot possibly have been composed in their present state immediately after
                    Buddha’s death. The date, derived from Ceylon, which is usually assigned to that
                    event is 543 B.c.; but those scholars who have devoted most attention to the
                    point hold this calculation to contain a certain error of about 60 years, and a
                    probable error of 80 to 100 more; so that the date for the death of Buddha would
                    have to be brought forward to 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> or a few years
                    later. As the date of Asoka’s council has been determined with certainty to have
                    been within a year or two of 250 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> there remains
                    an interval of a century and a half between the first council and the earliest
                    records now accessible to us, an interval amply sufficient for the growth of the
                    supernatural element which they so largely contain. When these records have been
                    published in the original Pâli, it may be possible to decide how far some
                    portions are older than the rest, and how far it is possible to hold that they
                    reproduce any earlier canon; at present we can only claim in the following brief
                    outline to give an account of Buddhism as it existed 150 years after the decease
                    of its founder. But when it is recollected that Gautama Buddha was himself
                    learned in all the learning of his time; that he did not leave behind him a
                    number of deeply simple sayings from which his followers subsequently built up a
                    system, but had thoroughly elaborated a system of his own before his mission
                    began; that during his long career as teacher he had ample time to repeat the
                    principles and details of the system to his disciples over and over again, and
                    to test their knowledge of it; and finally, that his principal disciples were,
                    like himself, accustomed to the subtlest metaphysical distinctions, and trained
                    to that wonderful command of memory which Indian ascetics then possessed,—when
                    these facts are recalled to mind, it will be seen that much more reliance can be
                    placed upon the doctrinal parts of the existing Buddhist canon than upon
                    correspondingly late records of other religions, or on the biographical parts of
                    the Buddhist canon itself.</p>

                    subject to the law of cause and effect, and that everything is constantly,
                    though perhaps imperceptibly, changing. Though in its principles it anticipates
                    much that modern science has proved, in its details it does not, as might be
                    expected, rise much above the beliefs most current at the time of its origin;
                    but it has formulated them into a hypothetical system sufficiently consistent
                    with itself to have satisfied Buddhists for more than 2000 years, however little
                    consistent with actual truth. Scattered through space, it teaches, there are
                    innumerable circular worlds in sets of three. All of these are exactly similar
                    to our own, in the centre of which rises an enormous mountain, called Mäha Meru,
                    which is surrounded by seven concentric circles of rock of an enormous height,
                    and the circle enclosed by the outermost is divided into four quarters, or great
                    continents, part of one of which is Jambudvιpa, the earth in which we live. On
                    the heights of Mahä Meru, and above it and the rock circles, rise the
                    twenty-four heavens, and beneath it and the earth are the eight great hells.
                    These heavens and hells are part of the material world, subject like the rest of
                    it to the law of cause and effect, and the beings within them are still liable
                    to rebirth, decay, and death. Between Mahä Meru and the outmost circle of rocks,
                    the sun, moon, and stars revolve through space; and it is when they pass behind
                    the first circle of rocks that they appear to the inhabitants of Jambudvipa to
                    set. This world, like each of the others scattered through space, is
                    periodically destroyed by water, fire, or wind, but the sum of the demerits of
                    the beings (men, animals, angels, &lt;fcc.) who lived within it produces each
                    time a new world, which in its turn is fated to be destroyed. The number of
                    these beings never varies save on those few occasions when one of them either in
                    earth or heaven attains Nirvana; in every other case, as soon as an individual
                    dies, another is produced under more or less material conditions, according as
                    the sum of the former individual’s demerits, minus the sura of its merits, was,
                    at the time of its death, large or small. A belief in such hypotheses seems
                    inconsistent with a fundamental tenet of Buddhist philosophy, that there are
                    only two sources of knowledge, experience, and inference; but the hypotheses
                    themselves are too intimately involved in the whole scheme of Buddhism to leave
                    much doubt as^to their having formed part of the original doctrine of its
                    founder. They are, however, scarcely distinctive of Buddhism, but, like the
                    pessimist view of life, are rather modifications of previous beliefs which
                    Buddhism adopted into its system, and from the consequences of which it promised
                    to relieve those who followed out its teachings.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The two ideas of the utter vanity of all earthly good and the inevitable law of
                    rebirth, decay, and death will be seen to lead naturally to the belief in
                    Nirvana. If life be an evil, and death itself be no delivery from life, it is
                    necessary to go further back to discover the very origin, the seed, so to speak,
                    of existence; and by destroying that to put an end at last to the long train of
                    misery in which we are compelled to go again and again through the same weary
                    round of experiences, always ending in disappointment. This seed of existence
                    Buddhism finds in “Karma,” the sum of merit and demerit, which, as each one’s
                    demerit is the greater of the two, often comes practically to much the same
                    thing as <hi rend="italic">sin</hi> or error. It forms the second link in the

                    Destroy that ignorance which brings^with it such a progeny, cut the links of
                    this chain of existence, root out karma with the mistaken cleaving to life, and
                    there will be deliverance at last—deliverance from all sorrow and all trouble in
                    the eternal rest of Nirvana. Anything less than this would be a mockery of hope;
                    for there is no life outside the domain of transmigration, and by the inevitable
                    law of change that which causes existence of any kind would itself be the cause
                    also of decay, and bring with it after a time the whole chain of evils from
                    which the tired heart of man seeks relief.</p>
                <p>To reach this end, to destroy karma, and thus to attain Nirvana, there is only
                    one way—the fourfold path already explained above, which is also summed up in
                    the Buddhist books in the eight divisions, “right views, right thoughts, right
                    speech, right actions, right living, right exertion, right recollection, and
                    right meditation.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From

                    means ignorance will be overcome and karma destroyed, and after the organized
                    being has been dissolved in death, there will be nothing left to bring about the
                    production of another life. For it must be understood that while Buddhism
                    occasionally yielded so far to popular phraseology as to make use of the word
                    soul, it denies altogether that the word is anything more than a convenient
                    expression, or that it bas any counterpart in fact. Birth is not rebirth, but
                    new birth; transmigration of soul becomes a transfer of karma; metempsychosis
                    gives way to metamorphosis. As one generation dies and gives way to another—the
                    heir of the consequences of all its vices and all its virtues, the exact result
                    of pre-existing causes—so each individual in the long chain of life inherits all
                    of good or evil that all its predecessors have done or been, and takes up the
                    struggle towards enlightenment precisely there where they have left it. There is
                    nothing eternal, but the law of cause and effect, and change; the kosmos itself
                    is passing away; even karma can be destroyed; nothing is, everything becomes.
                    And so with this organized life of ours, it contains within itself no eternal
                    germ; it passes away like everything else, there only remains the accumulated
                    result of all its actions. One lamp is lighted at another; the second flame
                    differs from the first, to which it owes its existence. A seed grows into a tree
                    and produces a seed from which arises another tree different from the first,
                    though resulting from it. And so the true Buddhist saint does not mar the purity
                    of his self-denial by lusting after a positive happiness which he himself is to
                    enjoy hereafter. He himself will cease to be, but his virtue will live and work
                    out its full effect in the decrease of the sum of the misery of sentient
                    beings.</p>
                <p>A not unnatural confusion has arisen from the fact that the result of each man’s
                    actions is held not to be dissipated as it were into many streams, but
                    concentrated together in the formation of one new sentient being. This link of
                    connection between the two otherwise distinct individuals has led to expressions
                    in Buddhist writings which when read by Christians seemed to infer the existence
                    of a soul. Phrases used of those living saints who have entered the fourth path,
                    and have practically attained Nirvana, have also been supposed by mistake to
                    apply to Nirvana itself. And when further Nirvana has been described in glowing
                    terms as the happy seat; the excellent eternal place of bliss, where there is no
                    more death, neither decay; the end of suffering; the home of peace; the other
                    side of the ocean of existence; the shore of salvation; the harbour of refuge;
                    the medicine for all evil; the transcendent, formless, tranquil state, the
                    Truth, the Infinite, the Unspeakable, the Everlasting,—it has been supposed by
                    some European scholars to mean a blissful state, in which the soul (!) still
                    exists in an everlasting trance. There can, <pb break="no"

                    Spence Hardy and Bigandet find in the modern Sinhalese and Burmese books the
                    same opinion as Alvis and Gogerly and especially Childers have found in the more
                    ancient authorities; and though the modern books of the Northern Buddhists are
                    doubtful, Eugène Burnouf has clearly proved that their older texts contain only
                    the same doctrine as that held in the South. Buddhism does not acknowledge the
                    existence of a soul as a thing distinct from the parts and powers of man which
                    are dissolved at death, and the Nirvana of Buddhism is simply Extinction.<note

                <p>It will seem strange to many that a religion which ignores the existence of God,
                    and denies the existence of the soul, should be the very religion which has
                    found most acceptance among men, and it is easy to maintain that had Buddha
                    merely taught philosophy, or had he lived in later ages, he might have had as
                    small a following as Comte. Gautama’s power over the people arose in a great
                    degree from the glow of his practical philanthropy, which did not shrink in the
                    struggle against the abuses most peculiar to his time; his philosophy and his
                    ethics attracted the masses, from whose chained hands they struck off the
                    manacles of caste, and in leaving the school for the world they insensibly
                    became a religion. But there is no reason to believe that Gautama intended
                    either at the beginning or the end of his career to be the founder of a new
                    religion. He seems to have hoped that the new wine would go into the old
                    bottles, and that all men, not excepting even the Brahmins, would gradually
                    adopt his, the only orthodox, form of the ancient creed. However the question of
                    the historical succession or connection between the different systems of Hindu
                    philosophy be ultimately settled, whether any of them were post-Buddhistic or
                    not, they afford at least sufficient evidence that beliefs very inconsistent
                    with the practical creed of the masses met with little opposition from the
                    priests so long as they were taught only in schools of philosophy; and Buddhist
                    morality was not calculated to excite anger or hatred. But the very means which
                    Gautama adopted to extend and give practical effect to his teaching, while
                    giving it temporary success, led to its ultimate expulsion from India. It was
                    his Society rather than his doctrine, the Sangha rather than the Dharma, which
                    both gave to his religion its practical vitality and excited the active
                    hostility of the Brahmins.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Sangha</hi><hi rend="italic">or
                    Society,the Buddhist Order of Mendicants.</hi> —It was a logical conclusion from
                    the views of life held by Gautama that any rapid progress in spiritual life was
                    only compatible with an ascetic life, in which all such contact with the world
                    as would tend to create earthly desires could be reduced as much as possible;
                    and accordingly from the first he not only adopted such a mode of life for
                    himself but urged it on his more earnest disciples. He contemplated no such
                    division between clergy and laity as obtains in Christian countries, and
                    constantly maintained that there was no positive merit in outward acts of
                    self-denial or penance; but holding that family connections and the possession
                    of wealth or power were likely to prolong that mistaken estimate of the value of
                    things, that clinging to life which was the origin of evil, he taught that to
                    forsake the world was a necessary step towards the attainment of spiritual
                    freedom. Little by little, as occasion arose, he laid down rules for the
                    guidance of those who thus devoted themselves to the higher life, and insensibly
                    as he did so, the Society became more and more like one of the monkish orders
                    which sprung up afterwards in the west. But not even now has the order become a
                    priesthood. It possesses no mystic powers of regeneration or confirmation or
                    absolution from sin; it works no miracle3 by consecration or by prayer, and its
                    doors are always open alike to those who wish to enter and to those who wish to
                    leave it. In a system which acknowledged no Creator and no God, the monks could
                    never become the only efficient intercessors between man and his Maker; and
                    since salvation was held to be and to depend upon a radical change in man’s
                    nature, brought about by his own self-denial and his own self-control, the monks
                    could never obtain power over the keys of heaven and hell. When successive kings
                    and chiefs were allowed to endow the society, not indeed with gold or silver,
                    but with the few necessaries of the monkish life, including lands and houses, it
                    gradually ceased in great measure to be the school of virtue or the most
                    favourable sphere for intellectual progress, and became thronged with the
                    worthless and the idle; but in the time of its founder it undoubtedly contained
                    few besides those who longed under his guidance first to train themselves and
                    then to preach to others the glad tidings of rest; that hope, to us so
                    uninviting and so cold, to them—to whom life, under their glowing sky and under
                    the oppressive weight of tyranny in church and state, was a burden too heavy to
                    be borne—to them so welcome and so sweet, of utter rest in annihilation. For
                    admittance to the Society no other credentials were at first required than the
                    simple wish of the applicant; afterwards on different occasions a few necessary
                    conditions were imposed, the applicant being obliged to state that he was free
                    from contagious disease, consumption, and fits; that he was neither a slave nor
                    a debtor nor a soldier, that is, that he was <hi rend="italic">sui juris;</hi>
                    and that he had obtained the consent of his parents. At first, also, the
                    candidate was admitted without any ceremony by merely shaving his head, putting
                    on the yellow robes, and leading an a3cetic life; afterwards a simple ceremony
                    was adopted, probably identical with that now in use in Ceylon, an excellent
                    account of which has been given in the Journals of the Ceylon Asiatic Society
                    for 1852 and of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1873. At first also there is no
                    mention of any distinction within the ranks of the society; but the preparatory
                    rank of novice was very early introduced, and later on, as the religion became
                    more and more corrupted, the order became more and more subdivided, until in
                    Tibet, in the 14th century, we find a complete episcopal hierarchy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rules of the Order.—</hi> The most usual names applied in the
                    sacred books to the senior members of the order are Sramana and Ehikshu, and to
                    the novices Sämanera. The first, from which the third is derived, means one who
                    exerts himself, controls himself; the second means simply a beggar.
                    Self-conquest and poverty, then, were to be the distinguishing characteristics
                    of the “sons of Säkya,” but it was not left to them to decide for themselves how
                    far this selfsuppression and abstinence were to be carried. The teacher gave a
                    number of rules and directions which have been handed down to us more or less
                    correctly in the Vinaya, the first part of the Buddhist canon, and which are
                    summed up in the <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> Pâtimokkha,” a book which,
                    though not included in the canon, cannot be much later than the great council of
                    Asoka, about 250, and is regarded with much reverence by the monks, from its
                    having from time immemorial been ordered to be read twice monthly in every
                    monastery. These rules may be roughly divided into two divisions, those which
                    are obligatory, and those which, not being obligatory, are recommended to such
                    as wish to work out their own salvation to a point further than that attainable
                    by the ordinary rules. And first, as to <hi rend="italic">food.</hi> No monk can
                    eat solid food except between sunrise and noon, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n482/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0482-0435"/> total abstinence from intoxicating drinks is
                    obligatory. The usual mode of obtaining food is for the monk to take his
                    begging-bowl, a brown earthenware vessel, in shape nearly like a soup tureen
                    without its cover, and holding it in his hands, to beg straight from house to
                    house. He is to say nothing, but simply stand outside the hut, the doors and
                    windows of which in India are usually large and open. If anything is put into
                    his bowl he utters a pious wish on behalf of the giver and passes on; if nothing
                    is given he passes on in silence, and thus begs straight on without going to the
                    houses of the rich or luxurious rather than to those of the poor and thrifty. As
                    the food of all classes consisted almost exclusively of some form of curry, the
                    mixture was not so very incongruous, and when enough had been given, the monk
                    retired to his home to eat it, thinking the while of the impermanence and
                    worthlessness of the body which was thus nourished, and of the processes through
                    which the food would have to pass. To express a Buddhist idea in the quaint
                    words of Herbert, “Look on meat, think it dirt, then eat a bit, and say withal,
                    Earth to earth I commit.” From the first it was permitted to wealthy or pious
                    laymen to invite one or more monks to take their mid day meal at their houses,
                    and this was frequently done, especially on full moon days; it was also allowed
                    to the laity on special occasions to bring food to the monastery. For the
                    stricter monks further vows are mentioned of abstinence from animal food, of
                    eating the whole meal without rising, of refusing all invitations and all food
                    brought to them, of eating everything in the bowl without leaving or rejecting
                    anything, and so on; but it is doubtful whether they are ever observed now, and
                    they were formerly taken only for a time. Much later a practice sprung up of the
                    order possessing rice fields, letting them out to be cultivated on condition of
                    receiving a share of the produce, and then having their meals cooked at home by
                    some lay follower or even slave.</p>
                <p>As regards <hi rend="italic">residence,</hi> Gautama considered a lonely life in
                    the forest to be the most conducive to self-conquest; but as he himself, after
                    having lived apart from the world, spent his life from the commencement of his
                    prophetic career among men, so from the first the lonely life was adopted only
                    by the most earnest, and that only for a time. The majority of the monks lived
                    in companies in groves or gardens, and very soon the piety of laymen provided
                    for them suitable monasteries, several of which were built even in the lifetime
                    of Buddha. During the fine weather the monks often travelled from place to
                    place, as their teacher did, but during the rainy season they always settled in
                    one spot in or near a town; and near the ancient cities of India have been
                    lately discovered extensive ruins on the site of the monasteries mentioned in
                    the Pâli books. On the other hand, there have been found numerous rock caves,
                    many of which, especially in Ceylon, were evidently meant for solitary hermits,
                    and they often bear inscriptions in the old Pali character, brought by Asoka’s
                    son Mahendra to Ceylon in the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>As regards <hi rend="italic">clothing,</hi> the monks were to be habited in
                    clothes of no value, put together from cast-off rags; but here again the
                    practice of Buddha himself, and that followed by the large majority of the
                    brethren, was to dress in simple robes of dull orange colour, first torn to
                    pieces and then sewed together again, so as to form two under garments, and one
                    upper garment to cover the whole of the body except the right shoulder. All
                    three are simply lengths of cotton cloth; the two under ones, the antara-väsaka
                    and the sanghäti, being wrapt round the middle of the body, and round the thighs
                    and legs respectively; and the upper one, the uttaräsanga, being first wrapt
                    round the legs and then drawn over the left shoulder. The colour was probably at
                    first chosen as the one regarded with most contempt, because of its being nearly
                    the same as that of very old rags of the common white cotton cloth, and because
                    cloths of that colour were of no value at all for ordinary purposes; but the
                    orange-coloured robes, from their very peculiarity as a sign of the members of
                    the Sangha, soon came to be looked upon as an honour, and were sought after on
                    that account alone; so that the Dhammapada, a collection of ethical verses, one
                    of the books in the Buddhist canon, has to give a warning that those who are not
                    free from sin (kasäva) are not worthy of the orange colour (käsäva). In Buddhist
                    countries men’s ordinary dress is merely a cloth wrapt round the loins, whereas
                    the monks are to cover the whole body, and are not permitted at any time to lay
                    their robes aside. To do so would be to lay aside their membership of the order,
                    to put on or to put off the robes being current expressions for joining or
                    leaving the Society. Of course no ornaments are allowed, and even the natural
                    ornament of hair is not permitted, complete tonsure being obligatory on all. No
                    monk should possess more than one change of robes, and minute rules in detail
                    are laid down to guard against any brother even by indirect methods taking any
                    steps to procure himself new ones; to provide them spontaneously is the duty and
                    privilege of the laity.</p>
                <p>It is scarcely necessary to state that <hi rend="italic">sexual intercourse,
                    theft,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">murder</hi> entail upon the culprit
                    irrevocable expulsion from the order; while the ease with which the Society
                    could be left provided an escape for those who found the vow of continence too
                    hard to keep. On the vow of <hi rend="italic">poverty</hi> a few words ought to
                    be said. In his individual right no monk is to possess more than the following
                    eight articles: 1, 2, 3, the three robes mentioned above; 4, a girdle for the
                    loins; <hi rend="italic">5,</hi> an alms-bowl; 6, a razor; 7, a needle; 8, a
                    water-strainer, through which he is to strain all he drinks— not only to remove
                    impurities, but also and chiefly to prevent the accidental destruction of any
                    living creatures. This individual vow of poverty has however been swallowed up
                    by the permission given to the community to possess not only books and other
                    personal property, but even lands and houses. Gautama himself is said to have
                    received such gifts on behalf of the Sangha, which at the time of its expulsion
                    from India must have rivalled in wealth the most powerful orders of the Middle
                    Ages; and in some Buddhist countries at the present day the Society possesses
                    enormous tracts of the most valuable land. But water-drinking celibates, who
                    take only one meal a day, and dress in a simple uniform, could never indulge in
                    unbounded personal luxury. Many members of the order enjoy the fascinating sense
                    of wealth, so completely contrary to all the principles of their religion, and
                    to the precepts laid down by their Teacher for the attainment of spiritual
                    progress; they are often lazy and not seldom avaricious; but in the southern
                    church at least théy are not disgraced by gluttony or drunkenness, and have
                    never given way to the weak vanity of dress, or of the pomp and pride of
                    ritual.</p>
                <p>The vow of <hi rend="italic">obedience</hi> was never taken by the Buddhist monks
                    or nuns, and in this may be noticed a fundamental difference between them and
                    their brethren and sisters in the West. Mental culture, not mental death, was
                    the aim set before the Buddhist ascetic by the founder of his order. Each one is
                    to conquer self by himself; and the observance of no ceremony, the belief in no
                    creed, will avail him who fails in obtaining this complete self-mastery. Outward
                    respect and courtesy to his superiors are exacted from the novice, but his own
                    salvation and his usefulness as a teacher depend on his self-culture. He is to
                    obey not his brother, but the law; his superior has no supernatural gifts of
                    wisdom or of absolution; and by himself must the ascetic stand or fall. A few
                    simple rules of discipline are laid down, but the highest punishment is to
                    compel the fallen brother to return to the world, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n483/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0483-0436"/> which he has not sufficient self-control to
                    reject. Twice a month, when the rules of the order are read, a monk who has
                    broken them is to confess his crime. If it be slight some slight penance is laid
                    upon him, to sweep the courtyard of the wihära, or to sprinkle dust round the
                    sacred Bo tree, but no inquisitorial questions are put to any one. Charges may
                    be brought against a monk for breach of the ordinances laid down by Buddha, and
                    must thenbe exami ned into by a chapter, but none can change or add to the
                    existing law, or claim obedience from any other member of the order, however
                    young.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">daily life</hi> of the novice should, according to a manual

                    be about as follows. He shall rise before daylight and wash, then sweep the
                    wihära and round the Bo tree, fetch the drinking water for the day, filter it,
                    and place it ready for use. Returning to a solitary place he shall then meditate
                    on the regulations. Then he shall offer flowers before the sacred dägaba or Bo
                    tree, thinking of the great virtues of the Teacher, and of his own faults. Soon
                    after, taking the begging-bowl, he is to follow his superior in his daily round
                    for food, and on their return is to bring water for his feet, and place the
                    alms-bowl before him. After the meal is over, he is to wash the alms-bowl, then
                    again retire, and meditate on kindness and love. About an hour afterwards he is
                    to begin his studies from the books, or copy one of them, asking his superior
                    about passages he does not understand. At sunset he is again to sweep the sacred
                    places, and lighting a lamp, to listen to the teaching of his superior, and
                    repeat such passages from the canon as he has learnt. If he finds he has
                    committed any fault he is to tell his superior; he is to be content with such
                    things as he has, and, keeping under his senses, to grow in wisdom without
                    haughtiness of body, speech, or mind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    relieved by the novices from any manual labour, were expected to devote
                    themselves all the more earnestly to intellectual culture and meditation. There
                    are five principal kinds of meditation, which in Buddhism takes the place of
                    prayer. The first is called Maitri-bhävanä, or meditation on Love, in which the
                    monk thinks of all beings, and longs for happiness for each. First, thinking how
                    happy he himself would be if free from all sorrow, anger, and evil desire, he is
                    then to wish for the same happiness for others; and lastly, to long for the
                    welfare of his foes, remembering their good actions only, and that in some
                    former birth his enemy may have been his father or his friend, he must endeavour
                    in all earnestness and truth to desire for him all the good he would seek for
                    himself. The second is Karuuä-bhävanä, or meditation on Pity, in which he thinks
                    of all beings in distress, realizes as far as he can their unhappy state, and
                    thus awakens the sentiment of pity. The third meditation is Muditä-bhävanä, or
                    meditation on Gladness, the converse of the last. The fourth is Asubha-bhävanä,
                    or Purity, in which the monk thinks of the vileness of the body, and of the
                    horrors of disease and corruption, how everything corporeal passes away like the
                    foam of the sea, and how by the continued repetition of birth and death mortals
                    become subject to continual sorrow. We hear of the mirage in the desert cheating
                    the unwary traveller’s eyes with the promise of water to quench his burning
                    thirst; but this mirage of human life, raising hopes of joy that turns bitter in
                    the drinking, is a more real mockery. The fifth is Upekshä-bhävanä, or the
                    meditation on Serenity, wherein the monk thinks of all things that men hold good
                    or bad,—power and oppression, love and hate, riches and want, fame and contempt,
                    youth and beauty, decrepitude and disease,—and regards them all with fixed
                    indifference, with utter calmness and serenity of mind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Duty of the Laity.—</hi> Gautama’s ideal was that all men
                    should sooner or later join the order, and thus that an end should be put at
                    once to individual existence and to misery and sin; but even those who did not
                    enrol themselves in the Sangha could obey many of the precepts, and by a
                    virtuous life here raise themselves in their next birth to a higher and less
                    material state of existence. Laymen could thus take the “three refuges,” and
                    keep five of the “ten precepts,” viz., not to take life, to steal, to lie, to
                    commit adultery or fornication, or to drink strong drink.<note anchored="true"

                    Buddhism,</hi> p. 460.</p></note> There are also ten commandments applicable to
                    the laity, viz., to avoid taking life, theft, illicit intercourse, lying,
                    slander, swearing, idle talk, covetousness, anger, and wrong belief, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> either superstition, doubt, or heresy; the first three
                    are sins of the body, the next four sins of the mouth, the last three sins of
                    the mind. The following short extracts from the Buddhist Scriptures will perhaps
                    give a better idea of the lay position in the Buddhist system than any longer
                    description in modern terms. In answer to a question as to what he considered
                    the <hi rend="italic">summum, bonum,</hi> Gautama is reported to have said—</p>
                <p>“1. To serve wise men, and not to serve fools, to give honour to whom honour is
                    due,—this is the greatest blessing. 2. To dwell in a pleasant land, to have done
                    good deeds in a former birth, to have right desires for one’s self,—this is the
                    greatest blessing. 3. Much insight and much education, a complete training and
                    pleasant speech, —this is the greatest blessing. 4. To succour father and
                    mother, to cherish wife and child, to follow a peaceful calling,—this is the
                    greatest blessing. 5. To give alms, and live righteously, to help one’s
                    relatives, and do blameless deeds,—this is the greatest blessing. 6. To cease
                    and abstain from sin, to eschew strong drink, not to be weary in well
                    doing,—this is the greatest blessing. 7. Reverence and lowliness, contentment
                    and gratitude, the regular hearing of the law,—this is the greatest blessing. 8.
                    To be long-suffering and meek, to associate with members of the Sangha,
                    religious talk at due seasons,—this is the greatest blessing. 9. Temperance and
                    chastity, a conviction of the four great truths, the hope of Nirvana,—this is
                    the greatest blessing. 10. A mind unshaken by the things of the world, without
                    anguish or passion, and secure,— this is the greatest blessing. 11. They that
                    act like this are invincible on every side, on every side they walk in safety,
                    and theirs is the greatest blessing.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    these are the foundation thoughts, the web and the woof of Buddhism, the
                    melodies on the variations of which its enticing harmony is built up. Such a
                    religion could never remain buried in the cloister, or remain the privilege of
                    the few. From the first it became an appeal to the many, and addressed itself
                    not to the learned or the rich but to all mankind, to men and women, slaves and
                    bondmen, Brahmins and Südras, nobles and peasants alike. The abuses of caste and
                    priestcraft could no longer grow and thrive among men who looked at every
                    question from a rationalistic standpoint, while their hearts were aglow with
                    real and practical philanthropy. In Guatama’s view men differed one from another
                    not by the accident of birth, but by their own attainments and character; the
                    same path to the same salvation lay equally open to all; and even in this life
                    the poor and the despised were welcomed to the ranks of the order, where wealth
                    was abandoned, and birth went for nothing in comparison with character or
                    insight. It is true that, like Christianity, it did not in so many words condemn
                    any of the political institutions amid which it arose; there is nothing said, at
                    least in the older books, against slavery or despotism or wealth; and even as
                    regards caste, Gautama did not directly interfere with it outside the limits of
                    his Society. But the new wine soon burst the old bottles; <pb break="no"

                    inconsistent with oppression and wrong of every kind; and the government of
                    Asoka, as Buddhist emperor of India, was probably the most enlightened, and
                    certainly the most philanthropic, which the natives of India have had.</p>

                <p>It is not surprising that teaching so earnest and so high, so deep-reaching and
                    so radical, should have met with eager acceptance among a people intensely
                    religious, to whom the doctrines of the priests held out so little hope in
                    exchange for the privileges it claimed from them on behalf of an oppressive
                    caste. It is only to be regretted that the history of Buddhism in India lies
                    under so thick a cloud that very little is known of it with certainty. Imme
                    diately after the death of Gautama the first council of 500 was held at
                    Räjagriha, as related above, and the young church, in the vigour of its purity
                    and fresh enthusiasm, spread very rapidly among the surrounding tribes. In less
                    than 150 years after the death of its founder, the new religion had become the
                    most powerful in Northern and Central India, and was the state religion of
                    Magadha, whose kings claimed the superiority over the whole peninsula. It
                    probably continued to gain in the number of its adherents till two or three
                    centuries later, but soon after the commencement of our era it began to decay;
                    though Fa Hian, a Chinese pilgrim, who visited India about 400 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> found it still flourishing over a large area, it was
                    certainly not increasing, and scarcely maintaining its ground. IIiouen Thsang,
                    another Chinese pilgrim, has left us an account of his journey made about two
                    centuries later, and he found Buddhism in a much lower condition even than it
                    had fallen to in the time of Fa Hian. In the 8th and 9th centuries a great
                    persecution arose, and the Buddhists were so utterly exterminated that there is
                    now not a Buddhist in all India; although of course the effects of so great a
                    movement could not pass away, and it left its mark for ever on the Hinduism
                    which supplanted it. The full reasons for this revolution are not known: but so
                    much is clear, that long before its expulsion Buddhism had become very corrupt;
                    the order had become wealthy and idle; and the laity, instead of following the
                    precepts of the Teacher, had gone back to the old devil-worship, witchcraft, and
                    astrology, which always underlay their nominal beliefs. From the great body of
                    his followers the ethics and philosophy of Guatama were concealed by the mass of
                    legends and superstitions which had grown up around the story of his life; and
                    though the Buddhists no longer propitiated the favour of the gods by sacrifices
                    of living beings, they rested their hopes more on their liberality to the monks
                    than on the harder duties of self-control and charity,—the latter word having
                    thus become even more limited in its meaning than it has among ourselves. Their
                    worship of the relics of the Buddha came very near to rank idolatry; their
                    reverence for their ancestors came very near to worship, and was a dangerous
                    source of emolument to the monks; while .the old Hindu gods were regarded much
                    more highly than was at all consistent with the Buddhist Abhidharma</p>
                <p>Buddhism had, however, been introduced into Ceylon, at a time when it was
                    comparatively pure, by Mahendra and Sanghamiträ, the son and daughter of the
                    emperor Asoka. It became at once the state religion, and the only religion of
                    the island, on which Brahminism had never gained much hold. Protected there by
                    its isolated position, and by the patriotic spirit which identified it with the
                    Sinhalese nation, whose hereditary enemies, the Tamils, were first Jains and
                    afterwards Hindus, it has retained almost its pristine purity to modern times.
                    From Ceylon it was introduced into Burma in the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> whence it penetrated into Arakan, Kâmbaya, and Pegu, and finally
                    into Siam in the 7th century of our era. As already mentioned, it became, in a
                    Jess pure form, the state religion of Kashmir about the time of Christ, and was
                    thence carried to Nepal and to Tibet and China. It would be impossible within
                    the limits of this article to trace its various fortunes in these countries, but
                    the following remarks may not be out of place.</p>
                <p>It would be hazardous as yet to attempt to trace chronologically the growth of
                    the Buddhist legends, but in one or other of the Buddhist books are found the
                    following ideas, the growth of which was, under the circumstances, almost
                    inevitable. Gautama himself became regarded as omniscient, and as absolutely
                    sinless; he was supposed to have descended of his own accord from heaven into
                    his mother’s womb, and to have had no earthly father; angels were said to have
                    assisted at his birth, immediately after which he walked three paces, and in a
                    voice of thunder proclaimed his own greatness. On his formal presentation to his
                    father, an aged saint is said to have worshipped him and prophesied that he
                    would become a Buddha, who would show the people the way of salvation. When the
                    babe was five months old, he was left under a tree, where he meditated so deeply
                    that he worked himself into a trance; and five wise men who were journeying
                    northwards through the air, being miraculously stopped over the place where he
                    was, came down and worshipped him, the hymn put into their mouths surprising us
                    in the midst of so absurd a legend by its beauty; in five stanzas they announce
                    that the babe shall be the teacher of a law which shall be the water to
                    extinguish all the fires of the sorrows of life, the light to enlighten the
                    world, and the chariot to carry us through this wilderness to the promised land;
                    that he shall deliver men from the bonds and shackles of the world, and be the
                    great physician to heal all their diseases, and do away with the miseries of
                    life and death. The only other legend we have of his youth is one in which he is
                    said to have surpassed all his contemporaries in feats of bodily and mental
                    skill, and even to have taught his teachers,—the later forms of this legend
                    bearing a curious resemblance to some parts of the apocryphal “Gospel of the
                    Infancy.” In the accounts of his father’s home and of his marriage he is
                    surrounded with all the state and wealth of the eldest son and heir to a
                    powerful monarch, whereas it is apparent from the geographical and other details
                    that his father’s power can only at most have extended a few miles from his
                    home. It was a pious task to make his abnegation and condescension greater by
                    the comparison between the splendour of the position he abandoned and the
                    poverty in which he afterwards lived; and in countries distant from Kapilavastu
                    the inconsistencies between these glowing accounts and the very names they
                    contain would pass unnoticed by credulous hearers. With the same object of
                    magnifying the person of Buddha, he is related in the legends to have performed
                    at various times a very large number of miracles, mostly mere manifestations of
                    power of no direct advantage to any one, and only designed to impress those who
                    beheld or might hear of them with a belief in his great superiority over other
                    teachers. Of several of these legends we have different versions in authorities
                    of different ages, and it is exceedingly interesting and instructive to notice
                    how the supernatural parts of the story gradually grow. Among the northern
                    Buddhists of Kashmir, Tibet, Nepal, and China, these legends have assumed much
                    larger dimensions than among the southern Buddhists in Burma, Siam, and Ceylon,
                    the former having evolved a theory of the spirit of the Buddhas still working in
                    the church, while the latter remain at the standpoint apparent in the canon as
                    fixed by the council of Asoka.</p>

                    the Great Vehicle, in contradistinction to that of the southern church, which
                    they call, not without some contempt, the Little Vehicle; and the Great Vehicle,
                    while holding fast to the real foundation of Buddhism, its ethical views of
                    selfconquest and charity, has in fact developed an entirely new religion. This
                    is based on the worship of Maitreya, the Dhyâni-buddhas, Manjüsrï, and
                    Avalôkitëswara, personifications respectively of charity, meditation, serenity,
                    and wisdom. The first of these appears in ancient Buddhism as the name of the
                    Buddha to come, and the last is the holy spirit of the northern Buddhist church.
                    Among the Dhyâni-buddhas, who are philosophical abstractions corresponding to
                    the earthly Buddhas, Amitâbha, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Infinite Light, is
                    the heavenly counterpart of Gautama, and soon took the most important place.
                    Avalôkitëswara “proceeded” from him, and manifests him to the world since the
                    death of Buddha; and his worship in the 1 Oth century of our era bore its full
                    fruit in the invention of a being, Adibuddha, the origin of all things, who,
                    using the wisdom within him, produced by meditation the five Dhyâni-buddhas, of
                    whom Amitâbha is the fourth,—a notion curiously similar to the theosophy of the
                    Gnostics, and utterly opposed to the Agnostic materialism of Buddha.</p>
                <p>In Tibet especially, the development in doctrine was followed by a development in
                    ecclesiastical government, which runs so remarkably parallel with the
                    development of the Romish hierarchy as to awaken an interest which could
                    scarcely otherwise be found in the senseless and fatal corruptions which have
                    overwhelmed the ancient Buddhist beliefs. The Buddhism introduced into that
                    country in the 7th and 8th centuries of our era was a form of the Great Vehicle,
                    already much corrupted by Siva-ism, a mixture of witchcraft and Hindu
                    philosophy; but it worked a great change among the savage races who then
                    inhabited those remote valleys. In the 13th century the country was possessed by
                    independent chiefs, who struggled with the abbots of the great monasteries for
                    power over the people; and the crozier proved itself in the long run more
                    powerful than the sword. We then find the two leading priests or archbishops,
                    the Pantshen Lâma and the Dalai Lâma, claiming to be official incarnations of
                    Amitâbha and Avalôkitëswara; and the latter as such succeeded in obtaining
                    superior political and secular power, leaving to his brother pope his high
                    ecclesiastical position and the aroma of holiness—a division of power which has
                    again resulted in a Guelph and Ghibelin-like rivalry. Lâmaism, with its shaven
                    priests, its bells and rosaries, its images and holy water, its popes and
                    bishops, its abbots and monks of many grades, its processions and feast-days,
                    its confessional and purgatory, and its worship of the double Virgin, so
                    strongly resembles Romanism, that the first Catholic missionaries thought it
                    must be an imitation by the devil of the religion of Christ; and that the
                    resemblance is not in externals only is shown by the present state of Tibet —
                    the oppression of all thought, the idleness and corruption of the monks, the
                    despotism of the Government, and the poverty and beggary of the people.</p>
                <p>Of the sacred books of the Northern Buddhists, we have in the original debased
                    Sanskrit only the “Lalita Vistara” a legendary life of Buddha, published in the

                    translations of which are mentioned in the beginning of this article. Of the
                    canon of the Southern Buddhists, which is about twice the length of our Bible,
                    we have in the original Pâli only—1. the Dhammapada, a collection of didactic
                    poems edited by Mr Fausböll of Copenhagen, with a Latin translation in 1855; 2.

                    Minayeff with a Russian translation, in 1867. A fuller account by the writer of
                    this article of all the work already accomplished in the editing of Pâli texts,
                    dictionaries, and grammars, will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Report of the
