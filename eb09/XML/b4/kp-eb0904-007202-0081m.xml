                    Suffolk County, and the second city in commerce, wealth, banking capital, and
                    valuation in the United States of North America. It lies at the bottom of
                    Massachusetts Bay, and is one of many pear-shaped peninsulas formerly attached
                    to the mainland only by narrow marshy necks, which fringed the shores of the
                    bay. The Charles River, once more than double its present width, divides it from
                    the similar promontory of Charlestown (the site of the battle of Bunker Hill),
                    on the other side of which the Mystic River, uniting with the Charles, flows
                    into the harbour. The latest determination gives the latitude of Boston 42° 2Γ
                    27 ’ 6" N., and the longitude 5° 59' 18"E. from Washington and 71° 3' 30" W.
                    from Greenwich. When it is noon in Boston it is 4 o’clock 44 minutes and 14
                    seconds at Greenwich, and 36 minutes past 11 at Washington, which is distant by
                    railroad 450 miles.</p>
                <p>The Indian name of the peninsula was “Shawmut,” meaning “living fountains.” When
                    Governor John Winthrop, with his company, came over from England with the king’s
                    charter, to establish a government under it in the bay, they reached
                    Charlestown, as a temporary settlement, on June 17, 1630. Looking across the
                    Charles, the Indian Shawmut presented to the eye an elevation nearly in its
                    centre, with three distinct summit peaks, the remnants of the only one of which
                    now remaining constitute the present Beacon Hill, so called from its ancient use
                    as a signal warning station. These triple summits led to the substitution of the
                    name “Trimountaine,” or “Tremont,” as the English designation of the whole
                    peninsula—a favourite title perpetuated in the name of a central street, <pb

                    &amp;c. A single lonely white man, the Rev. William Blaxton, a clergyman of the
                    English Church, was then living, with house, orchard, and garden on the slope of
                    the central hill, supposed to have come over in 1623, one of several isolated
                    settlers on the promontories and islands of the bay, called “the old planters.”
                    He invited Winthrop’s company to cross the river and build their cabins on his
                    side, because of the purer and more abundant water-springs. On the records of
                    the company we read, that at a court held in Charlestown, September 17 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(n.s.),</hi> 1630, “It is ordered that Trimountaine shall be
                    called Boston.” This has consequently been the date assumed for the foundation
                    of what is now the present citv. and the second centennial of which was
                    commemorated by public civic services, an oration by Josiah Quincy, a former
                    mayor, then president of Harvard University, and a poem by the banker-poet,
                    Charles Sprague. It is not probable that the peninsula was occupied till a month
                    later. Blaxton, not finding the new-comers congenial associates, sold out his
                    rights to them in 1634, and moved elsewhere. It has often been said, and has
                    been widely accepted, that Boston received its name in compliment to the second
                    minister of its first church, the Rev. John Cotton, formerly vicar of St
                    Botolph’s, borough of Boston, Lincolnshire, England. This was not the case. The
                    Rev. John Wilson, of King’s College, Cambridge, and of Sudbury, in Suffolk,
                    England, came in Winthrop’s company, and was first pastor of the church. Cotton
                    did not arrive till September <hi rend="italic">4,</hi> 1633, three years after
                    the name Boston had been adopted. Undoubtedly the name was chosen in compliment
                    to the much honoured Mr Isaac Johnson, one of the foremost in the enterprise,
                    who with his wife, the Lady Arbella, daughter of the Earl of Lincoln, came with
                    Winthrop in a vessel bearing her name. Johnson was from the English Boston, as
                    were also his associates, Atherton Hough, who had been mayor of the borough, and
                    Thomas Leverett, “ruling elder” of the church, who had been an aiderman.</p>
                <p>Some graceful courtesies have been exchanged in recent years between the two
                    cities. The English Boston sent over a copy of her charter, framed in wood from
                    St Botolph’s church, and this now hangs in the city hall of the Massachusetts
                    capital; and some descendants of John Cotton, with members of his American
                    Church, through one of their number, Edward Everett, then American minister at
                    the Court of St James’s, united in a generous subscription to restore a chapel
                    in St Botolph’s, and to erect a monumental tablet in it to the revered
                    teacher.</p>
                <p>The sea-girt peninsula seems to have attracted the choice of the colonists as a
                    place of settlement, because of its facilities for commerce and for defence. Its
                    aboriginal occupants had previously been devasted by a plague, leaving it
                    vacant. Some fifty years afterwards the settlers satisfied the claims of an
                    Indian sachem, representing that his grandfather had been its proprietor. Had
                    these settlers contemplated the enormous outlay of labour, skill, and money,
                    which their posterity would have to expend upon the original site to make it
                    habitable and commodious, they might have planted themselves elsewhere. There
                    was neither wood nor meadow on the peninsula; but it might be defended from the
                    Indians and wolves, and as ono early visitor vainly imagined, from “moskitoes.”
                    The surface was very abrupt, irregular, hilly, and undulating, deeply indented
                    by coves, and surrounded by salt-marshes left oozy by the ebbing tides, and
                    separating the shores from the river channels. The peninsula contained less than
                    1000 acres, and the narrow neck, which joined it to the main, was often swept by
                    spray and water. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n83/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0083-0074"/> widening of Charles River near its mouth gored
                    deeply into the northern side of the peninsula, almost dividing it, and the
                    waters were soon turned to account for a mill-pond. This was filled up by earth
                    from the hills in 1807, adding more than 50 acres to the territory. Another
                    broad cove on the southern side was filled in 1837, adding 77 acres more. The
                    Back Bay, so called, and all the flats on both sides of the original neck, have
                    since been reclaimed for the various uses of a public garden, and squares,
                    streets, dwellings, churches, schools, hotels, manufactories, &lt;fcc.,
                    constituting, in fact, a new city with many costly and elegant structures, on
                    what was originally the narrowest and most disagreeable, but is now the fairest
                    and widest, portion of the primitive site. But whole forests-from the State of
                    Maine, and vast quarries of granite, and hills of country gravel, have been put
                    to service in fringing water margins, constructing the wharves, piers, and
                    causeways, redeeming the flats, and furnishing piling and solid foundations for
                    the stately edifices, private houses, halls, churches, and railroad stations,
                    principally between Charles River and the old Dorchester flats. From the first
                    settlement, however, the ownership and occupancy of land by the citizens were
                    not confined to the soil of the peninsula. The land needed for grazing, farming,
                    and wood, on neighbouring promontories and islands was soon placed under the
                    jurisdiction of Boston, for its “inlargement.” Portions of territory, thus
                    added, were from time to time severed, and have since been re-annexed. Noddle’s
                    Island, now East Boston, was “layd to Boston” in 1637. It then contained 660
                    acres, with several hundreds more of flats and marsh, since reclaimed. It has a
                    wharf, 1000 feet in length, for the English and Canadian steamers. Dorchester
                    Neck and Point, containing 560 acres, were annexed as South Boston in 1804, and
                    the neighbouring Washington Village in 1855. The city of Roxbury was annexed in
                    1868; the town of Dorchester in 1870; the city of Charlestown, and the towns of
                    Brighton and West Roxbury, in 1874. The 900 acres of the original peninsula have
                    been doubled on its own area; while the present area of the city’s jurisdiction
                    covers 22,472 acres. The whole length of the original peninsula, from Roxbury
                    line to Winnisimmet Ferry, was two miles and a little more than three quarters;
                    its greatest breadth was 1 mile and 139 yards. The reclaimed territory is raised
                    to a uniform level, sufficiently high to secure it against freshets, and is well
                    drained. While the original site still preserves to a large extent its
                    irregularity of surface, and its undulations, some of its former steep eminences
                    have been reduced or wholly removed. The highest eminence in the old territory
                    is about 110 feet above the sea-level. This work of levelling, grading, and
                    reclaiming has been done at vast expense. But greater has been the expense of
                    widening and straightening the narrow and crooked highways, streets,
                    thoroughfares, and lanes of the first settlers, which are traditionally said to
                    have been made by the cattle on their way to and from their pastures. This, next
                    to the water-works, has been the occasion of the most considerable increase of
                    the debt incurred by the city, somewhat relieved by assessments for betterment
                    on abutting proprietors. It is believed that there has been a larger outlay of
                    labour, material, and money, in reducing, levelling, and reclaiming territory,
                    and in straightening and widening thoroughfares in Boston, than has been
                    expended for the same purposes in all the other chief cities of the United
                    States together. The broad watercourses around Boston are now spanned by
                    causeways and bridges,—East Boston only, that the harbour may be opened to the
                    navyyard, being reached by a ferry. The first bridge over Charles River, that to
                    Charlestown, was opened in 1786; the West Boston bridge, to Cambridge, in 1793;
                    the Western Avenue, a solid causeway to Brookline, 7000 feet long, in 1821.
                    Boston has now to maintain sixteen bridges. Most of the railroads also have
                    their bridges. Six of the islands in Boston harbour are the property of the
                    city, and three more of them have been ceded to the United States for
                    fortifications. The harbour islands, including rocks and shoals, are very
                    numerous, rendering the navigation through the two channels very difficult and
                    easily guarded. But the harbour, when reached, is very secure. It is nearly 14
                    miles long, and 8 miles wide, giving nearly 60 square miles of anchorage. These
                    islands were for the most part heavily wooded when first occupied, and some of
                    them were profitably used for grazing and pasturage. Since they have been
                    stripped of their primitive growth for fuel and building material, it has been
                    found impracticable to reclothe them with trees, on account of the roughness of
                    the sea-air. The washing of the soil from the bluffs of many of them, to the
                    great injury of the harbour, has involved large expense in the erection of
                    seawalls. The first settlers constructed rude defences, frequently repaired and
                    extended, on Castle Island, 2∣ miles from Boston. More formidable works were
                    raised here by an English engineer in 1701-3. The United States Government has
                    constructed elaborate fortifications on this site, now called Fort Independence,
                    which, with Forts Winthrop and Warren, on neighbouring islands, offer formidable
                    harbour defences. The first lighthouse was erected in the harbour, on Beacon
                    Island, 8-∣ miles from the town, near the Great Brewster, in 1716. This was
                    destroyed during the Revolutionary War, re-erected in 1783, ceded to the United
                    States in 1790, refitted in 1856 and 1860, with a tower 98 feet high, fog-horn,
                    bell, &amp;c., and is now called the Outer Light. An inner lighthouse was
                    established on Long Island Head in 1819, refitted in 1855. On the long spit, at
                    the western extremity of the Little Brewster, stands the Bug or Spit Light,
                    erected in 1856.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable, considering the leading and conspicuous character which has
                    always attached to Boston from the first English settlement of the country, that
                    it should have remained for nearly two centuries under the simple form and
                    administration of a town government, the same as that of the smallest interior
                    hamlets. Such a government, by all the citizens assembled in “town meeting” to
                    dispose all their affairs, was, however, found favourable to the development and
                    prosperity of the community. Here was trained a homogeneous population under
                    peculiar institutions. Wealth slowly but steadily increased, through the whale
                    and cod fisheries, the fur-trade, the sale of lumber and pitch, and a commerce
                    largely with the West Indies and elsewhere,—though much impeded by the
                    restrictions of the English navigation laws. Heavy exactions and drawbacks were
                    found in the Indian and in the French colonial wars. Here began opposition to
                    the measures of the British ministry, for oppressing and taxing the colonies.
                    The Stamp Act, passed in 1765, was repealed in 1766. The Tea Act, passed in
                    1773, was defied by the emptying of three cargoes of tea into the harbour,
                    December 16 of the same year, by a party in the guise of “Mohawk Indians.” The
                    port was closed by a British fleet, June 1, 1774. The British army evacuated
                    Boston March 17,1776, after having been beleaguered in it nearly a year. The
                    constitution of the State was adopted here in 17 80, midway in the war.</p>
                <p>Boston received a city charter in 1822. Its Government is composed of a mayor,
                    twelve aidermen, and a common council of seventy-two members, three from each of
                    its twenty-four wards, annually elected by the citizens. There are commissioners
                    for fire, water, health, and various other departments. There is a board of
                    twelve overseers of the poor, with a commodious central building, connected <pb

                    the board acts in concert. The board h0ld3 charity trust funds amounting to
                    $312,183 , it expended in 1874 $101,591, and relieved 304 beneficiaries on its
                    trust funds, and 9762 other persons.</p>

                    in 1708, was about 12,000; in 1719, about 18,000; in 1780, about 23,000; in
                    1800, 25,000; in 1850, 139,000; and, with Roxbury and Dorchester, in 1873, was
                    308,875. Charlestown brought with it 32,040; West Roxbury, 10,361; and Brighton,
                    5978. The total, in 1875, must be nearly 360,000. The valuation of the city in
                    May 1875 was $554,200,150 of real estate, and $244,554,900 of personal
                    property,—total, $798,755,050. The value of the corporate public property is
                    $30,787,292. The net city debt is $27,294,208. The number of public paupers,
                    including insane, is 689; of criminals, 1495. There are fifty-eight banks of
                    deposit and discount in the city, the capital of which is $52,900,000, and the
                    circulation $27,074,396. The number of savings-banksis twenty-one, with deposits
                    of $73,322,368·56. Of fire and marine insurance companies, stock and mutual,
                    there are thirty, with four new ones in formation, besides life insurance
                    companies and those against accidents and for specific forms of property. The
                    annual sale of merchandise in the city is estimated at $1,000,000,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> Boston has commercial relations with every part
                    of the globe. In 1874 the gold value of its foreign imports was $49,522,547; of
                    its exports of foreign merchandise, $2,084,257; and of its dotnestic
                    merchandise, in currency, $27,035,169. There arrived 167 American vessels from
                    foreign ports, with a tonnage of 234,587 and 6324 men; of foreign vessels from
                    foreign ports 1849, with a tonnage 484,448 and 18,486 men. There cleared for
                    foreign ports, 598 American vessels, with 254,347 tons and 6606 men; and 1882
                    foreign vessels, with 472,941 tons and 17,995 men. The total tonnage of Boston,
                    registered and enrolled, on Docember 31, 1874, was 331,266. Its commerce is
                    slowly recovering from the effects of the war of secession.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Great Fires.—</hi> The buildings of Boston having from the
                    first been largely of wood,—the use of which material for that purpose is now
                    under severe restrictions,—and closely compacted, the old town suffered from
                    frequent and disastrous conflagrations, several of which were successively
                    described as “The Great Fire.” There had been ten of these disasters, severe
                    under the then existing circumstances, before the year 1698. In 1711, the
                    town-house and a meeting-house, both of brick, and a hundred dwellings were
                    destroyed. In 1760 a conflagration consumed 349 dwellings, stores, and shops,
                    and rendered more than 1000 people homeless. But these and all subsequent ones
                    were eclipsed in their devastation by the disaster of November 9-10, 1872, in
                    which hundreds of costly warehouses filled with goods, with banks, offices,
                    churches, ·&amp;c., were destroyed, though all of brick or granite, involving a
                    loss of over $80,000,000. It is an evidence of the energy and resources of the
                    citizens, that in a little more than two years after the catastrophe, the whole
                    “burnt district,” with widened and improved thoroughfares, was covered with
                    solid, substantial, and palatial edifices combining all the safeguards,
                    improvements, and conveniences of modern skill. At least as large an amount has
                    been expended on this restoration as was lost in the ruin. The fire department
                    has been made more efficient under the control of three commissioners. There are
                    now in the city twenty-nine steam fire-engine3 and a fire-boat in the harbour,
                    eleven hook and ladder companies, sixteen horse-hose companies, a protective
                    department, an insurance brigade, with waggons, &amp;c., an alarm telegraph, and
                    a system of signal boxes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water Supply.—</hi> Though the first white settlers were drawn
                    to Boston by its pure and abundant springs, the want of water resources was long
                    felt till efficient measures were taken for a supply. The southern portion of
                    the town was supplied at the beginning of this century by an aqueduct from
                    Jamaica Pond in Roxbury. The works already constructed and still in progress
                    fully meet the present and prospective demands. The waters from Cochituate Lake
                    and its tributaries, from twenty to thirty miles from the city, flowed into it
                    by gravitation, October 25, 1848. The storage reservoirs and the works have cost
                    up to May 1875, $10,786,739. The length of the conduit of brick is 14⅜ miles,
                    and of supply pipes of iron 262⅜ miles. The annexation of Charlestown brought
                    with it the waters of Mystic Lake, the works for which had cost $1,147,902, with
                    1∣ miles of brick conduit, and 127 miles of pipe, pumping engines, and
                    reservoir.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">public schools</hi> of the city are organized and
                    supervised under the statutes of the State which make provision for free
                    education by some compulsory enactments, subject to such special regulations as
                    may be enjoined by the Legislature. The Legislature of 1875, by an Act (chapter
                    241), introduced a change in the composition and functions of the school
                    committee. Henceforward this board is to consist of twenty-four members, chosen
                    by the citizens on general ticket, to be disposed in three sections of eight
                    members each. After the close of the first year from the first election, eight
                    members are to retire, and eight new members are to be elected, to serve for
                    three years, all without compensation. The board is to elect and fix the
                    compensation of a secretary, an auditing clerk, and other necessary subordinate
                    officers, and also of a superintendent of schools, and a board of not more than
                    six supervisors. The mayor is to be, <hi rend="italic">ex officio,</hi> chairman
                    of the general board, to which no other member of the city government can
                    belong, and which shall have the whole management of the schools, choosing and
                    fixing the compensation of all teachers, janitors, &amp;c., but needing the
                    authority of the city council before incurring an expense exceeding $1000 for
                    the purchase of land, or the erection or alteration of a building. Boston has
                    now 9 high schools, 49 grammarschools, 416 primary schools, 25 evening schools
                    and industrial, licensed minors’, deaf-mute, and kindergarten schools,—total,
                    499. The number of teachers employed is 1289; of scholars, 53,391. Cost of
                    maintenance for the year ending May 1, 1875, $1,724,373’61. In the old city
                    there is a Latin, English high, girls’ high, and normal school; and in each of
                    the municipalities that have been annexed there is a high school, where
                    classical education is furnished.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">public buildings</hi> of Boston are very numerous,
                    embracing those of the United States Government, the State, the county, and the
                    city. Most of them have been built within a few years, and are substantial and
                    commodious, but. owing to the constant expansion and growth of the city, each of
                    them in turn becomes contracted, and needs enlargement or a substitute. The
                    buildings connected with each of the railroad stations have been reconstructed
                    for extension three or four times. The largest group of edifices and works is
                    that of the United States navy-yard, with docks, manufactories, foundries,
                    machine shops, ordnance stores, rope-walks, furnaces, casting pits, timber
                    sheds, ordnance parks, ship-houses, &amp;c. The half of a very elaborate and
                    costly edifice, the corner-stone of which was laid by President Grant, is now
                    (1875) completed and in use for the United States post-office and sub-treasury.
                    The other half, now in progress, will accommodate the United States courts.
                    There is also a custom-house, with bonded warehouses, and the United States
                    court-house.</p>

                <p>The State House, for the business of the Legislature of the commonwealth, was
                    built in 1798, and has been recently greatly extended. It stands on the highest
                    land in the city,—what remains of the old Trimountaine summits,—and has a gilded
                    dome, fountains, and statues on its lawn, with statues, busts, paintings, and
                    trophies within. The edifice looks nobly down upon the “Common,” so dear to the
                    citizens of Boston. This park came with the original purchase from Mr Blaxton,
                    and encloses 48 acres, with malls all round it, a pond, a fountain, a soldiers’
                    monument, a deer park, and about 1300 trees. An Act of the Legislature of 1875
                    protects it from being encroached upon in any way by the municipal authorities
                    without a vote of the majority of the citizens, To the State also belong a
                    court-house and some of the newly reclaimed territory on the South Bay. To the
                    county of Suffolk belong a jail, and court-houses, municipal and probate. The
                    State prison is in Charlestown district.</p>
                <p>To the city, besides the school-houses,—which bear the names of honoured citizens
                    for many generations, and of ex-mayors,—belong a large number of structures and
                    appliances :—the Old State House, so called, built for the British authorities
                    in 1712,—the oldest public building now standing in the city, Christ Church,
                    dedicated in 1723, coming next to it; Faneuil Hall, famous for its patriotic
                    oratory, originally the gift of Peter Faneuil in 1743, used for “town meetings,”
                    and enlarged in 1806; extensive market-houses; the City Hall; the Public
                    Library; bathhouses; engine-houses and armories; the Public Garden on the new
                    territory, highly ornamented, enclosing more than 24 acres, with a pond; city
                    stables, &lt;⅛c.</p>
                <p>Statues in public places :—in bronze, a fine equestrian statue of Washington, and
                    those of Dr Franklin,—born in Boston, January 17, 1706,—of Daniel Webster,
                    Horace Mann, and Edward Everett; of marble or granite, Washington, Alexander
                    Hamilton, Governor Andrew, Columbus, Aristides, soldiers in the war of
                    secession, and the monument commemorating the introduction of the use of ether
                    as an anaesthetic, first applied in the Massachusetts General Hospital,
                    Boston.</p>
                <p>Boston is fringed with substantial wharves on all its water margins, for the most
                    part covered with massive warehouses. Horse railroads, or tramways, make easy
                    connections within its own limits, and with the suburbs. Steam roads open
                    communication with the whole continent, in every landward direction. Successive
                    experiments have been tried with the various materials and methods for paving
                    the streets, and constructing side-walks. ' The streets of the town were first
                    named in 1708. The first map of the town, that of Bonner, was made in 1722.
                    Overseers of the poor were first chosen in 1691. The superintendent of lamps has
                    charge of 7664 gas, and 976 fluid, burners. The cost of gas to the city, for
                    1874, was $275,064*35. There are seventeen police-statiou houses and lock-ups;
                    the expense of that department was $683,89278; of the health department,
                    $446,877*08; of the fire department, $671,511*13; of the City Hospital,
                    $111,198*31; of penal and pauper institutions, $405,003*40. The cost of street
                    widenings and extensions from 1822 to 1874 was $21,739,983*13; and in 1873-74,
                    $6,403,413*76, reduced by “betterments,” $283,697*50; tax assessed in 1874,
                    $9,022,187*17 The revenue of the city was $23,633,874*06. Tnerehad been in the
                    town and original city eleven burial-places. Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge,
                    five miles distant, enclosing 125 acres, was put to use in 1831. There have been
                    more than 19,000 interments in it. Five other suburban cemeteries are now
                    provided, and interments in the city are prohibited.</p>
                <p>The Public Library, as an institution of the city, was fostered by an enterprise
                    initiated · by Μ. Vattemare, in securing a gift of books from the city of Paris,
                    in 1843. Acts of the Legislature, renewed and extended from 1848 to 1857, aided
                    by the efforts of individual citizens and meetings of committees, with free and
                    conditional gifts of money and of books, kept the object steadily in view. In
                    1852 Mr Joshua Bates, born in Massachusetts, then of the firm of the Messrs
                    Baring, of London, made a gift to the city for the purpose of a library, of
                    $50,000, subsequently adding various donations of books. The main hall of the
                    library building bears his name, in commemoration of his munificence. The
                    present spacious and solid structure, which, however, already needs a second
                    enlargement, was inaugurated for its uses, on January 1, 1858, with an address
                    by Edward Everett. It cost, with the land, $365,000. Large donations of money
                    and of private libraries have since accrued from living benefactors, and by
                    bequests. The names of Ex-Mayor Bigelow, of Abbot Lawrence, and Jonathan
                    Phillips deserve mention for their pecuniary gifts; while the libraries of
                    Theodore Parker, Edward Everett, and George Ticknor have furnished most valuable
                    acquisitions. Here is deposited the Prince Library, belonging to the Old South
                    Religious Society. The unique and rich collection, known as the Barton Library,
                    of 12,000 volumes, including the magnificent Shakspearian treasures, was
                    obtained in 1873. The edifice has been once enlarged, with efforts to render it
                    fireproof, and additional ground has been purchased at a cost of $70,000. The
                    expense of its maintenance and care, in 1874, was $135,000. There are employed
                    in it 103 persons. The number of volumes is about 280,000, besides pamphlets,
                    MSS., and valuable collections of engravings, including the Tosti, so called.
                    Branch libraries are established for the convenience of the citizens, in South
                    and East Boston, Dorchester, Roxbury, Brighton, and Charlestown; and a system of
                    other local deliveries has been initiated.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">churches</hi> and places of worship in Boston, there are 163
                    for Protestants, 26 for Roman Catholics, and 3 Jewish synagogues. The Roman
                    Catholics have a cathedral which will seat more than 4000. The Unitarians have
                    the largest number of Protestant churches. There are 112 public halls, which
                    serve very miscellaneous uses of worship, debate, lecturing, society meetings,
                    and amusement.</p>
                <p>Literary, learned, scientific, benevolent, and secret societies, represented by
                    their own edifices, halls, libraries, and collections, are very numerous, and
                    well sustained. Among these may be mentioned the American Academy of Arts and
                    Sciences; the Massachusetts Historical Society; the Boston Athenaeum, with a
                    very extensive library, paintings, and statuary; the New England Historic
                    Genealogical Society; the Masonic Temple; the Odd Fellows’Hall; the
                    Mechanics’Association; the Mercantile Library Association; the Massachusetts

                    General Theological Library; the Art Museum, &amp;c. There are four theatres in
                    the city,—the Boston, the Globe, the Howard, and the Museum.</p>
                <p>Hospitals, asylums, and refuges, chiefly founded and sustained by private
                    benevolence, and generously administered, provide, for the most part
                    gratuitously, for the various ills and maladies of humanity. Of these, besides
                    the City Hospital, may be mentioned the Massachusetts General Hospital, with its

                <p>Ninety years after the settlement of the town of Boston, Daniel Neal, of London,
                    wrote a description of it, returning from his visit. In this he says: “The
                    conversation in this town is as polite as in most of the cities and towns iu
                    England, many of their merchants having travelled into Europe, and those that
                    stay at home having the advantage of a free conversation with travellers; so
                    that a gentleman from London would almost think himself at home at Boston, when
                    he observes the numbers of people, their houses, their furniture, their tables,
                    their dress, and conversation, which perhaps is as splendid and showy as that of
                    the most considerable tradesmen in London.” Though in the succession of visitors
                    from abroad, particularly from England, who have followed Mr Neal, there have
                    been a few who have found matter for satire and depreciatory criticism in their
                    accounts of Boston, of its citizens, their habits, &amp;c., the great majority
                    of its foreign guests, especially if their own manners and errands have ι
                    ecommended them, have written in a similar strain. They have found there much to
                    learn and enjoy, and to remember with pleasure. Cultivated Englishmen,
                    particularly those who have visited Boston in recent years to obtain or to
                    impart information, have found themselves at home there. The supposed conceit of
                    its citizens over their own distinctive qualities or advantages has led to some
                    pleasant banter from at home and abroad in characterizing the city as the
                    “Athens of America” or “The Hub of the Universe.”</p>
                <p>The development, growth, and increased population of the city, under the liberal
                    social influences, and the changes of opinion and habit, which in no part of the
                    world are more marked and active than here, have, of course, wholly displaced
                    the original homogeneousness of its people, and the peculiarly Puritan character
                    of the tone and customs of life. Its large foreign population make, in
                    traditions, habits, social relations, and religion, a nation within a nation.
                    The unfamiliar names which appear on the signs of shops and dwellings, the
                    relaxed usages as regards the observance of Sunday, and the indulgence in
                    amusements, large personal freedom, &amp;c., have made Boston, substantially, a
                    cosmopolitan city. Those now living remember when a person who ventured to smoke
                    a cigar or a pipe in the street would have fallen into the hands of a constable.
                    When the traffic in the streets is annually obstructed by an elaborate
                    procession, mounted and on foot, on “St Patrick’s Day,” and when a cardinal,
                    with other officials from the court of Rome, comes hither to consecrate an
                    archbishop in a cathedral, it is difficult to recall the virgin promontory and
                    the English exiles with which this notice began. (α. <hi rend="smallcaps">e. e.
