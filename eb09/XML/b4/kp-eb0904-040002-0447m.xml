                    at Nola about the year 1548. Little is known of the life of this knight-errant
                    of philosophy; the very date of his birth rests in obscurity. What we do know is
                    attractive enough to render it matter of regret that the materials should be so
                    scanty. In his fifteenth year he entered the order of the Dominicans at Naples,
                    and is said to have composed a treatise on the ark of Noah. Why he should have
                    submitted to the bonds of a discipline palpably unsuited to his fiery and
                    vehement spirit, we cannot tell. He soon found the restraints intolerable, and
                    became an outcast from his church and a wanderer on the face of the earth. His
                    opinions with regard to some of the Romish mysteries seem to have been too
                    liberal to find toleration with so strict an order as that of St Dominic. He was
                    accused of impiety, and after enduring persecution for some years, he fled from
                    Rome about 1576, and wandered through various cities, reaching Geneva in 1577.
                    The home of Calvinism was no resting-place for him, and he travelled on through
                    Lyons, Toulouse, and Montpellier, arriving at Paris in 1579. Everywhere he bent
                    his irrepressible energies to the exposition of the new thoughts which were
                    beginning to effect a revolution in the thinking world. He had drunk deeply of
                    the very spirit of the Renaissance, the determination to open his eyes and see
                    for himself this noble universe, unclouded by the mists of authoritative
                    philosophy and church tradition. The discoveries of Copernicus, which were
                    unhinging men’s minds and teaching them to look upon their little world in a new
                    light, were eagerly accepted by him, and he used them as the lever by which to
                    push aside the antiquated system that had come down from Aristotle, and which
                    was loaded with the weight of that great thinker’s name. For Aristotle, indeed,
                    he had a perfect hatred. Like Bacon and Telesius he infinitely preferred the
                    older Greek philosophers, who had looked at nature for themselves, and whose
                    speculations had more of reality in them. He had read widely and deeply, and in
                    his own writings we come across many expressions familiar to us in earlier
                    systems. Y et his philosophy is no eclecticism. He owed something to Lucretius,
                    something to the Stoic nature-pantheism, something to Anaxagoras, to Heraclitus,
                    to the Pythagoreans, and to the Neoplatonists, who were partially known to him;
                    above all, he had studied deeply and profoundly the great German thinker Nicolas
                    of Cusa, who was indeed a speculative Copernicus. But his own system has a
                    distinct unity and originality; it breathes throughout the fiery spirit of Bruno
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Bruno had been well received at Toulouse, where he had lectured on astronomy;
                    even better fortune awaited him at Paris. He was offered a chair of philosophy,
                    provided he would receive the Mass. He at once refused, but was permitted to
                    deliver lectures. These seem to have been altogether devoted to expositions of a
                    certain logical system which Bruno had taken up with great eagerness, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi rend="italic">Magna</hi> of Raymond Lully. With the
                    exception of a comedy, <hi rend="italic">Il Candelajo,</hi> all the works of
                    this period are devoted to this logic. The most important of them is the
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Umbris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Idearum.</hi> It has seemed to many a curious freak of Bruno’s that he should
                    have so eagerly adopted a view of thought like that of Lully, but in reality it
                    is in strict accordance with the principles of his philosophy. Like the Arabian
                    logicians, and some of the scholastics, who held that ideas existed in a
                    threefold form,— <hi rend="italic">ante res, in rebus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">post res,—</hi> he laid down the principle that the archetypal
                    ideas existed metaphysically in the ultimate unity or intelligence, physically
                    in the world of things, and logically in signs, symbols, or notions. These
                    notions were the shadows of the ideas, and the <hi rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Magna</hi> furnished him with a general scheme, according to which
                    their relations and correspondences should be exhibited. It supplied not only a
                    <hi rend="italic">memoria</hi><hi rend="italic">technica,</hi> but an <hi
                    rend="italic">organon,</hi> or method by which the genesis of all ideas from
                    unity might be represented intelligibly and easily. It provided also a
                    substitute for either the Aristotelian or the Ramist logic, which was an
                    additional element in its favour.</p>
                <p>In the train and under the protection of the French ambassador, Michel de
                    Castelnau, Bruno passed over in 1583 to England, where he resided for about two
                    years. He was much disgusted with the brutality of the English manners, which he
                    paints in no flattering colours, and he found in Oxford pedantry and
                    superstition as rampant as at Geneva. But he indulges in extravagant eulogies of
                    Elizabeth, and he formed the acquaintance at London of Sir Philip Sidney, Fulke
                    Greville, and other eminent Englishmen. At Oxford he was allowed to hold a
                    disputation with some learned doctors on the rival merits of the Copernican and
                    so-called Aristotelian systems of the universe, and, according to his own
                    report, had an easy victory. The best of his works were written in the freedom
                    of English social life. The <hi rend="italic">Cena</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    le</hi><hi rend="italic">Ceneri,</hi> or Ash Wednesday conversation, devoted to
                    an exposition of the Copernican theory, was printed in 1584. In the same year
                    appeared his two great metaphysical works, <hi rend="italic">De la
                    Causa,</hi><hi rend="italic">Principio,</hi><hi rend="italic">ed Uno,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">De Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Infinito, Universo,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e Mondi</hi><hi rend="italic">μ</hi> in the year following the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eroici</hi><hi rend="italic">Furori</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cabala del Cavallo</hi><hi rend="italic">Pegaseo.</hi> In 1584 also appeared
                    the strange dialogue, <hi rend="italic">Spaccio della</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Bestia</hi><hi rend="italic">Trionfante,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Expulsion of
                    the Triumphant Beast,</hi> an allegory treating chiefly of moral philosophy, but
                    giving at the same time the very essence and spirit of Bruno’s philosophy. The
                    gods are represented as resolving to banish from the heavens the constellations,
                    which served to remind them of their evil deeds. In their places are put the
                    moral virtues. The first of the three dialogues contains the substance of the
                    allegory, which, under the disguise of an assault on heathen mythology, is a
                    direct attack on all forms of anthropomorphic religion. But in a philosophical
                    point of view the first part of the second dialogue is the most important. Among
                    the moral virtues which take the place of the beasts are Truth, Prudence,
                    Wisdom, Law, and Universal Judgment, and in the explanation of what these mean
                    Bruno unfolds the very inner essence of his system. Truth is the unity and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n448/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0448-0401"/> substance which underlies all things; Prudence or
                    providence is the regulating power of truth, and comprehends both liberty and
                    necessity; Wisdom is providence itself in its supersensible aspect.—in man it is
                    reason which grasps the truth of things; Law results from wisdom, for no good
                    law is irrational, and its sole end and aim is the good of mankind; Universal
                    Judgment is the principle whereby men are judged according to their deeds, and
                    not according to their belief in this or that catechism. Mingled with his
                    allegorical philosophy are the most vehement attacks upon the established
                    religion. The monks are stigmatized as pedants who would destroy the joy of life
                    on earth, who are avaricious, dissolute, and the breeders of eternal dissensions
                    and squabbles. The mysteries of faith are scoffed at. The Jewish records are put
                    on a level with the Greek myths, and miracles are laughed at as magical tricks.
                    Through all this runs the train of thought resulting naturally from Bruno’s
                    fundamental principles, and familiar in modern philosophy as Spinozism, the
                    denial of particular providence, the doctrine of the uselessness of prayer, the
                    identification in a sense of liberty and necessity, and the peculiar definition
                    of good and evil. Altogether the <hi rend="italic">Spaccio,</hi> as it is the
                    most popular, is the most characteristic of Bruno’s works.</p>
                <p>In 1586 he returned to Paris with Castelnau, but was soon driven from his refuge,
                    and we next find him at Marburg and Wittenberg, the headquarters of Lutheranism.
                    There is a tradition that here or in England he embraced the Protestant faith;
                    nothing in his writings would lead one to suppose so. Several works, chiefly
                    logical, appeared during his stay at Wittenberg. In 1588 he went to Prague, then
                    to Helmstadt. In 1591 he was at Frankfort, and published three important
                    metaphysical works, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Triplici Minimo
                    et Mensura</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">De Monade,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Numero,</hi><hi rend="italic">et Figura; De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Immenso</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Innumerabilibus.</hi> He
                    did not stay long at Prague, and we find him next at Zurich, whence he accepted
                    an invitation to Venice. It was a rash step. The emissaries of the Inquisition
                    were on his track; he was thrown into prison, and in 1593 was brought to Rome.
                    Seven years were spent in confinement. On the 9th February 1600 he was
                    excommunicated, and on the 17th was burned at the stake.</p>
                <p>As has been said, for an estimation of Bruno’s philosophy, the most important
                    works are the two Italian dialogues and the three last-mentioned Latin
                    treatises. It is not an easy matter to put his opinions into small compass, for
                    the general form of exposition adopted by him, the dialogue, imposes a certain
                    looseness on his own mode of thinking.</p>
                <p>To Bruno as to all other great thinkers, the end of philosophy is the search for
                    unity. Amid all the varying and contradictory phenomena of the universe there is
                    something which givee coherence and intelligibility to them. Nor can this unity
                    be something apart from the things; it must contain in itself the universe,
                    which develops from it; it must be at once all and one. This unity is God, the
                    universal substance,—the one and only principle, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >causa</hi><hi rend="italic">immanens,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> that which
                    is in things and yet is distinct from them as the universal is distinct from the
                    particular. He is the efficient and final cause of all, the beginning, middle,
                    and end, eternal and infinite. By his action the world is produced, and his
                    action is the law of his nature, his necessity is true freedom. He is living,
                    active intelligence, the principle of motion and creation, realizing himself in
                    the infinitely various forms of activity that constitute individual things. To
                    the infinitely actual there is necessary the possible; that which determines
                    involves somewhat in which its determinations can have existence. This other of
                    God, which is in truth one with him, is matter. The universe, then, is a living
                    cosmos, an infinitely animated system, whose end is the perfect realization of
                    the variously graduated forms.</p>
                <p>The unity which sunders itself into the multiplicity of things may be called the
                    <hi rend="italic">monas monadum,</hi> each thing being a <hi rend="italic"
                    >monos</hi> or self-existent, living being, a universe in itself. Of these
                    monads the number is infinite. The soul of man is a thinking monad, and stands
                    mid-way between the divine intelligence and the world of external things. As a
                    portion of the divine life, the soul is immortal. Its highest function is the
                    contemplation of the divine unity, discoverable under the manifold of
                    objects.</p>
                <p>Such is a brief summary of the principal positions of Bruno’s philosophy. It
                    seems quite clear that in the earlier works, particularly the two Italian
                    dialogues, he approached more nearly to the pantheistic view of things than in
                    his later Latin treatises. The unity expounded at first is simply an <hi
                    rend="italic">anima</hi><hi rend="italic">mundi,</hi> a living universe, but not
                    intelligent. There is a distinct development traceable towards the later and
                    final form of his doctrine, in which the universe appears as the realization of
                    the divine mind.</p>
                <p>The Italian works of Bruno, formerly exceedingly rare, have been collected and
                    published in two volumes, by A. Wagner, 1830. An edition of the Latin works was
                    begun by Gfrörer in 1834, but has not been completed. The most complete
                    monograph on him is that by C. Bartholmess, 2 vols. 1846-47; the most recent
                    life is that by Domenico Berti, 1868. The best systematic account of his
                    philosophy is that by Carriere, <hi rend="italic">Philosophische</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Weltanschauung</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lleformationszeit,</hi> 1847, pp. 411-494. The relations between his philosophy
                    and that of Cusanus are treated in Clemens, <hi rend="italic">G. Bruno</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Nicolaus von C</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">usa,</hi> 1847. An English translation by
                    Morehead (not, as is generally supposed, by Toland) of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spaccio</hi> is dated 1713. It was probably printed before that time, and it is
                    now excessively rare. Toland translated the preface to <hi rend="italic">De
                    Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Infinito</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it is found in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Posthumous Works.</hi> There is a French translation of part
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Spaccio,</hi><hi rend="italic">Le Ciel Reformé,</hi>
                    1750. Lasson has translated <hi rend="italic">De la Caτιsa</hi> into German,
                    1872, with introduction and notes.</p>
                <p>The earlier literature with regard to Bruno is copious; it will be found in
                    Bayle, Buhle, and Tennemann. (R. AD.)</p>
