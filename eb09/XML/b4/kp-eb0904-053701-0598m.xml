                    practice of burying in churches or churchyards is said to have been connected
                    with the custom of praying for the dead, and it would appear that the earlier

                    spaces of ground adjoining the churches were carefully enclosed and solemnly
                    consecrated and appropriated to the burial of those who had been entitled to
                    attend divine service in those churches, and who now became entitled to render
                    back into those places their remnants to earth, the common mother of mankind,
                    without payment for the ground which they were to occupy, or for the pious
                    offices which solemnized the act of interment” (Lord, Stowell). The right to
                    burial in the parish churchyard is far from being merely an ecclesiastical
                    privilege, but at the same time it is intimately bound up with the laws of the
                    Church Establishment. It is a common law right, controlled in many points by the
                    provisions of the law ecclesiastical. This double character is sufficient to
                    explain the controversy which has so long raged round the subject of burials in
                    England. Every man, according to the common law, has a right to be buried in his
                    own churchyard, or, as it is sometimes put, in the churchyard of the parish
                    where he dies. But the churchyard, as well as the church itself, is the freehold
                    of the parson, who can in many respects deal with it as if it were a private
                    estate. A statute of Edward I. (35, st. 2) speaks of the churchyard as the soil
                    of the church, and the trees growing in the churchyard “as amongst the goods of
                    the church, the which laymen have no authority to dispose,” and prohibits “the
                    parsons from cutting down such trees unless required for repairs.”
                    Notwithstanding the consecration of the church and churchyard, and the fact that
                    they are the parson’s freehold, a right of way may be claimed through them by
                    prescription. The right to burial may be subject to the payment of a fee to the
                    incumbent, if such has been the immemorial custom of the parish, but not
                    otherwise. The spirit of the ancient canons regarded such burial fees as of a
                    simoniacal complexion, inasmuch as the consecrated grounds were among the <hi
                    rend="italic">res</hi><hi rend="italic">sacrae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a
                    feeling which Lord Stowell says disappeared after the Reformation. No person can
                    be buried in a church without the consent of the incumbent, except when the
                    owner of a manor house prescribes for a burying-place within the church as
                    belonging to the manor house. In the case of Rex <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Taylor it was held that an information was grantable against a parson for
                    opposing the burial of a parishioner; but the court would not interpose as to
                    the parson’s refusal to read the burial service because he never was
                    baptized—that being matter for the ecclesiastical court. Strangers (or persons
                    not dying in the parish) should not be buried, it appears, without the consent
                    of the parishioners or churchwardens, “whose parochial right of burial is
                    invaded thereby.” According to a recent case, a clergyman may be punished for
                    refusing to read the burial service over a person who had ceased to be a
                    parishioner, but was buried in a family vault. While burial is a common-law
                    right, the mode of burial is said to be of ecclesiastical cognizance, and a
                    mandamus to inter a body in an iron coffin was in one case refused. Lord Stowell
                    permitted the use of iron coffins on condition of an increased rate of payment
                    to the parish, observing that the common cemetery is not <hi rend="italic"
                    >res</hi><hi rend="italic">unius aetatis,</hi> the property of one generation
                    now departed, but of the living and of generations yet unborn, and is subject
                    only to temporary appropriation (Gilbert <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Buzzard, 2
                    Consistory Reports, 333). One of the canons of 1603 requires the clergyman under
                    penalty of suspension for three months to bury the corpse without refusal or
                    delay, “unless the party deceased were excommunicated <hi rend="italic">majori
                    excommunicatione,</hi> for some grievous and notorious crime, and no man able to
                    testify of his repentance.” It appears that persons dying in a state of
                    intoxication must be buried with the funeral service of the church. On the other
                    hand no service but that of the Church of England may be used, and no layman or
                    unauthorized person can read or assist in reading a burial service over a dead
                    body in consecrated ground. Nor, it seems, does the church recognize “such an
                    indecency” as burial without service. There are probably many questions as to
                    the common right of burial to which the law has as yet provided no specific
                    answer. In the meantime many attempts have been made to pass a Burials Bill, the
                    main feature of which is the permission to use in churchyards religious services
                    other than that of the Church of England.</p>
                <p>The necessity for providing new cemeteries, caused by the natural increase of
                    population, has led to a good deal of legislation, and an Act was passed (10 and
                    11 Vict. c. 65) to consolidate certain provisions usually contained in Acts
                    authorizing the making of cemeteries. Sec. 23 allows the bishop to consecrate a
                    part of any such cemetery “for the burial of the dead according to the rites of
                    the Established Church.” The 15 and 16 Vict. c. 85, for discontinuing burials in
                    the metropolis and opening new burial grounds, was extended to other towns by
                    the 16 and 17 Vict. c. 134. The new burial ground is to be divided into
                    consecrated and unconsecrated portions; and provision is made for building a
                    cemetery chapel for the use of the church, and, if necessary, another for
                    dissenters. By 20 and 21 Vict. c. 81, ground may be consecrated for the burial
                    of poor persons. The same Act allows a burial board to appeal to the archbishop
                    when the ordinary refuses to consecrate a new burial ground, and if after the
                    archbishop confirms the appeal the bishop still refuses to consecrate, the
                    archbishop may licence the grave for interments as if it were consecrated. The
                    30 and 31 Viet, c. 133 (amended in the following year) provided facilities for
                    cheapening the expense of consecration and for allowing limited owners to convey
                    sites of land for churchyards.</p>
                <p>The practice of burying suicides on a public highway, with a stake driven through
                    the body, is prohibited by 4 Geo. IV. c. 52, which requires the coroner to
                    direct their private interment, without religious rites, in the churchyard,
                    within twenty-four hours after the inquest, and between the hours of nine and
                    twelve at night. Bodies may not be removed from burial grounds without licence
                    from a Secretary of State, except when the removal is from one unconsecrated
                    place to another, and is authorized by the ordinary. A coroner may disinter the
                    body in a case of violent death.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the obligation of providing and maintaining the churchyard rests on
                    the heritors of the parish. The guardianship of the churchyard belongs to the
                    heritors and also to the kirk-session, either by delegation from the heritors,
                    or in right of its ecclesiastical character. The right of burial appears to be
                    strictly limited to parishioners, although an opinion has been expressed that
                    any person dying in the parish has a right to be buried in the churchyard. The
                    parishioners have no power of management. The presbytery may interfere to compel
                    the heritors to provide due accommodation, but has no further jurisdiction. It
                    is the duty of the heritors to allocate the churchyard. The Scotch law hesitates
                    to attach the ordinary incidents of real property to the churchyard, while
                    English law treats the ground as the parson’s freehold. It would bo difficult to
                    sav who in Scotland is the legal owner of thç <pb break="no"

                    beneath. The difficulty as to religious services does not exist. On the other
                    hand, the religious character of the ground is hostile to many of the legal
                    rights recognized by the English Law.</p>
