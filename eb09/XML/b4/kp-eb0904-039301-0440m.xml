                    African traveller, was born at Kinnaird House, Stirlingshire, on the 14th
                    December 1730. He was educated at Harrow, and at first turned his attention to
                    the bar. After his marriage, however, he entered into business as a
                    wine-merchant, but soon gave up any active share in the concern. His wife had
                    died within a year of their marriage, and Bruce, after acquiring a knowledge of
                    the Spanish and Portuguese languages, travelled on the Continent for some time,
                    returning to England in 1758. He then made a proposal to the English Government
                    that they should make a descent upon Spain at Ferrol, assuring them from his own
                    observation that the coast was without defence at that place. His suggestions
                    were not adopted; but Lord Halifax, to whom he had been introduced, and who had
                    consulted him about the exploration of the Nile, appointed him soon afterwards
                    to the consulship at Algiers. He arrived at that place in March 1762, and after
                    spending a year in the study of Arabic and other Oriental languages, set out
                    through Tunis, Tripoli, and the North of Africa. He then visited Rhodes and
                    Cyprus, and explored great part of Syria and Palestine, making very careful
                    drawings of Palmyra and Baalbec. These drawings were afterwards presented to the
                    king and placed in the royal library at Kew. It was not till June 1768 that
                    Bruce arrived at Alexandria, and prepared to start on his great exploring
                    expedition. From Cairo he sailed up the river as far as Syene; he then struck
                    across the desert to Kosseir, and reached Jidda in May 1769. He remained for
                    some time in Arabia, set sail from Loheia on the 3d September, and on the 19th
                    arrived at Massowah. There he was detained for some time; but at last, on the
                    15th February 1770, he made his way to Gondar, the capital of Abyssinia. He
                    gained great favour with the Abyssinian king, and remained with him till
                    October, when he set off up the Bahr-el-Azrek, which he looked upon as the main
                    branch of the Nile. On the 14th November he reached the sources of the
                    Bahr-el-Azrek, and proudly imagined himself to have solved the great
                    geographical problem. Slowly and with great difficulty he made his way back
                    through the deserts of Nubia. On the 29th November 1772 .he reached Assouan on
                    the Nile. Thence he returned into the heart of the desert to recover his
                    baggage, which had been abandoned in consequence of the death of all his camels.
                    In January 1773 he arrived at Cairo. On his way home to England he spent some
                    time at Paris, where he was warmly received by Buffon and other eminent men of
                    science. The celebrated <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> did not appear till 1790,
                    when they were published in five large quarto volumes, profusely illustrated.
                    The work was received with favour on account of its freshness and interest, but
                    with almost universal incredulity. The <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> were
                    looked upon as veritable travellers’ tales, not entitled to any respect as
                    authentic narrative. Succeeding investigations, however, have thoroughly
                    dispelled these suspicions, and reinstated the book in popular estimation. Bruce
                    died in 1794, in consequence of a fall down the staircase of. his own house. A
                    second edition of his work, on which he was engaged at the time of his death,
                    was published in 1804.</p>
