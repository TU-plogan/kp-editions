                    domesticated <hi rend="italic">animals</hi> only, but since the phenomena
                    presented under cultivation by all classes of organisms are entirely similar in
                    character, and since, moreover, much of our knowledge on the subject has been
                    gained from botany and horticulture, we shall include, under the one term
                    breeds, the varieties of domestic animals and of cultivated plants. The natural
                    and simple definition of breeding would be the art by which breeds are produced.
                    But here the objection arises, that in this definition too much is assumed. It
                    may be argued that our domesticated animals and plants are each <pb break="no"

                    extinct, and that man has merely deprived them of liberty and regulated their
                    environment and propagation in the manner most advantageous to each kind. At the
                    present day, when the whole range of biological thought is so largely permeated
                    by the principles of the doctrine of evolution, this objection will probably not
                    be advanced. Yet, when it is remembered that such an authority as Col. Hamilton
                    Smith held the belief that each breed of dog had its wild prototype, it appears
                    necessary to modify the definition above given. Let it be said that the art of
                    breeding consists in changing the conditions of life and regulating the
                    reproduction of animals and plants.</p>
                <p>Since a breed is a domestic variety, it implies the existence of a group of
                    individuals marked off from their congeners by the possession of certain
                    characters which are transmitted to their offspring. It is this <hi
                    rend="italic">transmission</hi> of peculiarities which is the essential
                    characteristic of a breed; for any collection of domesticated organisms could be
                    divided into groups of individuals distinguished by certain points, but such
                    groups would not necessarily form breeds. It is evident, then, that the law of
                    heredity which asserts that“like begets like” must hold good, or the existence
                    of breeds will be an impossibility. Again, if it were absolutely true that like
                    begets like, that is, if the offspring were in all cases identical with the
                    pareut, it is evident that neither by man’s interference, nor by the operation
                    of nature, could a breed or race arise. It seems, then, that were it not in the
                    nature of all organic beings to reproduce their kind in the manner formulated in
                    tile principle of heredity, and were it not for the continuous slight
                    infringement of it expressed by the principle of variability, breeds could not
                    have arisen. It is therefore necessary to examine these two principles as part
                    of the subject under consideration.</p>
                <p>Whatever views we may entertain respecting the origin of our domestic animals and
                    plants, there can be no doubt as to the matter of fact that breeders have always
                    proceeded on one principle,— <hi rend="italic">select the best individuals in
                    each generation and pair them.</hi> Now we have found that the qualities of
                    organic beings (forming in a certain sense the material on which the breeder has
                    to work) can be generalized under two principles—heredity and variability. And
                    in the same way the art of breeding is itself capable of a kind of
                    generalization under the principle of selection. There are thus three great
                    principles or laws—heredity, variability, and selection,—the last relating to
                    the art of man, the other two to those qualities of organic beings which render
                    the art practicable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Heredity.—</hi> The simplest form of heredity is found amongst
                    those organisms which reproduce their kind by division into two parts similar to
                    each other. This process is illustrated by the fission of a Moneron. The next
                    advance in complexity of reproduction occurs when the two portions into which
                    the organism divides are dissimilar to one another; here the process by which
                    both portions ultimately assume the form of the parent is not one of simple
                    nutrition, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of formation of tissue like that already
                    formed. The process by which man propagates some of his cultivated plants is one
                    of artificial reproduction by fission. For instance, a cutting or part of a
                    shoot, or even a leaf (as with Begonia), if placed in suitable soil, will
                    reproduce the original plant in all its minute details. We are here face to face
                    with the mystery of reproduction; for we have the ever wonderful fact that in a
                    few cells lies dormant the vital impetus which enables them to produce from
                    inorganic pabulum a most complicated structure, which in its totality is utterly
                    unlike themselves. And this example shows us, moreover, how essentially the same
                    are sexual and asexual reproduction; for there is no intrinsic difference
                    between reproduction from a small part artificially separated from a simple
                    foliar organ (a leaf) and the same sequence of growth originating in a small
                    portion naturally segregated from a transformed foliar organ (the ovary). The
                    conditions of growth are not the same in the two cases, and there all essential
                    difference ends; for the broad distinction which the congress of two individuals
                    in one case appears to make is swept away by the facts of Parthenogenesis. In
                    the lowest of living things we have seen that growth and reproduction are almost
                    identical aspects of life. And this connection is not less close among higher
                    organisms; as Mr Herbert Spencer observes,—“When in place of its lost claw a
                    lobster puts forth from the same spot a cellular mass, which, while increasing
                    in bulk, assumes the form and structure of the original claw, we can have no
                    hesitation in ascribing this result to a play of forces like that which moulds
                    the materials contained in a piece of Begonia leaf into the shape of a young
                    Begonia. In the one case as in the other the vitalized molecules composing the
                    tissues show their proclivity towards a particular arrangement; and whether such
                    proclivity is exhibited in reproducing the entire form or in completing it when
                    rendered imperfect matters not.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Principles of Biology,</hi> London, 1863,
                    p. 181.</p></note> The main fact of inheritance is so obvious that it is apt to
                    be forgotten. Mr Darwin remarks,—“It is hardly possible, within a moderate
                    compass, to impress on those who have not attended to the subject the full
                    conviction of the force of inheritance, which is slowly acquired by rearing
                    animals, by studying the various treatises which have been published on the
                    various domestic animals, and by conversing with breeders.”<note anchored="true"

                    4.</p></note> Certain peculiarities have appeared only once or twice in the
                    history of the world, but have reappeared in children or grandchildren of the
                    individuals so characterized. Thus Lambert “the porcupine man,” whose skin was
                    covered with warty projections, which were periodically moulted, had all his six
                    children and two grandsons similarly affected. The mest striking cases of
                    inheritance have, as in this instance, been observed in man; but the very
                    existence of the numerous breeds of domestic animals is clear evidence of the
                    possibility of the transmission of every kind of peculiarity. For instance, it
                    is believed that· the varieties of the domestic pigeon amount to at least 150,
                    and these races differ from each other in many ways, and all breed true to their
                    kind. Some very curious peculiarities have been perpetuated. A race of cattle
                    called “Dutch buttocked” was formed in Yorkshire by selecting in each generation
                    the animals with the largest hinder-quarters. When the breed began to be
                    established it was found that the large size of the calves’ hind-quarters
                    increased the dangers of parturition to a considerable extent. This case is
                    interesting as showing that hurtful peculiarities may be inherited just as
                    readily as those which are beneficial, and as bearing witness to the
                    improbability of the view that there is an innate tendency to vary in the right
                    direction. The terrible strength of inheritance exhibited by disease is a fact
                    which is only too well established in the case of man; and in the maladies of
                    domestic animals the same law holds good. It appears that nearly all the
                    diseases to which the horse is subject are hereditary,—for instance, contracted
                    feet, curbs, splints, spavin, founder, and weakness of the fore legs, roaring or
                    broken and thick wind, melanosis, specific ophthalmia, and blindness, and even
                    such habits as crib-biting and jibbing, are all plainly hereditary. The fact
                    that any, even the most complex combinations of qualities are capable of
                    hereditary transmission, is, perhaps, more forcibly brought home by considering
                    the monetary aspect of the art of breeding, than by the fullest collection of
                    special instances. As Mr Herbert Spencer remarks :—“Excluding those inductions
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n289/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0289-0246"/> that have been so fully verified as to rank with
                    exact science, there are no inductions so trustworthy as those which have
                    undergone the mercantile test. When we have thousands of men whose profit or
                    loss depends on the truth of the inferences they draw from simple and
                    perpetually repeated observations; and when we find that the inferences arrived
                    at and handed down from generation to generation of these deeply interested
                    observers has become an unshakeable conviction, we may accept it without
                    hesitation. In breeders of animals we have such a class, led by such experiences
                    and entertaining such a conviction— the conviction that minor peculiarities are
                    inherited as well as major peculiarities. Hence the immense prices paid for
                    successful racers, bulls of superior form, sheep that have certain desired
                    peculiarities.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    only are slight and gradual changes inherited, but in some cases sudden and
                    well-marked variations are strongly transmitted. The case of the Niata cattle is
                    now well known; a similar case is recorded of a rabbit born with only one ear,
                    from which a breed was formed which steadily produced one-eared rabbits. These
                    remarkable cases of sudden and large variation being inherited are closely
                    allied to the still more curious phenomenon of the inheritance of mutilations.
                    The most striking cases on record are those of Brown-Séquard.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Bay.
                    Soc.,</hi> No. 297; <hi rend="italic">Brit. Assoc.,</hi> 1870; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lancet,</hi> Jan. 1875,</p></note> In his experiments on the inheritance of
                    artificially produced epilepsy he found that guinea pigs, after having undergone
                    section of the sciatic nerve, often nibbled off portions of their hind legs in
                    consequence of the anaesthesia of those parts. Now the offspring of these
                    self-mutilated animals were in thirteen cases born without toes. To appreciate
                    the true value of this case it must be noted that Dr Brown-Séquard has for
                    thirty years kept guinea pigs, and has had many thousands under observation, and
                    <hi rend="italic">not a single case</hi> of congenitally toeless animals has
                    occurred excepting among the offspring of mutilated parents. In spite of the
                    universal tendency towards the transmission of the form and qualities of the
                    parents to the offspring, there occur capricious and inexplicable lapses in
                    inheritance. It is not possible logically to distinguish a want of inheritance
                    from a case of variation; but when the difference between the offspring and the
                    parent consists merely in the absence in the former of a quality possessed by
                    the parent, it may be more conveniently classed as a want of inheritance than as
                    an instance of variation. Although a weeping or pendulous habit in trees is in
                    some cases strongly inherited, in other instances the want of inheritance is
                    equally well marked. Mr Rivers sowed above 20,000 seeds of the weeping ash, and
                    not a single seedling was in the least degree pendulous. Μ. Borchmeyer has also
                    observed the same fact in Germany. In all cases it must be remembered that the
                    form and qualities which the offspring of an animal or plant will assume when
                    fully developed are not solely dependent on the nature of the hereditary impetus
                    with which it starts; the initial tendency is as it were calculated so as to
                    impart under certain conditions a certain form to the organism. If the
                    conditions change, the initial tendency will not lead to the proper result; and
                    it is to be noted that the apparent amount of alteration in the conditions is no
                    measure of the amount of effect produced on the organism. For instance, none of
                    the English breeds of sheep can be kept pure in France, the lambs of even the
                    first generation lose vigour as the heat of the summer comes on, and the breed
                    becomes absolutely degenerate. It is extremely curious that the force of
                    inheritance which seems all powerful in England should give way so utterly under
                    such a slight change of circumstances.</p>
                <p>The method by which a breed was formed, combining the valuable qualities of the
                    English sheep with a constitution fitted for the French conditions of life, is
                    most instructive, and is a triumph of thoughtful and scientific breeding. The
                    successful attainment of this end is due to Μ. Malingié-Nouel. He found that the
                    offspring of a cross between a pure English ram and a French ewe inherit the
                    desirable form of the sire, but, unfortunately, also his undesirable
                    constitution. He accordingly paired a ewe taken from a border district, and
                    therefore intermediate betw een two breeds, with a similar intermediate ram. He
                    thus produced a sheep “combining the four races—Berry, Sologne, Meriuo, and
                    Touraine . . . without decided character, without fixity, . . . but possessing
                    the merit of being used to our climate and management.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Jour. Bay. Agri. Soc.,</hi>
                    xiv. 1853, p. 214, translated by Mr Pusey.</p></note> It was now found that the
                    lambs born of this mongrel ewe by purely-bred New Kent rams combined the English
                    form with the French constitution, and transmitted this desirable combination to
                    their offspring, and in this way the “Charmoise” breed was produced.</p>
                <p>In this instance it seems as if the tendencies supplied by the ewe formed so
                    discordant a combination that no strong tendency resulted for any of the French
                    forms to appear, so that the form of the English ram was strongly impressed on
                    the offspring. On the other hand, the <hi rend="italic">constitutional</hi>
                    tendencies coming from the mother’s side were not discordant, but united in
                    impressing the French constitution on the offspring. This case is instructive as
                    establishing the possibility of an important kind of acclimatization, and as
                    bearing on a somewhat exceptional phenomenon of heredity, namely, that when <hi
                    rend="italic">both</hi> parents exhibit a given character strongly, the
                    offspring do not inherit it so surely as when one, parent only is especially
                    well characterized. Thus a successful breeder of laced Sebright bantams says,—
                    “I am confident that those that are best laced frequently produce offspring very
                    far from perfect in their markings, whilst those exhibited by myself which have
                    so often proved successful were bred from the union of heavily laced birds with
                    those that were scarcely sufficiently laced.”<note anchored="true"

                    W. Tegetnιeier, 1866, p. 245.</p></note> The class of cases just noticed is,
                    moreover, of great interest as bearing on a form of inheritance which has been
                    named “prepotency of transmission.” When the ' offspring, instead of being
                    intermediate between the parents, strongly resemble one of them, the latter is
                    said to be prepotent in transmitting its likeness. The famous bull Favourite is
                    believed to have had a prepotent influence on the short-horn race. It has also
                    been observed with English race horses that certain mares have generally
                    transmitted their own character, while other mares of equally pure blood have

                <p>In other cases a remarkable weakness of transmission of character is found to

                    “trumpeters” is characterized "by a tuft of feathers over the beak, by a crest
                    on the head, and by a most peculiar coo. Mr Brent crossed a trumpeter with
                    another breed, and then recrossed the mongrels with trumpeters. But it was only
                    at the fourth generation, when the birds had J⅞ trumpeter blood in their veins,

                    only. It frequently happens that a character existing in one of the parents is
                    transmitted more powerfully to the offspring of the sex to which that parent
                    belongs than to the opposite sex. The large and important subject of secondary
                    sexual characters hinges entirely on this phenomenon. The resemblance between
                    prepotency and sexual limitation becomes clear when we remember that where the
                    offspring are of one sex it may be impossible to distinguish between these forms
                    of heredity. The most interesting point connected with secondary sexual
                    peculiarities in relation to the subject of breeds is, that they are sometimes
                    found in domesticated animals whose nearest wild congeners show no such
                    limitation of character. Thus in the sheep, the males of certain races differ
                    greatly from the females in the shape of their horns, in the development of fat
                    in the tail (in certain fat-tailed breeds), and in the outline of the forehead.
                    These differences are interesting because, so far as we know, similar secondary
                    sexual differences are not found in the nearest allied wild species of sheep. On
                    the other hand, secondary peculiarities which originally distinguished the sexes
                    are in some cases diminished or removed by domestication. Thus our improved
                    breeds of pigs have to a large extent lost the formidable tusks of the wild
                    boar. The existence of secondary sexual characters gives a striking illustration
                    of another important law of inheritance. This law asserts that the age at which
                    any character first shows itself in the offspring is the same as that at which
                    it appeared in the parent. Now, secondary sexual characters— those, for
                    instance, presented by the male sex—have apparently been developed by sexual
                    selection, and this force can only be brought to bear on variations occurring in
                    adult animals. If, then, the male offspring do not develop the selected
                    peculiarities until they arrive at puberty, the age at which it appeared in
                    their male parent, it is clear that they cannot differ from the female until the
                    age of puberty arrives. And this is well known to be the case, for at an early
                    age the sexes are usually undistinguishable by any secondary characters. (See
                    <hi rend="italic">Descent of Man,</hi> vol. i. chap, viii)</p>
                <p>The interesting form of inheritance exemplified by the transmission through the
                    female line of diseases necessarily confined to the male sex has been already
                    alluded to. This latency of male characters is clearly illustrated by what
                    frequently occurs to old hens. It is well known that a large ntfmber of female
                    birds, when old or diseased, partly assume the secondary male characters of
                    their species. Waterton <hi rend="italic">(Essays on Nat. Hist.)</hi> gives a
                    curious instance of a hen which had ceased laying, and had assumed the plumage,
                    voice, spurs, and warlike disposition of the cock. The opposite case of the
                    assumption by the male of female characters is illustrated by the fact that
                    capons sometimes acquire the sitting instinct of the hen.</p>
                <p>The possibility of characters existing in a latent condition is of the utmost
                    moment to the breeder, since upon it depends the possibility of reversion or
                    atavism. Reversion is a matter of extreme importance to the breeder, for it is
                    one of the serious hindrances to the progress of his art. Since the time of the
                    famous Bakewell during last century, Leicester sheep have been bred with the
                    most scrupulous care, yet grey-faced, black-spotted, or wholly black lambs
                    occasionally appear. In this case the most careful selection has been necessary
                    to battle against the tendency of the original colouring of the sheep to
                    reappear. And in all cases of selection it is this tendency that has to be
                    struggled against by the breeder. On this principle the gardener looks over his
                    beds and weeds out the “rogues.” Even from seeds gathered from the finest
                    cultivated varieties of the heart’s-ease <hi rend="italic">(Viola
                    tricolor),</hi> plants perfectly wild both in flowers and foliage are frequently
                    produced. The proximate cause of any particular case of reversion is utterly
                    obscure; but some of the general causes may be set down. It is frequently
                    asserted that domestic animals or cultivated plants, when allowed to run wild,
                    always revert to the original parent form of the species. This assertion appears
                    to rest on insufficient evidence, and to be an exaggerated statement of what is
                    known on the subject. Nevertheless some weight must be allowed to it. Pigs have
                    run wild in various parts of the world, and have everywhere acquired the general
                    characters of the wild pig, and the young have re-acquired the longitudinal
                    stripes. This last character is interesting, since it is not in any way a direct
                    result of the changed conditions of life, as the thicker bristles and increased
                    size of the tusks might be supposed to be. Another well-established cause of
                    reversion is <hi rend="italic">crossing.</hi> The case is exceedingly striking
                    when the offspring of a cross do not resemble any near progenitor, but throw
                    back to very remote ancestors. In illustration may be mentioned the experiments
                    on pigeons detailed in the <hi rend="italic">Variation of Animals and Plants
                    under Domestication</hi> (vol. i. p. 200). There can be but little doubt that
                    all our domestic races of pigeons have descended from <hi rend="italic">Columba
                    livia,</hi> the wild rock pigeon; the common dovecot pigeons exhibit the
                    coloration of the parent form, and the most purely-bred fancy breeds, when of a
                    blue colour, often show these characteristic marks. One of the above-mentioned
                    experiments consisted in pairing a “mongrel female barb fantail with a mongrel
                    male barb spot, neither of which mongrels had the least blue about them.” It
                    appears that blue barbs are exceedingly rare, that the spot has been known as a
                    pure breed for nearly 200 years, and that a white fantail throwing any other
                    colour is almost an unknown occurrence; nevertheless the offspring from the
                    above two mongrels were of exactly the same blue tint over the whole back and
                    wings as that of the wild rock pigeon from the Shetland Islands. Moreover, every
                    characteristic mark of the wild pigeon was repeated in their mongrel offspring.
                    This experiment demonstrates in the most striking way the tendency of a cross to
                    produce reversion. The same result was also obtained by pairing black Spanish
                    cocks with hens of various white breeds. In this case the offspring reverted to
                    the red colouring cf <hi rend="italic">Gallus bankiva,</hi> which may be safely
                    ranked as the parent form of our domestic fowls. In these instances the
                    offspring revert to a character originally possessed by the ancestors of both
                    parents, and here the cross is in no way essential to the reversion; it merely
                    acts as a disturbing cause (although, probably, no other equally strong
                    disturbing power could be named). In these cases reversion to a character of any
                    degree of antiquity may occur. In the other class of cases where the character
                    to which the offspring revert is one given by a single cross with a distinct
                    variety, the tendency to reversion becomes weaker in each generation removed
                    from the cross, and may ultimately be obliterated. The length of time requisite
                    to effect obliteration has formed a subject of discussion. The question can
                    hardly be answered, but the fact that it has been asked shows at least that
                    obliteration may in some cases be effected in a practically finite period. In
                    other cases even characters gained in this way by a single cross seem incapable
                    of extermination. Eowls have been known to exhibit a Malay character, due to a
                    cross with that breed forty years previously.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Variability.—</hi> When in any case we find the offspring
                    differing from the parent, we set it down at first sight as an instance of
                    variability. But on the discovery being made that the peculiarities
                    characterizing the offspring are derived from a remote ancestor, it can no
                    longer be so considered, and must be attributed to reversion. Many cases of
                    apparent variation are due to this cause. Thus Gartner declares, aυd his
                    experience is of the highest value <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n291/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0291-0248"/> on such a point, that when he crossed distinct
                    species of native plants that had not been cultivated, he never once saw in the
                    offspring any new character; but that, from the odd manner in which the
                    characters derived from the parents were combined, they sometimes appeared as if
                    new. It appears, therefore, that the point at which the line of distinction is
                    drawn between reversion and variation depends in many cases on the state of our
                    knowledge of the subject. In some other points, also, the relations between
                    inheritance and variation are extremely intricate and difficult to unravel.
                    These two principles are often spoken of as opposed to one another. The
                    following case shows that any definition of variability implying that it is
                    necessarily equivalent to a breach in the law of heredity is incorrect. Some
                    kinds of sheep and cattle dogs are congenitally almost destitute of a tail; and
                    this Stonehenge attributes to the fact that under the old excise laws only those
                    dogs whose tails had been removed were exempt from taxation; so that this
                    mutilation was universally practised until the deficiency became hereditary. The
                    production of a tailless breed of dogs must certainly be considered a case of
                    variation, yet in this case it is not a <hi rend="italic">breach</hi> of the law
                    of heredity, but a remarkable instance of obedience to that law, that is to say,
                    of the transmission of the effects of mutilation. In other cases external causes
                    produce some constitutional or otherwise imperceptible changes in the parent,
                    and these in being transmitted to the offspring become correlated with some
                    external or <hi rend="italic">perceptible</hi> alteration, and in this way new
                    characters may appear. This is undoubtedly a true case of variation;
                    nevertheless, strictly speaking it is due to the inherited effects of a cause
                    acting on the parent. And it seems illogical to separate it in a radical manner
                    from cases such as tlιat of the tailless breeds of dogs. Considering, therefore,
                    the great difficulty in which the subject is enveloped, it will be well to
                    abandon theoretical considerations, and merely to state that characters at least
                    practically new do undoubtedly appear in the offspring. In every group of
                    organisms a degree of variability, sufficient to give material for the breeder
                    to work on, probably exists. The Laplander knows and gives a name to each of his
                    reindeer, though, as Linnaeus remarks, “to distinguish one from another among
                    such multitudes was beyond my comprehension, for they were like ants on an
                    ant-hill.” A still more striking case is that of the old Dutch florist Voorhelm,
                    who kept above 1200 varieties of the hyacinth, and was hardly ever deceived in
                    knowing each kind by the bulb alone. These cases are important as showing that,
                    even in natural objects which appear identical to the unpractised eye,
                    perceptible differences do exist. Man can effect nothing until some of his stock
                    begin to vary in the desired direction. But horticulturists have found by
                    experience that when any particular character is desired, the first step is to
                    get the plant to vary in any manner, and to go on selecting the most variable
                    individuals even though they vary in the wrong direction, for the fixed
                    character of the species being once broken through the desired variation will
                    sooner or later appear. The great number of races of many domestic animals and
                    plants—for instance, of pigeons, sheep, wheat, &lt;kc.—demonstrates clearly
                    their variability in many diverse characters. In other domestic animals,
                    however, very few distinct races exist; yet we must not conclude that these
                    animals have not varied. There are several causes besides that of an inherent
                    want of plasticity which may have been at work. It will here suffice to allude
                    to a few of them.</p>
                <p>1. If any particular group has not been especially subjected to selection, the
                    absence of distinct races in such a group is no proof of want of variability.
                    This applies to asses (in England only).</p>
                <p>2. If the breeder has not a large number of individuals to select from, the
                    chance of the required variations occurring is very small. Hence animals kept in
                    small lots do not form ι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> aces (c.&lt;∕., sheep on
                    small holdings).</p>
                <p>3. If intercrossing cannot be prevented, it is obvious that any variety which may
                    appear will have no chance of being perpetuated, but will be diluted down to the
                    normal type. This applies to cats, which, from their wandering and nocturnal
                    habits, cannot be paired.</p>
                <p>It may appear a truism to say that every variation must have a distinct cause,
                    but it is a truism very often overlooked. The case of twins, each born with a
                    peculiar crook in the little finger, is instructive, for here the conclusion is
                    irresistible that the same definite, though unknown, cause produced the
                    mal-formation in the two children. This case may also serve to illustrate the
                    extreme obscurity in which the causes of any given variation are hidden, and the
                    great difficulty of investigating them. Some general causes which induce
                    variability may, however, be set down.</p>
                <p>There appears to be no doubt that organisms subjected to the unnatural and
                    changeable conditions implied by domestication are more variable than those
                    living in a state of nature. Thus monstrosities are comparatively frequent among
                    domestic animals and plants.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Domestication causes a number of changes in the condition of life; it is
                    therefore of interest to determine which of these are the most important.
                    Contrary to what might have been expected, change of climate is not an important
                    cause of variation. This is repeatedly shown by A. de Candolle in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Géographie Botanique;</hi> and a change to a more genial climate
                    is certainly not necessary, for the dwarf kidney bean, which is often injured by
                    our spring frosts, and the peach, which requires the protection of a wall, have
                    varied much in England. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Acclimatisation.)</hi></p>
                <p>In some moths the colour of the perfect insect is affected by a change in the
                    food of the caterpillar, but there seems to be no evidence that this cause has

                    <hi rend="italic">excess</hi> of food is probably an important cause of
                    variability. This view was held by Andrew Knight, and the same idea is expressed
                    in the following remark of a “great raiser of seeds “It is a rule invariably
                    with us, when we desire to keep a true stock of any one kind of seed, to grow it
                    on poor land without dung; but when we grow for quantity we act contrary, and
                    sometimes have dearly to repent of it.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Quoted in <hi rend="italic">Vαr. under Domes.,</hi> ii. p.
                    257.</p></note> Nevertheless it appears that many of the best varieties of fruit
                    have not been produced under cultivation. Thus it is asserted that some of the
                    finest French pears were originally found growing wild, and this was the case
                    with an English variety of apple. The most interesting fact connected with
                    changes in the conditions of life is that the results of such changes are
                    capable of accumulation. It is this peculiarity that accounts for the fact that
                    when new flowers are first introduced into our gardens they do not vary. Thus
                    the Swan River daisy did not break from its original colour until it had been
                    subjected to seven years of high culture. Many facts might be given showing by
                    what slight changes of habitat the health and general development of animals and
                    plants may be affected;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See <hi rend="italic">Var. under Domes.,</hi> vol. ii. ch. xxiii., on “The
                    Definite Action of the Conditions of Life.”</p></note> but with these cases we
                    are not especially concerned. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Acclimatisation.)</hi>
                    The causes, however, which induce an unstable condition of general variability
                    are of great importance to the breeder. Of the causes not already touched on the
                    most important is intercrossing. In considering variations under this aspect no
                    attempt will be made to distinguish from true cases of variation the cases in
                    which new characters are simulated by combinations of old ones. In the first
                    place, it is probable that organisms propagated by <hi rend="italic">sexual</hi>
                    reproduction <pb break="no"

                    here the offspring has a double chance of being influenced by circumstances
                    affecting the parents; and by the concentration of a double set of tendencies
                    into one individual, a better chance is given for the origin of variations
                    produced by combinations of ancestral characters. In the same way, to a certain
                    extent, a cross with a distinct variety produces a disturbance or loss of
                    equilibrium in the reproductive system from which a tendency to the production
                    of variations results. Thus Gärtner asserts that seedlings from <hi
                    rend="italic">Dianthus</hi><hi rend="italic">barbatus,</hi> when crossed by the
                    hybrid <hi rend="italic">D. chinensi-barbatus,</hi> were more variable than
                    those raised from this latter hybrid fertilized by the pure <hi rend="italic"
                    >D.</hi><hi rend="italic">barbatus.</hi> Max Wichura insists strongly on an
                    analogous result in the case of willows; and Kölreuter says that to obtain an
                    endless number of varieties from hybrids they should be crossed and
                    recrossed.</p>
                <p>Some peculiarities in our domestic races are to be attributed to the inherited
                    effects of habit and of disuse. Splints and ring-bones on the legs of horses
                    appear to be certainly hereditary; and veterinary surgeons agree in pronouncing
                    these growths to be the result of travelling on hard roads, and of the horses
                    being shod. The effects of disuse are clearly shown in the skeletal characters
                    of our domestic races. These effects are well marked in tame birds, which are
                    necessarily prevented from exercising their wings in flight. Thus in the
                    domestic duck the crest of the sternum is less prominent, the furculum,
                    coracoids, and scapulae are all reduced in weight relatively to that of the
                    whole body; the bones of the wing are shorter and lighter, and the bones of the
                    leg longer and heavier in comparison with the same bones in the wild duck.
                    Closely connected with this class of facts is the subject of rudimentary organs.
                    In organisms living in a state of nature the constant pressure of the struggle
                    for existence tends to keep useless structures in a rudimentary condition. But
                    domestication, in removing this pressure, does away at the same time with the
                    principle of economy of growth; and accordingly, we find that organs rudimentary
                    in a state of nature become developed under domestication. Thus cultivation has
                    made true branches out of the thorns or rudimentary branches of the wild pear.
                    Again, the rudimentary fifth toe on the dog’s hind foot becomes in some cases
                    considerably developed, and forms the “dew-claw” of a few large breeds.</p>
                <p>Correlation has probably played an important part in modifying domestic races;
                    for in selecting a given character man has frequently perpetuated many other
                    peculiarities correlated with the first.</p>
                <p>Finally may be mentioned the curious phenomena of “analogous variation.” This
                    term is applied to those cases in which varieties of one species resemble
                    distinct but allied species. Where this occurs it is probably due to the two
                    forιrs having originated in a common progenitor, so that modifying causes evolve
                    similar varieties in the two cases because of the similarity of the material
                    which these forces have to act on. Analogous variation is therefore, properly
                    speaking, a branch of the subject of reversion, and once more points out the
                    close connection existing between the latter phenomenon and variability.</p>
                <p>In purely bred fowls of many races, birds may occasionally be found closely
                    resembling the <hi rend="italic">Gallus bαnkiva.</hi> Here the case is one of
                    simple reversion, and has already been alluded to. The production of spangled
                    sub-breeds of Hamburgh, Polish, Malay, and Bantam fowls is not an obvious case
                    of reversion to a known ancestor. It may be due, however, to descent from the
                    parent form of the Gallinaceae, considering the frequency of spangled markings
                    throughout the order.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Selection.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Selection may be
                    defined as the process by which the procreators of each fresh generation are
                    chosen out of the preceding one. But with reference to the formation of our
                    improved breeds something more than this is meant by the term. The modern
                    development of the art, which has been distinguished by Mr Darwin as <hi
                    rend="italic">methodical selection,</hi> always implies that the breeder has
                    before his mind an ideal form,—a model on which he attempts to mould his strain.
                    To be successful in this respect a man must not only possess in the highest
                    degree the powers of discrimination, enabling him to determine which individuals
                    are·tending in the right direction, that is, which most nearly approach his
                    ideal, but he must be able to decide, in the most judicious manner, as to which
                    of his selected individuals ought to be paired together. The subject, therefore,
                    falls naturally into two divisions— (1) the discrimination of individual
                    differences, (2) the arrangement of the pairing.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Discrimination of Individual Differences.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> The extremely fine powers of perception and the great
                    patience required by the breeder might be illustrated by numerous instances. Sir
                    John Sebright is said to have sometimes spent several days in weighing the rival
                    merits of five or six birds. In Germany the merino sheep farmers do not even
                    trust theirown judgment,but employ professional “sheep classifiers” to select
                    the best of the flock for breeding purposes. Not merely outward form, but
                    internal and constitutional peculiarities have been carefully attended to by
                    breeders. Thus, Bakewell (the first true methodical breeder of whose proceedings
                    we have any knowledge) bred almost entirely for the early maturity and fattening
                    qualities of his strain; and again, in the improved short-horn breeds, the
                    masses of internal fat or tallow have been increased to an almost incredible
                    extent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Youatt, <hi

                    put to the exaggeration of any one point, that even the great Bakewell appears
                    to have made this mistake in causing a useless accumulation of fat where it was
                    not needed. It seems that the fat mingled less with the lean than even in the
                    old breeds, and that it spread in layers under the skin, forming cushions of
                    fat. He quotes a writer who observes that, having with great difficulty formed a
                    race of cattle that would “make fat,” Bakewell left his successors under the
                    necessity of producing a breed that would “make lean.” The same kind of error
                    was at one time committed with the improved short-horns, whose progenitors were
                    pre-eminently good milkers; here the breeders, by attending exclusively to other
                    qualities, have in some cases injured the milking powers of the race. Youatt is
                    convinced that this loss is not necessarily correlated with rapid feeding
                    qualities,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Op. cit.,</hi> p. 239.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> He
                    asserts that by careful selection a strain may be obtained (and this has, in
                    fact, been effected) in which the cows are first-class milkers, and when dried
                    fatten quickly and well.</p>
                <p>In spite of these warnings against exclusiveness and exaggeration, it should be
                    remembered that the difficulties of selection are greatly increased by attention
                    to several points at once. An illustration of this may be taken from the less
                    important art of fancy breeding. « An eminent fancier in speaking of the almond
                    tumbler pigeon (a breed having five points, viz., plumage, carriage, head, beak,
                    and eye), remarks that “there are some young fanciers who are over covetous, who
                    go for all the above five properties at once; they have their reward by getting
                    nothing.” Mr Darwin observes, “We may smile at the solemnity of this precept,
                    but he who laughs will win no prizes.”</p>
                <p>It should be remarked, however, that “fancying” is not governed by rules
                    identical with those which regulate breeding for economic purposes. The fancier
                    often has to strive after extreme abnormal development, amounting to
                    monstrosity; it has often been remarked that he will not tolerate anything short
                    of this extreme divergence. On the other hand the economic breeder is prevented
                    by solid monetary considerations from being misled to any great extent by
                    fashion. Hence, instead of the wide differences observable in “fancied” animals,
                    we find a remarkable uniformity in certain characters among many of those bred
                    for use. Thus all the improved races of the pig closely resemble each other in
                    their shortened legs and muzzles, their large hairless· bodies and small tusks.
                    Weìl-bred cattle of several distinct races exhibit a similar convergence of
                    character.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Arrangement of the Pairing</hi> (including crossing).—We
                    have already alluded to the remarkable case in which it seems an advantage to
                    the offspring that one parent <hi rend="italic">only</hi> should possess the
                    desired quality in an especial degree. This may be considered an extreme case,
                    yet it bears some relation to the principles on which breeders usually regulate
                    the arrangement of the pairings. Generally speaking, individuals having certain
                    points peculiarly well developed are matched with those excelling in other
                    directions. It is probable that a physiological law which would formulate the
                    exceptional cases above mentioned would also favour the more common practice <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n293/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0293-0250"/> now under consideration. For it would allow the
                    transmission of qualities from either parent, undisturbed by the influence of
                    the other, to the offspring. In this part of his work the breeder once more
                    finds occasion for the utmost skill and judgment; but so difficult to formulate
                    are the fruits of his experience that he often seems guided in his choice by
                    instinct rather than by reason. Every new breed must originate in a few
                    individuals possessing some special peculiarities. Therefore, nearly-related
                    individuals must at first be matched; in other words, close “in-and-in” breeding
                    must be practised, or the race cannot be “fixed.” In consequence of the
                    uniformity obtained by pure breeding, characters otherwise unimportant become
                    valuable as marks of purity of race. Thus the dark red colour of the Devon
                    cattle becomes a criterion of “blood.”</p>
                <p>The advantages of in-and-in breeding have been insisted upon by the improvers of
                    our domestic breeds, and some of them have declared that no ill results follow
                    from the practice. But in spite of this assertion it is generally admitted that
                    degeneration either in constitution or in other ways does ultimately ensue; so
                    that at any cost the breeder is absolutely compelled to admit blood from another
                    family or strain of the same race. In speaking of this necessity in the case of
                    sheep, Youatt says that the breeder will choose “a ram from a soil and kind of
                    food not dissimilar to his own, . . . with points as much resembling his own
                    sheep as may bθ—quite as good as those in his own flock—superior if possible in
                    some points, inferior in none.” But in opposition to Youatt it may be argued,
                    from the practice followed by some great poultry breeders, that animals having
                    the same physical characters, but which have been kept under different <hi
                    rend="italic">conditions,</hi> ought to be selected for crossing. By this means
                    tone and vigour are infused into the stock without materially altering its
                    character. In other cases a different plan has been followed. For instance,
                    Colling (for what purpose is not clear, on account of the secrecy in which he
                    carried out his art) crossed his short-horns with a distinct breed—the Galloway.
                    He thus produced a sub-strain or family, called in reproach the “Alloy,” but
                    possessed of great merits, which, by recrossing with short-horns, became quite
                    equal to the pure breed,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Low, p. 304.</p></note> and produced animals which sold for enormous prices.
                    This method of making one “violent” cross, and trusting to subsequent recrossing
                    with, the pure parent form (together with long continued selection), has
                    sometimes been followed where some especial quality is required. Lord Orford’s
                    well-known attempt to infuse pluck into his greyhounds by means of a cross with
                    a bull-dog is a case in point. Stonehenge records a carefully-observed
                    experiment of the same kind, which shows that the objectionable form of the
                    bull-dog can be thoroughly eradicated even in four generations. In other cases a
                    cross with a distinct variety is effected with the object of forming an
                    intermediate race which shall transmit its characters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Crossing.—</hi> An injudicious exaggeration of certain
                    qualities, as in some cases before alluded to, has taken place in breeding
                    long-woolled sheep. Here the fleece has been almost exclusively attended to, and
                    the quality of the carcase allowed to deteriorate. No doubt, an improved breed
                    remedying this evil might have been formed by selection, but this process would
                    have been slow and extremely difficult; and, fortunately, there existed the
                    readier method of forming a cross-breed race combining the desirable
                    characteristics of both varieties. Messrs Druce and Pusey<note anchored="true"

                <p>Crossing has, in fact, entered largely into the formation of nearly all our
                    improved sheep.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mr
                    Spooner’s excellent paper on “Cross-Breeding” in the <hi rend="italic">Jour.

                <p>In some cases the offspring of a first cross between distinct species possess
                    valuable qualities, but owing to their sterility an intermediate <hi
                    rend="italic">race</hi> cannot be formed. If, however, the combination is
                    valuable the cross may be repeated at will. The breeding of mules is a familiar
                    example of this method. In the same way cross-bred cattle, which though not
                    sterile are yet incapable of transmitting their valuable qualities to their
                    offspring, are bred for the butcher by a repetition of the first cross.</p>
                <p>Some of the more important points in connection with methodical selection and the
                    modern art of breeding have now been briefly indicated. The results obtained
                    have been truly astonishing. Lord Somerville graphically remarked that the
                    modern sheep-breeder appeared to have “drawn a perfect form and then to have
                    given it life.” These extraordinary improvements have been effected almost
                    within the last century; and it may be objected that because selection as now
                    practised is of modern date, the differences which characterize many races of
                    great antiquity cannot have been produced by man. This objection, however, is
                    not valid, for it can be shown that an unnoticed and therefore unrecorded cause
                    of modification has long been in existence. This important ageut has been named
                    “unconscious selection it is illustrated by the following case. In speaking of
                    two flocks of the New Leicester sheep possessed respectively by Messrs Buckley
                    and Burgess, Youatt remarks that “both of their flocks have been purely bred
                    from the original stock of Mr Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not
                    a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject,
                    that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure
                    blood of Mr Bakewell’s flock; yet the difference between the sheep possessed by
                    these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite
                    different varieties.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">The Sheep,</hi> p. 315.</p></note></p>
                <p>Now we may feel sure that neither of these breeders intended to alter the
                    character of his flock, he merely strove to produce the best possible New
                    Leicester sheep, and selected those which approached his ideal most closely. Yet
                    owing to slightlydifferentstandards of excellence having been unconsciously
                    aimed at in the two cases, the important results pointed out by Youatt arose. It
                    is an exceeding remarkable fact, that changes so small as not to be perceived by
                    the trained eye of the modern breeder may by accumulation produce obvious
                    results in the short space of fifty years. And if such changes may occur
                    unnoticed under the supervision of men keenly alive to the possibilities of
                    change, a far greater field for this kind of modification must have been offered
                    before any such knowledge was general. An unperceived divergence of character
                    will arise whenever men, actuated by some vague belief in heredity, begin to
                    select the best individuals, roughly speaking, for reproductive purposes. Each
                    man will unconsciously take a standard of excellence slightly different from his
                    neighbours, and thus his strain will imperceptibly begin to differ from theirs.
                    Now there can be no doubt that an amount of selection sufficient for this
                    purpose must have been practised from a very remote period. Youatt, after an
                    examination of the passages in the Old Testament bearing on the subject, asserts
                    that some of the best principles of breeding were then understood. The antiquity
                    of breeding is also proved by certain passages in ancient Chinese
                    encyclopaedias.</p>
                <p>The ancestors of nations at present civilized must have passed through stages in
                    which they resembled the savages of the present day; therefore it may fairly be
                    assumed that customs which are found among lowly developed savages are of great
                    antiquity. Now few races are more barbarous than the Australians, yet even they
                    take pains in the breeding of their dogs, matching the finest together and
                    providing good food for the mother in order that the young may be well nurtured.
                    From a large body of similar evidence there can be no doubt that a degree of
                    selection sufficient for the development of unperceived divergence has been <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0294-0251"/> practised from exceedingly ancient times. The
                    results produced by prolonged selection of this kind may be estimated in various
                    ways. For instance, although it is certain that the pointer originally came from
                    Spain, no such breed exists there at the present day. So far as is known no
                    efforts have ever been made to modify the pointer; but every one has wished to
                    possess as good dogs as possible, and by an unconscious consensus of opinion,
                    the desire for improvement has resulted in a slow progressive change in a
                    certain direction. But the amount of divergence produced by long-continued
                    selection may be illustrated more forcibly by general considerations than by
                    special instances. The fact that the progenitors of many cultivated plants and
                    domestic animals cannot with certainty be determined points out the great
                    divergence from the wild parent form that has been effected under domestication.
                    The genus <hi rend="italic">Auchenia</hi> may serve as an illustration. There
                    are four forms in this genus— the guanaco and vicuna, found wild, and
                    undoubtedly distinct species, and the llama and alpaca, known only in a
                    domesticated condition. Most professed naturalists have looked on all four forms
                    as specifically distinct, and have made the assumption that the wild llama and
                    alpaca have become extinct. But Mr Ledger appears to have proved
                    conclusively<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Bull, de la Soc. d'Acclimat.,</hi> tom. vii∙, 1860, p.
                    457.</p></note> that the llama is the domesticated descendant of the guanaco,
                    and the alpaca that of the vicuna,—so that a large amount of divergence must
                    have been effected in this case. And as we know that careful selection was
                    anciently applied to these animals, there is nothing inconceivable in such a
                    transformation having been effected. The power of long-continued selection is
                    well shown by the fact that, in domestic animals and plants, the parts or
                    qualities valued by man have been most modified; thus the sheep has been prized
                    during many ages for its fleece, the horse for its strength and fleetness, and,
                    accordingly, we do not find breeds of sheep differing from each other in
                    strength and fleetness, or breeds of horses distinguished by the properties of
                    their hair, but on the contrary both animals have produced races characterized
                    by differences in the qualities for which they are valued. The same law is even
                    more clearly demonstrated by plants under cultivation. In the radish, which has
                    been esteemed exclusively for its root, it is the latter that differs in the
                    several varieties, while the flowers, seed, and foliage are almost identical in
                    all. Again, the varieties of the gooseberry differ much in their fruit, but
                    hardly perceptibly in their flowers and organs of reproduction. In some cases
                    structures neglected by man have varied by correlation; but allowing for this
                    exception, they may be said to have escaped the effects of selection, and
                    accordingly to have remained stationary, while the selected qualities have
                    gradually improved.</p>
                <p>In attempting to frame an answer to the question— How much has man actually
                    effected '? it will be well first to estimate the amount of modification which
                    may be claimed as his work, and then to measure the efficiency of the agents by
                    which these results are believed to have been effected.</p>
                <p>(1.) Organic beings resemble each other in descending degrees, so that they can
                    be classed in groups under groups, —classes, orders, genera, &amp;c. The
                    doctrine of evolution gives life to this arrangement and makes it truly a
                    “natural” classification,—the idea of different degrees of community of descent
                    being added to that of arbitrary classification by community of characteristics.
                    Thus it happens that the number and distinctness of the genera contained in a
                    natural family become to a certain extent a gauge of the amount of divergence
                    which the modifying causes of nature have produced, since the time when all the
                    genera were united in the parent form of their family. And by a similar method
                    we may estimate the amount of divergence that man has effected. For instance,
                    there can be no doubt that all the varieties of the domestic pigeon are the
                    descendants of the rock pigeon, and have sprung up under the care of man during
                    the long period of time that has elapsed since their wild ancestor was first
                    domesticated. These varieties amount to more than 150 in number; and there can
                    be no question that, supposing them to be found wild, they would be grouped
                    under at least five distinct genera,—so great are differences existing among
                    them. This instance gives some idea of the marvellous amount of modification
                    that may arise under domestication.</p>
                <p>(2.) Are the powers which man possesses of producing modification sufficient for
                    the work assigned to them Î It will be well to set down the assumptions which
                    may fairly be made in connection with this point.</p>
                <p>First, the labours of the great breeders teach us what enormous changes can be
                    effected in the short space of one man’s life; and we know that the essential
                    principles involved in the process were anciently known and followed.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we may feel certain that great divergence of character is unconsciously
                    produced during long continued selection of any kind; and we know that some kind
                    of selection must have existed from remote periods. Logically considered,
                    therefore, the possibility of almost any degree of divergence having been
                    effected turns in great measure on the question of the antiquity of
                    selection.</p>
                <p>It is therefore important to note that an indirect kind of selection must almost
                    necessarily be coeval with domestication. For this can be shown to be the case
                    with tame animals possessed by the rudest savage, who does not regulate their
                    increase in accordance with even the vaguest belief in heredity. In each litter
                    of puppies, for instance, some would necessarily be destroyed, for their master
                    would be unable to preserve all the young ones which were produced. He would
                    certainly not save those which were small, feeble, or deficient in any valuable
                    quality. The finest in each generation would then be preserved, merely because
                    it was believed that they, individually, would be useful, and not with any idea
                    of “breeding.” Nevertheless, it would indirectly follow that the superior
                    individuals in each generation would, as a rule, form the progenitors of the
                    next one; that is, a kind of indirect selection would arise. If then we can be
                    sure that domestication, in some form, has existed from remote times, we may
                    feel tolerably certain that the above-described rude form of selection must be
                    of nearly equal antiquity. Apart from the direct proofs on this head which we
                    possess in the remains of the prehistoric period, there is a high antecedent
                    probability in favour of the extreme antiquity of domestication; for it is
                    certain that tame animals are of great use to savages, and the wild progenitors
                    of many of our domestic creatures are rendered tame with ease. This is the case
                    with wild dogs, pigs, cattle, ducks, &amp;c. In the case of vegetables, it
                    appears that, in times of scarcity, savages devour almost any berries or leaves
                    which they can obtain, often suffering terribly in consequence; and in this way
                    plants at all superior in nutritious qualities would assuredly be discovered. We
                    may, therefore, conclude—(1), that the domestication of animals and the culture
                    of plants date from exceedingly remote antiquity; (2), that a certain amount of
                    selection must have been nearly coeval with domestication; (3), that some degree
                    of divergence of character must almost necessarily have accompanied selection;
                    and (4), that, consequently, the largo amount of modification claimed to have
                    been produced by man is a conceivable and credible result. <hi rend="smallcaps"
