                    railway it is 50 miles from London and 28 from Chichester. Its seafrontage of
                    handsome mansions and hotels extends upwards of three miles from Kemp Town in
                    the east to what was formerly the suburban village of Cliftonville in the parish
                    of Hove; while its depth inland at the centre is rather in the reign of Henry
                    VII., and is probably one of the oldest buildings in the town, and Trinity
                    chapel, in Ship Street, memorable as the scene of the labours of Frederick
                    William Robertson. The most important of the secular edifices are the town-hall,
                    the market, the pavilion, the aquarium, the theatre, the proprietary college,
                    the Sussex county hospital, the new workhouse, the infirmary, the blind asylum,
                    and the female orphan asylum. The pavilion, with its strange assemblage of domes
                    and minarets, was built in 1784-7 as a residence for the Prince of Wales
                    (afterwards George IV.), and about 1818 it was refashioned by Nash into a
                    grotesque imitation of Chinese architecture. It has a frontage to the east of
                    300 feet, and occupies, with its gardens, about 11∣ acres. In 1850 it was
                    purchased by the town for £53,000, and its spacious rooms, greatly altered from
                    time to time, are now appropriated to a variety of uses,—one serving as a
                    museum, another as an assembly-room, others as picture-galleries. The pavilion
                    dome, formerly the royal stables, is now converted into a magnificent hall for
                    high-class musical performances; it is lighted by a glazed dome, with more than
                    a mile. In general appearance the style of the town strikingly resembles that of
                    London; and many of its streets and squares seem as if they had been transported
                    a≡ they stand from the “West End.” As far, indeed, as its character is not
                    affected by its natural situation, it is nothing more or less than a vigorous
                    offshoot supported by the sap of the greater city, a fact which is popularly
                    recognized by the designation of London-super-Mare. During the present century
                    its growth has been rapid and continuous, about four hundred new houses being
                    often built in the space of a year. Its streets and squares already amount to
                    four hundred; but in comparison with this extent the number of its really
                    remarkable buildings is rather small, and nearly all of them are of modern date.
                    Among its twenty Episcopalian and between thirty and forty Nonconformist
                    churches two only need be specially mentioned,—the parish church of St Nicholas,
                    which was built a diameter only 20 feet less than that of the dome of St Paul’s
                    of London. The county hospital was built in 1828 by Sir Charles Barry, at a cost
                    of £10,000, and has since been largely extended. It is “open to the sick and
                    lame poor of every country and nation.” There are a large number of minor
                    benevolent establishments in the town, and so various are its educational
                    institutions that it has been called the city of schools. Among the bathing
                    establishments the most remarkable are Brill’s and the New Turkish Baths; the
                    former includes extensive swimming baths for both sexes.</p>
                <p>The tendency of the currents in the channel opposite Brighton is to drive the
                    shingle eastward, and within the memory of man large portions of the coast have
                    thus been destroyed. To prevent this erosion the whole sea-frontage of the town
                    at the east end is protected by a great sea-wall, which was built between 1827
                    and 1838. It is a mile long, 60 feet high, and 23 feet thick at the base, and
                    cost £100,000. The beach is further ribbed from north to south by various
                    “groynes,” or jetties, one of which, constructed of concrete in 1867, at a cost
                    of £5000, stretches about 250 feet into the sea. There are two piers which serve
                    as promenades. The first, an elegant chain fabric commenced by Sir S. Brown,
                    R.N., in 1822, was <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0392-0345"/> opened to the public in the following year. It is
                    1136 feet in length and 15 feet in width, the four cast-iron columns on which it
                    is suspended being supported by stone buttresses based on oaken piles driven
                    into the solid chalk. The cost was £30,000, and in 1836 an additional
                    expenditure was necessary to repair the damage inflicted by a great storm in
                    November of that year, which was within a little of destroying the structure
                    altogether. A new pier further to the west was opened in 1866. Its total length
                    is 1115feet,andit affords accommodation for2000 people. The town is well
                    supplied with water by the corporation waterworks, and by an artesian well, 1285
                    feet deep, at Warren Farm, the boring of which lasted from 1858 to 1862. The
                    sewage is effectively removed by an intercepting sewer 5 miles in length, which
                    discharges into the sea 2 miles east of the parish boundary. Since the opening
                    of the Brighton railway in 1841 the town has developed wonderfully; but, with
                    the exception of the railway works, no manufacturing establishment exists, and
                    no tall chimneys are seen. Owing to the absence of a natural harbour the
                    commerce of the place is insignificant, but the mackerel and herringfisheries
                    are carried on by about 120 boats. The races, which are held in August to the
                    north and north-east of the town, and the great volunteer reviews, which of late
                    years have drawn many thousands to the neighbouring downs, add considerably to
                    the local trade. The town is governed by a mayor, thirteen aidermen, and a
                    council. It returns two members to parliament.</p>
                <p>Brighton, originally Brighthelmstoue, plainly derives its name from some Saxon
                    Brighthelm, but who or what he was there seems no means of discovering. The
                    present contracted form of the word came into general use only in the end of the
                    18th century, but it iβ sometimes found in the documents of the time of Charles
                    II. At the time of the Conquest Brighton was a small fishing village, and the
                    lordship of the manor was bestowed by the Conqueror on his nephew William de
                    Warrenne, who received as rent from the fishermen 4000 herrings. In 1513 it was
                    burnt by the French under Messire Pregent, whom the English chronicles call
                    Prior John; and in 1545 it was again greatly damaged by Claude d’Annebalte, the
                    admiral of Francis I. At that time it is represented as a quadrangular town of
                    four or five streets. There were then no defences, but in 1558 a small circular
                    fort was erected by Elizabeth. The town seems to have rapidly recovered its
                    prosperity, for in 1579 it possessed 80 fishing-boats, with 400 fishermen and
                    10,000 nets. The whole Elizabethan town, however, has been destroyed by the sea,
                    which in 1699 swept away 160 houses, and in 1703 and 1706 did almost as much
                    damage. The modern reputation of Brighton is due to Dr Richard Russell, a native
                    of Lewes, who resided there in 1750, and wrote a book on the advantages of
                    sea-bathing, which led a number of people of high rank—-among others the dukes
                    of Cumberland and Marlborough— to place themselves under his direction. The
                    Prince Regent followed, and the fortunes of Brighton were made. Bedford Square
                    was commenced in 1810, and the building of Kemp Town took place between 1821 and
                    1830. A charter of incorporation was granted in 1854. In 1761 the population was
                    only about 2000; in 1801 it had risen to 7339, by 1841 to 48,567, and by 1851 to
                    69,673. In 1861 there were 77,693 inhabitants in the municipal borough, and
                    87,317 within the parliamentary limits, the number of houses being respectively
                    12,727 and 13,983, while in 1871 the municipal borough nad a population of
                    90,011, inhabiting 14,438 houses, and the parliamentary borough 103,758, with
                    16,284. See Lower’s <hi rend="italic">History of Sussex,</hi> 1870, and papers
