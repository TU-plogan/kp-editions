                    young men of the schools of Paris, and these passions gained full possession of
                    the mind of Bûchez. With his friends Bazard and Flotard he founded, in 1821, a
                    secret association—a system of French carbonarism—which spread rapidly and
                    widely, and displayed itself in repeated attempts at revolution. In one of these
                    attempts—the affair at Belfort— which cost General Berton, Colonel Caron, and
                    four soldiers of Rochelle their lives, he was gravely compromised, although the
                    jury which tried him did not find the evidence sufficient to warrant his
                    condemnation. In 1825 he graduated in medicine, and soon after he published,
                    along with Μ. Trelat, a <hi rend="italic">Précis élémentaire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d'Hygiene∙</hi> About the same time he became a member of the
                    Saint-Simonian Society, presided over by Bazard, Enfantin, and Rodriguez, and
                    contributed to its orgau, the <hi rend="italic">Producteur.</hi> He left it in
                    consequence of aversion to the strange theological dogmas of its spiritual
                    chief, Μ. Enfantin, and began to elaborate what he regarded as a Christian
                    socialism. For the exposition and advocacy of his principles he founded a
                    periodical called <hi rend="italic">L'Européen.</hi> In 1833 he published an <hi
                    rend="italic">Introduction</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">la
                    Science</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire,</hi> which was received with considerable favour, and of which a
                    second edition, improved and enlarged, in two volumes, appeared in 1842.
                    Notwithstanding its prolixity and discursiveness, this is both an interesting
                    and a meritorious work. The part of it which treats of the aim, foundation, and
                    methods of the science <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0462-0415"/> of history is truly valuable. On the other hand,
                    what is most distinctive in Μ. Buchez’s theory—the division of historical
                    development into four great epochs originated by four universal revelations, of
                    each epoch into three periods corresponding to desire, reasoning, and
                    performance, and of each of these periods into a theoretical and practical age—
                    seems entitled to no higher commendation than that of being ingenious. (See
                    Flint’s <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of History in Europe,</hi> i., 242-252). Μ.
                    Bûchez next edited, along with Μ. Roux Laverne, the <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    parlementaire de la Révolution Française</hi> (1833-38, 40 vols). This vast,
                    laborious, conscientious publication is one of the chief sources of information
                    regarding the early periods of the first French Revolution. There is a review of
                    it by Mr Carlyle <hi rend="italic">(Miscellanies),</hi> the first two parts of
                    whose own history of the French Revolution are mainly drawn from it. The editors
                    worked under the inspiration of a strong admiration of the principles of
                    Robespierre and the Jacobins, and in the belief that the French Revolution was
                    an attempt to realize Christianity.</p>
                <p>Μ. Bûchez gave a general exposition of his views in his <hi rend="italic">Essai
                    d'un Traité complet de Philosophie au point de vue du Catholicisme et du
                    progrès</hi> (3 vols. 1839-40). Perhaps the fundamental doctrine of this
                    treatise is that the primitive, intellectual, moral, and religious ideas of men
                    cannot be adequately explained as innate, or as derived from sensation,
                    sentiment, or reasoning, but must have been imparted by divine revelation. It is
                    substantially identical with the fundamental doctrine of De Bonald, although
                    Bûchez infers from it democratic instead of theocratic consequences. Great
                    prominence is given to the conception of progress which is attained by
                    generalization from a comprehensive survey of geology, physiology, and history.
                    The author sets very distinctly before himself also the aim of organizing the
                    sciences into a single comprehensive system. This he thought could only be
                    accomplished through an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> synthetic method, and
                    not, as had previously been attempted, by the analytical and experimental
                    method. It was partly owing to the reputation which he had acquired by these
                    publications, but still more owing to his connection with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >National</hi> newspaper, and with the secret societies hostile to the
                    Government of Louis Philippe, that he was raised, by the Revolution of 1848, to
                    the presidency of the Constituent Assembly. He speedily showed that he was not
                    possessed of the firmness, decision, and political capacity needed in a
                    situation so difficult and in days so tempestuous. He retained the position only
                    for a very short time. After the dissolution of the Assembly he was not
                    re-elected. Thrown back into private life, he resumed his studies, and added
                    several works to those which have been already mentioned. A <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de Politique,</hi> which may be considered as the
                    completion of his <hi rend="italic">Traité de Philosophie,</hi> is the most
                    important of the productions of the last period of his life. His brochures are
                    very numerous and on a great variety of subjects, medical, historical,
                    political, philosophical, He died in 1865. He found a disciple of considerable
                    ability in Μ. Ott, who has advocated and applied his principles in various
                    writings, the most recent of which, perhaps, places the metaphysiβal theory of
                    Bûchez in as favourable a light as it can be seen under. · (κ. F.)</p>
