                    chiefly in the old town, comprise the following :—the cathedral, erected in the

                        rend="italic">Bleikeller,</hi> or lead-vault, in which bodies may be kept a
                    long time without suffering decomposition; the church of St Ansgarius, built
                    about 1243, with a spire 400 feet high; the <hi rend="italic">liathhaus,</hi> a
                    building of the early part of the 15 th century, with a celebrated underground
                    winecellar; the town-house, formerly the archiépiscopal palace, and converted to
                    its present uses only in 1819; the Schütting, or merchant’s hall, originally
                    built in 1619 for the guild of cloth-traders; the exchange, completed in 1867;
                    the theatre; the town library; the high-school, a quite recent erection; and the
                    new post-office buildings. St Rembert’s church and the colosseum may be
                    mentioned in the Vorstadt; and the barracks in the new town. At the head of the
                    monetary establishments stands the <hi rend="italic">Bremer Bank,</hi> which was
                    founded in 1856 as a private speculation, and is only allowed to issue notes to
                    the amount of its realized capital. Seven other banks were in operation in the
                    beginning of 1875. There are in the city eighteen public and thirteen private
                    schools, the former including a navigation and an industrial school, and the
                    latter an institution for the extension of female labour.</p>
                <p>New waterworks, constructed by an English company on the left side of the river,
                    were opened in 1872, and supply the city with water of a good quality from the
                    Weser; a large fire-brigade establishment has also been founded in imitation of
                    a similar institution at Berlin; and an extensive park, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bürger</hi><hi rend="italic">Park,</hi> has been laid out in the old Bürger
                    Weide, or meadows. Railway communication is rapidly increasing, and a central
                    terminus for all the lines is proposed. The most important of those already open
                    connect the city directly with Hanover, with Oldenburg, with Bremerhaven, with
                    Hamburg, and with Minden. Tho manufactures of Bremen are of considerable extent
                    and variety, the most important being those of tobacco, snuff, and cigars,
                    though they have somewhat declined since the formation of the empire. In 1872 no
                    fewer than 2500 people were employed throughout the state in preparing cigars
                    alone, while the making of cigar-boxes occupied 250 more. The shelling of rice
                    is also largely carried on, and there are sugar-refineries, soap-works,
                    shipbuildingyards, sail-cloth factories, a large iron foundry, distilleries,
                    asphalt-works, and colour-factories. In the extent of its foreign trade Bremen
                    is one of the chief cities in Germany, and as a port of emigration it is only
                    rivalled by Hamburg. It deals largely with the United States, Great Britain,
                    British India, and Russia. Its principal imports consist of cotton, tobacco,
                    coffee, rye, rice, coals, iron goods, petroleum, glass, hides and skins, silk,
                    wool, linen, and dyes, <pb break="no"

                    a manufactured state. In 1874 the arrivals were 3407 vessels, with a register of
                    990,101 tons,—650 belonging to Bremen, 418 to Britain, and* 317 to Holland. Much
                    of the shipping trade of the city is conducted at Bremerhaven and Vegesack,
                    because vessels drawing more than 7 feet cannot get up to the town. Among the
                    societies of the city are a nautical association, the German Life-Boat
                    Institution, and the cnamber of commerce.</p>
                <p>As early as 788 Bremen, tnen a mere fishing village, was made the seat of a
                    bishopric by Charlemagne; and in 858 it was raised to an archbishopric by
                    Ansgarius, archbishop of Hamburg, who had been driven from that city by the
                    Normans about 847. The importance of Bremen soon increased; and its citizens
                    took an active share in the more remarkable movements of the time, such as the
                    Crusades, the establishment of the Teutonic Order, and the founding of Riga. In
                    1283 they joined the Hanseatic League, and in 1289 formed a treaty with
                    Gisalbert, their archbishop, by which he agreed to confine himself to the
                    spiritual affairs of his diocese, leaving secular concerns to the civic
                    authorities. In the course of the 14th century, there was much intestine
                    conflict in the city, and in the 15th it had to defend its commerce against the
                    pertinacious hostility of the Frisian pirates; but from both perils it issued
                    with increased vigour. About 1522 the archbishop and most of the inhabitants
                    declared for Protestantism, in defence of which they took a foremost part, and
                    had on various occasions to suffer severely. The city was twice besieged by the
                    imperial forces in 1547. At the peace of Westphalia (1648) the archiépiscopal
                    diocese was secularized and raised to a grand duchy, which was ceded to Sweden.
                    In a war between Denmark and Sweden in 1712 it was conquered by the former, and
                    in 1715 it was purchased from that power by Hanover along with the duchy of
                    Verden. The transfer was confirmed by the diet of 1732, and the district now
                    forms part of the Hanoverian province of Stade. The city of Bremen had meanwhile
                    had its civic rights more or less thoroughly recognized during these
                    vicissitudes. In 1806 it was taken by the French, and from 1810 to 1813 it was
                    the capital of the department of the Mouths of the Weser. Restored to
                    independence by the congress of Vienna in 1815, it subsequently became a member
                    of the German confederation, and in 1867 joined the new confederation of the
                    North German States, with which it was merged in the new German empire. It has
                    now one vote in the federal council, and sends a representative to the imperial
                    diet. The freedom of its port is secured, and in compensation it pays an <hi
                        rend="italic">aversum</hi> of 250,000 thalers to the customs union.</p>
                <p>The territory of Bremen has an area of 63,400 English acres, about 5000 acres
                    being occupied by the towns of Bremen, Bremerhaven, and Vegesack, and about 1200
                    by the bed of the Weser. Of the remaining area about two-fifths are arable land
                    and two-fifths meadowland, the extent of woodland being very slight. The soil is
                    for the most part sandy, though here and there marshes or bogs occur. Of the
                    population, which in 1873 was 130,871, 88,146 were inhabitants of Bremen the
                    city, 12,129 of Bremerhaven, and 3843 of Vegesack, and 26,753 of the rural
                    districts. With the exception of about 2800 Roman Catholics and 271 Jews, the
                    inhabitants are Lutherans or Calvinists of various denominations. According to
                    the constitution of 1849, modified by various enactments in 1854, the senate,
                    which is the executive power, is composed of eighteen members, elected by the
                    “burghership” on presentation by the senate. Of these, ten at least must be
                    lawyers, and five merchants; and two of the number are nominated by their
                    colleagues as burgomasters, who preside in succession, and hold office for four
                    years, one retiring every two years. The burghership consists of 150 (formerly
                    300) representatives chosen from the citizens for six years. Sixteen are elected
                    by those of the inhabitants of the city who have attended a university, 48 by
                    the merchants, 24 by the manufacturers and artisans, and 30 by the other
                    citizens; of the remaining representatives 6 are furnished by Bremerhaven, 6 by
                    Vegesack, and 20 by the country population The revenue in 1873 amounted to
                    £545,531, and the expenditure was £1,094,222, so that the deficit was £548,691.
                    The total debt at the end of the year was £3,676,733 The territory and city are
                    still outside the limits of the customs union. In the whole state there were in
                    1870 forty-five public and thirteen private schools, with a total attendance of
                    12,794.</p>
