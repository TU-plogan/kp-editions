                    (1564 -1629), the first of a lineof distinguished scholars, whose Hebrew and
                    rabbinical learning shed lustre upon the university of Basel during the 17th
                    century, was born at Camen in Westphalia on the 25th December 1564. The original
                    form of the name was Bockstrop, or Boxtrop, from which was derived the family
                    crest or insignia, which bore the figure of a goat <hi rend="italic">(Bock</hi>
                    in German signifying “hegoat”). Hie early education was received at the schools
                    of Hamm and Dortmund. After the death of his father, who was minister of Camen,
                    Buxtorf resumed his studies, which had been interrupted for a short time by that
                    event, at Marburg, and the newly-founded university of Herborn, at the latter of
                    which Olevian and Piscator had been recently appointed professors of theology.
                    It was under the teaching of Piscator that Buxtorf first imbibed a love for the
                    Hebrew language and literature, that department iu which he was destined
                    afterwards to become so famous. So great was his progress in these studies, that
                    Piscator acknowledged that he was far surpassed by his pupil. At a later date
                    Piscator received the assistance of Buxtorf in the preparation of his Latin
                    translation of the Old Testament, which was published at Herborn in 1602-3. From
                    Herborn Buxtorf repaired to Heidelberg, and thence to Basel, to which latter
                    university he was attracted by the reputation of John James Grynaeus and
                    Hospinian. After a residence of some time at Basel, Buxtorf proceeded to Zurich,
                    for the purpose of attending the lectures of Bullinger, and after that to
                    Geneva, where he enjoyed for a short time the instructions of Beza. On his
                    return to Basel, Grynaeus, who had been greatly impressed by the character,
                    talents, industry, and great learning of the youth, and was desirous that the
                    services of one who promised to become a scholar of great distinction should be
                    secured to the university, procured him a situation as tutor in the family of
                    Leo Curio, son of Coelius Secundus Curio, so celebrated for his sufferings on
                    account of the Reformed faith. This arrangement exercised a decisive influence
                    upon the future life, public and private, of Buxtorf. At the instance of
                    Grynaeus, Buxtorf undertook the duties of the Hebrew chair in the university,
                    and discharged them for two years with such ability and acceptance, that at the
                    end of that time he was unanimously appointed to the vacant office. From this
                    date (1590) to his death in 1629, a period of thirty-nine years, Buxtorf
                    remained in Basel, and devoted himself to the study of Hebrew and rabbinical
                    literature with an energy and zeal that have rarely been paralleled in the
                    history of any scholar. He is said never to have devoted fewer than eight or ten
                    hours daily to study. Not satisfied with perusing the works of the rabbins, he
                    received into his own house many learned Jews, that he might discuss with them
                    the more difficult aud abstruse points treated of in the writings of their
                    countrymen. So great, indeed, became his reputation for profound and extensive
                    knowledge of rabbinical books, that he was frequently consulted by Jews
                    themselves on matters relating to their ceremonial law. Probably no Protestant
                    scholar ever possessed so complete a knowledge of the contents of the rabbinical
                    writings as Buxtorf, and he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n673/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0673-0602"/> seems to have well deserved the title which was
                    conferred upon him of “Master of the Rabbins.’' His partiality for Jewish
                    society exposed him, indeed, on one occasion to considerable annoyance. He had
                    received a Jew named Abraham into his house in order to assist him in the
                    editing of his great Rabbinical Bible. Abraham’s wife was confined of a boy,
                    whose circumcision, agreeably to Hebrew usage, had to take place on the eighth
                    day after birth, and it was nêcessary that at least two Jewish witnesses should
                    be present at the ceremony. Buxtorf obtained permission from the chief officer
                    of the town council to allow two Jews from a distance to assist on the occasion,
                    while he himself, his son-in-law, and two citizens of Basel, were also present.
                    This proceeding, however, gave great offence to the authorities of the city, the
                    laws against the Jews being at this time exceedingly stringent. The result was
                    that Buxtorf and his son-in-law were each fined 100 florins, the father of the
                    boy 400 florins, while the officer of the municipality and the two citizens were
                    punished with three days’ imprisonment. Notwithstanding this occurrence,
                    however, Buxtorf’s relations with the city of Basel were of a friendly kind. He
                    remained firmly attached to the university which first recognized his merits,
                    and declined two invitations which were offered him, from Leyden and Saumur
                    successively, to fill the Hebrew chair in these famous schools. His
                    correspondence with the most distinguished scholars of the day was very
                    extensive, and in the rich collection of letters preserved in the library of the
                    university of Basel, are contained materials for a literary history of the time
                    which it is hoped may be one day utilized.</p>
                <p>The works which Buxtorf published during his life are too numerous to be all
                    enumerated in this brief notice, and for a complete list of them the reader is
                    referred to the authorities cited at the close of the article. The following,
                    however, may be mentioned. In 1602 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Manuale
                    Hebraicum et Chaldaicum,</hi> which reached a seventh edition in the year 1658.
                    In the following year was published his <hi rend="italic">Synagoga</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Judaica,</hi> which appeared first in German and was afterwards
                    translated into Latin in an enlarged form, and which constitutes a valuable
                    repertory of information regarding the opinions and ceremonies of the Jews. In
                    1607 he published his <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi><hi rend="italic">Hebraicum
                    et Chaldaicum</hi><hi rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic">brevi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lexico Rabbinico</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophico,</hi> which
                    was reprinted at Glasgow so recently as 1824. In 1618 there appeared in two
                    folio volumes his great <hi rend="italic">Rabbinical Bible,</hi> containing, in
                    addition to the Hebrew text, the Chaldee Paraphrases or Targums, which he
                    punctuated after the analogy of the Chaldee passages in Ezra and Daniel (a
                    proceeding which has been condemned by Richard Simon and others), and the
                    Commentaries of the more celebrated Rabbins, with various other treatises. Of
                    this work it may be said that Rosenmuller’s judgment will approve itself to most
                    Hebrew scholars,—that “this edition is indispensable to every one who desires
                    thoroughly to study the criticism and exposition of the Old
                    Testament.”—(Rosenmuller, <hi rend="italic">Handbuch für</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >die</hi><hi rend="italic">Literatur der Biblischen Kritik und Exegese,</hi>
                    vol. i. p. 259). The Bible was followed by his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tiberias,</hi><hi rend="italic">sive Commentarius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Masoreticus,</hi> so named from the great school of Jewish criticism which had
                    its seat in the town of Tiberias. It was in this work that Buxtorf controverted
                    the views of Elias Levita regarding the late origin of the Hebrew vowel points,
                    a subject which gave rise to the. famous controversy between Cappellus and his
                    son John Buxtorf, which will be referred to in the following article. Buxtorf
                    did not live to complete the two works on which his reputation chiefly rests,
                    viz., his great <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Chaldaicum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Talmudicum,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Rabbinicum,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Concordantioe
                    Bibliorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Hebraicorum,</hi> both of which were edited by
                    his son. They are monuments of untiring, labour and industry, and possess an
                    enduring value. The former work has been recently (1869) republished at Leipsic
                    with some additions by Bernard Fischer, Ph.D., and the latter was assumed by
                    Fürst as the basis of his great Hebrew concordance, which appeared in 1840. For
