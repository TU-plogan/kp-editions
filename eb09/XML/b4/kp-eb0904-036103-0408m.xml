                    their behaviour towards hydrogen, uniting with it atom for atom, forming,
                    gaseous condensible acid compounds, which are all produced by similar reactions,
                    and which yield in combination with metals crystals of uniform structure.
                    Bromine was discovered in 1826 by Balard, who extracted it from the water of the
                    Mediterranean during his researches in connection with the sea-water. At
                    ordinary temperatures it is a deep brownish-red liquid, emitting a strong
                    disagreeable odour (whence its name, from <hi rend="italic">βpωμoς,</hi> a
                    stink), having a specific gravity of 2 ’ 96, freezing into a red-brown
                    crystalline mas3 at - 24 ’ 5° C., and boiling at 63° C. Its combining equivalent
                    or atomic weight is 80. Bromine is an element of great chemical activity, and of
                    the highest interest in scientific chemistry on account of its combinations, and
                    especially on account of the products of its substitution for hydrogen in
                    organic compounds.</p>
                <p>Although very widely disseminated, since it is found in ocean water, bromine is
                    nowhere an abundant element. It is a constituent of some silver ores from Mexico
                    and South America; it is very generally found in strong saline springs, as well
                    as associated with deposits of salt; and it is present in many marine plants.
                    The waters of the Atlantic, according to Von Bibra, contain 24 grains per
                    gallon; while Here-path’s analysis gives Dead Sea water a strength of 121*5
                    grains per gallon. It is only from the waters of certain saline springs in
                    America that bromine is prepared as a direct product. At several places in
                    western Pennsylvania and West Virginia the manufacture is carried on
                    extensively, 125,000 lb having been extracted in 1870. In Europe bromine is only
                    obtained as a secondary product of the preparation of potash and other alkaline
                    salts, its chief source being the mother-liquors of the kelp manufacture, brine
                    springs, and especially the Stassfurth saline deposits, near Magdeburg, Prussia.
                    The produce at Stassfurth in 1873 amounted to about 10,000 lb; and it is
                    estimated that the yield of English and French works was, taken together, about
                    the same.</p>
                <p>On the commercial scale bromine is prepared at Stassfurth from the liquids which
                    have been exhausted of all their crystallizable soda and potash salts, and from
                    which also a deposit of chloride of magnesium has been obtained. This final
                    mother-liquor is found to contain from 0 ’ 3 to 0 ’ 5 per cent, of bromine, in
                    the form of bromide of potassium. To separate the bromine the liquor is
                    introduced into a sandstone apparatus similar to that used for the evolution of
                    chlorine from common salt,—the process and reaction being similar in both cases.
                    In this it is mixed with black oxide of manganese and sulphuric acid in definite
                    proportions, and heated by a current of steam. The red vapour of bromine is
                    given off and led by a pipe into a condensing worm of earthenware, and received
                    into a series of three Woulfe’s bottles, the first of which contains water, and
                    the others alkaline ley and iron filings. The reaction which takes place is thus
                    represented—</p>
                <p>2KBr + MnO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 3H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi></p>
                <p>= 2KHSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + MnSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 2 H
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O + 2Br,</p>
                <p>-—sulphates of potash and manganese, water, and free bromine being produced from
                    bromide of potassium, manganese dioxide, and sulphuric acid. Pure bromine vapour
                    distils over at first, but as the distillation proceeds chlorine is gradually
                    evolved, and from this the bromine may be freed by shaking up with a solution of
                    bromide of potassium, which yields up its bromine to combine with chlorine. On
                    account of its peculiarly irritating action on the organs of respiration, very
                    great precautions have to be taken to protect workmen from the fumes of bromine,
                    and it is indispensable that those engaged in the industry should abstain from
                    all alcoholic liquors.</p>
                <p>The chief industrial application of bromine and its compounds is in medicine, for
                    which it is used in the form of bromide of potassium, bromide of ammonium, and
                    bromide of sodium, besides in various combinations with alkaloids and organic
                    substances. It is, however, most largely employed as bromide of potassium, a
                    salt prepared on the large scale by the decomposition of potassium carbonate by
                    the bromide of iron. It is also prepared by passing the vapour of bromine into a
                    solution of caustic potash, when a mixture of bromide and bromate of potassium
                    is produced. The mixed salts are reduced to a uniform bromide by burning with
                    coal dust. Bromide of silver is employed to some extent in photography, and,
                    according to the experiments of Vogel, it possesses a peculiar sensitiveness for
                    the red, green, and yellow colours, which are not acted on by other photographic
                    agents. During the American Civil War (1861-5) bromine came into use as a
                    disinfectant in military hospitals, a purpose to which it was also applied in
                    the Franco-German War in 1870-1. For such purposes it was found to possess
                    several advantages over chlorine, which, however, has the recommendation of
                    cheapness and abundance. It has long been hoped that bromine might be
                    substituted for iodine in the preparation of the several coal-tar colours, but
                    hitherto the attempts in that direction have not been successful. Eosine, a
                    tetrabromated potassium salt, is the only dye into which bromine at present
                    enters. The use of bromine has been suggested by Dr Rudolf Wagner in several
                    metallurgical operations, in which he anticipates it might be of great service.
                    He proposes, in place of the present wasteful method of reducing mercury from
                    cinnabar, to digest the ere in an aqueous solution of bromine, whereby a bromide
                    of mercury would be formed. He also suggests that bromine might be
                    advantageously applied to the extraction of gold from poor auriferous ore, in a
                    manner analogous to Plattner’s chlorination process. Further, it is recom <pb

                    of a bromide; and it is thought that bromine vapour might be used with advantage
                    for toughening brittle gold.</p>
