                    Bossuet and Madeleine Mochette. The family of which he came, though of bourgeois
                    rank, had long taken an honourable part in the public and official life of
                    Burgundy. He was destined from infancy for the church, and grew up amid
                    influences eminently favourable to the unfolding of his powers, for, although at
                    six years of age, on his father’s appointment to be president in the parliament
                    of Metz, he was left at Dijon, yet his education had been wisely confided to an
                    uncle, Claude Bossuet, a large-hearted man, ardently devoted to literature,
                    whose delight it was to foster his nephew’s intellectual gifts. These soon gave
                    token of exceptional brilliancy, and in the Jesuits’ College, where he went to
                    school, he distanced all competitors in the facility with which he mastered the
                    Greek and Latin classics, Virgil and Homer being his especial favourites, for
                    whose writings he contracted an unalterable attachment, just as Horace became
                    the life-long companion of his rival Eénélon. It was from a higher source,
                    however, that Bossuet’s genius, which was essentially of the Hebrew type, caught
                    its finest inspiration; and one day reading a Bible left open by accident at the
                    prophecies of Isaiah, he was so thrilled by their poetry that thenceforth he
                    became virtually “a man of one book,” and in Holy Scripture, read and re-read
                    until learned ultimately almost by heart, he found the field in which his mind
                    could best expatiate and gather light and power. In Bossuet, says Lamartine, the
                    Bible was transfused into a man. With that keen-sighted appreciation of talent
                    which they uniformly display, the Jesuits sought to enlist him in their order,
                    but family influence being against the proposal, in 1642 he was sent to Paris;
                    nor could the circumstances of his arrival there fail profoundly to impress the
                    fervid imagination of the boy, for it chanced to be on the very day on which
                    Richelieu, then near his end, was borne into the city in a splendid movable
                    chamber, at the close of the vengeance-taking campaign, which terminated in the
                    execution of De Thou. Bossuet entered the college of Navarre, the oldest in the
                    University, where, under Nicholas Cornet, the presiding genius of the place, and
                    in midst of the intellectual quickening imparted to it in common with the whole
                    of learned Europe by the new philosophy of Descartes, he achieved distinction in
                    every department except mathematics, for which he seems to have possessed
                    neither the taste nor the faculty. At sixteen his attainments were the talk of
                    the town. He became the pet of the lettered aristocracy of Paris, and it argues
                    his strength of character that he was unspoiled by their caresses. The applause
                    which greeted the delivery of his thesis for the bachelor’s degree encouraged
                    him to perfect his superb oratorical gifts, nor did he count it unlawful then to
                    be a frequent spectator when the <hi rend="italic">chefs-d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">oeuvres</hi> of Corneille were played,
                    although, later, he was not sparing in his criticism of the stage. At
                    twenty-four he was appointed archdeacon of Metz. In Lent 1652, after a season of
                    retreat at St Lazare, he received priest’s orders, and immediately quitted the
                    gay capital, and the career already opening to him there, to fulfil the duties
                    awaiting him in the comparative obscurity of the provinces. Six years were spent
                    in unwearied pastoral activity, as well as in exhaustive private study of
                    Scripture and of the Fathers, notably St Augustine, although even in the less
                    read Patristic writings he was at home, and quickly put his knowledge to use in
                    a work of controversy, entitled <hi rend="italic">Refutation</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Catéchisme</hi><hi rend="italic">de Paul Ferry,</hi> a
                    Protestant minister of Metz. It is of interest principally because it outlines
                    even at that early date the doctrine afterwards vigorously defended by Bossuet
                    of the limited authority of the popes in matters of faith. The echo of his
                    pulpit eloquence had already begun to reach beyond Lorraine; during a short
                    residence at Metz it fascinated Anne of Austria, the Queen Mother, and for the
                    next ten years (1659-69) he was in perpetual request in the metropolis. Wherever
                    he appeared court and city flocked to listen; the queens went from the palace
                    and the nuns of Port Royal from their seclusion; Condé, Turenne, Madame de
                    Sevigné, and other famous contemporaries mingled with the crowd; while, in 1662,
                    the preacher’s triumph reached a climax, when after hearing him for the first
                    time at the Louvre, Louis XIV., in a moment of rarely awakened enthusiasm,
                    despatched a royal message to Bossuet’s father—“pour le feliciter d’avoir un tel
                    fils.”</p>
                <p>According to Lachet, these matchless discourses may be classified as belonging to
                    three periods:—that of Metz, showing a considerable measure of crudeness both of
                    thought and expression; that of Paris, distinguished by strength and splendour
                    (for, as Sainte-Beuve observes, every trace of immaturity or questionable taste
                    disappears from the moment when Bossuet enters the circle of the king’s
                    influence); and that of Meaux, in which faultless grace of composition is
                    purchased at the expense of vigour. On ordinary occasions, and for an audience
                    that loved the practical truths of religion marshalled with logical force and
                    distinctness, Bourdaloue was, perhaps, equally attractive as a preacher—there is
                    even more contemporary talk about him; but in the <hi rend="italic">Oraisons
                    Funèbres</hi> Bossuet is unapproachable. In this species of oratory Mascaron and
                    Flechier had preceded him, but he is the veritable creator of it, and nowhere
                    does his genius take such wing as at the grave’s mouth, when, recounting the
                    virtues of the illustrious dead, he pictures, with wonderful sweep of
                    imagination and mastery of detail, the historical events and personages of the
                    epoch in which they lived, the more impressively to demonstrate that all earthly
                    pomp and renown “are shadows, not substantial things.” Not that he altogether
                    escapes the vice of the French pulpit of that age, for occasionally he does
                    elevate into types of excellence those who fell far short of it; but, as
                    compared with other offenders, the adulation which he offers is, even in the
                    hearing of royalty, measured and temperate. His funeral orations at the death of
                    Henrietta of England, of her daughter, the duchess of Orleans, and of the great
                    Condé, are commonly deemed his finest efforts of the kind.</p>
                <p>In 1669 Bossuet was appointed to the diocese of Condom, and in the year following
                    he became preceptor to the Dauphin; but being unable, in conscience, to retain
                    both offices he resigned the former, and, in consideration of the pecuniary
                    sacrifice involved, obtained the revenues of the Abbey of St Lucien at Beauvais.
                    Convinced that on the culture of the Dauphin might depend the future welfare of
                    the French people, he threw himself with incredible energy into the novel duties
                    of the preceptorship, and resumed his own education the better to educate his
                    august but indolent pupil. He lacked that sweetness of nature, however, which
                    afterwards gave to Fénélon such sway over the Dauphin’s son. For the edification
                    of his royal charge Bossuet wrote several able works, such as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n80/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0080-0071"/><hi rend="italic">L'Histoire abrégée de la France;
                    La Politique sacrée; Traité de la connaissance de Dieu et de soimême;</hi> and
                    most celebrated of aL. <hi rend="italic">Le Discours sur l'histoire
                    universelle.</hi> This work, originally meant to be a mere abridgment for use in
                    tne royal schoolroom, grew as he wrote into a magnificent historical narrative.
                    It consists of three parts :— (1), a sketch of history from Genesis to the birth
                    of the modern world under Charlemagne; (2), an account of the Mosaic and
                    Christian economies; (3), a series of reflections on tho vicissitudes of human
                    government,—the whole being characterized by splendour of colouring and vast
                    range of plan, although this latter feature is less striking in iate editions
                    than in the earliest, which was not broken up into chapters. In the composition
                    of it Leibnitz greatly helped him, by forwarding from Germany every book bearing
                    on the subject on which he could lay hands. Its central thought is that of all
                    changes in history being overruled with sole reference to the progress and
                    universality of true religion; but Bossuet’s treatment of this theme,
                    notwithstanding a host of striking and unchallengeable observations, is vitiated
                    by his identification of the Christian faith exclusively with the Papal form of
                    it, and by the way in which he ignores the place and value of pagan antiquity in
                    the world’s development, so as to invite, if not to justify, the sneer of
                    Voltaire: “Il parait avoir écrit uniquement pour insinuer que tout a été fait
                    dans le monde pour la nation juive.’'</p>
                <p>It was not until the close of 1679 that Bossuet’s official duties as preceptor
                    came to an end, but in the interval his industry otherwise did not slacken. He
                    was elected a member of the Academy of France in 1671. About this time, too, he
                    gave to the world the most frequently revised, most bitterly attacked, and most
                    widely translated of all his books, <hi rend="italic">L’Exposition</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la doctrine</hi><hi rend="italic">catholique.</hi> Composed in
                    1669, and originally circulated in manuscript, it had been credited with
                    effecting in this shape not a few conversions, among others that of Turenne. But
                    Jean Daillé and other Reformers having charged it with toning down the harshness
                    of Roman dogma with the purpose of ensnaring their flocks, Bossuet resolved to
                    publish it. The book created a wide-spread flutter of excitement, as may be
                    inferred from the terms employed in speaking of it by Jurieu, perhaps the ablest
                    of Bossuet’s opponents,—“Everybody is gone mad over the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exposition;</hi> everywhere one hears of the most disgraceful perversions.” It
                    twice received the <hi rend="italic">imprimatur</hi> of the Pope in despite of
                    the author’s undisguised opinions with respect to infallibility. Curiously
                    enough, it was this treatise that brought about in 1678 the conference between
                    Bossuet and Claude, the learned pastor of Charenton. Floquet informs us that
                    wherever he could obtain a face to face encounter, Bossuet preferred it to
                    controversial writing. On the present occasion the discussion lasted five hours,
                    turning on the authority of the church, with what result is, perhaps, not
                    unfairly described by Bayle in the pithy remark—“That as at the battle of
                    Seneff, both sides claimed the victory.”</p>
                <p>During the latter years of the preceptorship Bossuet, with a few genial
                    associates, busied himself with <hi rend="italic">Notes and Annotations of the
                    Books of Scripture.</hi> Many pleasant hours were spent in these round-table
                    stud⅛s, and it is proof of his inexhaustible energy that he did not hesitate,
                    even so late in life, to acquire a knowledge of Hebrew, though there may be a
                    touch of exaggeration in what was said of him by an admirer,—“that he was not
                    less familiar with the language of Moses than with that of Homer.” His life at
                    court was not without its shadows. His very position involved him unwillingly in
                    the miserable transactions springing out of the unhallowed relation in which the
                    king stood to his successive favourites. But Bossuet never forgot the bishop in
                    the courtier. He remonstrated often and seriously with the profligate Louis. As
                    spiritual adviser of the beautiful but unhappy La Valliere, his Christian
                    gentleness and wisdom shine out conspicuously in the interviews and
                    correspondence which issued in her retirement to the convent of the Carmelites.
                    If, in the case of Madame de Montespan, his actions are more open to
                    misconstruction, yet further investigation tends towards his acquittal of the
                    charges advanced by various historians.</p>
                <p>Appointed in 1681 to the bishopric of Meaux, Bossuet had scarcely been installed
                    when he was summoned to take part in the memorable assembly of the French clergy
                    with which his name will always be associated. This council was convoked by
                    royal edict, at the instance of the clergy themselves, for the purpose of
                    finding a way out of the conflict, yearly growing fiercer, between Louis and
                    Rome. The strife arose about the <hi rend="italic">regalia,</hi> or claim of the
                    Crown to administer the affairs of a vacant see until such time as its new
                    occupant should take the oath of fidelity. But in the course of its discussions
                    the council was agitated by questions far wider than that in which it took its
                    rise, and embracing eventually the whole subject of the extent and limits of
                    Papal authority. Bossuet preached the opening sermon. He gave fearless utterance
                    to his cherished opinions. Referring to the aggressive disposition of the Papacy
                    he declared—“Ocean itself, immense though it is, has its limits, and to break
                    through at its own caprice would be to lay desolate the world.” At the same
                    time, seeing the heated state of the public mind, he counselled moderation,
                    occupying a middle place between Ultramontanists and ultra-Gallicans, and was
                    even opposed to any formal declaration of the Gallican position. Being overruled
                    in this chiefly through the influence of Harlay, archbishop of Paris, he next
                    directed his efforts towards issuing the assembly’s decision in the most
                    temperate and conciliatory form. He was himself appointed to draw it up, and
                    there resulted the famous four articles which were in substance these :—I. The
                    civil authority is not subject to the ecclesiastical in temporal things; II. As
                    decreed by the Council of Constance, a general council is superior to the Pope;
                    III. The exercise of the apostolic power ought to be tempered by the usage of
                    particular churches; IV. Except with the consent of the church the judgment of
                    the Pope is not unalterable in matters of faith. Being virulently attacked,
                    these propositions were defended by Bossuet in his great <hi rend="italic"
                    >Defense de la doctrine</hi><hi rend="italic">du clergé</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    France,</hi> which, however, was not printed until 1735.</p>
                <p>Bossuet applauded the shameful revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685), but his
                    English biographer reminds us that, stern as was his character, he did his
                    utmost to secure to Protestants as much liberty as was possible under the
                    existing law; and, further, that no military execution took place during his
                    episcopate at Meaux.</p>
                <p>In 1688 there appeared <hi rend="italic">L'Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Variations des</hi><hi rend="italic">Eglises Protestantes,</hi> a review and
                    analysis, in fifteen books, of the confessions of faith emitted by Protestant
                    churches during the epoch of the Reformation, in which Bossuet aims at
                    demonstrating their incoherency and self-contradiction, even on cardinal points,
                    as contrasted with the doctrinal stability of Rome. Forcible and learned as it
                    undoubtedly is, this work is grievously lacking in candour, and in the paramount
                    love of truth, the treatment of Luther and his writings being especially
                    unscrupulous and vindictive. Indeed, from first to last, it is executed in the
                    spirit less of an upright judge than of an unprincipled partisan. These less
                    attractive features of Bossuet’s character, over which one would gladly throw
                    the veil, became still more prominent when in 1689 there broke out the bitter
                    quarrel on the subject of “Quietism,” the melancholy and fluctuating history of
                    which may be best embraced <pb break="no"

                    alike unjust and ungenerous, has left an indelible stain upon his otherwise
                    brilliant reputation, while the man for whose condemnation he resorted to
                    violence and intrigue conducted himself with the meekness and charity of a
                    saint. Attacked by a painful disorder, of which the premonitory symptoms
                    appeared in 1696, the venerable prelate lingered on until the 12th of April
                    1704, when he died at Paris in his 77th year, amid the tokens of universal
                    regret.</p>
                <p>Of unrivalled eloquence and consummate learning, an intrepid controversialist and
                    defender of the faith, as well as the most conscientious and diligent of
                    bishops, he will probably be remembered longest as the champion of the ancient
                    rights and liberties of the Gallican Church, and the representative of a phase
                    of Catholicism which the Vatican council has for ever banished from within the
                    Roman pale.</p>
