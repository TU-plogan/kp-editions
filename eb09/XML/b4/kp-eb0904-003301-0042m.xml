                    between Charles Martel and Radbod, king of the Frisians. Despite the wishes of
                    his brethren, who desired to make him their abbot, he again set out in 718,
                    visited Rome, and was commissioned by Gregory II. to preach to the pagans of
                    Germany. For five years he laboured in Thuringia, Hessia, and Friesland, and
                    then returned to Rome to report his success. He again set out for Germany, and,
                    armed with full powers from the Pope, baptized thousands of the heathen, and
                    brought back to the Church of Rome many Christians who had in a measure
                    separated themselves from the fold. After another visit to Rome in 738 he
                    proceeded to Bavaria, and founded there the bishoprics of Salzburg, Regensburg
                    (Ratisbon), Freisingen, and Passau. He then resumed his labours in Germany,
                    where he erected the. districts of Würzburg, Erfurt, and Burburg into
                    bishoprics. He also organized provincial synods in the Frankish Church, and
                    obtained great influence over the king, Pepin, whom he crowned at Soissons.
                    Boniface had been created a bishop by Gregory IL, and after the deposition of
                    the bishop of Mainz in 745, that bishopric was converted into a metropolis and
                    conferred upon him, much against his own inclinations. He had never relinquished
                    his hope of converting the Frisians, and iu 755 he set out with a small retinue
                    for Friesland. He baptized a great number, and summoned a general meeting for
                    confirmation at a place not far from Dokkum, between Franeker and Groningen.
                    Instead of his converts, however, there appeared a mob of armed pagans, who fell
                    upon the aged archbishop and slew him. His remains were finally deposited in the
                    famous abbey of Fulda, founded by himself.</p>
