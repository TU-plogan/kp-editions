                    Vicomte de,</hi> philosopher and politician, was born at Monna, near Milhaud, in
                    Rouergue, France, on the 2d October 1754. He served for some years in the king’s
                    musketeers, and after his marriage was made mayor of his native place.
                    Dissatisfied with the revolutionary principles then being acted upon, he
                    emigrated in 1791, and joined the army of the Prince of Condé. Soon afterwards
                    he settled, with his family, at Heidelberg, where he wrote his first important
                    work, <hi rend="italic">Théorie du pouvoir</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >politique</hi><hi rend="italic">et religieux dans la Société civile,</hi> 3
                    vols., 1790, in which his conservatism and reactionary views are fully expounded
                    and illustrated. In this work, too, he predicted the certain return of the
                    Bourbons to France. The book was condemned by the Directory, and in Franco very
                    few copies escaped detection. Naturally, on his return to his native country, Μ.
                    de Bonald found himself an object of suspicion, and was obliged to live in
                    retirement. He still continued to publish works of the same tendencies,— his <hi

                    In 1806 he was associated with Chateaubriand and Fiévée in the conduct of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mercure de France;</hi> and two years later, after great
                    persuasion, he allowed himself to be appointed councillor of the Imperial
                    University, which he had often attacked. After the Restoration he was made
                    member of the Council of Public Instruction, and from 1815 to 1822 he sat in the
                    chamber as deputy. His speeches and votes were invariably on the extreme
                    Conservative side; he even advocated a literary censorship. In 1822 he was made
                    minister of state, and presided over the commission in whose hands the
                    censorship rested. In the following year he was raised to the rank of peer, a
                    dignity which he lost through refusing to take the oath in 1830. From 1816
                    onwards he had been a member of the Academy. He took no part in public affairs
                    after 1830, but retired to his country-seat at Monna, where he died on the 23d
                    November 1840.</p>
                <p>Bonald was one of the most able and vigorous writers of the theocratic or
                    reactionary school, which comprehended among its numbers such men as De Maistre,
                    De Lamennais, Ballanche, and D’Eckstein. The great bulk of his writings belong
                    to the department of social or political philosophy; but all the results at
                    which he arrives are deductions from a few principles. The one truth which to
                    him seemed, in fact, all-comprehensive was the divine origin of language. In his
                    own somewhat enigmatic expression, <hi rend="italic">L’homme pense sa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">parole</hi><hi rend="italic">avant de parler sa pensée,</hi> words
                    and thoughts are inextricably linked together; the first language contained the
                    essence of all truth. From this premise he draws his proof for the existence of
                    God, and for the divine origin and consequent supreme authority of the Holy
                    Scriptures. The infallibility of the church as the exponent of spiritual truth
                    readily follows. While this thought lies at the root of all his speculations
                    there is a formula of constant and significant application. All relations are by
                    him reduced to the triad of cause, means, and effect, which he sees constantly
                    repeated throughout all nature. Thus, in the universe there are the first cause
                    as mover, movement as the means, and bodies as the result; in the state we have
                    power as the cause, ministers as the means, and subjects as the effects; in the
                    family we have the same relation exemplified by father, mother, and children. It
                    is also to be remarked that these three terms bear specific relations to one
                    another, the first is to the second as the second is to the third. Thus, in the
                    great triad of the religious world,—God, the Mediator, and Man,—God is to the
                    GodMan as the God-Man is to Man. It will be readily apparent how Bonald was able
                    from these principles to construct a complete system of political absolutism,
                    for the sufficiency of which only two things were wanted,—well-grounded premises
                    instead of baseless hypotheses, and the harmony of the scheme with the wills of
                    those who were to be subjected to it. Bonald’s style is remarkably fine; ornate,
                    but pure and vigorous. Many fruitful thoughts are scattered among his works,
                    which have been popular with a certain party; but his system scarcely deserves
                    the name of a philosophy.</p>
                <p>Besides the above-mentioned works, Bonald published <hi rend="italic">Recherches
                    Philosophiques sur les premiers objets de Connaissances Morales,</hi> 2 vols.,

                    collected edition appeared in 12 vols., 1817-19; the latest is that in 3 vols.,
                    with introductory notice by the Abbé Migne. See <hi rend="italic">Notice</hi><hi
