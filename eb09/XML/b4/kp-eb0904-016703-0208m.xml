                    security of the cargo alone, it is said to be taken up at <hi rend="italic"
                    >respondentia;</hi> but it is now only in rare and exceptional cases that it
                    could be competent to the ship-master to pledge the cargo, except under a
                    general bottomry obligation, along with the ship and freight. In consideration
                    of the risks assumed by the lender, the bottomry premium (sometimes termed <hi
                    rend="italic">maritime interest')</hi> is usually high, varying of course with
                    the nature of the risk and the difficulty of procuring funds.</p>
                <p>A bottomry contract may be written out in any form which sufficiently shows the
                    conditions agreed on between the parties; but it is usually drawn up in the form
                    of a <hi rend="italic">bond.</hi> The document must show, either by express
                    terms or from its general tenor, that the risk of loss is assumed by the
                    lender,—this being the consideration for which the high premium is conceded. The
                    lender may transfer the bond by endorsation, in the same manner as a bill of
                    exchange or bill of lading, and the right to recover its value becomes vested in
                    the indorsees.</p>
                <p>According to the law of this country, a bottomry contract remains in force so
                    long as the ship exists <hi rend="italic">in the form of a ship,</hi> whatever
                    amount of damage she may have sustained. Consequently, the “constructive total
                    loss” which is recognized in marine insurance, when the ship is damaged to such
                    an extent that she is not worth repairing, is not recognized in reference to
                    bottomry, and will not absolve the borrower from his obligation. But if the ship
                    go to pieces, the borrower is freed from all liability under the bottomry
                    contract; and the lender is not entitled to receive any share of the proceeds of
                    such of the ship’s stores or materials as may have been saved from the wreck.
                    Money advanced on bottomry is not liable in England for general average
                    losses.</p>
                <p>If the ship should <hi rend="italic">deviate</hi> from the voyage for which the
                    funds were advanced, her subsequent loss will not discharge the obligation of
                    the borrower under the bottomry contract. If she should not proceed at all on
                    her intended voyage, the lender is not entitled to recover the bottomry premium
                    in addition to his advance, but only the ordinary rate of interest for the
                    temporary loan. As the bottomry premium is presumed, in every case, to cover the
                    risks incurred by the lender, he is not entitled to charge the borrower with the
                    premium which he may pay for <hi rend="italic">insurance of</hi> the sum
                    advanced, in addition to that stipulated in the bond.</p>
                <p>The contract of bottomry seems to have arisen from the custom of permitting the
                    master of a ship, when in a foreign country, to pledge the ship in order to
                    raise money for repairs, or other extraordinary expenditures rendered necessary
                    in the course of the voyage. Circumstances often arise, in which, without the
                    exercise of this power on the part of the master, it would be impossible to
                    provide means for accomplishing the voyage; and it is better that the master
                    should have authority to burden the ship, and, if necessary, the freight and
                    cargo also, in security for the money which has become requisite, than that the
                    adventure should be defeated by inability to proceed. But the right of the
                    master to pledge the ship or goods must always be created by necessity; if
                    exercised without necessity the contract will be void. Accordingly, the master
                    of a British ship has no power to grant a bottomry bond at a British port, or at
                    any foreign port where he might raise funds on the personal credit of the
                    shipowners. Neither has he any power to pledge the ship or goods for private
                    debts of his own, but only for such supplies as are indispensable for the
                    purposes of the voyage. And in all cases he ought, if possible, to communicate
                    with the owners of the ship, and with the proprietor of the cargo before
                    pledging their property. Facility of communication, by telegraph and otherwise,
                    has of late years given additional stringency to this rule.</p>
                <p>The bottomry lender must use reasonable diligence to ascertain that a real
                    necessity exists for the loan; but he is not bound to see to the application of
                    the money advanced. If the lender has originally advanced the funds on the
                    personal credit of the owner he is not entitled to require a bottomry
                    obligation. A bond procured from the shipmaster by improper compulsion would be
                    void.</p>
                <p>The power of the master to pledge the cargo depends upon there being some
                    reasonable prospect of benefit to it by his so doing. He has no such power
                    except in virtue of circumstances which may oblige him to assume the character
                    of <hi rend="italic">agent for the cargo,</hi> in the absence of any other party
                    authorized to act on its behalf. Under ordinary circumstances he is not at
                    liberty to pledge the cargo for repairs to the ship. If indeed the goods be of a
                    perishable nature, and if it be impossible to get the ship repaired in
                    sufficient time to obviate serious loss on them by delay, without including them
                    under the bottomry contract, he has power to do so, because it may fairly be
                    assumed, in the case supposed, that the cargo will be 1 enefited by this
                    procedure. The general principle is, that the master must act for the cargo,
                    with a reasonable view to the interests of its proprietors, under the whole
                    circumstances of the case. When he does this his proceedings will be sustained;
                    but should he manifestly prejudice the interests of the cargo by including it
                    under bottomry for the mere purpose (if relieving the ship, or of earning the
                    freight, the owners of the cargo will not be bound by the bottomry contract. Any
                    bottomry or respondentia bond may be good in part or bad in part, according as
                    the master may have acted <hi rend="italic">xoithin</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >beyond</hi> the scope of his legitimate authority in granting it. If two or
                    more bottomry bonds have been granted at different stages of the voyage, and the
                    value of the property be insufficient to discharge them all, the last dated bond
                    has the priority of payment, as having furnished the means of preserving the
                    ship, and thereby preventing the total loss of the security for the previous
                    bonds.</p>
                <p>When the sum due under a bottomry bond over ship, freight, and cargo is not paid
                    at the stipulated time, proceedings may be taken by the bondholder for recovery
                    of the freight and for the sale of the ship; and should the proceeds of these be
                    insufficient to discharge the claim, a judicial sale of the cargo may be
                    resorted to. As a general rule the value of the ship and freight must be
                    exhausted before recourse can be takςn against the cargo. A bottomry bond gives
                    no remedy to the lenders against the owners of the ship or cargo personally. The
                    whole liability under it may be met by the surrender of the property pledged,
                    whether the value so surrendered covers the amount of the bond or not. But the
                    owners of the ship, though not liable to the bondholder for more than the value
                    of the ship and freight, may be further liable to the proprietors of the cargo
                    for any sum in excess of the cargo’s proper share of the expenses, taken by the
                    bondholder out of the proceeds of the cargo to satisfy the bond after the ship
                    and freight have been exhausted.</p>
                <p>The bottomry premium must be ultimately paid by the parties for whose benefit the
                    advances were obtained, as ascertained on the final adjustment of the average
                    expenditures at the port of destination.</p>
