                    20, 1632. At the age of sixteen he entered the Society of Jesus, of which he was
                    destined to become one of the greatest ornaments, and there completed his
                    studies. His able masters, who early discerned his talents, successively
                    confided to him the chairs of humanity, of rhetoric, of philosophy, and of moral
                    theology; and it was only after passing through these different probationary
                    employments that he arrived at the eminent post which was designed for him, and
                    was deemed qualified for mounting the pulpit.</p>
                <p>In order to form an idea of the difficulties which he had to surmount, and of the
                    talents which he displayed, it is only necessary, on the one hand, to call to
                    mind the ridiculous manner and inflated style of the preachers of that period;
                    and on the other, to figure the young Jesuit at issue with the bad taste as well
                    as the bad habits of the time,—combating at once the passions, the vices, the
                    weaknesses, and the errors of humanity, and overcoming his enemies, sometimes
                    with the arms of faith, and sometimes with those of reason.</p>
                <p>At first he preached for some time in the provinces, but his superiors afterwards
                    called him to Paris. This took place in 1669, at the most brilliant epoch of the
                    age of Louis XIV., when nothing was talked of but the victories of Turenne, the
                    festivities of Versailles, the masterpieces of Corneille and Racine, the
                    encouragement afforded to the arts, and the general impulse given to the human
                    mind. Bourdaloue suddenly appeared in the midst of these fascinations<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n216/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0216-0175"/>, and, far from diminishing their effects, the
                    severity of his ministry and the gravity of his eloquence served rather to
                    enchance their splendour. His first sermons met with prodigious success, and all
                    voices were raised in loud applause of the preacher. Madame de Sevigné, sharing
                    the universal enthusiasm, wrote to her daughter that “she had never heard
                    anything more beautiful, more noble, more astonishing, than the sermons of
                    Father Bourdaloue.” Louis XIV. also wished to hear him, and the new preacher was
                    in consequence sent to court, where he preached during Advent in 1670, and
                    during Lent in 1672; and he was afterwards called for the Lents of 1674,
                    1675,1680, and 1682, and for the Advents of 1684, 1689, and 1693. This was a
                    thing unheard of before, the same preacher being rarely called three times to
                    court. Bourdaloue, however, appeared there ten times, and was always received
                    with the same ardour. Louis XIV. said that “he loved better to hear the
                    repetitions of Bourdaloue than the novelties of any one ehe.” After the
                    revocation of the Edict of Nantes he was sent to Languedoc to preach to the
                    Protestants, and confirm the newly-converted in the Catholic faith; and in this
                    delicate mission he managed to reconcile the interests of his ministry with the
                    sacred rights of humanity. He preached at Montpellier in 1686 with the greatest
                    success, Catholics and Protestants being all equally eager to recognize in this
                    eloquent missionary the apostle of truth and of virtue.</p>
                <p>In the last years of his life Bourdaloue abandoned the pulpit, and devoted
                    himself to charitable assemblies, hospitals, and prisons, where his pathetic
                    discourses and conciliatory manners were very effective. He had the art of
                    adapting his style and his reasonings to the condition and he understanding of
                    those to whom he addressed either counsel or consolation. Simple with the
                    simple, erudite with the learned, and a dialectician with sophists and
                    disputants, he came off with honour in all the contests in which zeal for
                    religion, the duties of his station, and love of mankind led him to engage.
                    Equally relished by the great and by the commonalty, by men of piety, and by
                    people of the world, he exercised till his death in 1704 a sort of empire over
                    all minds; and this ascendency he owed as much to the gentleness of his manners
                    as to the force of his reasoning. “His conduct,” says one of his contemporaries,
                    “is the best answer that can be made to the <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Provinciales.”</hi> No consideration was ever capable of altering
                    his frankness or corrupting his probity.</p>
                <p>Bourdaloue may with justice be regarded as the reformer of the pulpit and the
                    founder of Christian eloquence among the French. That which distinguishes him
                    from other preachers is the force of his reasoning, and the solidity of his
                    proofs. Never did Christian orator infuse into his discourses more majesty,
                    dignity, energy, and grandeur. Like Corneille, he has been charged with
                    overlabouring his diction, aud accumulating idea upon idea with a needless
                    superfluity of illustration—of speaking more to the understandings than to the
                    hearts of his auditors, and sometimes enervating his eloquence with the too
                    frequent use of divisions and subdivisions. But even in subscribing to these
                    criticisms, which are to a certain extent well founded, it is impossible not to
                    admire the inexhaustible fecundity of his plans—the happy talent <hi
                    rend="italic">velut</hi><hi rend="italic">imperatoria virtus</hi> which he
                    possessed, of disposing his reasonings in the order best calculated to command
                    victory—the logical skill with which he excludes sophisms, contradictions, and
                    paradoxes—the art with which he lays the foundations of our duty in our
                    interest—and, finally, the inestimable secret of converting the details of
                    manners and habits into so many proofs of ’ ∣is subject. Parallels have often
                    been drawn between Bourdaloue and Massillon; but the talents of these great
                    pulpit orators lay in different directions, and they may, therefore, be more
                    fitly contrasted than compared. “Between Massillon and Bossuet,” says Lord
                    Brougham, whose judgment of Bossuet errs, however, on the side of severity,
                    (JKor⅛, vol. vii.), “and at a great distance certainly above the latter, stands
                    Bourdaloue, whom some have deemed Massillon’s superior, but of whom an
                    illustrious critic (D’Alembert, <hi rend="italic">Éloge</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Massillon)</hi> has more justly said that it was his greatest glory to have left
                    the supremacy cf Massillon still in dispute. It is certain that he displays a
                    fertility of resources, an exuberance of topics, whether for observation or
                    argument, not equalled by almost any other orator, sacred or profane.” If
                    Massillon is now read with a more lively interest, he owes that advantage to the
                    charms of his style rather than to the force of his reasoning. Among the critics
                    of the present day, the preference is unhesitatingly given to the rival of
                    Racine, to the painter of the heart, to the author of the discourse on the small
                    number of the elect; but if we consult the contemporaries of Massillon himself,
                    we shall find that they assign him only the second rank. According to them
                    Bourdaloue preached to the men of a vigorous and masculine age—Massillon to
                    those of a period remarkable for its effeminacy. Bourdaloue raised himself to
                    the level of the great truths of religion—Massillon conformed himself to the
                    weakness of the men with whom he lived. The bishop of Clermont will always be
                    read; but if the simple Jesuit could raise his commanding voice from the tomb,
                    and again roll forth a majestic stream of divine truth, the courtly accents of
                    his rival would no longer be heard, and the charms of his diction would be
                    forgotten. The first part of his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Passion,</hi> in
                    which he proves that the death of the Son of God is the triumph of His power,
                    has generally been considered as the great masterpiece of Christian eloquence.
                    Bossuet has said nothing stronger or more elevated. The second part, however, is
                    inferior to the first, though considered by itself alike beautiful and
                    convincing.</p>
                <p>The discourses of Bourdaloue have been described by a celebrated French critic as
                    embodying in them a complete course of theology. This is perhaps going a little
                    too far; but still their general merit is very great, and for nothing are they
                    more distinguished than their comprehensiveness. The diction of this great
                    preacher is always natural, clear, and correct, sometimes deficient in
                    animation, but without vacuity or languor, and generally relieved by
                    outbreakings of much force and originality.</p>
                <p>Two editions of Bourdaloue’s works were published at Paris by Père Bretonneau, a
                    Jesuit,—one in 16 vols. 8vo, 1707-34, and the other, from which the editions of
                    Rouen, Toulouse, and Amsterdam were afterwards printed, in 18 vols. 12mo,
                    1709-34. The Versailles edition appeared in 1812-13, in 16 vols. 8vo. It is much
                    inferior to the former. Of recent editions, the best are those of 1822-26, 17
                    vols. 8vo; of 1833-34; of 1840, 3 tom. 8vo; of 1847, 18 vols.; and of 1864, 4
                    vols. The <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi><hi rend="italic">inédites</hi><hi
