                <p><label type="entry">BOLIVIA</label></p>
                <p>THIS name was given in honour of Bolivar (see last article) to a state in South
                    America, formed in 1825 from the provinces of Upper Peru which formerly
                    constituted part of the vice-royalty of Buenos Ayres. The bulk of the country
                    extends from 10° to 23° S. lat., and from 58° to 71° W. long., and it is bounded
                    on the N. by Peru and Brazil, on the E. by Brazil and Paraguay, on the S. by the
                    Argentine Republic and Chili, and on the W. by the Pacific Ocean and Peru. The
                    greater part of Bolivia is a mountainous and elevated country, more particularly
                    at its western and central parts; but towards the east it becomes much less so,
                    and at length terminates in extensive plains, which are bounded on the east by
                    Brazil. From the Pacific coast the southern boundary of Bolivia runs along the
                    24th parallel of latitude (the limit decided by treaty with Chili in August
                    1866), to as far as the crest of the Andes; turning S. it follows the line of
                    the mountains to 26° 8. lat., in which parallel it crosses the plateau to the
                    inner Cordillera, along which it lies N.N.E. to the 22d parallel. This line of
                    latitude forms the boundary of territory which is certainly Bolivian, as far as
                    the River Paraguay; but Bolivia, in common with the Argentine Republic and
                    Paraguay, has claims on the unexplored territory of the Gran Chaco, which lies
                    south of this line, and between the rivers Pilcomayo and Paraguay. From 22° on
                    the River Paraguay, the frontier with Brazil was decided, by treaty of March
                    1867, to be a line following that river northward to the Bahia Negra in 20° 1Γ,
                    along the Negra to its termination, and thence through the midst of the lagoons
                    of Caceres, Mandioré, Gaiba, and Uberaba (lying immediately west of the Paraguay
                    River), to Corixa Grande; thence in a straight line to Boa Vista and the source
                    of the Verde; down that river to the Guapore, and along the latter to where the
                    Beni joins it in 10° 20' 8.; thence in a straight line towards the source of the
                    River Javary (in 7° 8.) The present Government of Bolivia appears inclined,
                    however, to repudiate this treaty, and to return to the older frontier, which
                    included the tributaries of the Amazons as far as 6° 28’ S. On the Peruvian or
                    western frontier the boundary follows a more or less northerly direction from
                    the mouth of the River Loa in Atacama, along the Cordillera, crossing Lake
                    Titicaca, and passing north thence to the line running from the Beni to the
                    Javary.</p>
                <p>Before the formation of the republic, Bolivia, or the former province of Charcas,
                    consisted of four great districts or “intendencias∕ ’ which were under the rule
                    of the viceroy of Rio de la Plata. These were—</p>
                <p>1. Santa Cruz, formed of the districts of its bishopric— Mojos, Chiquitos, Santa
                    Cruz, Valle Grande, Misque, and the special jurisdiction of its capital
                    Cochabamba;</p>
                <p>2. La Paz, consisting of the dioceses of its bishopric;</p>
                <p>3. Potosi, comprising Tarija, Chichas, Lipez, Atacama, Porco, and Chayanta;</p>
                <p>4. The province of La Plata, which embraced all remaining portions of the
                    archbishopric.</p>
                <p>At the present time the republic is divided politically into departments,
                    provinces, and cantons. The departments, which are named La Paz de Ayacucho,
                    Cochabamba, Potosí, Chuquisaca, Oruro, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Tarija, Beni,
                    and Atacama, have each one or two capital towns; the provinces and cantons have
                    also each its chief place. Each department has a governor, who stands in direct
                    communication with the Government; the subdivisions have their corregidors and
                    alcaldes, who are subject to the governor.</p>
                <p>The westerly departments of La Paz, Oruro, and Potosi are situated in the highest
                    regions of the plateau of Bolivia, and are more valuable on account of their
                    mineral riches than for their vegetable products, of which a coarse grass is
                    characteristic. The first consists of a series of high ranges and deep valleys,
                    in which the climate and production vary with the elevation; the second lies
                    also in the high table-land or Puna region; both are rich in veins of gold,
                    silver, and tin, but the mining of these has not yet been fully developed. The
                    third, Potosi, belongs entirely to the highest regions of Bolivia, and is bare
                    and dry, with a cold and rude but healthy climate; this is the greatest mining
                    region of the country.</p>
                <p>The central departments of Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, and Tarija lie partly on the
                    high plateau, partly on the lower slopes and plains eastward, and pass thus
                    through the whole series of changing climates and zones of production, from the
                    bare high land to the tropical regions of the low lands. The first is eminently
                    the granary of Bolivia and southern Peru, excelling in the cultivation of wheat;
                    the industries of woollen and cotton manufactures are also most highly developed
                    in the department, but its mines are not worked. Chuquisaca, of which only a
                    third part lies in the high land, is also a vegetable growing region, in which
                    wheat, barley, rice, peas, vines, and all sorts of vegetables are cultivated;
                    cattle and horses are also numerous. The forests of this department and of
                    Tarija, which slope down to the wooded and pastoral plains of the tributaries of
                    the Paraguay, afford many species of valuable timber.</p>
                <p>The departments of Beni (or Veni) and Santa Cruz de la Sierra lie altogether in
                    the low lands of the east, stretching to the Rio Maderia and the Paraguay. The
                    former is as yet little explored, but is a land of tropical forests, rivers, and
                    swamps, with an unhealthy climate. Santa Cruz is also characterized by a hot,
                    damp atmosphere, but produces garden and field fruits in astonishing
                    richness,—coffee, cocoa, vanilla, sugar-cane, maize, and cotton. The forests of
                    both of these departments afford an infinity of valuable <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n20/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0020-0011"/> timber trees, and in the latter there is much
                    pasture land well fitted for cattle breeding</p>
                <p>The department of Atacama, which belongs geographically either to Peru or Chili,
                    forms the only part of Bolivia which comes into contact with the ocean, and is
                    situated between the Andes and the Pacific coast. It is almost entirely desert
                    and sterile, has many volcanoes, and is characterized by rapid changes of
                    temperature; it is almost destitute of population, and is only inhabited in
                    those parts of the coast in which valuable guano deposits are found, or where
                    the nitrate deposits and silver mines in the interior are worked. Near its
                    northern limit is situated the small port of Cobija, the only avenue by which
                    foreign articles of commerce can enter the Bolivian Republic without the payment
                    of transit duties It has obtained peculiar and valuable privileges as an
                    encouragement to the introduction of merchandise by this route, in preference to
                    the more convenient routes by the Puertos Intermedios, belonging to the Republic
                    of Peru. But the arid nature of the surrounding country, and the great scarcity
                    of water, must greatly retard its advancement, since not only are the
                    inhabitants scantily supplied with this necessary of life, but the mules
                    employed in transporting goods into the interior are exposed to great
                    hardships.</p>
                <p>Western Bolivia is the highest and most mountainous country of the two Americas
                    Five separate systems of mountains, curving from Peru in the north-west and
                    passing south into Chili, may be distinguished as forming its high land. Nearest
                    the Pacific is the range of the outlying <hi rend="italic">coast mountains,</hi>
                    which does not exceed 5000 feet in altitude. The range of the true <hi
                    rend="italic">Andes</hi> rises farther inland, forming part of the vast chain
                    which extends along the whole of America; in Bolivia it attains an average
                    height of 15,000 feet, and has a general width of 20 miles, having its highest
                    known point here in the volcano of Sahama, 23,000 feet in elevation. Next
                    follows the central system of the <hi rend="italic">Cordillera Real,</hi> also
                    named the eastern Cordillera, presenting a succession of sharp, rugged peaks,
                    reaching up into the region of eternal ice and snow, higher generally than the
                    Andes, but less massive: the peaks of Illimani (21,300 feet) and Sorata(24,800
                    feet)are its culminating points. Between the Andes and the Cordillera Real there
                    are various <hi rend="italic">Serrania</hi> or isolated groups of mountains, and
                    single cerros of less altitude, rising from the enclosed plateau to 17,000 feet
                    in some instances. The last system is that of the numerous minor Cordilleras,
                    which run south-eastward from the Cordillera Real into the lowlands of eastern
                    Bolivia, of which the most important is that of Cochabamba, stretching out to
                    62° 40' E. long. The elevation of the snow line in the highlands of Bolivia
                    appears to vary between 16,000 and 18,000 feet, modified in many cases by the
                    aspect of the mountains and the nature of the country surrounding them, being
                    raised where heat is powerfully reflected from the surface of the bare high
                    plains, or lowered where the mountains are exposed to cold southerly winds.
                    Volcanoes are frequent in the Andes and coast ranges; those of Sahama and
                    Isluga, with Tua, Olea, and Ollagua farther south, are constantly smoking.</p>
                <p>These mountain systems divide Bolivia into a high region, containing many very
                    elevated plains stretching between the enclosing heights of the west, and a low
                    land forming the eastern side of the country, beneath the mountains, and at a
                    comparatively small elevation above the sea. The high plains or basins of the
                    plateau enclose a continental water system, from which there is no outlet to the
                    ocean, the rivers terminating in lakes, of which Lake Titicaca is the chief, or
                    in swamps, or in vast dried up salt fields,—rapid evaporation disposing of and
                    balancing the supply of water flowing to these by the mountain streams.</p>
                <p>The valley or plateau which is occupied by the Lake of Titicaca and the Rio
                    Desaguadero forms the most elevated table-land in the globe, with the exception
                    of that of Thibet, which presents only mountain pastures, covered with sheep;
                    while this table-land of the New World presents towns and populous cities,
                    affords support to numerous herds of cattle, <hi rend="italic">llamas,
                    guanacos,</hi> and sheep, and is covered with harvests of maize, rye, barley,
                    and wheat, at an elevation which has nothing to equal it in any other part of
                    the world. The Lake of Titicaca or Chuquito, which occupies its northern
                    extremity, is 12,600 feet above the level of the sea, and its extent is equal to
                    fourteen times that of the Lake of Geneva, or 3220 square miles, the greatest
                    depth being upwards of 700 feet. It is surrounded by numerous towns and
                    villages, and a rich and fertile country, and contains several islands, the
                    largest of which is called Titicaca, and was long held in great veneration by
                    the Peruvian Indians, in consequence of its having been the place whence Manco
                    Capac and his consort Manco Oello Huaco, the great founders of the empire of the
                    Incas, issued, to spread civilization, industry, and good government among the
                    surrounding nations. The Lake of Titicaca is very irregular in its form. It
                    admits of extensive navigation for small vessels, though not unattended with
                    danger, as it is subject to sudden storms and violent gusts of wind from the
                    neighbouring mountains. This lake communicates with the smaller Lake of Pansa,
                    or of the “Pampa Aullagas,” situated at the southern extremity of the valley, by
                    means of the Rio Desaguadero, which flows out of the Lake of. Titicaca, and has
                    a breadth of from 80 to 100 yards. This river and lake form part of the western
                    boundaries between the Republics of Bolivia and Peru. Over the river was formed,
                    in the time of the Incas, a suspension bridge, composed of cables and cords made
                    of the grass and rushes which grow on its borders; and the work was constantly
                    renewed from time to time, to obviate the effects of decay, as it constituted
                    the only line of communication between the opposite sides of the valley. These
                    lakes, with the Desaguadero, form the only receptacles for the water of those
                    rivers and streams which descend from the surrounding mountains and enter this
                    extensive plain, which has no visible outlet whereby its contents can escape
                    otherwise than by evaporation.</p>
                <p>Those rivers which take their rise from the western declivity of the Andes, and
                    flow into the Pacific, are so inconsiderable in magnitude, and so short in their
                    course, as scarcely to merit observation, and are only useful in supplying the
                    means of a partial irrigation to the arid plains which separate these mountains
                    from the Pacific. But those numerous rivers taking their origin on the eastern
                    declivity of the Cordillera Real, which is the main waterparting of Bolivia,
                    present a very different aspect, and are of much greater importance, since they
                    communicate with large navigable rivers, which terminate in the Atlantic
                    Ocean.</p>
                <p>The River Paro or Beni, which takes its origin in the neighbourhood of the city
                    of La Paz, and the Guapey, which rises near Cochabamba, and, sweeping round the
                    southern and eastern bases of the Cordillera of Cochabamba, unites itself to the
                    Mamore, flow to the north-east to mingle with the waters of the Madeira and the
                    mighty Maranon or Amazons; while the Pilcomayo, which rises near Potosi and
                    Chuquisaca, and the Vermejo, from the valley of Tarija, bend their courses, at a
                    considerable distance from each other, to the south-east, until they join the
                    Paraguay, which terminates in the Rio de la Plata. Possessing only a small
                    extent of sea-board, and that in a perfect desert difficult of passage, and
                    behind which the lofty range of the Andes forms a huge barrier, the whole of the
                    rich provinces of eastern Bolivia are land-locked and almost isolated from
                    communication with the outer world. The most natural outlets of the country
                    appear to be in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n21/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0021-0012"/> rivers flowing to the great mediterranean
                    navigation system of the Amazons in the north, or to the Rio de la Plata. More
                    than forty years ago the importance of opening up a river highway from eastern
                    Bolivia to the Rio Paraguay had impressed itself strongly on the Government, and
                    large grants and privileges were offered in encouragement of this object, the
                    rivers Otuquis, Tucabaca, and Latirequiqui, flowing to the Paraguay about the
                    20th parallel, being looked to as probably affording the desired navigable way.
                    As yet, however, though this plan has been frequently revived, no definite
                    progress has been made in this direction. An expedition sent down the Rio
                    Pilcomayo in 1844 reported it innavigable. On the side of the Amazons, the
                    rapids of the River Madeira, 18 in number, and extending over a distance of 230
                    miles, form a great natural barrier; to overcome this and to connect the
                    navigable upper tributaries in Bolivia with the navigation of the lower Madeira,
                    a company was recently formed for the construction of a railroad along the
                    interrupted portion of the course of the Madeira: this scheme also is for the
                    present in abeyance. It seems probable, however, that the recent opening of
                    regular navigation on the Rio Vermejo from the Paraguay to the upper Argentine
                    province of Jujuy on the southern frontier of Bolivia may to some extent afford
                    an outlet, and tend to develop the resources of that part of the country.</p>
                <p>Bolivia lies, as has been noticed, for the most part within the tropical zone;
                    but from its peculiar formation, its climate and productions are dependent
                    rather upon the elevation of different parts of the land than upon its
                    geographical situation. In descending from the highest region of snow and ice to
                    the low plains of rich tropical vegetation several zones or stages are
                    distinguished. The name <hi rend="italic">Puna</hi><hi rend="italic">brava</hi>
                    is given to the uppermost mountain regions which rise above 12,500 feet to the
                    snow limit: these are scarcely inhabited by man, and are characterized by mosses
                    and hardier grasses,—the animal kingdom being represented by the vicuna,
                    guanaco, llama, alpaca, viscacha, chinchilla, besides the condor and other birds
                    of prey. The region between an elevation of 11,000 feet and the lower Puna brava
                    is termed the <hi rend="italic">Puna;</hi> less cold than the former, it is
                    suited for the growth of potatoes, barley, and rush-like grasses, upon which
                    sheep, llamas, vicunas, &amp;c., may feed. This division embraces the whole of
                    the high plains of Bolivia, which are but scantily peopled or cultivated.
                    Several species of cactus are found in these elevated regions, and especially
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cactus peruvianus,</hi> which sometimes grows to a height
                    of from 20 to 30 or even 40 feet, and is serviceable for many purposes. Under
                    the general name <hi rend="italic">Cabezera de Valle</hi> are grouped the heads
                    of the valleys descending to the lower lands, between 9500 and 11,000 feet in
                    elevation, where the climate is temperate. These cultivable districts produce
                    wheat, maize, and the ordinary vegetables. The <hi rend="italic">Valle</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Medio Yunga</hi> is the general name of the deeper portions of
                    the valleys, between 9500 and 5000 feet, with warm climate, affording field and
                    garden fruits in abundance. The <hi rend="italic">Yunga,</hi> lastly, is the low
                    tropical region, comprising all beneath 5000 feet, and producing all kinds of
                    tropical fruits and vegetation.</p>
                <p>In the punas the air is always dry and perceptibly cold, though the temperature
                    may rise high in the sun, and cold, cutting blasts of air from the mountains are
                    of frequent occurrence. In the Valle and upper Yunga a perpetual spring seems to
                    reign, and night frosts are rare. The western side of the Andes is completely
                    rainless, all moisture-bearing clouds rolling up from the ocean being quickly
                    evaporated, or condensed in the higher mountain regions in snow or hail; but the
                    whole of the remaining eastern region of Bolivia has a rainfall. In the lowlands
                    this is irregular in season; but in the upper regions of the Puna and the
                    Cabezera de Valle, a rainy season generally begins in the middle of November and
                    concludes in the beginning of March, often accompanied by furious
                    thunder-“storms, with hail and snow in the higher regions. The climate of
                    Potosi, at an elevation of 13,300 to 13,600 feet, is so various that in one day
                    it frequently exhibits the vicissitudes of the four seasons of the year. Thus,
                    during the night and the early part of the morning it is piercingly cold; in the
                    forenoon it resembles our fine weather in March; in the afternoon the rays of
                    the sun in so pure and attenuated an atmosphere are very powerful and
                    scorchingly hot; while towards evening the air usually becomes mild and serene.
                    Strangers on first arriving in these higher plains are usually affected with
                    difficulty of breathing, owing to the extreme rarity of the atmosphere; they are
                    likewise sufferers from dysentery, which, however, for the most part soon
                    disappears, and in general the highlands are by no means unhealthy. Travellers
                    in the higher regions are exposed to great danger and hardships owing to the
                    storms which occasionally prevail, especially snow storms, which frequently
                    produce the <hi rend="italic">surumpi, or</hi> snow blindness, an affection
                    which has proved fatal to some travellers. An infectious fever called “fiebre
                    amarilla” sometimes breaks out in the Indian villages of the Puna, causing great
                    loss of life; coughs and lung diseases are prevalent among the children in the
                    punas, and do much injury among grown people in the Valle and Yungas. In
                    descending through the eastern provinces towards the plains of Mojos and
                    Chiquitos, all the gradations of climate are experienced down to that which
                    characterizes the equinoctial regions of America, where intermittent “terciana”
                    or cold fevers, dysenteries, and other diseases peculiar to warm climates
                    prevail.</p>
                <p>The animals which distinguish the more elevated parts of Bolivia are the <hi
                    rend="italic">guanaco,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">llama,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">alpaca</hi> (the first supposed to be the original from which the
                    second and third varieties have been domesticated), and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vicuna.</hi> These animals, in their structure and habits, are all closely
                    allied to the camel of Africa. Thus, an examination of the structure of the
                    stomach shows that they are capable of existing during a considerable time
                    without any supply of water, and in fact they are seldom seen to drink from the
                    streams of their native mountains. The camel seems peculiarly well calculated to
                    live in the arid and burning deserts of the Old World, and the form of its feet
                    is singularly adapted for traversing rapidly these extensive plains; whilst, on
                    the other hand, the guanaco and the llama have their feet so constructed as to
                    enable them with facility to ascend and descend the abrupt declivities, and to
                    traverse the rugged and uneven passes which abound in these mountains. They seem
                    likewise to frequent particularly those parts of the Cordillera of the Andes
                    which are the most dry and arid, and which are least clothed with forests and
                    shrubbery. Thus, in the Cordillera which separates the Argentine Republic from
                    Chili, the guanacos are found in great numbers on the summits and eastern
                    declivities, which are exceedingly arid and bare when compared with the western
                    or Chili side, where the Andes in their whole extent are clothed to a certain
                    elevation with a broad belt of forest trees and evergreens, and where, at
                    certain seasons of the year, thero are heavy and continued rains. On this side
                    guanacos are of comparatively rare occurrence. Their flesh is savoury when
                    young, but not very palatable when full grown; their wool, however, is very
                    valuable to the Indians, who manufacture it into hats and various kinds of
                    woollen stuffs; and their skins, when tanned, are useful in making shoes and
                    harness. The number of these animals in the country is estimated at not less
                    than three millions; about a third part of them, the full-grown males, are
                    employed as <pb break="no"

                    being cavried on by means of them.</p>
                <p>The vicuna <hi rend="italic">(Camelus</hi><hi rend="italic">vicugna')</hi> is a
                    smaller animal than the guanaco or the llama, and only useful for its fleece.
                    The wool is long and fine, and forms a valuable article of commerce; it is of a
                    brownish colour, somewhat resembling that of a dried rose leaf; it has a soft,
                    silky, and close texture, and is well adapted for the manufacture of hats and
                    warm clothing. The vicuna very much resembles the llama and guanaco in its
                    habits and dispositions, but cannot be usefully employed as a beast of burden.
                    It usually frequents the highest parts of the mountains, is extremely timid, is
                    gregarious, and runs very swiftly. The chinchilla <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Chinchilla</hi><hi rend="italic">lanigera)</hi> is also an inhabitant of the
                    mountainous parts of Bolivia. The skins, however, are of an inferior quality,
                    although larger than those obtained from the northern parts of Chili; but still
                    they form a very valuable article of commerce, on account of the great fineness
                    and delicacy of their furs.</p>
                <p>The sheep pasturing in the highlands of Bolivia are supposed to number about
                    seven millions, and in the lower regions of the east horned cattle are very
                    numerous. The eastern or more thickly-wooded parts of Bolivia are inhabited by a
                    variety of wild animals, such as the jaguar and the tapir, which are more or
                    less common in Brazil and the other parts of intertropical America of
                    inconsiderable elevation.</p>
                <p>The geological structure of the colossal mountains situated in Bolivia has
                    hitherto been very imperfectly examined. We learn from Humboldt, however, that
                    the metalliferous mountains near Potosi are principally composed of trachytic
                    porphyries; and Mr Pentland discovered trachyte also in the mountain of Pichu,
                    one of the most elevated of the western Cordillera. In the same chain there
                    likewise exist various volcanic mountains, some of which are in an active state.
                    There is perhaps no part of the world which affords a more interesting field for
                    the investigations of the geologist than Bolivia, not only .on account of the
                    great elevation which it attains, but also from the exhibitions of internal
                    structure presented by volcanic agency and otherwise,— not to mention the aid
                    afforded by such inquiries in the prosecution of mining enterprises.</p>
                <p>The great variety, extent, and value of the mineral productions of the
                    mountainous districts of Bolivia have given to this part of America an
                    importance and celebrity which it would not otherwise have obtained, and have
                    caused large and populous cities and towns to be built at elevations where the
                    rigours of the climate and the deficient vegetation would otherwise have
                    afforded very few inducements for fixing the abodes of industry. Mining is,
                    however, at the present time in a ruinous state.</p>
                <p>Gold is found in considerable quantities in the mountainous parts of Bolivia;
                    but, owing to the expense of extracting the metal from the ore, the mines which
                    produce it have not been worked to the extent of which they are capable. In
                    these it is usually found in the form of grains or nodules, or intermixed with
                    antimony, silver, and other substances, and is separated by reducing the whole
                    to a fine powder, and by amalgamation with quicksilver. The mountain of Illimani
                    is believed to contain great quantities of gold, in consequence of that metal
                    having been found in a native state in considerable quantities in the lake of
                    Illimani, situated at its base. In the 17th century, likewise, an Indian found
                    here, at a short distance from the city of La Paz, a mass of native gold, which
                    was said to have been detached from the mountain by the agency of lightning, and
                    which, having been purchased for the sum of 11,269 dollars, was afterwards
                    deposited in the cabinet of natural history at Madrid. But by far the greater
                    part of the gold procured in Bolivia is obtained by means of the <hi
                    rend="italic">laυaderos</hi> or gold-washings, in the beds of rivulets, where it
                    is found in the form of grains. The most productive of these are the celebrated
                    lavaderos of Tipuani, consisting of streams descending from the snow-capped
                    summits of the Cordillera of Ancuma, situated about sixty leagues to the
                    north-east of the city of La Paz, in the province of Larecaja. The gold is found
                    in the form of grains or <hi rend="italic">pepitas,</hi> at the depth of 10 or
                    12 yards below the surface, embedded in a stratum of clay of several feet in
                    thickness. The gold-washings at Tipuani were worked in the time of the Peruvian
                    Incas, as is evinced by their tools, which are occasionally found embedded in
                    the alluvial soil, and almost invariably in such situations as prove the most
                    productive. The gold-washings and quartz veins of Cho-quecamata, in the province
                    of Ayopaya in Cochabamba, are also famous, and their yield up to 1847 was valued
                    at £8,000,000. Several districts of the departments of Potosi, Chuquisaca, Santa
                    Cruz, and Tarija, are also rich in gold, but the greater part of the mines
                    formerly worked have now been abandoned, or the known veins have not been
                    explored.</p>
                <p>Silver, however, has hitherto been the staple metallic production of Bolivia, and
                    has given to it that celebrity which it has long possessed. In the rich
                    mountains of Potosi alone, according to the records kept at Potosi of the <hi
                    rend="italic">quintas</hi> or royal duties from the year 1545 to the year 1800,
                    no less than 823,950,509 dollars wer¾coined during that period; and if the other
                    produce of the mines be taken into account, it is estimated that not less than
                    1,647,901,018 dollars must have been obtained from this source alone during
                    those 255 years.</p>
                <p>The Cerro de Potosi, or argentiferous mountain of Potosi, has a somewhat conical
                    form, resembling a colossal sugarloaf; its base being about three leagues in
                    circumference, and its summit 15,977 feet above the level of the sea, and 2697
                    above the level of the great square or <hi rend="italic">plaza</hi> of the city
                    of Potosi, which is situated at its base. At the foot of the Cerro is a smaller
                    mountain called Huayna Potosi, or the Younger Potosi, likewise containing
                    silver, but in less abundance than the other, and less accessible, from the
                    numerous springs which there impede the operations of mining. The principal
                    mountain has been worked as high up as within 125 feet of its summit. The
                    labours of the miners have been principally confined to the upper half of the
                    mountain, which has been perforated by numerous excavations, with at least 5000
                    openings of mines, the greater number of which are however abandoned. The upper
                    part of the mountain is exhausted to a considerable extent of its valuable
                    contents; but the lower part is still in a great measure untouched, as the
                    springs are there more numerous, and the water accumulates in such quantities as
                    materially to interrupt the further progress of the miners. The mines of Potosi,
                    according to Humboldt, rank next in importance to those of Guanaxuato in Mexico.
                    The existence of silver in this place was first accidentally discovered by an
                    Indian in the year 1545, and ever since that time its mines have been worked. In
                    1858, twenty-two companies were working 46 silver mines and 4 tin shafts in the
                    province of Potosi, and the yield in 1856 amounted to a value of nearly a
                    million dollars.</p>
                <p>The silver mines of Portugalete, in the province of Chichas, have acquired
                    considerable celebrity on account of the richness as well as quantity of their
                    ores, which yield from 60 to 80 merks of silver to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >caxon,</hi> while those of Potosi only afford about 10 merks from the same
                    quantity of ore. Besides these there are various other silver mines in the
                    province of Chichas, but their value is much diminished by the scarcity of
                    water, and by their being situated in an almost desert and unproductive country.
                    The mines of Laurani, in the province of Sicasica in La Paz, once famous, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n23/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0023-0014"/> are now abandoned; and those of the province of
                    Arque in Cochabamba are not now regularly worked. The rich silver mines of Lipez
                    also lie fallow, as do those of the department of Oruro. In 1870 great silver
                    deposits were discovered at Caracoles, about 120 miles inland, in the desert
                    province of Atacama, drawing thither a rush of miners from all parts of Chili
                    and Peru.</p>
                <p>Among the other mineral riches of Bolivia copper takes the next rank, and is also
                    widely distributed The province of Ingavi in La Paz possesses mines from which
                    15,000 to 20.000 cwts. of copper are annually taken. The departments of Potosi,
                    Chuquisaca, Oruro, and Atacama are also rich in copper. Tin is mined to some
                    extent in Potosi and Oruro, where it is found along with the silver. Lead is
                    also frequently found in the neighbourhood of silver, as well as quicksilver.
                    The methods hitherto employed for the reduction of the ores of this country are
                    exceedingly imperfect and inefficient. More skill and capital are requisite to
                    render them productive and remunerating Coal and iron have been found in the
                    departments of Chuquisaca, Oruro, and Beni, though the extent or value of these
                    products is yet unknown. Precious stones, chiefly the hyacinth and opal, have
                    been found in the department of Santa Cruz, and diamonds in Beni.</p>
                <p>Very valuable beds of guano extend along the Pacific coast between 23° and 25°
                    S., those of Mexillones being specially famous. Nitrate of soda also exists in
                    great quantity in the deserts of Atacama, and is profitably worked.</p>
                <p>The roads which form the means of communication between Bolivia and the
                    surrounding countries, and between the various provinces of the republic, are in
                    no respect sufficient for the important purposes which they are destined to
                    serve. By inattention to the formation and preservation of roads, the Spaniards
                    and their descendants have fallen greatly behind the ancient Peruvians, whose
                    industry and civilization they affected to despise, and laboured hard to
                    depreciate. The present route, for it can scarcely be designated by the name of
                    road, from Potosi to Jujuy, the first city belonging to the Argentine Republic,
                    is about 310 miles in length; and this place forms the point where a road
                    commences for carriages and waggons as far as Buenos Ayres, an additional extent
                    of land carriage of about 1617 geographical miles. The various routes from
                    Bolivia to the coast of the Pacific, by the way of Cobija, by Tarapaca, and by
                    Oruro to Tacna, can only be passed on mules or horseback; and travellers are
                    sometimes exposed to great perils and hardships from exposure to the storms
                    which occasionally prevail at such great elevations. The President Ballivian,
                    however, while in office, did much to obviate these difficulties, and initiated
                    a new era of things by the construction of a·splendid highway, which leads from
                    Sucre, and passing Santa Cruz, connects Mojos and Chiquitos and the fertile
                    plains of the Beni and Madeira. Although railroads are as yet unknown in the
                    greater part of Bolivia, and though the country presents the most formidable
                    natural difficulties in the way of engineering, a beginning has been made in
                    this direction. The only line at present constructed in Bolivian territory is a
                    short one from the bay of Autofagasta, south of that of Mexillones on the
                    Pacific coast, in Atacama, to the nitrate of soda works of Salar el Carmer; it
                    is intended to extend this line inland to the nitrate fields and to the silver
                    mines of Caracoles. It is also proposed to extend one of the southern Peruvian
                    coast lines, starting from near the point of Iquιque to Oruro in Bolivia. At
                    present one of the main outlets of western Bolivia is by the Peruvian railroad
                    from the port of Moliendo and Arequipa to Puno, on Lake Titicaca, completed in
                    1870. Puno, its inland terminus, is connected with Bolivia by steam navigation
                    across Lake Titicaca.</p>
                <p>The productions furnished by Bolivia as articles of commerce are chiefly the
                    precious metals, vicuna and alpaca wool, guano, nitrate of soda, leather,
                    coffee, cacao, and chinchona bark; but from the fact that no direct commercial
                    intercourse has ever existed with the outer world, these products are frequently
                    ascribed to the countries through which they must pass. Thus the metals and
                    wools of Bolivia are looked upon as Peruvian, and the cinchona bark and gums
                    passing out eastward are credited to Brazil or the Argentine Republic. The rude
                    and simple fabrics manufactured by the Peruvian Indians are usually appropriated
                    to their own domestic uses; while the valuable vegetable productions, and the
                    herds of cattle and mules which are reared in the eastern parts of the republic,
                    have hitherto scarcely been sufficient for the supply of the inhabitants of
                    those populous mining districts that are principally dependent on them for
                    subsistence.</p>
                <p>Before the war of independence a very extensive traffic was maintained between
                    the upper provinces of Peru (or Bolivia) and the provinces of the Rio de la
                    Plata for supplies of cattle and mules. These were reared in great numbers in
                    all the interior Argentine provinces expressly for the use of those countries,
                    and were first sent by easy journeys to the luxuriant pastures of Salta and
                    Jujuy, where they were carefully fed and tended during the winter, previous to
                    their being conveyed to their final destination in Bolivia and Peru. Some idea
                    may be formed of the extent of this traffic from the statement that, besides all
                    those furnished by the other Argentine provinces, the province of Salta alone
                    supplied annually to Upper and Lower Peru from 60,000 to 80,000 mules, on all of
                    which they realized considerable profits, the prices being proportioned to the
                    distance to which they were conveyed. The customs derived from the import of
                    cattle from the Argentine Republic still form an important source of revenue.
                    The trade is now in a great degree diverted from the Argentine provinces to the
                    ports of the Pacific called the Puertos Intermedios. Tacna and Arequipa, with
                    their respective ports, have now become the principal channels through which
                    Bolivia receives the produce and manufactures of other countries, the Bolivian
                    port of Cobija being of little value, owing to the difficulties of transport
                    from it by mules and llamas across the desert track and the mountains. There are
                    no certain returns of the value of the trade of Bolivia; the importation by
                    Tacna and Arica is valued at 5 or 6 millions of dollars, that of Cobija at 1⅛ to
                    2 millions. A new and very important channel of communication for commerce will
                    be opened between Bolivia and the Atlantic, whenever commercial enterprise and
                    increasing civilization shall have established steam navigation on the Rio de la
                    Plata and its tributary streams, or from the mouth of the Amazons to its distant
                    tributaries the Beni and the Mamore.</p>
                <p>The population of Bolivia consists of a mixture of various races, chiefly of the
                    Spaniards with the Indian natives. A third of their number live in towns or
                    “villas,” the rest in smaller villages, or in the open camp. Besides the native
                    Indians there are in the country some descendants of African negro slaves, and
                    not a few Guaranis, who came over from the regions east of the Paraguay, and
                    settling in the plains, have increased in numbers. The Indian population may be
                    considered as the civilized, the half civilized, and the wild. To the first
                    class belong the <hi rend="italic">Quichua</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aymara,
                    or</hi> the Inca Indians, who are by far the most numerous, who have come most
                    closely into contact with the Spanish invaders, and who occupy chiefly the
                    highlands of the west. The Indians of Mojos and Chiquitos may be considered as
                    representing the half-civilized class,—retaining part of the civilization
                    introduced among them in the 17th century by the Jesuits. The nomadic or wild

                    and of the Rio Pirai; the <hi rend="italic">HichUos,</hi> who occupy the pampas
                    north of San Carlos in the department of Beni; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Penoquιquιas,</hi> living in the upper or southern districts of the River
                    Itonama or San Miguel; the <hi rend="italic">Guaranocas</hi> inhabiting the
                    western portion of the space between the rivers Tucabaca and Latiriquique; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Potororos</hi> in the north-west of the same district; and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Chiriguanos,</hi> occupying the country along the north of the
                    upper Pilcomayo below the confluence of the Pilaya. To these may be added the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tobas,</hi> who though they generally occupy the lower basin
                    of the Rio Vermejo in the Argentine portion of the Chaco, occasionally make
                    raids into the departments of Tarija and Chuquisaca, plundering and destroying
                    the villages, and carrying off women and cattle. The Quichuaand Aymara have no
                    relations or sympathies with the Γndians of the plains, who in their turn hold
                    the civilized Indians in great contempt. These descendants of the Peruvians
                    under the empire of the Incas are still numerous, notwithstanding the many
                    causes which have tended to diminish their numbers, and form a distinct race,
                    preserving the language and manners of their ancestors, their habits having been
                    only somewhat modified by the circumstances in which they have been placed since
                    they came under the dominion of the Spaniards. The Quichuas are mild in
                    character, apparently subdued and apathetic,—qualities which are but the natural
                    result of the state of subjection and debasement in which they were long held by
                    their conquerors; they are, however, robust and muscular, and capable of great
                    endurance, though little inclined to labour; their customs are rude and simple,
                    their mode of living poor in the extreme. The Aymara are perhaps more mobile in
                    character, but in other respects similar. Both are cultivators of the land
                    according to their rude notions of husbandry; vegetables, especially maize and
                    potatoes, form the staple of their food, and they indulge freely in their
                    favourite <hi rend="italic">chicha,</hi> an intoxicating liquor prepared from
                    maize; many are employed as drivers of llama trains, or are breeders of the
                    llama, sheep, or goats, which they possess in great numbers. Among the half-bred
                    population of Bolivia, who stand in relation of numbers to the Inca Indians as
                    about one to two, there are distinguished the <hi rend="italic">zambo,</hi> or
                    half-negro halfIndian, powerful in frame and intelligent, but unfaithful and
                    cunning; the <hi rend="italic">mulatto,</hi> or offspring of the Spaniard and
                    negro; and the <hi rend="italic">cholo,</hi> the descendant of the alliances of
                    the Spaniards with the Inca Indians. The last generally resemble their fathers
                    in character, and occupy themselves chiefly in mining. It is to the Cholos that
                    Bolivia owes its political independence.</p>
                <p>The population of Bolivia has greatly increased since the year of independence,
                    1825, when the whole number did not exceed 979,000; in 1831 it exceeded
                    1,000,000; at the census of 1846 it had risen to 1,380,000. The following table
                    shows the population of each department, as given by Ondarza in 1858. This is
                    the most recent detailed statement of the population of Bolivia, but an estimate
                    of the population of the ecclesiastical divisions of the country for 1874 is
                    appended to it; the provinces into which each department is divided are also
                    named, on the authority of Herr Reck :—</p>

                <p>The populations of the chief towns, in 1858, were as follows:—La Paz, 76,372;
                    Cochabamba, 40,678; Chuquisaca or Sucre, 23,979; Potosi, 22,580; Santa Cruz,

                    4170; Cobija, 2380. Among the small number of foreigners in the country,
                    Italians, Spaniards, and French are in a majority.</p>
                <p>The area of Bolivia, hitherto very uncertain, on account of the indefinite state
                    of the frontier on the east and south, has been calculated at Gotha, on the
                    basis of the recent determination of the boundary with Brazil, at 536,200
                    English square miles, or about ten times the extent of England.</p>
                <p>The religion of the people is Roman Catholic. Since the commencement of the
                    republican government a considerable part of the revenues of the minor convents
                    and monastic establishments in Bolivia has been diverted from their original
                    purposes to form a fund for the establishment and support of seminaries of
                    education. Colleges on improved modern principles are formed in each of the
                    departments. A university having long existed at Chuquisaca for the education of
                    the youth of Upper Peru, the utility of the establishment was greatly augmented,
                    during the administration of General Sucre, by an improvement in the modes of
                    instruction, and an increase in the number of the departments of education. In
                    Potosi, likewise, efficient means were adopted by General Miller, while prefect
                    of that department, to establish there a college for the study of mineralogy,—a
                    branch of education of great importance in a place wholly dependent on
                    mining.</p>

                <p>The constitution given to the country by Bolivar, which, in the frequent
                    revolutions of later times has often been modified and altered, and sometimes
                    set aside altogether, is founded on the strictest principles of justice, in as
                    far as regards the civil rights and privileges of the community; but in other
                    respects, and particularly in reference to the supreme executive authority, its
                    provisions savour strongly of a monarchical spirit. The supreme authority is
                    vested in a <hi rend="italic">présidente</hi><hi rend="italic">vitalicio,
                    or</hi> president for life, with the power of naming his successor. It
                    guarantees to the Bolivians civil liberty, security of persons and property, and
                    equality of rights; the free exercise and communication of thoughts and
                    opinions, either by the press or otherwise; liberty to remain or leave the
                    territory of the republic with their property, at their pleasure, but without
                    prejudice to others; equality in the imposition of taxes and contributions, from
                    the payment of which none can be exempted; and the abolition of all hereditary
                    employments, privileges, and entails. No profession, trade, or employment can be
                    prohibited, unless repugnant to public feeling, or injurious to the health and
                    security of the community; and every inventor is secured in the benefits of his
                    discovery. No one can be arrested without previous information of the alleged
                    fact of delinquency, unless when taken <hi rend="italic">flagranti delicto.</hi>
                    All trials and judgments are public; ‘ and in criminal cases none can be
                    imprisoned more than forty-eight hours without having presented to him the
                    charges preferred against him, and being delivered over to the proper tribunal
                    or judge.</p>
                <p>By this constitution all legitimate power emanates directly from the people, and
                    is in the first instance exercised by all who can justly claim the privilege of
                    citizens. Of these every ten nominate an elector, who exercises his delegated
                    authority for a period of four years. At the commencement of each year all the
                    electors assemble in the capitals of their respective provinces, and regulate
                    their proceedings and the exercise of their various functions by a plurality of
                    votes. They elect the members of the three legislative chambers, the number of
                    each amounting to thirty; those for the chamber of tribunes being nominated for
                    four years, and renewed by moieties every two years; those for the senate for
                    eight years, and renewed by moieties every four years; and those for the chamber
                    of censors being nominated for life.</p>
                <p>The executive government consists of a president, vice-president, and three
                    secretaries of state. The president of the republic is named for the first time
                    by a majority of the collective legislature, and retains the dignity during
                    life, with the power of naming his successor. He is the chief of the
                    administration of the state, and is not responsible for the acts of his
                    administration. The constitutional privileges of the president are the most
                    limited that have been intrusted to the supreme chief of any nation. They extend
                    only to the nomination of the officers of the revenue, of peace, and of war, and
                    the command of the army. The administration belongs wholly to the ministry,
                    which is responsible to the senate, and is subject to the jealous vigilance of
                    the legislators, magistrates, judges, and citizens. The judicial department
                    enjoys the most perfect independence, the members composing it being proposed by
                    the people, and chosen by the legislature. Slavery in every form has long been
                    abolished, and the exercise of religion is free from all restraints. The armed
                    force is composed of the regular army, amounting to about 3000 officers and men,
                    to garrison and defend the frontiers; of the national militia to preserve
                    internal order; of the preventive service to protect the revenue; and of a navy
                    when circumstances may require its formation.</p>

                <p>The early history of that part of the empire of the Incas which now forms the
                    Republic of Bolivia is so intimately connected with that of Peru, that the
                    consideration of it may with propriety be deferred until we come to treat of
                    that country, in which Cuzco, the capital of the Incas, is situated. Attention
                    will therefore at present be directed chiefly to that period of its history
                    which is more recent, and which has so materially influenced its present
                    condition.</p>
                <p>The Peruvians, ever since the conquest of their country by the Spaniards in the
                    16th century, have been subjected to a system of tyranny and oppression which
                    has few parallels in the history of the universe. They were treated little
                    better than beasts of burden. By their toil the gold and silver were obtained
                    from the mines, the lands were cultivated, the flocks and herds were attended
                    to, and all the domestic and menial offices performed. Yet the fruits of their
                    labour, especially that of mining, which was attended with numerous privations,
                    and often with great loss of life, were altogether devoted to enriching their
                    oppressors.</p>
                <p>One of their principal grievances was the <hi rend="italic">mita,</hi> a
                    compulsory kind of personal labour, either in the working of the mines or in the
                    cultivation of the fields, exacted from the Indians generally for the space of
                    one year. The proprietors of mines and land to be worked or cultivated were
                    privileged to claim as their undoubted right the personal services of the Indian
                    population of the district surrounding that in which their property was
                    situated. By the regulations of the <hi rend="italic">mita</hi> a proportional
                    number of the Indians of the district were annually chosen by lot for the
                    purposes required; and some idea may be formed of the effects of such a
                    regulation from the fact that 1400 mines were registered in Peru alone, and that
                    every mine which remained unworked a year and a day became the property of the
                    first claimant. So much was the labour of the mines dreaded by those persons on
                    whom the lot fell, that they considered it as equivalent to a sentence of death,
                    and made all their arrangements accordingly, carrying with them their wives and
                    families to their new and dreaded place of abode. An estimate may be formed of
                    the extent of this evil from 12,000 Indians having been annually required by the
                    <hi rend="italic">mita</hi> of Potosi alone; and it is calculated that, in the
                    mines of Peru, no less than 8,285,000 Indians have perished in this manner.
                    Besides the <hi rend="italic">mita</hi> for the service of the mines, the
                    Indians were also compelled to labour for their superiors on their cultivated
                    estates, their <hi rend="italic">estancias</hi> or grazing farms, and also in
                    their <hi rend="italic">obrages</hi> or manufactories.</p>
                <p>The tribιite exacted by the Government from every Indian between the age of
                    eighteen and fifty-five was a capitation tax of 8 dollars. This was levied with
                    the greatest rigour, and the official persons charged with its collection
                    frequently committed great injustice in doing so,—obliging the Indians to
                    commence these payments at fifteen, and continue them until seventy years of
                    age, and putting the amount of tribute for the years before and after the legal
                    period into their own pockets. In proof of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n26/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0026-0017"/> the extent to which this evil was carried, and of
                    the rapacity of the Spanish Government, it may be stated that a law was enacted
                    for the express purpose of augmenting the number of the people liable to pay
                    tribute. By it the Indians were obliged to marry, the men at the age of fifteen,
                    the women at thirteen. The governor of each province was responsible to the
                    Government for the amount of the tribute, which was regulated by a census of the
                    tributary Indians, taken every seven years; and in this many frauds were
                    practised, the actual number being often underrated.</p>
                <p>Besides all these, the Peruvian Indians were long subjected to another system of
                    extortion no less grievous and unjust,—the law of <hi rend="italic"
                    >repartamiento.</hi> This was originally established with the best
                    intentions,—the governors or <hi rend="italic">corregidors</hi> of the districts
                    being intrusted with the charge of supplying the inhabitants under their care
                    with such articles as they might require at a fair and equitable price. But the
                    law, which had so plausible an origin, was shamefully abused; and it was made
                    compulsory on the Indian population to purchase worthless articles at an
                    extravagant price.</p>
                <p>The constant and extensive operation of these demoralizing practices, although
                    more immediately affecting the aboriginal population, could not fail to produce
                    the most pernicious effects on the Creoles or descendants of the Spaniards; but,
                    in addition to these causes of debasement, the latter were subjected to numerous
                    unjust and oppressive laws, all tending to paralyze their advancement.</p>
                <p>The raising of those vegetable products which form the principal objects of
                    culture in Spain, as articles of commerce, was strictly prohibited to the South
                    Americans, however favourable the soil and climate of their native country might
                    be for the production of them. No kind of manufacture of cloth or articles of
                    clothing was permitted which could interfere with the commerce of Old Spain,
                    excepting only the coarse fabrics manufactured and worn by the Indians. Even the
                    valuable mines of mercury and iron found in South America were, in a great
                    measure, hermetically sealed by prohibitory decrees, lest they might interfere
                    with the traffic carried on by Spain in these articles. And, not only was the
                    commerce of South America confined entirely to Spain and prohibited with other
                    nations, under the severest penalties, but the colonies were not permitted to
                    have any commerce with each other.</p>
                <p>The grievances under which they suffered at length exceeded even the powers of
                    endurance possessed by the pacific Indians, and gave rise to the insurrection of
                    1780-81, led by the Inca Tupac Amaπi, who spread fire and sword against
                    everything Spanish from Cuzco to Jujuy; twice the city of La Paz was besieged by
                    a force of 20,000 Indians; and in the battle before that town Tupac Amani was
                    made prisoner and put to death in the most barbarous manner by the Spaniards.
                    The insurrection was finally put down in 1782, and with it ended the last power
                    of the Incas. The aboriginal population, having failed in their arduous
                    undertaking, after the destruction of great numbers of their nation, and finding
                    their chains now rivetted with double force, never again recovered their wonted
                    energies. This accounts for the comparative indifference with which they viewed
                    the rise and progress of the war of independence.</p>
                <p>From the causes already stated, the war of independence was principally carried
                    on, as regards Bolivia, by the resources of, and in concert with, the
                    neighbouring provinces of the Rio de la Plata and Peru, all of which had equal
                    cause to avenge themselves on their oppressors, but were placed in circumstances
                    somewhat more fortunate for accomplishing their purpose. When the patriots of
                    Buenos Ayres had succeeded in liberating from the dominion of Spain the interior
                    provinces of the Rio de la Plata, they turned their arms against their enemies
                    who held Upper Peru. An almost uninterrupted warfare followed, from July 1809
                    till August 1825, with alternate successes on the side of the Spanish or
                    royalist and the South American or patriot forces,—the scene of action lying
                    chiefly between the Argentine provinces of Salta and Jujuy and the shores of
                    Lake Titicaca. The first movement of the war was the successful invasion of
                    Upper Peru by the army of Buenos Ayres, under General Balcarce, which, after
                    twice defeating the Spanish troops, was able to celebrate the first anniversary
                    of independence near Lake Titicaca, in May 1811. Soon, however, the patriot
                    army, owing to the dissolute conduct and negligence of its leaders, became
                    disorganized, and was attacked and defeated, in June 1811, by the Spanish army
                    under General Goyeneche, and driven back into Jujuy. Four years of warfare, in
                    which victory was alternately with the Spaniards and the patriots, was
                    terminated in 1815 by the total rout of the latter in a battle which took place
                    between Potosi and Oruro. To this succeeded a revolt of the Indians of the
                    southern provinces of Peru, and the object being the independence of the whole
                    country, it was joined by numerous Creoles. This insurrection was, however,
                    speedily put down by the royalists. In 1816 the Spanish general Laserna, having
                    been appointed commander-in-chief of Upper Peru, made an attempt to invade the
                    Argentine provinces, intending to march on Buenos Ayres, but he was completely
                    foiled in this by the activity of the irregular <hi rend="italic">gauclιo</hi>
                    troops of Salta and Jujuy, and was forced to retire. During this time and in the
                    six succeeding years a guerilla warfare was maintained by the patriots of Upper
                    Peru, who had taken refuge in the mountains, chiefly of the province of Yungas,
                    and who frequently harassed the royalist troops. In June 1823 the expedition of
                    General Santa Cruz, prepared with great zeal and activity at Lima, marched in
                    two divisions upon Upper Peru, and in the following months of July and August
                    the whole country between La Paz and Oruro was occupied by his forces; but
                    later, the indecision and want of judgment displayed by Santa Cruz allowed a
                    retreat to be made before a smaller royalist army, and a severe storm converted
                    their retreat into a precipitate flight, only a remnant of the expedition again
                    reaching Lima. In 1824, after the great battle of Ayacucho in Lower Peru,
                    General Sucre, whose valour had contributed so much to the patriot success of
                    that day, marched with a part of the victorious army into Upper Peru. On the
                    news of the victory a universal rising of the patriots took place, and before
                    Sucre had reached Oruro and Puno, in February 1825, La Paz was already in their
                    possession, and the royalist garrisons of several towns had gone-over to their
                    side. The Spanish general Olaneta, with a diminished army of 2000 men, was
                    confined to the province of Potosi, where he held out till March 1825, when he
                    was mortally wounded in an action with some of his own revolted troops.</p>
                <p>General Sucre was now invested with the supreme command in Upper Peru, until the
                    requisite measures could be taken to establish in that country a regular and
                    constitutional government. Deputies from the various provinces tö the number of
                    fifty-four were assembled at Chuquιsaca, the capital, to decide upon the
                    question proposed to them on the part of the Government of the Argentine
                    provinces, whether they would or would not remain separate from that country. In
                    August 1825 they decided this question, declaring it to be the national will
                    that Upper Peru should in future constitute a distinct and independent nation.
                    This assembly continued their session, although the primary object of their
                    meeting had thus been accomplished, and afterwards gave the name of Bolivia to
                    the country,—issuing at the same time a formal declaration of independence.</p>
                <p>The first general assembly of deputies of Bolivia dissolved itself on the 6th of
                    October 1825, and a new congress <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0027-0018"/> was summoned and formally installed at Chuquisaca
                    on the 25th May 1826, to take into consideration the constitution prepared by
                    Bolivar for the new republic. A favourable report was made to that body by a
                    committee appointed to examine it, on which it was approved by the congress, and
                    declared to be the constitution of the republic; and as such, it was sworn to by
                    the people. General Sucre was chosen president for life, according to the
                    constitution, but only accepted the appointment for the space of two years, and
                    on the express condition that 2000 Colombian troops should be permitted to
                    remain with him.</p>
                <p>The independence of the country, so dearly bought, did not, however, secure for
                    it a peaceful future. Repeated risings occurred, till in the end of 1827 General
                    Sucre and his Colombian troops were driven from La Paz. A new congress was
                    formed at Chuquisaca in April 1828, which modified the constitution given by
                    Bolivar, and chose Marshal Santa Cruz for president; but only a year later a
                    revolution, led by General Blanco, threw the country into disorder and for a
                    time overturned the Government. Quiet being again restored in 1831, Santa Cruz
                    promulgated the code of laws which bore his name, and brought the financial
                    affairs of the country iuto some order; he also concluded a treaty of commerce
                    with Peru, and for several years Bolivia remained in peace. In 1835, when a
                    struggle for the chief power had made two factions in the neighbouring republic
                    of Peru, Santa Cruz was induced to take a part in the contest; he marched into
                    that country, and after defeating General Gamarra, the leader of one of the
                    opposing parties, completed the pacification of Peru in the spring of 1836,
                    named himself its protector, and had in view a confederation of the two
                    countries. At this juncture the Government of Chili interfered actively, and
                    espousing the cause of Gamarra, sent troops into Peru. Three years of fighting
                    ensued, till in a battle at Jungay in June 1839 Santa Cruz was defeated and
                    exiled, Gamarra became president of Peru, and General Velasco provisional chief
                    in Bolivia. The Santa Cruz party, however, remained strong in Bolivia, and soon
                    revolted successfully against the new head of the Government, ultimately
                    installing General Ballivian in the chief power. Taking advantage of the
                    disturbed condition of Bolivia, Gamarra made an attempt to annex the rich
                    province of La Paz, invading it in August 1841 and besieging the capital; but in
                    a battle with Ballivian his army was totally routed, and Gamarra himself was
                    killed. The Bolivian general was now in turn to invade Peru, when Chili again
                    interfered to prevent him. Ballivian remained in the presidency till 1848, when
                    he retired to Valparaiso, and in the end of that year General Belzu, after
                    leading a successful military revolution, took the chief power, and during his
                    presidency endeavoured to promote agriculture, industry, and trade. General
                    Jorge Cordova succeeded him, but had not been long in office when a new revolt
                    in September 1857, originating with the garrison of Oruro, spread over the land,
                    and compelled him to quit the country. His place was taken by Dr José Maria
                    Linares, the originator of the revolution, who taking into his own hands all the
                    powers of Government, and acting with the greatest severity, caused himself to
                    be proclaimed dictator in March 1858. Fresh disturbances led to the deposition
                    of Linares in 1861, when Dr Maria de Acha was chosen president. In 1862 a treaty
                    of peace and commerce with the United States of North America <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> was ratified, and in the following year a similar
                    treaty was concluded with Belgium; but new causes of disagreement with Chili had
                    arisen in the discovery of rich beds of guano on the eastern coast-land of the
                    desert of Atacama, which threatened warfare, and were only set at rest by the
                    treaty of August 1866, in -which the 24th parallel of latitude was adopted as
                    the boundary between the two republics. A new military revolution, led by Maria
                    Melgarejo, broke out in 1865, and in February of that year the troops of
                    President Acha were defeated in a battle near Potosi, when Melgarejo took the
                    dominion of the country. After defeating two revolutions, in 1865 and 1866, the
                    new president declared a political amnesty, and in 1869, after imposing a
                    revised constitution on the country, he became its dictator till 1871.</p>
                <p>Such, in brief, are the rapidly succeeding political changes and internal
                    conflicts which have kept Bolivia far behind its neighbouring republics, and
                    have prevented the development of its natural wealth. Notwithstandingthese wars
                    and revolutions which rent the country, Bolivia had maintained itself without
                    foreign credit until the presidency of Melgarejo, when it was drawn into
                    disastrous speculations and contracts which have compromised its credit and
                    loaded the country with a heavy foreign debt.</p>
                <p>President Morales was elected in 1871; since that time a civilian Government has
                    succeeded to the military system, and attempts are being made to reform the
                    disordered affairs of the republic.</p>
