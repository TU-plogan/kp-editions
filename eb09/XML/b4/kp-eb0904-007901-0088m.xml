                <p>THE science of Botany includes everything relating to the Vegetable Kingdom,
                    whether in a living or in a fossil state. Its object is not, as some have
                    supposed, merely to name and arrange the vegetable productions of the globe. It
                    embraces a consideration of the external forms of plants —of their anatomical
                    structure, however minute—of the functions which they perform—of their
                    arrangement and classification—of their distribution over the globe at the
                    present and at former epochs—and of the uses to which they are subservient. It
                    examines the plant in its earliest state of development, when it appears as a
                    simple cell, and follows it through all its stages of progress until it attains
                    maturity. It takes a comprehensive view of all the plants which cover the earth,
                    from the minutest lichen or moss, only visible by the aid of the microscope, to
                    the most gigantic productions of the tropics. It marks the relations which
                    subsist between all members of the vegetable world, and traces the mode in which
                    the most despised weeds contribute to the growth of the mighty denizens of the
                    forest.</p>
                <p>The plants which adorn the globe more or less in all countries must necessarily
                    have attracted the attention of mankind from the earliest times. The science
                    that treats of them dates back to the days of Solomon, for that wise monarch
                    “spake of trees,” from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop on the wall. The
                    Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Greeks were the early cultivators of science, and
                    Botany was not neglected, although the study of it was mixed up with crude
                    speculations as to vegetable life, and as to the change of plants into animals.
                    Aescu- )dpius and his priests, the Asclepiades, who studied the art of medicine,
                    had their attention directed to plants in a pharmaceutical point of view. About
                    300 years before Christ Theophrastus wrote a <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Plants,</hi> and described about 500 species used for the treatment of diseases.
                    Dioscorides, a Greek writer, who appears to have flourished about the time of
                    Nero, issued a work on Materia Medica. The elder Pliny described about a
                    thousand plants, many of them famous for their medicinal virtues. Asiatic and
                    Arabian writers also took up this subject. Little, however, was done in the
                    science of botany, properly so called, until the 16th century of the Christian
                    era, when the revival of learning dispelled the darkness which had long hung
                    over Europe. Brunfels, a physician of Bern, has been looked upon as the restorer
                    of the science in Europe. He published a <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Plants,</hi> illustrated by figures, about the beginning of the 16th
                    century.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest attempts at a methodical arrangement of plants was made in
                    Florence by Andreas Caesalpinus, a native of Arezzo, some time professor of
                    botany at Padua, and afterwards physician to Pope Clement VIII. He is called by
                    Linnaeus <hi rend="italic">primus vents systematic™.</hi> In his work <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantis,</hi> published at Florence in
                    1583, he distributed the 1520 plants then known into fifteen classes— the
                    distinguishing characters being taken from the fruit.</p>
                <p>John Ray, a native of Essex, did much to advance the science of botany. He was
                    born in 1628, and died in 1705. He promulgated a system which may be considered
                    as the dawn of the “natural system” of the present day (Ray, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Methodus</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum,</hi> 1682). He separated flowering
                    from flowerless plants, and divided the former into Dicotyledons and
                    Monocotyledons. His orders were founded on a correct idea of the affinities of
                    plants, and he far outstripped his contemporaries in his enlightened views of
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>About the year 1670 Dr Robert Morison<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    divided them into eighteen classes, distinguishing plants according as they were
                    woody or herbaceous, and taking into account the nature of the flowers and
                    fruit. In 1690 Rivinus<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    promulgated a classification founded chiefly on the forms of the flowers.
                    Tournefort<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tournefort,

                    the subject of vegetable taxonomy. He was a contemporary of Ray, and was
                    professor of botany at Paris in 1683. He was long at the head of the French
                    school of botany, and published a systematic arrangement in 1694-1700. He
                    described about 8000 species of plants, and distributed them into twenty-two
                    classes, chiefly according to the form of the corolla, distinguishing herbs and
                    under-shrubs on the one hand from trees and shrubs on the other. The system of
                    Tournefort was for a longtime adopted on the Continent, but was ultimately
                    displaced by that of Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>Carl von Linné, or, as he is commonly called, Linnaeus,<note anchored="true"

                    (Râshult),in Smaland, a province of Sweden, where his father, Nicholas Linnaeus,
                    was clergyman. He entered as a pupil at the University of Lund, and about the
                    years 1727-28 was received into the house of Stobaeus, a physician in that city,
                    where he had abundant opportunities of prosecuting natural history. He
                    afterwards proceeded to Upsal, and had to struggle with great difficulties
                    during his studies there. He aided Celsius in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hierobotanicon,</hi> or account of the plants of Scripture, and he became
                    assistant to Rudbeck, professor of botany. He afterwards travelled in Lapland,
                    took his degree in Holland, visited <pb break="no"

                    where he lectured on botany aud mineralogy. He finally became professor of
                    botany at Upsal, and was one of the most popular lecturers of the day. He died
                    on the 8th of January 1778, in the 71st year of his age. His herbarium is now in
                    the possession of the Linnean Society.</p>
                <p>One of his biographers, in summing up his merits, says, —“Educated in the severe
                    school of adversity, accustomed from his earliest youth to put a high value on
                    verbal accuracy and logical precision, endowed with a powerful understanding,
                    and capable of undergoing immense fatigue, both of body and mind, Linnaeus
                    produced a most important revolution in botanical science. He improved the
                    distinctions of genera and species, introduced a better nomenclature on the
                    binomial method, and invented a new and comprehensive system founded on the
                    stamens and pistils. His verbal accuracy and the remarkable terseness of his
                    technical language reduced the crude matter that was stored up in the folios of
                    his predecessors into a form which was accessible to all men. He separated with
                    singular skill the important from the unimportant in their descriptions. He
                    arranged their endless synonyms with a patience and a lucid order that were
                    quite inimitable. By requiring all species to be capable of a rigorous
                    definition, not exceeding twelve words, he purified botany from the endless
                    varieties of the gardeners and herbalists; and by applying the same strict
                    principles to genera, and reducing every character to its differential terms, he
                    got rid of the cumbrous descriptions of the old writers. It is said of Linnaeus,
                    that, although no man of science ever exercised a greater sway, or had more
                    enthusiastic admirers, yet his merit was not so much that of a discoverer as of
                    a judicious and strenuous reformer. The knowledge which he displayed, and the
                    value and simplicity of the improvements which he proposed, secured the
                    universal adoption of his suggestions, and crowned him with a success altogether
                    unparalleled in the annals of science.”</p>
                <p>The system of Linnaeus is founded on the sexes of plants, and hence it is often
                    denominated the sexual system. It is called an artificial method, because it
                    takes into account only a few marked characters in plants, and does not propose
                    to unite them by natural affinities. It is an index to a department of the book
                    of nature, and as such is useful to the student. It does not aspire to any
                    higher character, and although it cannot be looked upon as a scientific and
                    natural arrangement, still it has a certain facility of application which
                    commends it to the tyro. In using it, however, let it ever be remembered, that
                    it will not of itself give the student any view of the true relations of plants
                    as regards structure and properties, and that by leading to the discovery of the
                    name of a plant, it is only a stepping-stone to the natural system. Linnaeus
                    himself claimed nothing higher for it. He says—“Methodi Naturalis fragmenta
                    studiose inquirenda sunt. Primum et ultimum hoc in botanicis desideratum est.
                    Natura non facit saltus. Plantae omnes utrinque affinitatem monstrant, uti
                    territorium in mappa geographica.” Accordingly, besides his artificial index, he
                    also promulgated fragments of a natural method of arrangement.</p>
                <p>The Linuean system was strongly supported by Sir James Edward Smith, who adopted
                    it in his <hi rend="italic">English Flora,</hi> and who also became possessor of
                    the Linnean collection. The system was for a long time the only one taught in
                    the schools of Britain, even after it had been discarded by those in France and
                    in other Continental countries.</p>
                <p>The foundation of Botanic Gardens during the 16th and 17th centuries did much in
                    the way of advancing botany. They were at first appropriated chiefly to the
                    cultivation of medicinal plants. This was especially the case at universities,
                    where medical schools existed. The first Botanic Garden was established at Padua
                    in 1545, and was followed by that of Pisa. The garden at Leyden dates from 1577,
                    that at Leipsic from 1579. Gardens also early existed at Florence and Bologna.
                    The Montpellier Garden was founded in 1592, that of Giessen in 1605, of
                    Strasburg in 1620, of Altorf in 1625, and of Jena in 1629. The Jardin des
                    Plantes at Paris was established in 1626, and theUpsal Garden in 1627. The
                    Botanic Garden at Oxford was founded in 1632. The garden at Edinburgh was
                    founded by Sir Andrew Balfour and Sir Robert Sibbald in 1670, and, under the
                    name of the Physic Garden, was placed under the superintendence of James
                    Sutherland, afterwards professor of botany in the university. The park and
                    garden at Kew date from about 1730. The garden of the Royal Dublin Society at
                    Glasnevin was opened about 1796; that of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1807; and
                    that of Glasgow in 1818. The Madrid Garden dates from 1763, and that of Coimbra
                    from 1773. Gesner states that at the end of the 18th century there were 1600
                    Botanic Gardens in Europe.</p>
                <p>A new era dawned on botanical classification when Antoine Laurent de Jussieu
                    appeared. He was born at Lyons in 1748, and was educated at Paris under the care
                    of his uncle, Bernard de Jussieu. At an early age he became botanical
                    demonstrator in the Jardin des Plantes, and was thus led to devote his time to
                    the science of botany. Being called upon to arrange the plants in the garden, he
                    necessarily had to consider the best method of doing so, and adopted a system
                    founded in a certain degree on that of Ray, in which he embraced all the
                    discoveries in organography, adopted the simplicity of the Linnean definitions,
                    and displayed the natural affinities of plants. His <hi rend="italic">Genera
                    Plantarum,</hi> begun in 1778, and finally published in 1789, indicated an
                    important advance in the principle of classification. Jussieu subsequently
                    became professor of rural botany; he died in 1836 at the age of 88.</p>
                <p>The system of Jussieu made its way slowly in Great Britain, and it w as not until
                    Robert Brown brought it under notice that it was adopted.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brown, <hi rend="italic">Prodromus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Floroe Novoe Ilollandioe,</hi> 1810,</p></note> It is now the
                    basis of all natural classifications. One of the early supporters of this
                    natural method was Augustin Pyrame De Candolle, who was born in 1778, aud who,
                    after attending the lectures of Vaucher at Geneva, devoted himself to botanical
                    pursuits. He subsequently prosecuted his studies at Paris, and lectured on
                    botany at the College of France. He commenced his publications in 1802, and in
                    1804 he promulgated his <hi rend="italic">Elementary Principles of Botany.</hi>
                    In 1807 he became professor of botany at Montpellier, and in 1816 he was
                    appointed to the chair of natural history at Geneva, with the charge of the
                    Botanic Garden. In that city he carried on his future botanical labours, and
                    began his <hi rend="italic">Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni
                    Vegetabilis,</hi> which was intended to embrace an arrangement and description
                    of all known plants. He was enabled to complete eight volumes of the work before
                    his death, aud it has since been carried on by his son Alphonse De Candolle,
                    with the aid of other eminent botanists. It now embraces descriptions of the
                    genera and species of Dicotyledonous plants. The system followed by De Caudolle
                    is a modification of that of Jussieu, and it is adopted more or less at the
                    present day. De Candolle’s own herbarium was extremely rich. He had visited and
                    carefully examined many of the most extensive collections, especially those of
                    Paris; and many entire collections, as well as separate families, on which he
                    was specially engaged, were from time to time submitted to his examination by
                    their possessors. He had thus <pb break="no"

                    in ordinary circumstances fall to the lot of an individual. His library, too,
                    was stored with almost every important publication that could be required for
                    his undertaking. With such ample materials, aided by his untiring zeal and the
                    persevering energy of his character, he steadily pursued his allotted task, and
                    only ceased to labour at it when he ceased to live. For some years his health
                    declined, and it is to be feared that the severe and incessant attention which
                    he paid to the elaboration of the great family of Compositae had made a deep
                    inroad upon it. As a relaxation from his labours he undertook in the last years
                    of his life a long journey, and attended the scientific meeting held at Turin;
                    but he did not derive from this the anticipated improvement in his health, which
                    gradually failed until his death on the 9th September 1841. Since De Candolle’s
                    time various modifications of his system have been introduced by Endlicher,
                    Lindley, Hooker, and Bentham.</p>
                <p>In arranging plants according to a natural method, we require to have a thorough
                    knowledge of structural and morphological botany, and hence we find that the
                    advances made in these departments have materially aided the efforts of
                    systematic botanists.</p>
                <p>Robert Brown, a Scottish botanist, was the first in this country to support and
                    advocate the natural system of classification. The publication of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Prodroimιs Florae Novae Hollandiae,</hi> according to the natural
                    method, led the way to the adoption of that method in the universities and
                    schools of Britain. Sir William (then Dr) Hooker, in his prelections in the
                    University of Glasgow, and in his numerous writings, ably supported Brown. John
                    Lindley also came into the field, and in 1830 published the first edition of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Natural System.</hi> Dr Robert Kaye
                    Greville and Dr Walker Arnott were able coadjutors, more especially in the
                    department of Cryptogamie Botany. From the year 1832 up to 1859 great advances
                    were made in systematic botany, both in Britain and on the continent of Europe.
                    Endlicher’s <hi rend="italic">Enchiridion</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Genera
                    Plantarum,</hi> De Candolle’s <hi rend="italic">Prodromus,</hi> and Lindley’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Vegetable Kingdom</hi> became the guides in systematic botany,
                    according to the natural system.</p>
                <p>The following remarks embrace the views of Mr Bentham on the change from the
                    Linnean to the natural system of classification :—“The change from the technical
                    to the scientific study of plants was now complete. The Linnean platform,
                    established on the relation of genera and species, had now been so long and so
                    universally adopted as the basis or starting point, that the credit due to its
                    founder was almost forgotten, and it was superseded by the Jussiean method,
                    although it was chiefly by the consistent following out the principles laid down
                    by Linnaeus himself that the change had been effected. Plants were now grouped
                    upon a philosophical study of their affinities, whether morphological,
                    structural, or physiological.”</p>
                <p>In all classification it is necessary to define what is meant by species. The
                    usual definition of the term has been that a species (as regards the present
                    epoch of the earth’s history) is an assemblage of individuals having characters
                    in common, and coming from an original stock or protoplast, and their seeds
                    producing similar individuals. It was also supposed that variation in species
                    was restrained within certain limits, and that varieties had a tendency to
                    revert to the parent form. The view, however, adopted by many now-a-days is,
                    that the tendency to variation is continuous, and that, after a lapse of long
                    periods of time, and under the influence of varying external conditions, the
                    descendants from a common stock may exhibit the differences which characterize
                    distinct species. These are the views which are advanced by Darwin, and which
                    imply a complete revolution in our idea of species. This theory is thus stated
                    by Bentham :—</p>
                <p>1. That although the whole of the numerous offspring of an individual plant
                    resemble their parent in all main points, there are slight <hi rend="italic"
                    >individual</hi> differences.</p>
                <p>2. That among the few who survive for further propagation, the great majority,
                    under ordinary circumstances, are those which most resemble their parent, and
                    thus the <hi rend="italic">Species</hi> is continued without material
                    variation.</p>
                <p>3. That there are, however, occasions when certain individuals, with slightly
                    diverging characters, may survive and reproduce races, in which these
                    divergencies are continued even with increased intensity, thus producing <hi
                    rend="italic">Varieties.</hi></p>
                <p>4. That in the course of an indefinite number of generations circumstances may
                    induce such an increase in this divergency, that some of these new races will no
                    longer readily propagate with each other, and the varieties become <hi
                    rend="italic">Νeιv Species,</hi> more and more marked as the unaltered or less
                    altered races, descendants of the common parent, have become extinct.</p>
                <p>5. That these species have in their turn become the parents of ≡of species, that
                    is <hi rend="italic">Genera, Orders, he.,</hi> of a higher and grade, according
                    to the remoteness of the common parent, and more or less marked, according to
                    the extinction or preservation of unaltered primary, or less altered
                    intermediate, forms.</p>
                <p>As there is thus no difference but in degree between a variety and a species,
                    between a species and a genus, between a genus and order, all disputes as to the
                    precise grade to which a group really belongs are vain. It is left in a great
                    measure to the judgment of the systematist, with reference as much to the use to
                    be made of his method as to the actual state of things, how far he should go in
                    dividing and subdividing, and to which of the grades of division and subdivision
                    he shall give the names of Orders, Sub-orders, Tribes, Genera, Subgenera,
                    Sections, Species, Sub-species, Varieties, &amp;c., with the consequent
                    nomenclature.</p>
                <p>Such a systematic arrangement is founded on a hypothesis which, so far as the
                    present flora of the globe is concerned, cannot be demonstrated. Conjecture is
                    hazarded as to the present epoch of the earth’s history, by extending back to
                    unlimited ages. If the theory is consistent with what we see around us, and is
                    founded on plausible grounds, then we must think that we have ascertained the
                    plan followed by the great Creator, Designer, and Upholder of all things, that
                    we have been able to ascertain and follow His workings, and the mode an which He
                    has created the diverse plants which have covered our globe in time and space.
                    This new phase of systematic botany, however, requires more definite data to
                    lead to its adoption as an explanation of the plan of creation.</p>
                <p>The Physiology of plants did not keep pace with the advance in Classification.
                    Grew and Malpighi were the earliest discoverers in this department of botany.
                    Hales also contributed to it by his observations on the motion of fluids in
                    plants. The subject of fertilization was one which early excited attention.</p>
                <p>The idea of the existence of separate sexes in plants was entertained in early
                    times, long before separate male and female organs had been demonstrated. The
                    production of Dates in Egypt, by bringing two kinds of flowers into contact,
                    proves that in very remote periods some notions were entertained on the subject.
                    Female Date I ’ alms only were cultivated, and wild ones were brought from the
                    desert in order to fertilize them. Herodotus informs us that the Babylonians
                    knew of old that there were male and female Date-trees, and that the female
                    required the concurrence of the male to become fertile. This fact was also known
                    to the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and other nations of Asia and Africa. The
                    Babylonians suspended male clusters from wild Dates over the females; but they
                    seem to have supposed that the fertility thus produced depended on the presence
                    of small flies among <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n91/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0091-0082"/> the wild flowers, which, by entering the female
                    flowers, caused them to set and ripen. The process was called palmification.
                    Theophrastus, who succeeded Aristotle in his school in the 114th Olympiad,
                    frequently mentions the sexes of plants, but he does not appear to have
                    determined the organs of reproduction. Pliny, who flourished under Vespasian,
                    speaks particularly of a male and female Palm, but his statements were not
                    founded on any real knoλvledge of the organs. From Theophrastus down to
                    Caesalpinus, who died at Rome in 1603, there does not appear to have been any
                    attention paid to the reproductive organs of plants. Caesalpinus had his
                    attention directed to the subject, and he speaks of a halitus or emanation from
                    the male plants causing fertility in the female.</p>
                <p>Grew seems to have been the first to describe, in a paper on the A≡toNiy <hi
                    rend="italic">of Plants,</hi> read before the Royal Society in November 1676,
                    the functions of the stamens and pistils. Up to this period all was vague
                    conjecture. Grew speaks of the <hi rend="italic">attire,</hi> or the stamens, as
                    being the male parts, and refers to conversations with Sir Thomas Millington,
                    Savilian professor at Oxford, to whom the credit of the sexual theory seems
                    really to belong. Grew says that, “when the attire or apices break or open, the
                    globules or dust falls down on the seedcase or uterus, and touches it with a
                    prolific virtue.” Ray adopted Grew’s views, and states various arguments to
                    prove their correctness in the preface to his work on European plants, published
                    in 1694. In 1694 Camerarius, professor of botany and medicine at Tübingen,
                    published a letter on the sexes of plants, in which he refers to the stamens and
                    pistils as the organs of reproduction, and states the difficulties he had
                    encountered in determining the organs of Cryptogamie plants. In 1703 Samuel
                    Morland, in a paper read before the Royal Society, stated that the farina
                    (pollen) is a congeries of seminal plants, one of which must be conveyed into
                    every ovum or seed before it can become prolific. In this remarkable statement
                    he seems to anticipate in part the discoveries afterwards made as to pollen
                    tubes, and more particularly the peculiar views promulgated by Schleiden. In
                    1711 Geoffroy, in a memoir presented to the Royal Academy at Paris, supported
                    the views of Grew and others as to the sexes of plants. He states that the germ
                    is never to be seen in the seed till the apices (anthers) shed their dust; and
                    that if the stamina be cut out before the apices open, the seed will either not
                    ripen, or be barren if it ripens. He mentions two experiments made by him to
                    prove this—one by cutting off the staminal flowers in Maize, and the other by
                    rearing the female plant of Mercurialis apart from the male. In these instances
                    most of the flowers were abortive, but a few were fertile, which he attributes
                    to the dust of the apices having been wafted by the wind from other plants.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus was the next botanical author who took up the subject, and by his sexual
                    system he may be said to have opened a new era in the history of botany. He
                    first published his views in 1736, and he thus writes—“Antheras et stigmata
                    constituere sexum plantarum, a palmicolis, Mill-ingtono, Grewio, Rayo,
                    Camerario, Godofredo, Morlando, Vaillantio. Blairio, Jussievio, Bradleyo,
                    Royeno, Logano, &lt;fcc., detectum, descriptum, et pro infallibili assumptum;
                    nec ullum, apertis oculis considerantem cujuscunque piant« flores, latere
                    potest.” He divided plants into sexual and asexual, the former being
                    Phanerogamous or flowering, and the latter Cryptogamoαs or flowerless. In the
                    latter division of plants he could not detect stamens and pistils, and he did
                    not investigate the mode in which their germs were produced. He was no
                    physiologist, and did not promulgate any views as to the embryogénie process.
                    His followers were chiefly engaged in the arrangement and classification of
                    plants, and while descriptive botany made great advances, the physiological
                    department of the science was neglected. His views were not, however, adopted at
                    once by all, for we find Alston stating arguments against them in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertation on the Sexes of Plants.</hi> Alston’s observations
                    were founded on what occurred in certain unisexual plants, such as Mercurialis,
                    Spinach, Hemp, Hop, and Bryony. The conclusions at which he arrives are those of
                    Pontedera, that the pollen is not in all flowering plants necessary for
                    impregnation, for that fertile seeds can be produced without its influence. He
                    supports parthenogenesis in some plants. Soon after the promulgation of
                    Linnaeus’s method of classification, the attention of botanists was directed to
                    the study of Cryptogamie plants, and the valuable work of Hedwig on the
                    reproductive organs of Mosses made its appearance in 1782. He was one of the
                    first to point out the existence of certain cellular bodies in these plants
                    which appeared to perform the functions of reproductive organs, and to them the
                    name of antheridia and pistillidia were given. This opened up a new field of
                    research, and led the way in the study of Cryptogamie reproduction, which has
                    since been much advanced by the labours of numerous botanical inquirers. The
                    interesting observations of Morland, already quoted, seem to have been
                    neglected, and no one attempted to follow in the path which he had pointed out.
                    Botanists were for a long time content to know that the scattering of the pollen
                    from the anther, and its application to the stigma, were necessary for the
                    production of perfect seed, but the stages of the process of fertilization
                    remained unexplored. The matter seemed involved in mystery, and no one attempted
                    to raise the veil which hung over the subject of embryogeny. The general view
                    was, that the embryo originated in the ovule, which was in some obscure manner
                    fertilized by the pollen.</p>
                <p>In 1815 Treviranus roused the attention of botanists to the development of the
                    embryo, but although he made valuable researches, he did not add much in the way
                    of new information. In 1823 Amici discovered the existence of pollen tubes, and
                    he was followed by Brongniart and Brown. The latter traced the tubes as far as
                    the nucleus of the ovule. These important discoveries mark a new epoch in
                    embryology, and may be said to be the foundation of the views now entertained by
                    physiologists, which have been materially aided by the subsequent elucidation of
                    the process of cytogenesis, or cell-development, by Schleiden, Schwann, Mohl,
                    and others. The whole subject has been investigated recently with great
                    assiduity and zeal by physiologists, as regards both Cryptogamous and
                    Phanerogamous plants. The formation of germinal vesicles in the ovule, and the
                    development of the embryo in flowering plants, have been fully considered by
                    Griffith, Schleiden, Mirbel, Spach, Meyen, Schacht, Mold, Unger, Naudin,
                    Radlkofer, and others; the embryogénie process in Coniferous plants and in the
                    higher Cryptogams by Hofmeister, Henfrey, Suminski, Mettenius, Strasburger,
                    Eichler, Bâillon, Cohn, Pringsheim, Millardet; and that of the lower Cryptogams
                    by Thuret, Bornet, Decaisne, and Tulasne. The observations of Darwin as to the
                    fertilization of Orchids. Primula, Linum, and Lythrum, and the part which
                    insects take in this function, have opened up a new era in Physiological Botany.
                    He has been followed by Hermann Müller. Darwin’s experiments in reference to the
                    movements of climbing and twining plants, and of leaves in insectivorous plants,
                    have opened up a wide field of inquiry which he has cultivated with eminent
                    success and with most important results. Among other authors who have
                    contributed to the advance of Vegetable Physiology may be named Hoffmann, Sachs,
                    Van Tieghem, Prillieux, Dehe-rain, and Famintzen. We have thus been enabled to
                    come to certain general conclusions on this obscure subject, and <pb break="no"

                    path of investigation.</p>
                <p>In the Physiological department of botany the most important researches have been
                    made by French and German botanists. The laboratories in connection with schools
                    in Germany offer facilities for study which do not exist to the same extent in
                    Britain. Physiological researches demand not only a Botanic Garden with its
                    appendages, but apparatus of various kinds, means of prosecuting histological
                    and chemical investigations, physical experiments, and observations by the
                    spectroscope. Our schools require then not only lecture-rooms, but laboratories
                    well fitted up with all needful appliances, and salaried assistants to aid the
                    teachers in their demonstrations and the pupils in their practical work.</p>
                <p>The department of Geographical Botany has made rapid advance by means of the
                    various scientific expeditions which have been sent to all quarters of the
                    globe; and the question of the mode in which the floras of islands and of
                    continents have been formed has given rise to important speculations by such
                    eminent botanical travellers as Darwin and Hooker. The latter has published a
                    valuable paper on insular floras. Under this department the connection between
                    climate and vegetation has been carefully studied both by botanists and by
                    meteorologists. Among the contributors to this department of botany the
                    following authors may be noticed—Humboldt, Schouw, Meyen, Berghaus, Martius,
                    Harvey, Hooker.</p>
                <p>The subject of Palaeontological Botany has been much advanced of late by the
                    researches of botanists and geologists. The use of the microscope in the
                    examination of tissues has aided much in the determination of fossil plants. The
                    more accurate study of Organography has also been the means of correcting errors
                    in diagnosis. The nature of the climate at different epochs of the earth’s
                    history has also been determined from the character of the flora. The works of
                    Brongniart, Goeppert, and Schimper have advanced this department of science.
                    Among others who have contributed valuable papers on the subject may be noticed
                    Heer, who has made observations on the Miocene flora, especially in Arctic
                    regions; Saporta, who has examined the Tertiary flora; Dawson and Lesquereux,
                    who have reported on the Canadian and American fossil plants; and Williamson,
                    who has made a careful examination of many of the coal fossils, and whose
                    excellent drawings of structure have opened a new light on the character of many
                    of the genera. Delineations of fossils by Witham, Lindley and Hutton, and
                    Carruthers, have tended much to advance our knowledge of the fossil flora of
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>Botany may be divided into the following departments :— 1. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Structural</hi> Botany, having reference to the anatomical structure of the

                    various strata of which the earth is composed.</p>
                <p>In the present article we shall confine our attention to the Structure and
                    Morphology of Plants. The limits and classification of the Vegetable Kingdom
                    have been partly considered under <hi rend="smallcaps">Biology</hi> (vol. iii.
                    pp. 690-696). The Classification of Plants will be taken up <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">extenso</hi> under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Vegetable Kingdom,</hi> and the Distribution of Plants in space and time will
                    be treated of in separate articles.</p>
                <p>STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF PLANTS.</p>
                <p>The elementary structure which is the foundation of all vegetable tissue is the
                    <hi rend="italic">cell.</hi> In the young succulent bud of a growing stem each
                    cell consists of an outer firm, elastic membrane of cellulose constituting a <hi
                    rend="italic">cell-wall;</hi> within this, a gelatinous soft mass of <hi
                    rend="italic">protoplasm,</hi> of which there may be a portion distinctly marked
                    off as a <hi rend="italic">nucleus;</hi> and, enclosed by the protoplasm, a
                    cell-cavity containing a more or less watery fluid, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cell-sap</hi> (fig. 1). Such may be taken as the structure of a typical
                    vegetable cell, which is thus a closed vesicle or sac with fluid or semi-fluid
                    contents. Of these elements of the cell the protoplasm is that which is
                    essential for its growth and development. In it are contained all the substances
                    requisite for the formation of the cell-wall and the cell-sap; and the nucleus
                    is merely a differentiated portion of it. From it then all the other parts of
                    the cell are formed, and it is essential to the growth of the cell. Hence it has
                    received the appellation of <hi rend="italic">primordial cell;</hi> and, indeed,
                    amongst many Algae it exists for some time as a separate cell without any
                    cellwall or other part. This must be borne in mind when defining the cell as a
                    sac or vesicle. The growth of the cell is usually, at first, uniform throughout,
                    and it has therefore a more or less rounded form; but, according to the function
                    which it is destined eventually to perform, one or other, or it may be all, of
                    the parts of the cell become modified or specially developed. The cell-wall may
                    be greatly thickened; or it may grow more in one direction than another, so as
                    to be elongated and form protuberances; or perforations may occur; or several
                    similar cells arranged in a longitudinal series may, by obliteration of the
                    interposed septa, unite to form a long tube which is then called a <hi
                    rend="italic">vessel.</hi> The protoplasm in the process of growth may be
                    completely absorbed; and when this occurs growth ceases and the cell-walls form
                    merely a framework. It may, however, remain a long time, assuming various shapes
                    and often uniting with colouring matters. The cell-sap also may disappear or may
                    remain, containing in solution, or as definite forms in its mass, various
                    assimilative substances, as fat granules, oil globules, starch, mineral
                    crystals, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In some plants, as amongst Algae (Protococcus), one cell alone performs all the
                    functions necessary for the existence of the plant. We have thus in this cell an
                    epitome of vegetable life, and this is the most perfect form of cell. As we pass
                    to the higher forms of plants, where many cells are united, we find a
                    physiological specialization taking place, by which certain cells are set apart
                    for assimilation, some being embryonal, some supporting, and others protective,
                    &amp;c. Amongst such plants as Ferns and ordinary Flowering Plants a further
                    differentiation takes place, and some of these cells unite to form true vessels.
                    We thus have a means of arranging all plants in two groups, viz., those whose
                    tissues consist entirely of cells, <hi rend="italic">cellular plants</hi>
                    (including Fungi, Algae, Mosses, &amp;c.); and those in which vessels are
                    present, <hi rend="italic">vascular plants</hi> (including Fems, Lycopods, and
                    ordinary Flowering Plants).</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Cells and Vessels—Cellular and Vascular Tissues.</hi></p>
                <p>Cells united together constitute <hi rend="italic">cellular tissue</hi> (fig.
                    2).</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n93/mode/1up"

                <p>It exists in all plants and abounds in fleshy roots, stems, leaves, and in
                    succulent fruits. It constitutes the pith and outer bark of trees, and is very
                    abundant in the centre of the stem of the Aralia (Fatsia) papyrifera, whence
                    Chinese rice-paper is derived by cutting it into thin sheets. By cultivation the
                    Turnip, Carrot, Cabbage, and other esculent vegetables acquire much cellular
                    tissue, and become tender and succulent. The cells of the tissue vary much in
                    size. In a cubic inch of a leaf of the Carnation there are said to be upwards of
                    three millions of cells. They are frequently seen <hi rend="subscript

                    plants, cells ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅛th and 3 <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>In young cells the cell-wall is a thin membrane consisting of <hi rend="italic"
                    >cellulose,</hi> with some water and a certain amount of incombustible material.
                    It is permeable by water, is slightly extensible and elastic, and is colourless.
                    It dissolves in_ sulphuric acid, and upon addition of iodine and sulphuric acid
                    assumes a deep blue colour. By intussusception of nutrient material, t.β., the
                    interposition of new molecules between those pre-existing, the cell-wall
                    increases both in surface-extent and in thickness. The resulting cellwall is
                    not, however, uniform in its structure, but is composed of lamellae of different
                    refractive power, in which the cellulose is combined alternately with much and
                    with little water. These alternating dense and watery layers,—of which one set
                    is concentric with the cell-wall, whilst two other series are vertical or
                    oblique to the surface of the cellwall, and cut the concentric ones throughout
                    the whole thickness of the wall,—under a high power of the microscope present a
                    series of mutually intersecting lines, and constitute respectively what are
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">stratification</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >striation</hi> of the cell-wall.</p>
                <p>Independently of these changes in the structure of the cell-wall, consequent on
                    its increase in surface-extent and thickness, which will be presently noticed,
                    there are other changes of a chemical nature which take place during the growth
                    of the cell, and which so affect its wall as to break it into distinct “shells,”
                    which differ both chemically and physically from the original cell-wall. Thus,
                    in the epidermis or outer cellular covering of plants, the outermost portion of
                    the outer wall of the cells becomes converted into an elastic substance, quite
                    impervious to water, which acts as a protective covering. This substance is
                    known as cork or cuticular matter. Another alteration is the conversion of the
                    layers of the cell-wall into woody matter, by a process of <hi rend="italic"
                    >lignification,</hi> or formation of wood. Or, again, layers of the cell-wall
                    may be converted into mucilaginous substance, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    absorbing water, and becoming gelatinous, as in the cells of pith of Astragalus
                    Tragacantha,—which furnishes gum tragacanth,—and the outer cells of the seed of
                    the Common Flax. Lastly, mineral matters may be deposited in the cell-wall, such
                    as lime, silica, &amp;c., so abundantly in some instances as to constitute,
                    after burning, a perfect skeleton of the cellwall. In all these cases, however,
                    of alteration of layers of the cell-wall, an innermost layer, giving all the
                    reactions of pure cellulose, may be observed. If growth in surfaceextent
                    proceeded uniformly over the whole of a cell-wall the resulting structure would
                    be a more or less rounded vesicle; but at different points portions grow more
                    rapidly than at others, and thus cells, originally oval or spherical, may become
                    cylindrical, conical, &amp;c. The changes consequent on unequal growth in
                    thickness are, however, much more important, giving rise to altered appearances
                    both on the outside and inside of the cell-wall. The external thickenings are
                    most usually projections in the form of spines, knobs, &amp;c., as in some
                    pollen-grains, and in cilia connected with the reproductive cells of many Algae
                    (tig. 3), or clubshaped hygrometric filaments as in Equisetum (figs. 4, 5);
                    whilst the internal ones are more usually ridges—annular, spiral, or reticulate
                    (figs. 11 and 12)—which may proceed so far as almost to obliterate the cavity of
                    the cell-wall.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">p&gt;rotoplasm,</hi> which lines the interior of the
                    cell-wall, and which is the essential living portion of the cell, consists of
                    albuminous substance mixed with water and some incombustible materials, and it
                    also contains some organic compounds. It is a homogeneous, soft, gelatinous
                    substance. As we usually find it in cells it has a granular and turbid
                    appearance. This arises from an admixture of formative matters, to which the
                    name <hi rend="italic">metaplasm</hi> has been applied. It is coagulated by
                    heat, and is soluble in a dilute solution of caustic potash; iodine solution
                    colours it yellow or brown, whilst strong sulphuric acid at first colours it
                    rose-red, subsequently dissolving it. Usually, at points in the interior, drops
                    of fluid become differentiated as <hi rend="italic">vacuoli</hi> (fig. 6), which
                    may subsequently coalesce, and thus the protoplasm may become a sac containing
                    cell-sap; and if growth of the cell-wall continues the protoplasm eventually
                    forms a mere lining of the cellwall constituting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >primordial utricle</hi> of Von Mohl. The protoplasm in some cells exhibits
                    phenomena of movement within the cellwall of a definite character. Thus in the
                    internodal cells of Characeae (fig. 7) a movement of protoplasm round the
                    longest diameter of the cell is seen, and in the hairs of Tradescantia
                    (Virginian Spiderwort) a circulation of protoplasm occurs. These constitute the
                    phenomena of <hi rend="italic">rotation</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >circulation.</hi></p>
                <p>The nucleus (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">k)</hi> is present in the cells of all the
                    higher plants. It is a small rounded differentiated portion of the protoplasm,
                    and frequently contains vacuoles, which are termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >nucleoli</hi> (fig. 1, H). It may be in the centre of the cell or close to the
                    sides, but it may change its position. Portions of the protoplasm are also
                    differentiated as grains or granules, to which colouring matters are attached;
                    but <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n94/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0094-0085"/> these will be noticed hereafter. The protoplasm
                    in old cells may disappear, and then all growth ceases, and the celh consist of
                    a mere framework; or it may remain, and then growth of the cell continues. And
                    it is by a re-arrangement of the molecules of this protoplasm that the formation
                    of new cells begins,—the nucleus entering also into the process.</p>
                <p>By the term cell-sap is meant the fluid contained in the vacuoli. It consists in
                    great part of water, in which are dissolved various salts, derived from without,
                    and compounds formed by assimilation in the plant itself. Amongst the latter we
                    may mention inulin, a substance closely allied to starch and sugar, found in
                    Composite plants.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">parenchyma</hi> (areolar, utricular, or vesicular
                    tissue) is a general name for any form of cellular tissue, in which thin-walled
                    cells of a diameter nearly equal in every direction are united to one another by
                    broad surfaces (fig. 2). If the cells are pointed at both ends and have a length
                    greatly exceeding their breadth, there is formed <hi rend="italic"
                    >prosenchyma</hi> (fig. 8). Both tissues may be <hi rend="italic">complete</hi>
                    (figs. 2 and 8) or <hi rend="italic">incomplete</hi> (figs. 9 and 10), <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the component cells may touch each other on every side
                    and leave no intercellular spaces, or intercellular spaces may exist between the
                    cells. According to the amount of surface-growth and thickening of the cell-wall
                    various forms of parenchymatous and prosenchymatous tissue result. Thus, in the
                    Rush and Bean we have a stellate parenchyma, with large intercellular spaces
                    (fig. 10), in the Elder pith a complete angular parenchyma (fig 2), and in the
                    succulent stem of the Cactus a spherical incomplete parenchyma (fig. 9). Those
                    forms of tissue in which the individual cells have been altered by thickening of
                    the cell-wall are the most important; and the alterations in the cell-wall
                    consequent on growth in thickness may be such as to produce obliteration of the
                    septum between superposed cells, and their cavities, freely communicating, then
                    give rise to a tube or vessel, a combination of which constitutes the <hi
                    rend="italic">vascular tissue</hi> of authors. Whilst this is the nature of a
                    true vessel, considerable confusion has arisen from the term being applied to
                    any cell-like structure in which the longitudinal diameter exceeds the
                    transverse; and thus the difference between a cell and a vessel became one of
                    length only. The term vessel ought to be restricted to such as are formed by
                    coalescence of cells.</p>
                <p>Under the term <hi rend="italic">pleurenchyma</hi> (fig. 8) is included tissue '
                    composed of such elongated prosenchymatous, flexible, ’ thickened cells, as are
                    found in the bast or phloem layers of ordinary trees. They also occur in the
                    wood portion. Their walls are thickened regularly, and they constitute when
                    united what is commonly known as the woody or bast fibre. The diameter of the
                    woody fibres varies from y7⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th to 2⅞(<hi
                    rend="subscript"> j</hi> th of an inch. The materials used for ropes and
                    cordage, linen, certain Indian muslins, mummy-cloths, and mats consist of the
                    woody fibre of plants from which the more delicate tissues have been removed by
                    maceration in water. Flax or lint is thus procured from the bark of Linum
                    usitatissimum, hemp from Cannabis sativa, New Zealand flax from Phormium tenax,
                    Pita flax from Agave americana, Sun-hemp from Hibiscus cannabinus, and bass or
                    bast from the common Lime or Linden-tree. Fibres are also procured for
                    manufacture from the Pine-apple plant (Ananassa sativa), from Yucca gloι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> iosa, from Büh-meria nivca, which yields the Indian
                    Rheea fibre, from most of the plants belonging to the Mallow and Nettle tribes,
                    and from some Leguminous plants, such as Crotalaria juncea, which supplies a
                    kind of Bengal hemp. If the maceration of the fibre is carried to a great
                    extent, a pulp is formed from which paper is manufactured. Pleurenchyma does not
                    occur in cellular plants, such as Lichens, Sea-weeds, and Mushrooms. The tissues
                    of these plants speedily disappear under the action of water, and hence,
                    perhaps, the reason of their rarity in a fossil state. In the very young state
                    woody cells are delicate, and it is only in proportion as they attain maturity
                    that their walls acquire a thick consistence. In the sap-wood of ordinary trees
                    the woody cells are thickened in their walls, but are pervious; while in the
                    heart-wood they are rendered solid by the thickening matter, which is often
                    variously coloured.</p>
                <p>If the thickening of the cell-wall takes place so that a network, ring, or spiral
                    of thickening matter is formed, then the cells are <hi rend="italic"
                    >reticulated, annular</hi> (fig. 11), or <hi rend="italic">spiral</hi> (fig.
                    12), as in the leaves of Sphagnum, hairs of Cactaceae, and seed-coat of
                    Casuarina. In these cells the spiral thickening frequently becomes loosened from
                    the cell-wall as a spiral fibre, and can be unrolled. Such forms occur in the
                    outer covering of the seed of Collomia linearis and of the fruit of Salvia
                    Verbenaca. In these, when placed in water, the spirals rupture the softened
                    membrane of the cells, and spread outwards. The spongy elastic character of the
                    outer cellular covering of the roots of tropical Orchids and Araceae, of the
                    sepals of Illecebrum verticillatum, of the pericarp of Cachrys Morisoni and C.
                    odontalgica, and of the ribs of the fruit of Aethusa Cynapium, is due to the
                    presence of spiral cells. In the reproductive cells of Hepaticae spiral fibres
                    called <hi rend="italic">elaters</hi> are found in connection with the spores.
                    Reticulated or netted cells, produced by fibres forming a sort of mesh or
                    network, occur in the wing of the seed of Swietenia, in the pericarp of
                    Picridium tingitanum and P. vulgare, in the seed-coat of Cucurbita Pepo, in the
                    parenchyma of the leaf of Sanseviera guineensis, and in isolated cells of the
                    pith of Rubus odoratus and of Erythrina Corallodendron.</p>
                <p>If spiral, annular, or reticulated cells are arranged in a longitudinal series,
                    and the septum between adjoining cells gives way, then we have a spiral,
                    annular, or reticulated vessel (figs. 13, 15, 16) formed, and to this tissue
                    authors have given the name <hi rend="italic">trachenchyma,</hi> on account of
                    its resemblance to the tracheae or air-tubes of animals. These vessels vary from
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> √ <hi rend="subscript"> ιrσ</hi> th to <hi

                    wall of the vessel may become loosened from the membrane of the wall and form a
                    spiral fibre in the interior. These fibres are elastic, usually rounded and
                    simple; but sometimes two or more are combined so as to form a flat baud. These
                    flat ribands, consisting of fibres which vary in number from two to twenty-five,
                    or more, are met with abundantly in the stems of Bananas and Plantains, and in
                    the shoots of Asparagus. The spiral in such cases is called compound, and the
                    vessels <hi rend="italic">pleiotracheoe.</hi> The spiral fibres have such
                    tenacity that when the vessels are ruptured they can be pulled out. This
                    capability of being unrolled characterizes true spiral vessels (fig. 13). When
                    the spiral is not loosened from the cell-wall and cannot therefore be unrolled,
                    it is said to be <hi rend="italic">closed.</hi> On breaking the young shoots or
                    leaf-stalks of the Geranium, Strawberry, and Rose, or the leaves of the
                    Hyacinth, Amaryllis, and Banana, and pulling the parts gently asunder, the
                    fibres can be easily seen in the form of· a fine cobweb. When the aerial stems
                    of the Banana and Plantain are cut across, the spiral fibres may be pulled out
                    in large quantity so as to be used for tinder. Generally, the coils or volutions
                    of the fibre are said to be left-handed, that is, turning to the left of a
                    person supposed to be in the axis. In the garden Lettuce vessels are met with,
                    some having the fibre turning to the left, others to the right. In the Scarlet
                    Bean the coils of the fibres are left-handed, while the plant itself turns to
                    the right in twining. Spiral vessels are abundant in young plants and shoots,
                    while in the hard stems of trees and shnιbs they chiefly surround the pith.
                    Spiral vessels occasionally exhibit a branched appearance. This may arise from
                    the union of separate vessels, or it may depend on a regular division of the
                    fibres, as is seen in the Mistleto, House-leek, and Gourd (fig. 14). <hi
                    rend="italic">Annular</hi> vessels are those in which the thickening (or, if it
                    be loosened from the wall of the vessel, the fibre) is in the form of rings
                    (fig. 15). These rings in Mammillaria quadrispina, and in some other plants of
                    the Cactus tribe, are very thick, and leave only a small canal in the centre of
                    the vessel. Annular vessels are from - <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅜ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th to <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi

                    >reticulated</hi> vessels (fig. 16) the thickenings take the form of a network.
                    All vessels of this type lose very early their protoplasmic contents, and serve
                    to convey air.</p>
                <p>In the process of thickening of the cell-wall, if large spaces of the cell-wall
                    remain thin, and the thickening mass growing in a circular manner projects into
                    the interior of the cell and gradually arches over the thin portion of
                    cell-wall, a dome-shaped cavity is enclosed betwixt the thin cell-wall and the
                    thickening mass. The growing thickening mass gradually contracts the opening
                    into this cavity, but never completely closes it. On front view this presents
                    the appearance of two concentric circles, an outer marking the edge of the
                    original thin portion of the cell-wall, and an inner indicating the under edge
                    of the gradually contracting ring of thickening matter (fig. 17). When this
                    process takes place on opposite sides of the partition wall between two cells,
                    there are then two similar cavities separated by the thin partition wall of the
                    cells, each communicating freely by a small circular aperture with the cell in
                    which it has been formed (figs. 17 and 18). In process of growth the partition
                    wall is absorbed, and then a lenticular cavity is formed, connected by a
                    circular aperture on each side with adjacent cells (fig. 19). When viewed by
                    transmitted light these present the appearance seen in fig. 17 <hi rend="italic"
                    >t';</hi> such structures are termed <hi rend="italic">bordered pits,</hi> and a
                    collection of such cells constitutes the <hi rend="italic">disk-bearing or
                    punctated tissue</hi> of authors. It is well seen in Firs and other conebearing
                    plants. It has been called <hi rend="italic">glandular</hi> tissue. In the case
                    of some fossil woods, pieces of silica, like double convex lenses, have been
                    found in the cavities. When a vertical radial section is made of the stem of
                    Fir, bordered pits, arranged in two rows, with individual pits on the same
                    level, are seen. In Araucaria double and triple alternating rows are seen;
                    whilst in the Yew a prominent striation line winding spirally amongst the pits
                    is noticeable. When the thickening begins by the formation of transverse ridges
                    extending right across the wall of the cell, and the inwardly projected ridges
                    gradually arch over the thin membranous portion of the wall, a narrow fissure
                    only is left leading into the cavity enclosed by the thickening masses and the
                    thin portion of the partition wall, on the opposite side of which a similar
                    process lias proceeded. By the absorption of the partition wall a single cavity
                    between two cells is thus produced, communicating with both, just as in the last
                    case. Viewed by transmitted light these present an appearance like rungs of a
                    ladder, and hence the name <hi rend="italic">scalariforrn</hi> applied to the
                    cells in which they occur (fig. 20). They are specially seen in Ferns, where
                    they give rise to long prismatic vessels.</p>
                <p>When the thickening takes place over nearly the whole of the cell-wall, thin
                    portions may be left here and there, which appear as pits when viewed by
                    transmitted light, <pb break="no"

                    thick. Such cells are termed <hi rend="italic">porous</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pitted</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dotted</hi> cells (fig. 21). In old cells,
                    after the protoplasm has disappeared, the portiou of the cell-wall which
                    remained thin is often absorbed, and thus there is a true perforation of the
                    cell-wall. These perforations often occur in groups both upon the cell-wall and
                    upon the septum between superposed cells, and give rise to a remarkable
                    sieve-like structure, in which case they are termed <hi rend="italic">sieve
                    cells</hi> The <hi rend="italic">latticed cells</hi> of some authors are of a
                    similar nature. When superposed porous or sieve cells coalesce by complete
                    obliteration of the septum, then a <hi rend="italic">pitted vessel, sieve
                    tube,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">duct</hi> is formed (fig. 22). These ducts are
                    usually of a larger size than other ves sels; they are well seen in the inner
                    phloem layers and in the wood of trees, and they constitute the large rounded
                    openings which are seen in the transverse section of the stems of the Oak,
                    Poplar, Willow, àc. They also abound in the Bamboo (fig. 23), and in other
                    plants of rapid growth. The names of <hi rend="italic">bothrenchyma</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">taplιrenchyma</hi> have been given to a tissue composed of such
                    cells. Not unfrequently contractions are visible on the outside of the vessel
                    (fig. 22), indicating its formation by coalescence of superposed cells. To
                    vessels exhibiting contractions of this kind, whether spiral or pitted, the
                    terms <hi rend="italic">moniliform,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vermiform</hi>
                    have been applied; and the tissue composed of these moniliform vessels has been
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">phleboidal.</hi> In the ducts of many plants a
                    remarkable appearance is produced by the protrusion, through the perforations
                    into the cavity of the vessel, of portions of the adjoining cells, or, before
                    its absorption, of the portion of partition-wall closing the pit. These portions
                    appear as cells filling the interior of the vessel, and are described under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">tylosis</hi> (fig. 24). It is well seen in the Walnut,
                    Chestnut, Oak, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Latιciferous</hi> vessels (fig 25) consist of long branchbig

                    the veins of animals. They are the <hi rend="italic">milk</hi> vessels and the
                    <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> vessels of old authors. They receive their name
                    from containing an emulsion called <hi rend="italic">latex,</hi> of a granular
                    nature, often milky or coloured. They are seen in the Indiarubber and
                    Gutta-percha plants, the Mudar plant, the Cow-tree, Spurges, Dandelion, Lettuce,
                    Chicory, and Celandine, frequently containing a large quantity of caoutchouc.
                    Usually these vessels are thin-walled, but sometimes slightly thickened. They
                    are found most abundantly in the phloem layers—rarely in the xylem or wood
                    layers (Papayaceae). They are the result of the coalescence of anastomosing or
                    rectilinear rows of cells, and sometimes they seem to have resulted from the
                    conversion of other vessels. In some Araceae they seem to represent spiral
                    vessels. In Asclepiadaceae they are evidently bast-fibres. Some consider them as
                    merely intercellular canals. The milky sap of Euphorbia phosphorea is said to be
                    luminous. The latex exhibits movements which have given origin to the name <hi
                    rend="italic">cinen-chyma</hi> applied to laticiferous tissue by some authors.
                    Those movements, classed under the name <hi rend="italic">cyclosis,</hi> must
                    not be confounded w ith the motion of protoplasm in cells which is designated
                    rotation.</p>
                <p>We have seen that the cellular tissue is sometimes incomplete, that is, the cells
                    do not touch on every side (fig. 9). The intervening spaces are called <hi
                    rend="italic">intercellular spaces,</hi> and these may be either circumscribed
                    cavities called <hi rend="italic">lacunoe,</hi> or they may extend for some
                    length through the tissue as <hi rend="italic">intercellular canals;</hi> but
                    these two structures pass into one another. In the earliest stage of development
                    the tissue is always complete, and these spaces are formed subsequently by a
                    splitting of the partition or common wall of the cells, and they may
                    subsequently be increased in size by an absorption of the investing cells. These
                    lacunae and canals may contain air, especially iu aquatic plants, to give them
                    buoyancy, as in Potamogeton (fig. 26), or they may be receptacles for various
                    secretions, and when they exist as canals they usually aid in conducting sap.
                    The intercellular canals are exceedingly well seen in coniferous plants, where
                    they constitute resin passages, forming a continuous system throughout the
                    plant, and arranged at intervals in concentric circles in the xylem or wood

                <p><hi rend="italic">Chlorophyll</hi> is the green colouring-matter of plants. It
                    occurs in the cells of the superficial parts of plants united with small
                    portions of the protoplasm <hi rend="italic">(chlorophyll bodies),</hi> which
                    are combined into grains of various forms. Starch-grains are usually abundant iu
                    the chlorophyll bodies. Chlorophyll is soluble in alcohol and ether. It consists
                    of four substances, two yellow and two green, which possess distinct optical
                    properties. It gives a black band in the red of the spectrum. Physiologically it
                    is very important. It is developed under the action of light, and undergoes
                    changes according to its state of oxygenation. Hence the varied tints of leaves
                    in autumn. Numerous colouring matters occur in plants, especially in flowers,
                    and all such when not green are included under the general term <hi

                    chemically of carbon and the elements of water (hydrogen and oxygen), its

                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, occurs in the form of fine grains, more or less
                    oval or rounded, which vary in diameter from the <hi rend="subscript"> τδ</hi> ⅛

                    the addition of iodine; the other form, <hi rend="italic">starch cellulose,</hi>
                    is less soluble, and gives a yellow or brown colour with iodine; but the former
                    is most abundant in the grain. The individual grains either lie distinct from
                    each other iu the cells, as in the Potato, Wheat, and Fea, or they are
                    aggregated so as to form compound grains, as in West Indian Arrowroot, obtained
                    from Maranta arundinacea, and Portland Sago, procured from Arum maculatum.
                    Grains of starch present a very characteristic concentrically striated
                    appearance (fig. 27). This is the result of their mode of formation. The poiut
                    round which the striae are arranged is called the <hi rend="italic">hilum.</hi>
                    Starch is accumulated in the internal, and ofteu in the subterranean parts of
                    plants. It occurs abundantly in fleshy roots, and in stems, as well as in seeds
                    and fruits, and is easily separated by washing. The ordinary cultivated grains
                    yield starch in considerable quantity; so also do the Potato, Arrowroot, and
                    Cassava plants, the Sago-palms, and Banana fruit. That procured from the
                    Arrowroot plant consists of dull white grains; while that from the Potato, and
                    from various species of Canna supply ing tous-les-mois, is in the form of large
                    shining particles. Sago and Tapioca are granulated forms of starch, the former
                    being procured from the cells of various species of Sagus and Metroxylon, the
                    latter from the Cassava plant The existence of starch in the bark and young wood
                    of trees, such as the Birch and Pine, renders them useful as articles of food in
                    cold countries. Lichenin is a form of starch existing in the cells of Iceland
                    moss and other lichens; while inulin, which occurs dissolved in the cell-sap, is
                    the starchy matter supplied by the roots of the Dahlia, Dandelion, and
                    Elecampane. By the action of prolonged heat, as well as by the addition of
                    dilute sulphuric acid, or of malt, starch is converted into a soluble gummy
                    substance called dextrin. The same change occurs during germination or the
                    sprouting of the seed. Oily matters occur as drops in the interior of cells,
                    usually associated with starchy substances or with albuminoids. These latter
                    exist as small granules or large rounded masses with definite chemical and
                    optical properties, and are termed <hi rend="italic">aleurone grains.</hi> They
                    are frequently associated with a crystalline arrangement of portions of the
                    protoplasm of the cell known as <hi rend="italic">crystalloids.</hi> Sugar
                    occurs abundantly in the sap of plants. When pure and in a solid state this
                    substance is crystalline and soluble in water; but it also occurs in an
                    uncrystallized form. There are two marked varieties of it. Cane-sugar, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4a</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 11</hi>, procured from the Sugar-cane, Sugar-maple, Beet, Carrot, &amp;c.; and
                    grape-sugar, occurring iu numerous fruits, as Grapes, Gooseberries, Currants,
                    Peaches, and Apricots The formula for grape-sugar is C <hi rend="subscript">
                    β</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> li</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> During the
                    sprouting of the seed, starch is converted into grape-sugar, and a similar
                    change is induced by the action of malt, or of any ferment. A sweet substance
                    (not a true sugar), called Mannite, is procured from the Manua-ash (Ornus
                    europaea) as well as from various sea-weeds, from species of Eucalyptus, and
                    from the Dandelion. Gum or mucilage'is another substance found in vegetable
                    tissues. When pure it is clear, soluble in water and also in dilute acids, but
                    not soluble in alcohol or ether. It is one or the torms through which vegetable
                    matter passes in being applied to the purposes of plant life. It exists largely
                    in the vegetable juices. From the bark of many trees it is procured in the form
                    of an exudation. Two well-marked kinds of gum are met with,—arabin, soluble in
                    cold water, constituting the chief ingredient of gum-arabic, procured from
                    various species of Acacia; and cerasin, insoluble in cold water, but readily
                    soluble in boiliug water, constituting the gummy secretion obtained from the
                    Cherry and Plum. A substance called bassorin, or vegetable jelly, is found in
                    Tragacanth, the roots of some Orchids, as well as in Carrageen (Chondrus
                    crispus), and other sea-weeds. It is allied to gum, but differs iu swelling up
                    and becoming gelatinous when mixed with water. Another gum-like substance called
                    pectin exists in the juice of the Apple, Pear, and other pulpy fruits. It is
                    changed by the action of alkalies into pectic acid, which is found in many
                    fruits and such succulent roots as Carrot, Turnip, Beet, &amp;c. Oils, Fats, and
                    Resins occur in cells of plants, or in special canals or glands as products of
                    assimilation. The oils are either fixed or volatile,—the former being divided
                    into drying, fatty, and solid, while the latter are distinguished according as
                    they consist of carbon and hydrogen alone, or of these elements combined with
                    oxygen or with sulphur. Resinous matter occurs in the form either of fluid
                    balsams, or of the various kinds of solid resin and pitch. In the rind of the
                    Orange and Lemon glands of oil occur (fig. 28). Turpentine canals are met with
                    in the wood of Pines; and Vittae, or oil-canals, in the fruit of Umbelliferous
                    plants, such as the Coriander. In the fleshy covering of the fruit of the Olive
                    there are numerous oil-cells. The fruit of the Guinea-palm yields a solid oil,
                    called palm-oil. The dotted appearance of the leaves of the Orange, Myrtle,
                    Eucalyptus, and St John’s Wort, depends on the presence of numerous cells or
                    cavities containing essential oil.</p>
                <p>As allied to these secretions, we may notice caoutchouc, which is found in the
                    milky juice of plants, especially those belonging to the Fig, Spurge, and
                    Dogbane orders. The trees most prolific in this substance are Siphonia elastica,
                    Urceola elastica, and Urostigma elasticum. Guttapercha is the concrete milky
                    juice of the Taban plant (Isonandra Gutta). Wax is also found in the tissues of
                    plants, and it frequently occurs as a secretion on the stems, as in the Wax
                    Palm, and on the surface of fruits, as in the bloom or glaucous secretion of the
                    Plum and the Candleberry Myrtle. Crystals of lime salts occur in the interior of
                    cells, and also in the cell-walls of plants. They <pb break="no"

                    oxalic acids, and are in many plants very abundant. In Monocotyledons they
                    usually assume the form of needle-like crystals, and are termed <hi
                    rend="italic">raphides;</hi> they consist of oxalate of lime (fig. 29). They are
                    remarkably well seen in the Banana. The Squill bulb and the bulb of the Onion
                    exhibit raphidian cells, which are easily separated during the decay of the
                    plants. The crystals are also arranged in a conglomerate form (fig. 30), as may
                    be seen in the root of Turkey Rhubarb, to which they impart grittiness; and in
                    Old-Man-Cactus they constitute 60 to 80 per cent, of the dried tissue. In ä
                    siugle cell of the Poke (Phytolacca decandra) twenty to thirty crystals may be
                    seen. In the epidermal cells of species of Ficus, and other allied plants,
                    prolongations inward of the cell-wall occur, at the extremity of which small
                    crystals of carbonate of lime are deposited (fig. 31); to these the name <hi
                    rend="italic">cystoliths</hi> has been applied. Siliceous matter occurs in the
                    walls of cells, as in Grasses and Horsetails, and especially in Diatomaceae.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Integumentary System.</hi></p>
                <p>A more or less marked division of the tissues into an outer layer bounding an
                    inner mass is visible in all plants. Amongst the lower cellular plants this
                    division is not very distinct; the circumferential cells are perhaps only a
                    little smaller and more compacted than those near the centre. The higher
                    cellular plants, however, exhibit great diversity. In them the cells of the
                    circumference may be arranged in layers so as to constitute a true epidermis,
                    the component cells having a definite relation to one another and to the
                    exterior in the respective families. In all vascular plants an epidermis is
                    found. In many cases, however, it is difficult to recognize it, as in the stems
                    of submerged plants and in most roots. It usually consists of a single thin
                    layer of cells closely compacted, and leaving no interspaces except at definite
                    points <hi rend="italic">{stomata'),</hi> where openings lead into intercellular
                    cavities. The cells composing this layer have their outer wall much thickened,
                    the inner wall remaining thin, and they contain no starch or granular matter,
                    and usually are colourless. In many aquatic plants, however, and in Ferns,
                    chlorophyll is present. The apparent colour of the epidermis depends on that of
                    the parenchymatous cells below, from which it can be separated as a colourless
                    layer. Sometimes the cell-sap of the epidermal cells has a red tinge. The outer
                    lamella of the outermost cell-wall of the epidermal cells usually becomes
                    cuticular or corky, and thus is formed an external separable layer or <hi
                    rend="italic">cuticle</hi> upon the surface of the <hi rend="italic">epidermis
                    proper.</hi> This layer has different chemical properties from the epidermis,
                    being insoluble in sulphuric acid. Upon this cuticle wax is frequently deposited
                    in various forms, serving as a protective from moisture; of this nature is the
                    bloom of the Plum. The cuticle in aquatic plants is very thin; in aerial plauts
                    it is much thicker. The single layer of cells forming the epidermis is not
                    unfrequently strengthened by the addition to the inside of other layers of
                    cells. In the leaves of Begonia, Ficus, and the outer coveriug <hi rend="italic"
                    >{velamen)</hi> of the aerial roots of Orchids, this constitutes the <hi
                    rend="italic">hypoderma,</hi> the cells being of various forms. It is well seen
                    also in vascular Cryptogams, many Bromeliaceae, Ilex, &amp;c. On those parts of
                    the plant •which live long and have vigorous growth in thickness the efficacy of
                    the epidermis as a protective covering is increased by a large formation of
                    cork. Each epidermal cell divides into an outer and an inner cell. The former at
                    once becomes a cork cell, losing all its succulent matter; the latter remains
                    capable of division. When a layer of these merismatic cells occurs we have a <hi
                    rend="italic">cork cambium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">phellogen.</hi> If several
                    layers of cork cells be formed a <hi rend="italic">cork tissue</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">periderm</hi> is the result, which supersedes the epidermis, and
                    which from variations in the several layers may be stratified. Not unfrequently
                    the phellogen cells, in addition to giving off cork cells outwardly, give rise
                    on the inner face to cells containing chlorophyll; and if a layer of such is
                    formed it is termed a <hi rend="italic">phelloderm.</hi> In such cases the
                    phellogen lies between the phelloderm and the periderm. If phellogen lamellae
                    are formed deeper in the tissues of the plant, the internal layers of tissue
                    become dry and constitute the bark. Periderm is thus replaced by bark. One
                    important character of the epidermis is the presence of <hi rend="italic"
                    >stomata</hi> or breathing-pores. These exist abundantly upon the stems and
                    leaves of plants; they also occur on the parts of the flowers; but they are
                    absent from all root structures, though present on underground axial structures.
                    Each consists of a central pore bounded by two or more cells (guard-cells),
                    which contain chlorophyll, starch, and matters distinct from the surrounding
                    epidermal cells. The pore has various forms, and opens „</p>

                    concave edge, where two other <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n99/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0099-0090"/> smaller cells overlie them, with their upper
                    walls raised as ridges running at right angles to the stoma. This gives the
                    stoma a fringed appearance, hence called pectinate. The mode of formation of a
                    stoma is an interesting process, resulting from the division of a single
                    epidermal cell. Preparatory to the complete formation of the mother-cell of the
                    stomatic guard-cells, divisions may take place in the epidermal cells by which
                    numerous or few cells are formed surrounding this mother-cell. In the
                    mother-cell a partition wall is developed (fig. 35, s). A thickening of the
                    partition wall occurs, and eventually in the central portion a fissure makes its
                    appearance, which gradually increases in size (fig. 36). It does not, however,
                    pass throughout the whole extent of the partition wall. An opening or stoma is
                    thus formed, bounded on each side by a single guard-cell, leading into an
                    intercellular space in the parenchyma beneath. If we suppose the mother-cell to
                    be divided by numerous vertical septa we should have a stoma surrounded by many
                    guardcells, as occurs in some Hepaticae; and in this family, after the formation
                    of the fissure a series of horizontal septa appear in the guard-cell, and thus
                    the stomatic opening becomes a canal. In Ceratopteris thalictroides the stoma is
                    bounded by three cells,—two of which, in their open condition, are crescentic
                    and concave inwardly, while the third surrounds them, except for a small space
                    at the end of the long axis of the stoma, and has on this account been called
                    <hi rend="italic">peristomatic.</hi> In Urostigma elasticum four cells form the
                    stoma. Subsequent changes in the surrounding epidermal cells may cause
                    alterations in their relations to the stomata. Thus, in the Oleander (fig. 37)
                    the epidermis develops so as to sink the stoma within a ciliated cavity; in
                    other cases the stomata are raised on pillars. The guardcells have a power of
                    opening or closing the orifice of the stoma; when moistened they swell and curve
                    outward, and leave a free opening; when dry they collapse and their edges are
                    straightened, and they close the orifice. Stomata are most abundant on the under
                    surface of leaves. Their number varies from 200 to 160,000 or more in a square
                    inch of surface. In the leaves of the White Lily there are 60,000 in a square
                    inch on the under surface, and about 3000 on the upper; on the leaves of the
                    Cherry-Laurel there are 90,000 on the lower surface, and none on the upper.</p>
                <p>Upon the epidermis and as outgrowths from it are found certain appendages. These
                    are hairs, scales, prickles, &amp;c., and all have been embraced under the
                    general name <hi rend="italic">trichome.</hi> Hairs <hi rend="italic">(pili</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">villi')</hi> are productions each of an epidermal cell,
                    having typically an elongated or conical form, and covered by the cuticle. They
                    are erect or oblique, or they lie parallel to the surface, and are appressed.
                    Sometimes they are formed of a single cell, which is simple and undivided (fig.
                    38), or forked (fig. 39), or branched; at other times they are composed of many
                    cells, either placed end to end, as in moniliform or necklace-like hairs (fig·
                    40), or united together laterally, and gradually forming a cone, as in compound
                    or branched hairs. When the branches of a hair proceed from a common centre, it
                    is stellate or radiated (fig. <hi rend="italic">41, a,</hi> δ), as in hairs of
                    the Mallow tribe, in those of Deutzia scabra, and those on the stem of the
                    Rice-paper plant (Fatsia papyrifera). When stellate hairs are flattened out, so
                    as to form a sort of membranous expansion (fig. <hi rend="italic">44),</hi> a
                    <hi rend="italic">scale or scurf</hi> is produced. In Bromeliaceae the s
                    curliness of the leaves is a marked character. To such expansions of the
                    epidermis the name <hi rend="italic">lepis</hi> is applied, and the surface is
                    said to be <hi rend="italic">lepidote.</hi> These scales have sometimes a
                    beautiful silvery appearance, as in Elaeagnus and Sea-buckthorn (fig. 44).
                    Surrounding the base of the leaves of Ferns a brown chaffy substance occurs,
                    consisting of elongated cells, to which the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ramentaceous hairs,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ramenta,</hi> has been given. In
                    Palms also a similar substance but of a fibrous texture occurs, called <hi
                    rend="italic">reticulum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mattulla. Setae</hi> are
                    bristles or stiff hairs, and the surfaces on which they occur are said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">setose</hi> or <hi rend="italic">setaceous.</hi> Some hairs, as
                    those of Drosera</p>
                <p>(Sundew), have one or more spiral fibres in their interior. When the cells of
                    hairs are hardened by thickening of the cell-wall, as in the Rose and Bramble,
                    they are called Prickles <hi rend="italic">(aculei).</hi> By some these are not
                    considered as hairs, but are termed <hi rend="italic">emergencies,</hi> inasmuch
                    as they arise from a collection of cells, not from one epidermal cell. Various
                    names have been given to the different forms of hairs. They are <hi
                    rend="italic">clavate,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">club-shaped,</hi> gradually
                    expanding from the base to their apex; <hi rend="italic">capitate</hi> (fig.
                    42), having a distinct rounded head; <hi rend="italic">rough</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">scabrous,</hi> with slight projections on their surface; <hi
                    rend="italic">lvoohed</hi> or <hi rend="italic">uncinate,</hi> with a hook at
                    their apex pointing downwards and to one side; <hi rend="italic">barbed</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">glochidiate,</hi> with two or more hooks around the apex; <hi
                    rend="italic">shield-like</hi> or <hi rend="italic">peltate,</hi> when attached
                    by their middle, and projecting horizontally on either side, as in Malpighia
                    urens (fig. 45), and in many Cruciferous plants; <hi rend="italic">cilia,</hi>
                    when surrounding the margin of leaves. On the pod of the Cowitch (Mucuna
                    pruriens) hairs are produced with projections on their surface, which cause
                    irritation of the skin. In Venus’s Fly-trap (Dionaea muscipula) stiff hairs
                    exist on the blades of the leaf (fig. 46), which, when touched, induce their
                    closure.</p>
                <p>Hairs occur on various parts of plants,—on the stem, leaves, flowers,
                    seed-vessels, and seeds, and even in the interior of vessels. In the interior of
                    the spathe of some Palms numerous ovate cells, analogous with hairs, occur in
                    clusters, and can, when the spathe is dried, be shaken out in the form of
                    powder. Cotton consists of the hairs surrounding the seeds of Gossypium
                    herbaceum and other species of the genus. These when fresh are elongated tubular
                    cells; when dried their walls collapse and they appear twisted. Hairs are
                    occasionally developed to a great extent on plants exposed to elevated
                    temperatures, as well as on those growing at high altitudes. When they occur on
                    the organs of reproduction they are connected with fertilization, as the hairs
                    on the style of Goldfussia, and the retractile hairs on the style of
                    Campanula.</p>

                <p>Different organa of plants are transformed into hairs,—as may be seen in the

                    Compositae.</p>
                <p>Names are given to the surfaces of plants according to the presence or absence of
                    hairs, as well as the nature of the hairs which cover them The following are the
                    more important terms ·— <hi rend="italic">Glabrous,</hi> smooth, having no
                    hairs; <hi rend="italic">hairy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pilose,</hi> furnished
                    with hairs <hi rend="italic">; pubescent,</hi> covered with soft, short, downy
                    hairs; <hi rend="italic">villous,</hi> having long, weak, often oblique hairs:
                    <hi rend="italic">sericeous,</hi> covered with long, closely oppressed hairs,
                    having a silky lustre; <hi rend="italic">hispid,</hi> covered with long harsh or
                    stiff hairs not appressed , <hi rend="italic">hirsute,</hi> having long
                    tolerably distinct hairs, not harsh nor appressed; <hi rend="italic"
                    >velvety</hi> or <hi rend="italic">velutinous,</hi> with a dense covering of
                    short down, like velvet; <hi rend="italic">tomentose,</hi> covered with crisp,
                    rather rigid, entangled hairs like cotton, which form a sort of felt <hi
                    rend="italic">(tomentum); woolly,</hi> with long curled and matted hairs like
                    wool; <hi rend="italic">bearded</hi> or <hi rend="italic">stupose,</hi> when
                    hairs occur in small tufts. The hairs which are most frequently met with in
                    plants are called <hi rend="italic">lymphatic,</hi> from their not being
                    connected with any peculiar secretion. Those, on the other hand, which have
                    secreting cells at their base (fig. 43) or apex, are denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">glandular,</hi> and are not to be distinguished from glands. On
                    young roots cellular projections occur, which may be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >radical</hi> hairs. Young leaves and buds are frequently covered with
                    protecting hairs. On the parts of the flower, as in the Iris, coloured hairs
                    occur which have been called <hi rend="italic">corolline</hi></p>
                <p>In connection with the epidermal appendages we may notice glands, although they
                    may occur in any tissue. A gland consists of a single cell or a collection of
                    cells secreting substances different from those contained in the surrounding
                    cells, In the former case the gland is simple, in the latter it is compound. In
                    compound glands it frequently happens that the walls of the inner cells are
                    absorbed, and thus the gland has only a single cavity, as in the glands of the
                    Orange rind (fig. 28); these are termed <hi rend="italic">vesicular.</hi> The
                    secretion of the glands may be stored in their interior, as in Orange rind, and
                    in the leaves of Lauras Camphora, or it may be exuded as in Lychnis viscaria,
                    and in the nectaries of Fritillaria imperialis (fig. 50). Hairs serve as ducts
                    through which the secretion of glands is discharged. Such hairs are seen in the
                    Nettle (fig. 43), in Loasa or Chili Nettle, and in Malpighia (fig. 45), and are
                    commonly called stings <hi rend="italic">(stimuli).</hi> In the Nettle they are
                    formed of a single conical cell, dilated at its base, and closed at first at the
                    apex by a small globular disk placed obliquely. This disk breaks off on the
                    slightest touch, when the sharp extremity of the hair enters the skin, and pours
                    into the wound the irritating fluid which has been pressed out from the elastic
                    epidermal cells at the base. When a nettle is grasped with violence, the sting
                    is crushed, and hence no injury is done to the skin. The glandular enlarged apex
                    of hairs sometimes exudes a viscid secretion, as in the Chinese Primrose and in
                    the Sundew. The hairs of the latter plant, by this secretion, detain insects
                    which happen to alight on them. The hairs gradually close on the insects,
                    electrical phenomena taking place during the movement, and then the secretion
                    from the glands becoming acid, an action takes place upon the organic matter
                    analogous to that of the pepsin of the gastric juice, by which it is rendered
                    soluble, and is eventually absorbed by the plant. A similar property is
                    possessed by the secretion from the glands upon the surface of the leaf of
                    Venus’s Fly-trap (Dionaea muscipula, fig. 46). The acid in both instances
                    belongs to the formic acid series. Glands may be either internal or external,
                    and they may be situated at the extremity of a hair (when they are <hi
                    rend="italic">stalked),</hi> or they may be immersed in the substance of the
                    plant <hi rend="italic">(sessile).</hi> In the Dittany (Dictamnus albus, fig.
                    47) a form of gland is seen intermediate between the sessile and stalked form.
                    The glands in this plant secrete a green oily matter, so also do the stalked
                    glands in the Rose. In the Ice-plant the glands appear as elevations of the
                    epidermis, containing a transparent fluid like ice, which is said to have an
                    alkaline reaction; in the Chick-pea similar superficial cells contain an acid
                    fluid. Clear glands are also seen on the under surface of the leaf of Passiflora
                    lunata. Resinous glands are seen in the Hop (fig. 48) and Hemp plants. At the
                    base of the petals of the Crown-imperial (fig. 50), cavities occur containing a
                    honeylike fluid, secreted by what are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >nectariferous</hi> glands.</p>
                <p>Cavities containing saccharine matter, surrounded by small thin-walled cells, are
                    met with in the leaves of Acacia longifolia, also in Viburnum Tinus, and
                    Clerodendron fragrans. The cavities communicate with the surface of the leaves
                    by means of canals. Peculiar sessile glands secreting a gummy substance are
                    found at the inner side of the base of the petioles of Cinchona and Ipecacuan
                    plants (fig. 49). On the buds of various trees peculiar glandular hairs termed
                    <hi rend="italic">colleters</hi> exist, secreting a gummy mucilaginous matter,
                    the <hi rend="italic">blastocolla,</hi> which covers the bud. These, however,
                    disappear on the bursting of the bud. They <pb break="no"

                    secretions of glands are very various, oily, waxy, resinous, gummy, saccharine,
                    acid, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>ORGANS OF PLANTS.</p>
                <p>Having now considered the elementary structures and tissues found iu the
                    Vegetable Kingdom, we proceed to view them in combination to form the plant. The
                    simplest plant is found amongst Algae, where, as in the Red-snow plant
                    (Protococcus nivalis, fig. 51) the whole organism consists of a single isolated
                    cell. Other Algae and all Fungi and Musci are composed of a number of cells
                    united in various ways; whilst in Ferns and their allies and all flowering
                    plants vessels are formed in addition to the cells. The plants in which the
                    tissues are entirely cellular are termed <hi rend="italic">cellular</hi> plants;
                    those in which vessels are also found are <hi rend="italic">vascular</hi>
                    plants.</p>
                <p>That the portions of a plant may be properly maintained two functions have to be
                    performed, namely, <hi rend="italic">nutrition,</hi> on the proper performance
                    of which the life of the individual plant depends, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >reproduction,</hi> by which the perpetuation of the type is provided for. In
                    such a simple form as the Red-snow plant (fig. 51) those functions are performed
                    by the single cell. In the plants composed of numerous cells a differentiation
                    takes place by which special cells are set apart for particular functions, and
                    thus certain organs are formed in the plant. In the higher plants those organs
                    become more complicated from the introduction of the vascular element.</p>
                <p>The nutritive organs of plants are generally known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >root,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">stem,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >leaves.</hi> In all vascular plants and the higher cellular plants an axis or
                    stem having roots and bearing leaves is distinguishable, and such plants have
                    been designated <hi rend="italic">Cormophytes</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phyllophytes.</hi> In the lower class of cellular plants, as Fungi and Algae,
                    no such distinction is possible, and there is merely a flattened leafy expansion
                    with dependent filiform processes; this structure has been termed a <hi
                    rend="italic">thallus,</hi> and such plants are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thallogens</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Thallophytes.</hi></p>
                <p>Amongst the higher plants the reproductive organs are, in ordinary language,
                    comprehended under the term flower; and, as they are conspicuous, such plants
                    have been denominated <hi rend="italic">Flowering, Phanerogamous,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Phoenogamoiis.</hi> Amongst all cellular plants and in some
                    vascular plants, as Ferns and Equisetum, there are no flowers, and the
                    reproductive organs are inconspicuous, hence they have been termed <hi
                    rend="italic">Flowerless</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cτyptogamous.</hi> In all
                    cases the young plant, or embryo, is completely cellular. But as growth
                    proceeds, that differentiation takes place which distinguishes the several
                    classes of plants one from the other. In Phanerogams the first leaves produced
                    upon the embryo plant are termed primary, seed-lobes, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >cotyledons.</hi> In some cases these are two in number, and are opposite one
                    another. Plants in which this occurs are <hi rend="italic">Dicotyledonous</hi>
                    (fig. 52), as our ordinary forest trees. In other plants the lobes alternate and
                    only one cotyledon is formed; such are <hi rend="italic">Monocotyledonous</hi>
                    (fig. 53), as Grasses, Lilies. In Cryptogams, on the other hand, no such
                    seed-lobes or cotyledons are produced, and they are <hi rend="italic"

                <p>In all plants the original cell tissue which gives origin to its parts is of a
                    uniform nature, and is termed the <hi rend="italic">primary tissue.</hi> When
                    all the cells of this tissue are capable of multiplication and division the
                    tissue is a <hi rend="italic">meristem</hi> or <hi rend="italic">generating
                    tissue.</hi> If the cells are not so capable, then it is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >permanent tissue.</hi> The primary tissue at the growing point of any shoot or
                    root is essentially a meristem, and it has been designated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >primary meristem</hi> to distinguish it from the <hi rend="italic">secondary
                    meristem,</hi> which is applied to a tissue in the older parts of a stem or root
                    which remains or becomes capable of division. The growing point of the apex has
                    been termed the <hi rend="italic">punctum vegetationis,</hi> and it not
                    unfrequently forms a conical projection, and is then the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vegetative cone.</hi> By growth at this punctum vegetationis the shoot or root
                    increases in length, and the mode of addition is in many cases of a definite
                    character. Two chief types of growth are recognized. In one of these a single
                    large cell is always present at the apex, termed the <hi rend="italic">apical
                    cell,</hi> which may be regarded as the mother-cell, whence by bipartition in a
                    definite manner the whole meristem below it has arisen, as is well seen in
                    vascular Cryptogams and cellular plants. The other type is seen in Phanerogams,
                    and here no such apical cell is visible, but a number of cells are found at the
                    apex by whose multiplication the subsequent tissues are formed. But in whatever
                    way formed, a primary meristem is the result of all the processes of growth, and
                    by differentiation of its cells the various parts of the shoot or root are
                    formed. The outerlayer of the primary meristem, which extends completely over
                    the punctum vegetationis, is termed the <hi rend="italic">dermatogen;</hi> it is
                    the primordial epidermis, being continuous with the epidermis of the shoot and
                    afterwards becoming epidermis. Underneath the dermatogen several layers of cells
                    are distinguished, continuous with the cortical portion of the shoot or root;
                    this is the primordial cortex, and constitutes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >periblem.</hi> Enclosed by this is a central cellular mass, out of which the
                    fibro-vascular bundles and the structures of the central part of the shoot or
                    root are formed; this has been termed the <hi rend="italic">plerome.</hi> If the
                    growing axis be a young root there is in addition developed, usually from the
                    dermatogen, a mass of cells at the extremity, constituting a <hi rend="italic"
                    >root-cap,</hi> or protective covering, to the delicate merismatic cells
                    beneath; no such structure is formed in a stem. Thus a stem is structurally
                    distinct from a root in having no root-cap.</p>
                <p>In the plerome the fibro-vascular bundles are formed. Certain cells become
                    elongated and prosenchymatous and united in bundles leaving no intercellular
                    spaces; <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n102/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0102-0093"/> this mass is termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >procambium</hi> of the fibro-vascular bundle. As growth proceeds changes take
                    place in the cells by thickening, and, their contents disappearing, various
                    kinds of cells and vessels are formed. In this way the whole mass of the
                    procambium may be converted into permanent tissue, and then growth ceases; or an
                    inner portion of the bundle remains merismatic, which is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">cambium,</hi> and then growth proceeds, the shoot or root
                    increasing in thickness by the cambium forming new cells on both sides In the
                    former case the bundle is <hi rend="italic">closed,</hi> as in Cryptogams and
                    Monocotyledons and some Dicotyledons; in the latter it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >open,</hi> as in most Dicotyledons and Conifers. In every fibro-vascular bundle
                    a separation into two groups of structures may be distinguished—the wood or
                    xylem layers, and the bast or phloem layers. As long as the bundle is open and
                    cambium present, these layers are separated by the cambium (fig. 55). Their
                    relative position as regards the axis of the stem or root varies. In some cases
                    the phloem is nearer the circum ference, in other instances the xylem is
                    peripheral, and in rare cases amongst Dicotyledons there are phloem layers both
                    on the outer and inner sides of the fibro-vascular bundles. In vascular
                    Cryptogams the phloem layers always surround the xylem portion of the
                    bundle.</p>
                <p>In the xylem or wood portion of a fibro-vascular bundle the cells all tend to
                    thicken their walls, and, consequently, numerous kinds of cells and vessels are
                    found, which arc usually arranged in a definite manner. On the side furthest
                    removed from the phloem we find spiral vessels interspersed with wood-cells
                    (figs. 55 and 56), outside are reticulated and scalariform vessels, and then
                    interspersed with wood cells are large pitted vessels. In the phloem or bast
                    layers the cells have not such a tendency to thicken, but usually remain
                    thin-walled, forming ordinary parenchymatous cells, or becoming perforated and
                    forming sieve cells. In certain layers, however, the'cell-walls are thickened so
                    as to become flexible, constituting the bast fibres. Around every fibro-vascular
                    bundle a single layer of cells of the fundamental cellular tissue of the stem is
                    marked off from its surroundings, the cells get filled with starch-grains, and
                    this constitutes what has been termed the <hi rend="italic">bundle sheath</hi>
                    or starch-bearing layer (fig. 57). In fig. 57 is seen a transverse section of
                    the closed fibro-vascular bundle from the Maize, and it will be observed that it
                    is essentially the same as that of the open bundle (fig. 55), only that all the
                    cambium cells have passed into per manent tissue.</p>
                <p>In all plants a provision is made for branching of the various organs, and two
                    principal forms of it may be recognized. In one of these the generating axis
                    elongates at the apex, producing in succession lateral structures. To this form
                    the term <hi rend="italic">monopodium</hi> has been applied. In the second form
                    there is a cessation of growth at the apex in the direction of previous
                    elongation of the axis, and a continuance in two diverging directions. This is
                    <hi rend="italic">dichotomous</hi> branching. In their rudimentary state all
                    branchings may be easily referred to one or other of those types; but in the
                    mature system it is frequently difficult to recognize the type, owing to
                    irregular development of the successive branching. Thus in a dichotomous
                    branching only one of the secondary axes may develop strongly, the weaker branch
                    appearing as a small lateral shoot from its base; and an apparent primary shoot
                    is thus produced which in reality consists of the bases of single branches of
                    consecutive forkings. Such an axis is termed a <hi rend="italic">pseudaxis</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">sympodium.</hi> And, again, in monopodial branchings the
                    primary axis may continue to develop more strongly than its lateral axes, which
                    in their turn develop similarly, and a <hi rend="italic">racemose</hi> form
                    arises; or the primary axis may be arrested in growth, and the secondary axes
                    develop more strongly and overlap it, when a <hi rend="italic">cymose</hi>
                    branching results. More will be said on this subject when considering the
                    inflorescence of Phanerogams, in which the various forms of branching are well
                    seen.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n103/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0103-0094"/>
                <p>We now proceed to consider the form and internal structure of the various organs
                    of plants.</p>
                <p>I. ORGANS OF NUTRITION.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Hoot or Descending Axis.</hi></p>
                <p>Speaking generally, the root is that portion of the plant which descends into the
                    soil. In all plants the root is at first entirely cellular. It may remain
                    permanently so, or vessels may be formed in it. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Radicle,</hi> or young root (fig. 58, r), is the first portion of the embryo
                    protruded from the seed or spore (fig. 54) when germination commences, and
                    resembles very much in structure the young stem. Both are entirely cellular,
                    consisting of a central nucleus of cellular tissue covered by two or more layers
                    of cells. But at the apex of the root a mass of cells is developed, which
                    constitutes what is known as the rootcap or <hi rend="italic">pileorhisa.</hi>
                    These cells extend for some distance along the sides of the root, forming a
                    sheath, and in some cases, as Lemna, the cap becomes loosened from the root,
                    remaining attached by a few cells at the apex only, and then it is known as the
                    <hi rend="italic">ampulla.</hi> This root-cap distinguishes structurally the
                    root from the stem, and it serves as a protection to the apical growing-point of
                    the root. The roots of Thallophytes, consisting entirely of cells, do not
                    develop a root-cap.</p>
                <p>The root is merely a prolongation downwards of the stem, and the part where they
                    unite is the <hi rend="italic">collum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">neck.</hi>
                    Afterwards the root is distinguished from the stem by the absence of a provision
                    for the development of leaf-buds. It is not always easy to distinguish between a
                    stem and a root. Many so-called roots bear at their upper part a portion called
                    their <hi rend="italic">crown,</hi> whence leaf-buds arise. Underground stems
                    and roots are often confounded. Some plants, as the Moutan Paeony, the
                    Plum-tree, Pyrus japonica, and especially Anemone japonica, have a power of
                    forming buds on what are commonly called their roots. The last-mentioned plant
                    develops these buds on every part of its extensively ramifying root-like
                    prolongations, which may be chopped into numerous pieces, each capable of giving
                    rise to a new plant. Such is also the case with the annulated root of Ipecacuan.
                    Roots are usually subterranean and colourless. Externally, they have a cellular
                    epidermal covering of a delicate texture, sometimes called <hi rend="italic"
                    >epιblema,</hi> in which no stomata exist. In woody plants fibro-vascular
                    bundles are found in the roots, and there is an internal arrangement of tissues
                    similar to that seen in the stem itself, but spiral vessels are rare in the
                    root. The axis of the root gives off branches which divide into radicles or
                    fibrils, the extremities of which, composed of delicate cellular tissue
                    constituting the <hi rend="italic">punctum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vegetationis,</hi> have been erroneously called <hi rend="italic"
                    >sρongioles</hi> or <hi rend="italic">spongelets;</hi> they are not distinct
                    organs. Hairs are often seen on roots, but no true leaves. These hairs consist
                    of simple elongated cells, which occur singly, and appear to serve the purpose
                    of absorption. Roots increase principally by additions to their extremities,
                    which are constantly renewed, so that the minute fibrils serve only a temporary
                    purpose, and represent deciduous leaves; but in large trees which form thick
                    roots an increase in diameter occurs in the root similar to what is seen in the
                    stem itself. In some plants no roots are formed at all; thus in the Orchidaceous
                    plants Epipogium Gmelini and Corallorhiza ihnata, and also in Lemna arrhiza, no
                    roots occur. Roots may be given off from any portion of a stem, originating as
                    cellular prolongations from the inner portion of the stem, and coming off at any
                    point of the stem, or at small lenticular points to which the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">lenticels</hi> has been given by some. When the stem is more or
                    less horizontal the roots given off from it pass directly into the soil; but if
                    the stem be erect they pass for a certain distance downwards through the air,
                    and are called <hi rend="italic">aerial.</hi> The latter are well seen in the
                    Screwpine (Pandanus), the Banyan (Ficus indica, fig. 59), and many other species
                    of Ficus, where they assist in supporting the stem and branches. In the Mangrove
                    they often form the entire support of the stem, which has decayed at its lower
                    part. In Tree-ferns they form a dense coating around, and completely concealing,
                    the stem; such is also the case in some Dracaenas and Palms. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Epiphytes,</hi> or plants growing in the air, attached to the
                    trunks of trees, such as Orchids of warm climates, the aerial roots produced do
                    not reach the soil; they continue always aerial and greenish, and they possess
                    stomata. Delicate hairs are often seen on these epiphytal roots, as well as a
                    peculiar investment formed by the cells of the epidermis which have lost their
                    succulent contents and are now filled with air. This layer is called <hi
                    rend="italic">velamen</hi><hi rend="italic">radicum,</hi> or covering of the
                    roots. The aerial roots of the Ivy are not the nutritive roots of the plant, but
                    are only intended for mechanical support.</p>
                <p>Parasitic plants, as the Mistleto (Viscum), Broom-rape (Orobanche), and
                    Rafflesia, send root-like processes into the substance of the plants whence they
                    derive nourishment. In the Dodder (Cuscuta∖ the tissue around the roots swells
                    into a kind of sucker <hi rend="italic">(haustorium),</hi> which is applied flat
                    upon the other plant, and ultimately becomes concave, so as to attach the plant
                    by a vacuum. From the bottom of the sucker the root protrudes, which penetrates
                    the supporting body. In the case of parasitic Fungi, such as Mould, there are
                    cellular filaments which spread among the tissues of plants, and which may be
                    looked upon as equivalent to roots and stems united. They form the <hi
                    rend="italic">spaιυn</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mycelium</hi> of these plants,
                    and in some cases cause rapid destruction of the tissues of plants, as in the
                    disease called Dry-rot.</p>
                <p>The forms of roots depend upon the mode in which the axis descends and branches.
                    The mode of branching of roots is almost universally monopodial, only in
                    Lycopodiaceae is it dichotomous. When the central axis goes deep into the ground
                    in a tapering manner, without dividing, a iαp- <hi rend="italic">root</hi> is
                    produced. This kind of root is sometimes shortened, and becomes succulent,
                    forming the <hi rend="italic">conical</hi> root of Carrot, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">fusiform</hi> or spindle-shaped root of Radish, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">najoiform</hi> root of Turnip. In ordinary forest trees the first
                    root protruded continues to elongate and forms a long <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n104/mode/1up"

                    off. In other plants, especially Monocotyledons, the primary axis soon dies and
                    the secondary axes take its place. When the descending axis is very short, and
                    at once divides into thin, nearly equal, fibrils, the root iβ called <hi
                    rend="italic">fibrous,</hi> as in many Grasses (fig. 60); when the fibrils are
                    thick and succulent the root is <hi rend="italic">fasciculated,</hi> aβ in
                    Ranunculus Ficaria, Asphodelus luteus, and Oenanthe crocata; when some of the
                    fibrils arc developed in the form of tubercules, the root is <hi rend="italic"
                    >tubercular,</hi> as in Orchis (fig. 61); when the fibrils enlarge in certain
                    parts only, the root is <hi rend="italic">nodulose,</hi> as in Spiraea
                    Filipendula, or <hi rend="italic">moniliform,</hi> as in Pelargonium triste, or
                    <hi rend="italic">annulated,</hi> as in Ipecacuan. Some of these so-called roots
                    are formed of a stem and root combined, and when cut in pieces they give rise to
                    buds and new plants. In some cultivated plants, as Turnip, the central root is
                    sometimes injured, so as to end abruptly, and it then divides into numerous
                    branches, resembling a fasciculated root. This gives rise to the disease called
                    Fingers and Toes, which is very injurious to the çrop. Anbury is a disease where
                    a clubbing of the root takes place. The mode in which the fibres of roots are
                    produced and developed gives origin to different forms of rhizotaxis, or
                    root-arrangement.</p>
                <p>Roots either fix the plant in the soil or attach it to other bodies. They absorb
                    nourishment by a process of imbibition or endosmose through their cellular
                    extremities. The elongation of the roots by their extremities enables them to
                    accommodate themselvee to the soil, and allows the extremities of the rootlets
                    to extend deeply without being injured. Roots, in their lateral extension, bear
                    usually a relation to the horizontal spreading of the branches, so as to fix the
                    plant firmly, and to allow fluid nutritive substances to reach the absorbing
                    extremities. As has been already stated, the structure of perennial roots is
                    identical with that of the stem. Thus in Dicotyledons we find a pith, medullary
                    rays, zones of wood, cambium layers, and bark, although no medullary sheath is
                    present. In Monocotyledons we have fibro-vascular bundles distributed in a
                    matrix of cellular tissue. The young primary root in Monocotyledons differs from
                    that in Dicotyledons in that it rises deeply within the embryonal tissue, and on
                    germination this tissue is ruptured and forms a sheath, around the base of the
                    roots, called <hi rend="italic">coleorhiza.</hi> Amongst Monocotyledons the
                    primary roots usually soon die, and secondary roots are formed in abundance. In
                    vascular Dicotyledonous plants the structure of the root is similar to that of
                    the stem. In Thallogens the roots consist merely of simple or branching
                    filamentous hair-like structures. In some large tropical Seaweeds the root-like
                    bodies develop to a large extent, but serve only as fixing organs, and take no
                    share in nourishing the plant.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Stem or Ascending Axis.</hi></p>
                <p>A stem may be defined as an axis bearing leaves. Structurally it differs from a
                    root in having no development of cells forming a cap over the growing point.
                    Under the term <hi rend="italic">caulome</hi> (stem structure) are included all
                    those parts of a plant morphologically equivalent in bearing leaves. The stem
                    generally ascends, seeking air and light, and has therefore been termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">ascending axis.</hi> Stems have usually considerable firmness and
                    solidity, but sometimes they are weak, and either lie prostrate on the ground,
                    thus becoming <hi rend="italic">procumbent,</hi> or climb on plants and rocks by
                    means of rootlets, like the Ivy, being then called <hi rend="italic"
                    >scandent,</hi> or twist round other plants in a spiral manner like Woodbine,
                    when they are <hi rend="italic">volubile.</hi> Twining plants turn either from
                    right to left, as the French Bean, Convolvulus, Passionflower, Dodder,
                    Periploca, and Gourd; or from left to right as Honeysuckle, Twining Polygonum,
                    Hop, and Tamus. Bryony tendrils twine from right to left, and left to right,
                    alternately. In warm climates twining plants <hi rend="italic">(lianas')</hi>
                    often form thick woody stems; while in temperate regions they are generally
                    herbaceous. Exceptions, however, occur in tho case of the Clematis, Honeysuckle,
                    and Vine; the twining stem of the vine has been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >sarmentum.</hi> Some stems are developed more in diameter than in height, and
                    present a peculiar shortened and thickened aspect, as Testudinaria or
                    Tortoise-plant, Cyclamen, Melocactus, Echinocactus, and other Cactaceae; while
                    in many Orchids (fig. 62) the stem assumes an oval or rounded form, and is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">pseudo-bulb.</hi></p>
                <p>Names are given to plants, according to the nature and duration of their stems.
                    <hi rend="italic">Herbs,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">herbaceous</hi> plants, have
                    stems which die down annually. In some of them the whole plant perishes after
                    flowering; in others, the lower part of the stem forming the <hi rend="italic"
                    >crown of the root</hi> remains, bearing buds from which the stem arises next
                    season. In what are called <hi rend="italic">biennial</hi> herbs, the whole
                    plant perishes after two years, while in <hi rend="italic">perennial</hi> herbs
                    the crown is capable of producing stems for many years, or new annual products
                    are repeatedly added many times, if not indefinitely, to the old stems. The
                    short permanent stem of herbaceous plants is covered partially or completely by
                    the soil, so as to protect the buds. Plants producing permanent woody stems are
                    called <hi rend="italic">trees</hi> and <hi rend="italic">shrubs.</hi> The
                    latter are less than five times the height of a man, and produce branches from
                    or near the ground; while the former have conspicuous trunks, which attain at
                    least five times the height of a man. Shrubby plants of small stature are called
                    <hi rend="italic">tinder-shrubs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bushes.</hi> The
                    limits between these different kinds of stem are not always well defined; and
                    there are some plants occupying an intermediate position between shrubs and
                    trees, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">arborescent</hi> shrubs is
                    occasionally given. The stem receives the name of <hi rend="italic">caulis</hi>
                    in ordinary herbaceous plants which do not form a woody stem, <hi rend="italic"
                    >culm</hi> in grasses, <hi rend="italic">truncus</hi> in trees, <hi
                    rend="italic">caudex</hi> or <hi rend="italic">stock</hi> in Palms and in some
                    Cacti, and <hi rend="italic">stipe</hi> in Ferns. The term <hi rend="italic"
                    >haulm</hi> is probably a corruption of culm; it is used by farmers to designate
                    the stem of grasses and the herbaceous stems of plants. The stem is not always
                    conspicuous. Plants with a distinct stem are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >caulescent;</hi> those in which it is inconspicuous are <hi rend="italic"
                    >acaulescent,</hi> as the Primrose, Cowslip, Gentian, and Dandelion. A similar
                    term is given in ordinary language to plants whose stems are buried in the soil,
                    such as Cyclamen or Sowbread. Some plants are truly stemless, and consist only
                    of expansions of cellular tissue representing stem and leaf, called a <hi
                    rend="italic">thallus,</hi> and hence are denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thallogens,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Thallophytes.</hi></p>
                <p>Stems have a provision for a symmetrical arrangement <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n105/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0105-0096"/> of leaves and branches,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >nodes,</hi> or points whence leaf-buds are produced, being placed at regular
                    intervals. No such provision occurs in roots. The intervals between nodes are
                    called <hi rend="italic">internodes.</hi> The stem, although it has a tendency
                    to rise upwards when first developed, in many instances becomes prostrate, and
                    either lies along the ground partially covered by the soil, or runs completely
                    underneath its surface, giving off roots from one side and buds from the other.
                    Some stems are therefore subterranean, and are distinguished from roots by the
                    provision made for regular leaf-buds. The first rudiment of the young stem in
                    the embryo appears outside the seed or spore after the radicle has been
                    protruded. It is termed the <hi rend="italic">plumule</hi> (fig. 58), and
                    differs from the radicle in the absence of a root-cap and in its tendency to
                    ascend. The apical growing portion of the young stem constitutes the terminal
                    bud of the plant, and by its development the stem increases in height; but in
                    addition there is a provision for the production of lateral buds, which develop
                    into lateral shoots more or less resembling the parent stem, and by these the
                    branching of the plant is determined. These buds are found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">axil</hi> of previously-formed leaves; or, in other words, in the
                    angle formed between the stem and leaf. They are hence called <hi rend="italic"
                    >axillary.</hi> They are produced always from the outer portion of the stem
                    except in the case of Equisetaceae (Horsetails), where they have a deep-seated
                    origin. At first they consist entirely of cellular tissue, but in the progress
                    of growth vascular bundles are formed iu them continuous with those of the stem,
                    and ultimately branches are produced, which in every respect resemble the axis
                    whence the buds first sprang. As the axis of the bud increases in length,
                    cellular projections appear at regular intervals upon the primary meristem,
                    which are the rudimentary leaves.</p>
                <p>Buds, as has been stated, are either terminal or lateral. By the production of
                    the former, stems increase in length, while the latter give rise to <hi
                    rend="italic">branches (rami),</hi> from which others, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >branchlets</hi> or <hi rend="italic">twigs</hi><hi rend="italic">(ramuli),</hi>
                    arise, and add to the diameter of the stem. The terminal bud, after producing
                    leaves, sometimes dies at the end of one season, and the whole plant, as in
                    annuals, perishes; or part of the axis is persistent, and remains for two or
                    more years, each of the leaves before its decay producing a bud in its axil.
                    This bud continues the growth in spring. In ordinary trees, in which there is
                    provision made for the formation of numerous lateral buds, any injury done to a
                    few branches is easily repaired; but in Palms, which only form terminal buds,
                    and have no provision for a lateral formation of them, an injury inflicted on
                    the terminal bud is more likely to have a prejudicial effect on the future life
                    of the plant. In the trees of temperate and cold climates the buds which are
                    developed during one season lie dormant during the winter, ready to burst out
                    under the genial warmth of spring. They are generally protected by external
                    modified leaves in the form of <hi rend="italic">scales (tegmenta</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">peruloe),</hi> which frequently exhibit a firmer and coarser
                    texture than the leaves themselves. They serve a temporary purpose, and usually
                    fall off sooner or later, after the leaves are expanded. The bud is often
                    protected by a coating of resinous matter, as in the Horse-chestnut and Balsam
                    Poplar, or by a thick downy covering, as in the Willow. Linnaeus called
                    leaf-buds <hi rend="italic">hibernacula,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">winter
                    quarters</hi> of the young branch. In some plants, as in Platanus, the buds
                    destined to live through the winter are so completely surrounded by the base of
                    the petiole as not to be visible until the leaf has fallen off. These are said
                    to be <hi rend="italic">ιntrapetiolar.</hi></p>
                <p>In the bud of a common tree, as the Sycamore (fig. 63), there is seen the
                    cicatrix left by the leaf of the previous year <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> with
                    the pulvinus or swelling <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> then the scales <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> e</hi><hi rend="italic">&gt; e,</hi> arranged
                    alternately in a spiral, and overlying each other in what is called an <hi
                    rend="italic">imbricated</hi> manner. On making a transverse section of the bud
                    (fig. 64), the overlying scales <hi rend="italic">e, e, e, e,</hi> are
                    distinctly seen surrounding the leaves <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> which are
                    plaited or folded round the axis or growing-point. Iu plants of warm climates
                    the buds are often formed by the ordinary leaves without any protecting
                    appendages; such buds are called <hi rend="italic">naked.</hi> A bud may be
                    removed in a young state from one plant and grafted upon another by the process
                    of <hi rend="italic">bzιdding,</hi> so as to continue to form its different
                    parts; and it may even be made to grow in the soil, in some instances,
                    immediately after removal. In some trees of warm climates, as Cycas, Papaw-tree,
                    Palms, and Tree-ferns, growth by terminal buds is well seen. In these plants the
                    elongation of the stem is generally regular and uniform, so that the age of the
                    plant may be estimated by its height; owing to this mode of growth they do not
                    attain a great diameter. Although provision is made for the regular formation of
                    buds, there are often great irregularities iu consequence of many being
                    abortive, or remaining in a dormant state. Such buds are called <hi
                    rend="italic">latent,</hi> and are capable of being developed in cases where the
                    terminal bud, or any of the branches, have been injured or destroyed. In some
                    instances, as in Firs, the latent buds follow a regular system of alternation;
                    and in plants with opposite leaves, it frequently happens that the bud in the
                    axil of one of the leaves only is developed, and the different buds so produced
                    are situated alternately on opposite sides of the stem. Occasionally, after a
                    partial development as branches, buds are arrested and form knots or nodules.
                    The embryo-buds or nodules of the Beech, Cedar, and Olive are apparently of this
                    nature.</p>
                <p>When the terminal bud is injured or arrested in its growth the elongation of the
                    main axis stops, and the lateral branches often acquire increased activity. By
                    continually cutting off the terminal buds, a woody plant is made to assume a
                    bushy appearance, and thus <hi rend="italic">pollard</hi> trees are produced.
                    Pruning has the effect of checking the growth of terminal buds, and of causing
                    lateral ones to push forth. The peculiar bird-nest appearance, often presented
                    by the branches of the common Birch, depends on an arrestment in the terminal
                    buds, a shortening of the internodes, and a consequent clustering or
                    fasciculation of the twigs. In some plants there is a natural arrestment of the
                    main axis after a certain time, giving rise to peculiar shortened stems. Thus
                    the crown of the root is a stem of this nature, forming buds and roots. Such is
                    also the case in the stem of Cyclamen, Testudinaria Elephantipes, and in the
                    tuber of the Potato. The production of lateral in place of terminal buds
                    sometimes gives the stem a remarkable zigzag aspect. Branches are sometimes
                    arrested in their progress at an early stage of their development, and do not
                    appear beyond the surface of the stem; at other times, after having grown to a
                    considerable· size, they undergo decay. In both instances the lower part of the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n106/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0106-0097"/> branch becomes embedded and hardened among the
                    woody layers of the stem.</p>
                <p>The mode in which branches come off from the stems gives rise to various forms of
                    trees, as pyramidal, spreading, or weeping,—the angles being more or less acute
                    or obtuse. In the Italian Poplar and Cypress the branches are erect, forming
                    acute angles with the upper part of the stem; in the Oak and Cedar they are
                    spreading or patent, forming nearly a right angle; in the Weeping Ash and Elm
                    they come off at an obtuse angle; while in the Weeping Willow and Birch they are
                    pendulous from their flexibility. The comparative length of the upper and under
                    branches also gives rise to differences in the contour of trees, as seen in the
                    conical form of Spruce, and the umbrella-like form of the Italian Pine <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pinus Pinea).</hi> The branching of some trees is peculiar. In
                    the Amazon district many Myristicaceae and Monimiaceae have verticillate
                    branches coming off iu fives. This is also seen in the Chili Pine. Some Amazon
                    trees taper downwards, so as to have a form like an inverted cone or pyramid, as
                    in the Mulatto tree (Euky∙ lista Spruceana), one of the Cinchonaceae.</p>
                <p>Branches are sometimes long and slender, and run along the ground, producing buds
                    with roots and leaves at their extremity or apex. This is seen in the <hi
                    rend="italic">runner (flagellum)</hi> of the Strawberry. In the Houseleek
                    (Sempervivum) there is a similar prostrate branch of a shorter and thicker
                    nature, producing a bud at its extremity capable of independent existence. It
                    receives the name of <hi rend="italic">offset (propagιdum).</hi> In many
                    instances the branch decays, and the young plant assumes a separate existence.
                    Gardeners propagate plants by the process of <hi rend="italic">layering,</hi>
                    which consists in bending a twig, fixing the central part of it iuto the ground,
                    and, after the production of roots, cutting off its connection with the parent.
                    A <hi rend="italic">stolon</hi> differs from these in being a branch which
                    curves towards the ground, and, on reaching a moist spot, takes root and forms
                    an upright stem, and ultimately a separate plant. This is a sort of natural
                    layering, and the plant producing such branches is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >stoloniferous.</hi> In the Rose and Mint a subterranean branch arises from the
                    stem, which runs horizontally to a certain extent, and ultimately sends up an
                    aerial stem, which becomes an independent plant. Such branches are denominated
                    <hi rend="italic">suckers,</hi> and the plants are <hi rend="italic"
                    >surculose.</hi> The gardener divides the connection between the sucker and the
                    parent stem, in order to propagate these plants. In the case of Asparagus and
                    other plants which have a perennial stem below ground, subterranean buds are
                    annually produced, which appear above ground as shoots or branches covered with
                    scales at first, and ultimately with true leaves. The young shoot is called a
                    <hi rend="italic">turio.</hi> These branches are herbaceous and perish annually,
                    while the true stem remains below ground ready to send up fresh shoots next
                    season. In Bananas and Plantains the apparent aerial stem is a shoot or leaf-bud
                    sent up by an underground stem, and perishes after ripening fruit. Branches are
                    sometimes arrested in their development, and, in place of forming leaves, become
                    transformed into <hi rend="italic">spines</hi> or <hi rend="italic">thorns,</hi>
                    as in the Hawthorn. Plants which have spines in a wild state, as the Apple and
                    Pear, often lose them when cultivated, in consequence of their being changed
                    into branches; in some cases, as in the Sloe (Prunus spinosa), (fig. 65), a
                    branch bears leaves at its lower portion, and terminates in a spine. Plants
                    bearing thorns (modifications of branches or leaves) are denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">spiny,</hi><hi rend="italic">spinose,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >spinescent.</hi> A bud is sometimes developed as a slender spiral or twisted
                    branch, called a <hi rend="italic">tendril</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >cirrus.</hi> In the Passion-flower the lateral buds are thus altered, with the
                    view of enabling the plant to climb. In the Vine the tendrils are looked upon as
                    the terminations of separate axes, or as transformed terminal buds, and are
                    sometimes called <hi rend="italic">sarmenta.</hi> In the Vine there are no young
                    buds seen in the angle between the stem and leaves, nor between the stem and
                    tendrils; and the latter are not axillary.</p>
                <p>Fig. 66 represents the branch of a Vine, in which <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> is
                    the primary or first formed axis, ending in <hi rend="italic">υ,</hi> a tendril
                    or altered terminal bud, and having a leaf <hi rend="italic">f'</hi> on one
                    side. Between this leaf and the tendril, which represents the axis, a leaf-bud
                    was formed at an early date, producing the secondary axis, or branch <hi
                    rend="italic">a!</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> ending in a tendril <hi
                    rend="italic">v",</hi> with a lateral leaf <hi rend="italic">f",</hi> from which
                    a tertiary axis or branch <hi rend="italic">a"</hi> was developed, ending in a
                    tendril <hi rend="italic">υ"',</hi> and so on. Tho tendrils of Ampélopsis
                    Veitchii are terminated by disks which secrete a sticky matter, by means of
                    which they adhere to walls, &lt;fcc. The tendrils, like those of the Vine, are
                    modifications of the axis. Tendrils twist in a spiral manner, and enable the
                    plants to rise into the air by twining round other plants. The direction of the
                    spiral frequently differs from that of the climbing stem which produces the
                    tendril. In the Vine the lower part of the stem is strong, and needs no
                    additional support; the tendrils therefore occur only in the upper part, where
                    the branches are soft, and require aid to enable them to support the clusters of
                    fruit. In the Bryony the tendril in the first part of its course twines from
                    right to left, and in the last from left to right.</p>
                <p>In some instances lateral buds are found without being in the axil of leaves. In
                    this case they are <hi rend="italic">extra-axillary.</hi> Such buds are produced
                    after the stem and leaves have been formed, and in certain circumstances they
                    are developed like normal buds. What have been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >embryo-buds</hi> are woody nodules seen iu the bark of the Beech, Elm, and
                    other trees. They are partially developed adventitious or abnormal buds, in
                    which the woody matter is pressed upon by the surrounding tissue, and thus
                    acquires a very hard and firm texture. When a section is made, they present
                    woody circles arranged around a central pith, and traversed by medullary rays.
                    The nodules sometimes form <hi rend="italic">knots</hi> on the surface of the
                    stem, at other times they appear as large <hi rend="italic">excrescences,</hi>
                    and in some cases twigs and leaves are produced by them.</p>
                <p>Buds sometimes become extra-axillary in consequence of the non-appearance or
                    abortion of one or more leaves, or on account of the adhesion of the young
                    branch to the parent stem. In place of one bud there are occasionally several
                    accessory ones produced in the axil, giving origin to numerous branches. Such an
                    occurrence is traced to the presence of latent or adventitious buds. By the
                    union of several such buds, branches are produced, having <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0107-0098"/> a thickened or flattened appearance, as is seen
                    in the Fir, Ash, and other trees. These <hi rend="italic">fasciated</hi>
                    branches, in some cases, however, are owing to the abnormal development of a
                    single bud. Occasionally adventitious buds are produced on the edges of leaves,
                    as in Bryophyllum calycinum (fig. 67), Malaxis paludosa, and various species of
                    Asplénium, and on the surface of leaves, as in Ornithogalum thyreoideum. These
                    are capable of forming independentplants. Similar buds are also made to appear
                    on the leaves of Gesnera, Gloxinia, and Achimenes, by wounding various parts of
                    them, and placing them in moist soil; this is the method often pursued by
                    gardeners in their propagation. The Ipecacuan plant has been propagated by means
                    of leaves inserted in the soil. In this case the lower end of the leaf becomes
                    thickened like a corm, and from it roots are produced, and ultimately a bud and
                    young plant. Leaves bearing buds on their margin are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >proliferous.</hi></p>
                <p>The typical form of stems is rounded. They are sometimes compressed or flattened
                    laterally, while at other times they are angular: being <hi rend="italic"
                    >triangular,</hi> with three angles and three flat sides; <hi rend="italic"
                    >trigonous,</hi> with three convex faces; <hi rend="italic">triquetrous,</hi>
                    with three concave sides; <hi rend="italic">quadrangular</hi> or square; <hi
                    rend="italic">quinquangulär</hi> or five-angled <hi rend="italic">;
                    octangular</hi> or eight-angled, &lt;fcc. Various terms are applied to the forms
                    of stems, as <hi rend="italic">cylindrical</hi> or <hi rend="italic">terete,
                    jointed</hi> or <hi rend="italic">articulated,</hi> &lt;fcc. The following are
                    some of the more important modifications of stems :—The <hi rend="italic">crown
                    of the root</hi> is a shortened stem, often partially under ground, which
                    remains in some plants after the leaves, branches, and flower-stalks have
                    withered. In this case the internodes are very short, and the nodes are crowded
                    together, so that the plant appears to be stemless. It is seen in perennial
                    plants, the leaves of which die down to the ground annually. A <hi rend="italic"
                    >rhizome or root-stock</hi> (fig. 68) is a stem which runs along the surface of
                    the ground, being partially covered by the soil, sending out roots from its
                    lower eide and leaf-buds from its upper. It occurs in Ferns, Iris, Hedychium,
                    Acorus or Sweet Flag, Ginger, Water-lily, many species of Carex,</p>
                <p>Rushes, Anemone, Lathraea, &lt;fcc. By many the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >rhizome</hi> is applied to stems creeping horizontally, whether they are
                    altogether or only partially subterranean. In rhizomes called definite, the
                    terminal bud gives off flowers, and the lateral buds form the stem; while in
                    indefinite rhizomes the terminal leaf-bud is formed annually. A rhizome such as
                    occurs in Solomon’s Seal (fig. 68) is not a single stem, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,e.,</hi> the product of a single bud, but is composed of portions of
                    successive axes, the leaves of which have died off and remain as scars (fig. 68,
                    c, c); it is thus an indefinite rhizome. Rhizomes are well seen in British
                    Ferns. A rhizome sometimes assumes an erect form as in Scabiosa succisa, in
                    which the so-called <hi rend="italic">praemorse</hi> root is in reality a
                    rhizome, with the lower end decaying. The erect rhizome of Cicuta virosa shows
                    hollow internodes, separated by partitions.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">pseudo-bulb</hi> (fig 62) is an eularged bulbous-like aerial
                    stem, common in Orchidaceous plants. It is succulent, often contains numerous
                    spiral cells and vessels, and is covered with a thick epidermis. A <hi
                    rend="italic">soboles</hi> is a creeping underground stem, sending roots from
                    one part and leafbuds from another, as in Couch-grass, Carex arenaria, and
                    Scirpus lacustris. It is often called a creeping root, but is really a rhizome
                    with narrow elongated internodes. A <hi rend="italic">tuber</hi> is a thickened
                    stem or branch produced by the approximation of the nodes and the swelling of
                    the internodes, as in the Potato. The eyes of the Potato are leafbuds. Tubers
                    are sometimes aerial, occupying the place of branches. The ordinary herbaceous
                    stem of the Potato, when cut into slips and planted, sends off branches from its
                    base, which assume the form of tubers. Tubers frequently store up a quantity of
                    starch as in Maranta arundinacea, whence arrowroot is derived. Another form of
                    thickened underground stem is the <hi rend="italic">corm,</hi> as seen in the
                    Autumn Crocus (Colchicum, fig. 69), Gladiolus, &amp;c. Structurally it is
                    composed of a solid more or less rounded axis covered by a layer of thin
                    membranous scales (fig. 70, <hi rend="italic">h, h).</hi> A</p>
                <p>corm is only of one year’s duration, giving off buds annually in the form of
                    young corms. In autumn the young corm gives origin to leaves, the lower of which
                    <hi rend="italic">(s, s', s")</hi> form sheaths round the corm and flower-stalk,
                    the upper <hi rend="italic">(l', I")</hi> remaining very small; and in the axil
                    of the uppermost leaves the flowering-stem develops and bears the flowers (δ,
                    δ'). Meanwhile in the axil of the middle leaves on the corm, a bud—the rudiment
                    of a new corm—appears <hi rend="italic">(k").</hi> The flowering-stem dies down,
                    and the corm from which it arose enlarges greatly during the winter at the
                    expense of its parent corm <hi rend="italic">(k),</hi> which thus becomes
                    shrivelled. In spring the leaves produced on it (Γ, <hi rend="italic">Γ),</hi>
                    which were merely rudiments in autumn, appear above ground as conspicuous <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n108/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0108-0099"/> large leaves. At the end of spring these leaves
                    die down, the bases of the lower ones alone remaining, and constituting thin
                    brown scales around the corm (as at <hi rend="italic">h).</hi> Meanwhile, the
                    -young bud corm <hi rend="italic">(k")</hi> in the axil of the middle leaves
                    grows rapidly at the expense of its parent corm (F), but it does not attain a
                    great size. In autumn it produces new leaves, which remain small, but from the
                    axil of the two upper the flowering stem rises up and bears flowers; whilst in
                    the axil of its middle leaves a new bud-corm appears, which will the following
                    autumn produce young leaves, flowering stem, and a new bud-corm, and thus the
                    cycle goes on. The buds or new corms formed from the old corms may be produced
                    either laterally, as in Colchicum autumnale, or terminally, as in Crocus and
                    Gladiolus. The <hi rend="italic">bulb</hi> is another form of underground stem
                    or bud. The axis in this case is much shortened, and the internodes are hardly
                    developed. The bases of the leaves rising from the stem are quite close
                    together, and become succulent and enclose the axis. In the Lily the thick and
                    narrow scales are arranged separately in rows, and the bulb is called <hi
                    rend="italic">scaly;</hi> while in the Leek, Onion, Squill, and Tulip the scales
                    are broad, and enclose each other in a concentric manner, the outer ones being
                    thin and membranous, and the bulb is <hi rend="italic">tunicated.</hi> In the
                    axils of these fleshy scales new lateral shoots arise, forming new bulbs. The
                    lateral buds or <hi rend="italic">cloves</hi> sometimes remain attached to the
                    axis, and produce flowering stems, so that apparently the same bulb continues to
                    flower for many years, as in the Hyacinth and Tulip; at other times the young
                    bulbs are detached, and form separate plants. In the axil of the leaves of
                    Lilium bulbiferum, Dentaria bulbifera, and some other plants, small conical or
                    rounded bodies are produced, called <hi rend="italic">bulbils</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">bulblets</hi> (fig. 71, δ). They resemble bulbs in their aspect,
                    and consist of a small number of thickened scales enclosing a growing-point.
                    These scales are frequently united closely together, so as to form a solid mass.
                    Bulbils are therefore transformed leafbuds, which are easily detached, and are
                    capable of producing young plants when placed in favourable circumstances. The
                    scales in bulbs vary in number. In Gagea there is only one scale; in the Tulip
                    and Fritillaria imperialis they vary from two to five; while in Lilies and
                    Hyacinths there are a great number of scales. In the Tulip a bud is formed in
                    the axil of an outer scale, and this gives rise to a new flowering axis, and a
                    new bulb, at the side of which the former bulb is attached in a withered
                    state.</p>
                <p>The forms of the stem having been considered, we now proceed to examine its
                    anatomical structure. This structure consists of the elementary tissues combined
                    and arranged in various ways. The arrangement of the fibro-vascular bundles in
                    the mature stem or root is not the same in all plants. But we find that in most
                    plants which have two seed-lobes in the embryo, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    Dicotyledons, a characteristic structure is apparent, quite distinct from what
                    is found in the majority of plants in which only one seed-lobe is present in the
                    embryo, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in Monocotyledons; and these, again, have a
                    different structure from that found in. Acotyledons, or plants with no seed-lobe
                    in their embryo. The three forms of stem here refeιτed to have been usually
                    distinguished as follows :—(1.) <hi rend="italic">Exogenous</hi> stem, in which
                    the fibro-vascular bundles are produced indefinitely in an outward direction,
                    and the stem increases in diameter by the annual formation of a new layer of
                    woody matter on the outside of the preceding layers. This is the form found in
                    most Dicotyledons, and they have hence been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exogens,</hi> or Outward-growers. Ordinary trees, such as tho Oak and Ash,
                    furnish instances. (2.) <hi rend="italic">Endogenous</hi> stem, in which the
                    fibro-vascular bundles are definite, and are formed towards the centre, which
                    becomes filled up with them in the progress of growth, so that the diameter of
                    the stem increases in a great measure by the new matter pushing out that
                    previously formed. This stem characterizes many Monocotyledons, which have thus
                    been called <hi rend="italic">Endogens,</hi> or Inward-growers. Palms supply
                    examples. (3.) <hi rend="italic">A erogenous</hi> stem, in which the bundles of
                    vessels are simultaneously developed, and the additions to the stem take place
                    at the summit by the union of the bases of the leaves. Plants having this kind
                    of stem are called <hi rend="italic">Acrogens,</hi> or Summitgrowers, and are
                    Acotyledons. Tree-ferns furnish an example. Recent research, however, has shown
                    that these terms cannot always be used as synonymous with Dicotyledon,
                    Monocotyledon, and Acotyledon, as we find amongst Dicotyledons stems where the
                    formation of new fibro-vascular bundles is distinctly endogenous, and again
                    amongst Monocotyledons stems with a provision for exogenous growth, and also
                    amongst Acotyledons examples are not wanting in which a continuous increase in
                    diameter is provided for.</p>
                <p>We shall consider the structure of the stem in Dicotyledons, Monocotyledons, and
                    Acotyledons successively.</p>
                <p>In the young stem of a Dicotyledon the fibro-vascular bundles first appear as a
                    circle of wedge-shaped masses, by which the stem is divided into a central
                    cellular portion, the <hi rend="italic">pith,</hi> and a peripheral <hi
                    rend="italic">cortex,—</hi> the space between the bundles being occupied by
                    cellular tissue constituting the <hi rend="italic">medullary rays,</hi> and
                    uniting the pith and cortex. Each fibro-vascular bundle increases by division of
                    its own cambium cells. If eventually all the cambium cells become permanent
                    tissue then the bundle becomes closed, and all further growth ceases. This is
                    the complete structure of an annual herbaceous dicotyledonous stem, which thus
                    consists of a central cellular pith, a circle of fibro-vascular bundles, a
                    cellular cortex united with the pith by medullary rays, and outside all an
                    epidermis (fig. 72). In trees and shrubs with permanent woody stems, the young
                    shoots given out annually have a structure similar to that of annual herbaceous
                    stems; but as the shoot grows, further changes occur by which the diameter is
                    increased, and the stem becomes more dense. After the first year’s growth, the
                    cells of the medullary rays, stretching between the fibro-vascular bundles and
                    continuous with their cambium cells, become converted into <hi rend="italic"
                    >secondary meristem,</hi> and then an <hi rend="italic">interfascicular</hi>
                    cambium is formed, which eventually coalesces with the cambium cells of the
                    fibro-vascular bundles, and thus a complete <hi rend="italic">cambium ring</hi>
                    is formed (fig. 73). From this cambium ring new xylem or wood is formed on the
                    inside, whilst new cortex <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n109/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0109-0100"/> is formed on the outside; and in this way the
                    stem increases in thickness. This growth in thickness, however, ceases
                    periodically, and is renewed with each new period of vegetation, and thus the
                    wood is formed in concentric layers, sharply marked off from succeeding layers,
                    each being an <hi rend="italic">annual ring</hi> of wood, and the same is seen
                    in the cortex (fig. 74). The rings of wood are thus formed successively outside
                    those pre-existing, while in the cortex the new layers are produced inside those
                    already formed.</p>
                <p>The inner vessels of the primary fibro-vascular bundles immediately surround the
                    pith and often project into it, and form what is termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >medullary sheath,</hi> which consists of spiral vessels, and through this
                    sheath the primary medullary rays pass. These medullary rays extend from the
                    pith to the cortex, but as new zones of wood and cortex are produced, new rays
                    are formed in them, which increase by additions from the cambium layer. The
                    secondary cortex, formed from the cambium ring, constitutes what is commonly
                    known as the inner bark or <hi rend="italic">endophloeum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the primary cortex, which forms the outer bark, consists of two layers
                    of cells, which have been respectively termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mesophloeum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">epiphloeum.</hi> Outside all is the
                    epidermis. This, however, does not remain as thin-walled cells, but is usually
                    converted into <hi rend="italic">periderm,</hi> and this may in turn be
                    completely supplanted by the bark. Thus, if a transverse and a longitudinal
                    section of a Dicotyledonous stem be made, the following structures will be seen
                    as represented in fig. 74. In the centre is the cellular pith <hi rend="italic"
                    >a, a,</hi> immediately surrounding it comes the medullary sheath <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> then the secondary layers of wood <hi rend="italic">b,
                    c,</hi> of successive years’ growth, outside this the cambium ring e, separating
                    the woodlayers from the cortical layers. Of these last, the inner,/, is the bast
                    layer or endophloeum, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is the middle cellular layer or
                    mesophloeum, and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is the outer epiphloeum. The latter
                    two constitute the outer bark. Connecting the mesophloeum with the pith is seen
                    a medullary ray <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> Outside all are the epidermal
                    tissues.</p>
                <p>Let us now examine the different parts of an Exogenous stem proceeding from the
                    centre to the circumference :—</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pith,</hi> or the central part of a Dicotyledonous stem, is
                    composed of cellular tissue. In the young stem it is succulent, the cells being
                    full of fluid and frequently of a greenish hue; but in process of time it
                    becomes palecoloured, dry, and full of air. Thesé changes take place first in
                    the central cells. Sometimes the pith is broken up into cavities, which have a
                    regular arrangement, as in the Walnut, Jessamine, and Cecropia peltata; it is
                    then called <hi rend="italic">discoid</hi> or <hi rend="italic">disciform.</hi>
                    At other times, by the rapid growth of the outer part of the stem, the pith is
                    ruptured irregularly, and forms large cavities, as in the fistular stem of
                    Umbelliferous plants. In some cases fibro-vascular bundles are found in the
                    pith, as in Elder, Pitcher-plant, and Ferula, and occasionally its cells are
                    marked by pores indicating a thickening of the cell-wall. The extent of pith
                    varies in different plants and in different parts of the same plant. In Ebony it
                    is small, while in the Elder it is large. In Aeschynomene aspera (Shola plant,
                    the Ricepaper plant of India), the interior of the stem is almost entirely
                    composed of cellular tissue or pith; from this a kind of paper is made, and
                    light hats. The same kind of tissue occurs in the Papyrus of the Nile. Large
                    pith is also seen in Fatsia (Aralia) papyrifera (Tung-tsaou or Chinese
                    rice-paper plant), and in Scaevola Taccada of the Malay archipelago. When the
                    woody circle of the first year is completed, the pith usually remains stationary
                    as regards its size, retaining more or less its dimensions, even in old trunks,
                    and never becoming obliterated.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Medullary Sheath</hi> is the fibro-vascular · layer
                    immediately surrounding the pith. It is the inner layer of the fibro-vascular
                    bundle of the first year (fig. 74, <hi rend="italic">d),</hi> and consists
                    chiefly of true spiral vessels, with annular and reticulated vessels, intermixed
                    with long woody fibres, which continue to exercise their functions during the
                    life of the plant, and which extend into the leaves. Between the vessels of the
                    sheath the medullary rays from the pith pass.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Wood.—</hi> The layers of wood (fig. 7 4, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> c) are formed outside the medullary sheath in concentric rings in the
                    manner already described. On account of this mode of formation of wood-layers
                    successively outside pre-existing layers the stem increases indefinitely. There
                    are no annular or spiral vessels present; these have been replaced by pitted and
                    punctated vessels along with wood-cells. The stems have been called <hi
                    rend="italic">exogenous</hi> and also <hi rend="italic">indefinite,</hi> and
                    Dicotyledonous plants have sometimes received the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyclogens,</hi> in consequence of exhibiting concentric circles in their stems.
                    On a transverse section each zone or circle is usually seen to be separated from
                    that next to it by a well-marked line of demarcation. This line, as in the Oak
                    and in the Ash, is indicated by holes which are the openings of large pitted
                    vessels,—the remainder of the tissue in the circle being formed by
                    pleurenchymatous tubes with thickened walls and of smaller calibre. In some
                    trees, as the Lime, Hornbeam, and Maple, the line is by no means so well marked,
                    as the openings are smaller and more generally diffused; but there is usually a
                    deficiency of pitted vessels towards the outer part of the circle. In
                    cone-bearing plants, as the Fir, in which the woody layers consist entirely of
                    punctated tissue, without any large pitted vessels, the line of separation is
                    marked by the tissue becoming dense and often coloured. In some kinds of wood,
                    as Sumach, the zones are separated by a marked development of cellular tissue.
                    The separation between the zones is owing to the interruption in the growth of
                    the tree during autumn and winter, and hence it is well defined in trees of
                    temperate and cold climates. But even in tropical trees, the lines, although
                    often inconspicuous, are still visible,&lt;— the dry season, during which many
                    of them lose their leaves, being their season of repose.</p>
                <p>The woody layers vary in their texture at different periods. At first all the
                    tissues are pervious and full of fluid; but by degrees they become thickened,
                    and the channels of the vessels get filled up and obliterated. The first-formed
                    layers are those which soonest become thus <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n110/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0110-0101"/> altered. In old trees there is a marked division
                    between the central <hi rend="italic">heart-wood</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >duramen,</hi> and the external <hi rend="italic">sapwood</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">alburnum,—</hi> the former being hard and dense, and often
                    coloured, with its tubes dry and thickened, while the latter is less dense, is
                    of a pale colour, and has its tubes permeable by fluids. The difference of
                    colour between these two kinds of woods is often very marked. In the Ebony tree
                    the duramen or perfect-wood is black, and is the part used for furniture, while
                    the alburnum is pale; in the Beech, the heart-wood is light-brown; in the Oak,
                    deep-brown; in Judas tree, yellow; in Guaiacum, greenish. The alteration in
                    colour is frequent in tropical trees. In trees of temperate climates, called <hi
                    rend="italic">white-wood,</hi> as the Willow and Poplar, no change in colour
                    takes place; this is also the case in the Chestnut and Bombax. The relative
                    proportion of alburnum and duramen varies in different trees. The heart-wood is
                    more useful than the sap-wood, and is less liable to decay.</p>
                <p>From the mode in which the woody layers are formed, it is obvious that each
                    vascular zone is moulded, upon that which precedes it; and as, in ordinary
                    cases, each woody circle is completed in the course of one year, it follows
                    that, by counting the concentric circles, the age of a tree may be ascertained.
                    Thus fig. 75 represents an oak eight years old, having eight woody layers <hi
                    rend="italic">b.</hi> This computation can only be made in trees having marked
                    separations between the circles. There are, however, many sources of mistake. In
                    some instances, by interruption to growth, several circles may be formed in one
                    year, and thus lead to an erroneous estimate. Care must be taken to have a
                    complete section from the bark to the pith, for the circles sometimes vary in
                    diameter at different parts of their course, and a great error might occur from
                    taking only a few rings, or circles, and then estimating for the whole diameter
                    of the tree. When by the action of severe frost, or other causes, injury has
                    been done to the tender cells from which the young wood is developed, while, at
                    the same time, the tree continues to live, so as to form perfect woody layers in
                    subsequent years, the date of the injury may be ascertained by counting the
                    number of layers which intervene between the imperfectly formed circle and the
                    bark. Inscriptions made in the wood become covered, and may be detected in after
                    years when a tree is cut down; so also wires or nails driven into the wood. As
                    the same development of woody layers takes place in the branches as in the stem
                    of an exogenous tree, the time when a branch was first given off may be computed
                    by counting the circles on the stem and branch respectively. If there are fifty
                    circles, for instance, in the trunk, thirty in one branch and ten in another,
                    then the tree must have been twenty years old when it produced the first, and
                    forty when it formed the other.</p>
                <p>In exogenous stems the pith is not always in the centre. The layers of wood on
                    one side of a tree may be larger than those on the other, in consequence of
                    their fuller exposure to light and air, or the nature of the nourishment
                    conveyed, and thus the pith may become <hi rend="italic">excentric.</hi> Zones
                    vary in size in different kinds of trees, and at different periods of a plant’s
                    life. Soft wooded trees have usually broad zones, and old trees form smaller
                    zones than young ones. There are certain periods of a plant’s life when it seems
                    to grow most vigorously, and to form the largest zones. This is said to occur in
                    the Oak between twenty and thirty years of age.</p>
                <p>C ’ cmδ⅛7n.—External to the layers of wood, and between them and the bark, there
                    is a layer of thin-walled cells in which the protoplasm and cell-sap remain, and
                    consequently they are capable of division and growth. To this layer the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">cambium,</hi> has been given. This cambium layer marks the
                    separation between the wood and the bark, and may be regarded as constituting
                    the active formative tissue of Dicotyledonous stems. It constitutes the <hi
                    rend="italic">thickening zone,</hi> by means of which the stem is enlarged,— the
                    cambium cells situated most internally being subservient to the purposes of the
                    wood formation, while the external ones give origin to the new bark. When these
                    cells are carrying on the process of growth with activity, during the flow of
                    the sap in spring, the bark can be easily separated from the wood.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bark</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cortical System,</hi> lies
                    external to the wood, and, like it, consists of several layers. In the early
                    state it is entirely cellular, and is in every respect similar to the pith; but
                    as the fibro-vascular bundles are developed, the bark and pith are separated,
                    and the former gradually becomes altered by the formation of secondary deposits.
                    We find in the cortex, as in the wood portion of the stem, fibro-vascular along
                    with cellular tissue. But the position and relative proportion of these two
                    systems is reversed. In the bark the cellular system is external, and is much
                    developed, while the fibro-vascular is internal, and occupies comparatively a
                    small space. The cellular portion of the bark consists of an external layer, or
                    <hi rend="italic">epiphloeum,</hi> and the cellular envelope, or <hi
                    rend="italic">mesophloeum,</hi> while the vascular system forms the internal
                    portion called <hi rend="italic">liber,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >endophloeum.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">endophloeum,</hi> liber, or inner bark, is formed from the
                    secondary cortex of the young stem. It consists mainly of thick or thin walled
                    woody fibres, commonly known as bast-fibres, mixed with elongated cellular
                    tissue and frequently with laticiferous vessels. It is separated from the wood
                    by the cambium layer. The pleurenchymatous tubes are thickened so as to be
                    flexible, but are not lignified, and are thus very tenacious. The endophloeum of
                    the Lime-tree and of Antiaris saccidora (the Sack tree of Coorg) is used to form
                    mats, cordage, and bags; and the toughness of the fibres of the inner bark of
                    flax, hemp, and of many of the Nettle and Mallow tribes, render them fit for
                    various manufacturing purposes. The endophloeum is sometimes, from its uses,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">bast-layer.</hi> Occasionally it is continuous and
                    uninterrupted, as in the Vine and Horse-chestnut; at other times, as in the Oak,
                    Ash, and Lime, the fibres are separated during the progress of growth, and form
                    a sort of network, in the interstices of which the medullary rays are seen. The
                    fibres of the Lace-bark tree (Lagetta lintearia) are similar. In fig. 76 is
                    represented the bark of Daphne Laureola,— <hi rend="italic">f</hi> indicating
                    the woody fibres of liber, and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the medullary rays. The
                    endophloeum increases by layers on its inside, which are thin, and may be
                    separated like the leaves of a book. The outer layer of bastfibres betwixt the
                    endophloeum and the outer bark has been termed the <hi rend="italic">cortical
                    sheath,</hi> corresponding to the medullary sheath on the inside of the
                    stem.</p>
                <p>The outer bark is formed from the primary cortex; it is always cellular, and is
                    divided into two layers, the epiphloeum<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0111-0102"/> with the mesophloeum underneath. The cellular
                    envelope, or <hi rend="italic">mesophloeum,</hi> lies immediately on the outside
                    of the liber. It consists of polyhedral, often prismatical cells, elongated
                    vertically to the surface, usually havingchlorophyll, or green colouring matter,
                    in their interior, but sometimes being colourless, and containing raphides. They
                    are distinguished from those of the epiphloeum by their form and direction, by
                    their thicker walls, their green colour, and the intercellular spaces which
                    occur among them. This covering is usually lese developed than the outer
                    suberous layer, but sometimes, as in the Larch and common Fir, it becomes very
                    thick, and separates like the epiphloeum. In the cellular envelope laticiferous
                    vessels occur. The <hi rend="italic">epiphloeum</hi> is the outer covering of
                    the bark, consisting of cells which usually assume a cubical or flattened
                    tabular form. The cells have no chlorophyll in their interior, are placed close
                    together, and are elongated in a horizontal direction; and thus they are
                    distinguished from the cells of mesophloeum. In the progress of growth they
                    become often of a brown colour. This covering may be composed of a single layer
                    of tabular cells; but in some trees it consists of numerous layers, forming the
                    substance called <hi rend="italic">cork,</hi> which is well seen in Quercus
                    Suber, the Cork-oak; hence the name <hi rend="italic">suberous,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">corky layer,</hi> which is given to it. The form of its cells
                    varies in some instances, being cubical at one part, and more compressed or
                    tabular at another, thus giving rise to the appearance of separate layers. On
                    the exterior of the epiphloeum is situated the epidermis, which has already been
                    described. It is formed of a layer of cells, which in woody stems serve only a
                    temporary purpose, becoming ultimately transformed in various ways.</p>
                <p>The bark, in its increase, follows an order exactly the reverse of that which
                    occurs in the woody layers. The layers of liber owe their increase to the
                    cambium cells, which, by their constant reproduction, mark the separation
                    between the xylem and phloem portions of the stem. These layers are often so
                    compressed and united together as to be counted with difficulty, while at other
                    times they are separated by rings of cellular tissue, and thus remain
                    conspicuous. As the additions are made to the woody layers on the outside, and
                    to the bark on the inside, there is a constant distension going on, by which the
                    bark becomes compressed, its layers of liber are condensed, the fibres are often
                    separated (fig. 76) so as to form meshes, its epidermis is thrown off, and the
                    epiphloeum is either detached along with it, or, when thick, is ruptured in
                    various ways, so as to give rise to the rugged appearance presented by such
                    trees as Elm and Cork-oak. In some instances the bark is very distensible, and
                    its outer cellular covering is not much developed, so that the surface remains
                    smooth, as in the Beech. The outer suberous layer sometimes separates with the
                    epidermis, in thin plates or scales; in the Birch these have a white and silvery
                    aspect. There is thus a continual destruction and separation of different
                    portions of the bark. The cellular envelope and liber may remain while the
                    epiphloeum separates, or they also may be gradually pushed off—the parts which
                    were at first internal becoming external. In the case of some Australian trees
                    both the cellular and fibrous portions are detached in the form of thin flakes,
                    and occasionally each annual layer of liber pushes off that which preceded it.
                    The epidermis separates early, and no renewal of it takes place. It is, however,
                    replaced by the cork layer, which then covers the outer part of the stem. To
                    this covering the name <hi rend="italic">penderm</hi> is given.</p>
                <p>From the mode in which the outer layers of bark separate, it follows that
                    inscriptions made on them, and not extending to the wood, gradually fall off and
                    disappear. A nail driven into these layers ultimately falls out. In consequence
                    of the continued distension of an exogenous stem, it is found that woody twining
                    plants cause injury, by interrupting the passage of the fluids. Thus a spiral
                    groove may be formed on the surface of the stem by the compression exercised by
                    a twining plant, such as Bush-rope (Bauhinia, fig. 77) or Honeysuckle. From what
                    has been stated relative to the changes which take place in the bark, it will be
                    understood that it is often difficult to count its annual layers, so as to
                    estimate the age of the tree by means of them. This may, however, be done in
                    some cases, as shown at fig. 75, where there are eight layers of bark <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> and eight woody layers <hi rend="italic">b.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Medullary Rays or Plates.—</hi> While the bark and pith become
                    gradually separated by the intervention of vascular bundles, the connection
                    between them is kept up by means of processes called <hi rend="italic">medullary
                    rays</hi> (figs. 78 and 79). These form the <hi rend="italic">silver grain</hi>
                    in wood, so conspicuous in the maple; they communicate with the pith and the
                    cellular envelope of the bark, and they consist of cellular tissue, which
                    becomes compressed and flattened so as to assume a muriform appearance. At first
                    they occupy a large space (fig. 72, <hi rend="italic">st);</hi> but as the
                    vascular bundles increase they become more and more narrow, forming thin laminae
                    or plates, which separate the woody bundles. On making a transverse or
                    horizontal section of a woody stem, the medullary rays present the aspect of
                    narrow lines running from the centre to the circumference (fig. 74); and on
                    making a vertical section of a similar stem through one of the rays, the
                    appearance represented in fig. 78 will be observed, where a medullary ray <hi
                    rend="italic">mr,</hi> composed of flattened muriform cells, passes from the
                    pith <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to the cellular envelope <hi rend="italic"

                    >cf.</hi> The laminae do not by any means preserve an uninterrupted course from
                    the apex to the base of the tree. They are broken up by the intervention of
                    woody fibres, as seen in a vertical section of a woody stem (fig. 79),
                    tangentially to the medullary rays <hi rend="italic">mr, mr, mr,</hi> which are
                    separated by interlacing fibres <hi rend="italic">ll.</hi> The primary medullary
                    rays extend completely from the pith to the bark; but in the secondary wood and
                    secondary cortex new rays are formed which, therefore, extend only through a
                    portion of the stem. These are secondary medullary rays. All may increase by
                    division of the merismatic cells of the cambium. Medullary rays are conspicuous
                    in the Cork-Oak, Hazel, Beech, Ivy, Clematis, Vine. They are not so well marked
                    in the Lime, Chestnut, Birch, Yew.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0112-0103"/>
                <p>The medullary rays are in some cases, as in Clematis and Aristolochia, large and
                    broad, while the woody wedges are comparatively small.</p>
                <p>The stems of Dicotyledonous plants occasionally present anomalous appearances in
                    the structure and arrangement of their wood, bark, and medullary rays. In place
                    of concentric circles there are sometimes only a few rows of wedge-shaped
                    vascular bundles produced during the life of the plant, additions being made by
                    the annual interposition of bundles of a similar kind, resembling in this
                    respect the formation of woody bundles in the early growth of herbaceous plants.
                    In Piperaceae, Aristolochiaceae, and Menispermaceae, these anomalous stems
                    occur. In Gnetum (fig. 80), the vascular bundles, δ, <hi rend="italic">b, b, b,
                    b,</hi> form zones, which are each the produce of several years’ growth, and are
                    separated by layers, <hi rend="italic">I, I, I, I, I, I,</hi> which may be
                    considered as representing different bast-layers. In some of the Menispermaceae
                    the separating layers are of a cellular and not of a fibrous nature. Many of the
                    Malpighiaceae, Sapindaceae, and Bignoniaceae of Brazil exhibit stems in which
                    the woody layers are arranged in a very irregular manner. In some of them (fig.
                    81) there is a central woody mass with from three to ten small secondary ones
                    round it. Each of the masses contains true pith, derived either from the
                    cortical cellular tissue, or from the original medullary centre. Around these
                    separate collections of pith there is a medullary sheath and spiral vessels. No
                    annual rings have been detected in the secondary masses, but medullary rays
                    exist usually in their outer portion. In some anomalous Sapindaceae, the central
                    and lateral woody masses are enclosed in a common bark, with a continuous layer
                    of liber. Some have supposed that the lateral masses are undeveloped branches
                    united together under the bark.</p>
                <p>In some Bignoniaceae (fig. 82) the layers of wood are divided in a crucial manner
                    into four wedge-shaped portions by the intervention of plates differing in
                    texture from the ordinary wood of the plant, and probably formed by the
                    introversion, or growing inwards, of the liber. In Aspidosperma excelsum
                    (Paddle-wood) of Guiana, and in Heteropterys anomala, the stem assumes a
                    peculiar lobed and sinuous aspect; and in some woody climbing plants pressure
                    causes the stems to become flattened on the side next the tree on which they are
                    supported, while from being twisted alternately in different directions, they
                    present a remarkable zigzag form, having the woody layers developed only on one
                    side (fig. 83). In Firs the wood is occasionally produced in an oblique in place
                    of a perpendicular manner, thus injuring the timber and causing it to split in
                    an unusual way. The young plants produced from the seed of such twisted-wooded
                    firs are said to inherit the peculiarity of their parents. Occasionally the
                    Dicotyledonous stem becomes swollen at certain places, especially near the root,
                    and thus exhibits a tuberous appearance. This peculiarity is said to be liable
                    to occur in Coniferous plants grown from cuttings. In some of the lower class of
                    plants a cellular stalk is produced, which on a transverse section presents an
                    appearance like that of a Dicotyledonous stem. Thus Lessonia fuscescens, a
                    species of sea-weed, has stems which are often 5 to 10 feet long, and as thick
                    as the human thigh, and which show concentric elliptic cellular rings. Such is
                    also the case with Usnea melaxantha, a tree like lichen. In these plants,
                    however, the structure is entirely cellular, and quite distinct from that of
                    Dicotyledonous plants.</p>
                <p>In the young stem of a Monocotyledonous plant the fibro-vascular bundles appear
                    scattered in an irregular manner through the fundamental parenchyma, becoming
                    more numerous towards the periphery. There is thus no primary separation in the
                    stem into pith, cortex, and medullary rays, although the central cellular mass
                    may be considered as representing the pith. Thus, if a section be made across a
                    young Monocotyledonous stem, an appearance is observed such as is represented in
                    fig. 84, where the vessels are seen as points, scattered through a cellular
                    matrix, the circumference not having any marked cortex, and the whole covered by
                    an epidermis. A similar section of a further advanced stem, as of a Palm (fig.
                    85), shows numerous bundles of vessels dispersed irregularly in cellular tissue;
                    those near the centre, <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> being scattered at a distance
                    from each other, while those towards the outside are densely aggregated, forming
                    a darkish zone <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and are succeeded at the circumference
                    by a paler circle of less compact vessels <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> with some
                    compressed cells, covered by an epidermis <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> The central
                    cellular mass has no medullary sheath. In some cases its cells are ruptured, and
                    disappear during the progress of growth, leaving a hollow cavity; but in general
                    it remains permanent, and is gradually encroached upon by the development of the
                    vascular system. The peripheral portion differs from <hi rend="italic">true</hi>
                    bark in not being separable from the rest of the tissue. It has received the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">false</hi> bark, and consists of the epidermal cells
                    <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and what has been called the cortical integument, <hi

                    but sometimes it is much developed, as in Testudinaria Elephantipes, in which it
                    is rugged, and is formed of a substance resembling cork in many respects. The
                    fibro-vascular bundles of the stem very soon become closed, and thus all growth
                    in them ceases, the cambium cells being converted completely into permanent
                    tissue. Fig. 57 represents a transverse section of a closed fibro-vascular
                    bundle from the stem of the maize (Zea Mays). In it the several elements seen in
                    the section of the fibro-vascular bundle from a Dicotyledonous stem may be
                    recognized, but there is no cambium, the cells marked <hi rend="italic">v,
                    v</hi> representing those cambiform cells which have last become permanent
                    tissue. This absence of cambium necessarily curtails the growth of the bundle,
                    and hence the limited diameter characteristic of the stems of Monocotyledons. In
                    fig. 86 a diagram represents a transverse and longitudinal section of a
                    Monocotyledonous stem.</p>
                <p>All the fibro-vascular bundles of the stem are <hi rend="italic">common</hi>
                    bundles, that is, they pass out into the leaf, and in these stems each bundle
                    has a definite arrangement. At the point where the bundle curves out into the
                    leaf it has its greatest thickness, gradually becoming attenuated a3 it passes
                    upwards into the leaf and downwards into the stem. Iu some instances, however,
                    the bundles as they descend increase at different parts of their course,
                    probably by interstitial growth, and give rise to irregular swellings of the
                    stem, as in Ceroxylon Andicola. The distension takes place occasionally at the
                    base of the stem, as in Euterpe montana. This downward prolonged portion does
                    not, however, run a straight course, but first passing inwards towards the
                    centre of the stem, it then gradually arches outwards towards the periphery.
                    This passing inwards at first of the fibro-vascular bundle gave origin to the
                    idea that the first formed fibres were gradually pushed towards the
                    circumference by those which succeeded them, and that the wood portion of these
                    stems was increased by additions to the centre; hence the term endogenous
                    applied to them, meaning internal growth. But, as has been shown, the
                    fibro-vascular bundles really become external at the base, although internal
                    above. On making a vertical section of the endogenous stem, as of a Palm (fig.
                    87), there is observed an interlacing of fibres, the fibro-vascular bundles are
                    first directed towards the centre, and then curve outwards towards the
                    circumference, so that those last formed ultimately become external. The term
                    endogenous will, therefore, only apply strictly to the fibres at the early part
                    of their course. The true distinction between exogenous and endogenous stems is,
                    that in the former the fibro-vascular bundles remain open, a cambium ring being
                    eventually formed from which the stem increases indefinitely in diameter. In the
                    latter the fibro-vascular bundles soon become closed, and being scattered
                    irregularly through the cellular tissue, and not in a circle, no cambium ring
                    can be formed, and thus growth in a transverse direction is soon arrested, and
                    the stem is of a comparatively uniform diameter throughout. The investing bark
                    of the former permits an unlimited extension of woody growth beneath it; the
                    fibrous cortical layer of the latter, by maintaining an intimate union with the
                    subjacent tissue, prevents unlimited increase in diameter. Hence we find that
                    the stem does not attain the enormous diameter exhibited by some Dicotyledonous
                    trees, such as Sequoia (Wellingtonia) gigantea and the Baobab,—the former of
                    which has been measured 116 feet in circumference. In consequence of this mode
                    of formation, the outer part of a Palm-stem is the hardest and densest, and
                    after acquiring a certain degree of firmness it resists all further distension,
                    and frequently becomes so hard as to withstand the blow of a hatchet, and
                    therefore a woody twining plant does less injury to it than to trees of
                    exogenous growth (fig. 88). The growth of endogenous stems may be said to
                    resemble an upward growth of an exogen by the terminal bud only, for there is no
                    cambium layer, and no peripherical increase. The terminal central bud is called
                    a <hi rend="italic">phyllophor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">phyllogen.</hi> As
                    growth only proceeds in this manner, no annual rings of wood are formed. From
                    the absence of concentric circles the age of a Palm cannot be estimated in the
                    same way as that of an exogenous tree. The elongation, however, of each species
                    of Palm is pretty regular, and by this some idea may be formed of its age. There
                    are many herbaceous plants in Britain, as Lilies, Grasses, &amp;c., having
                    Monocotyledonous stems, but there are no British Monocotyledonous plants with
                    permanent aerial woody stems. All the British trees are Dicotyledonous.
                    Illustrations cf Monocotyledonous stems must be taken from trees of other
                    countries, and of these Palms furnish the best examples.</p>
                <p>Although this limited growth in a transverse direction is characteristic of most
                    Monocotyledons, we find instances where a true thickening ring is formed and an
                    indefinite increase in diameter takes place, as in Dracaena, Yucca, &amp;c. This
                    thickening ring, however, originates in a manner different from that in
                    Dicotyledonous plants. A layer of the fundamental cellular tissue parallel to
                    the surface of the stem becomes merismatic, and produces new closed
                    fibro-vascular bundles and new cellular tissue <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n114/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0114-0105"/> between them. The new woody tissue so formed thus
                    corresponds to the secondary wood in Dicotyledonous stems, and the new
                    fibro-vascular bundles are all cauline, that is, do not pass out into the
                    leaves. By this means an enormous increase in diameter of the stem may take
                    place. And not unfrequently the primary central portion of the stem gives way,
                    and thus a hollow cylinder formed by this secondary wood remains. This was well
                    seen in the famous Dracaena Draco, or Dragon tree of Orotava, in the Canary
                    Islands, which had a hollow stem capable of holding several men.</p>
                <p>The composition of the vascular bundles in different parts of their course
                    varies. Thus, at the upper part, tracing them from the leaves towards the
                    centre, they contain spiral vessels, pitted vessels with some cellular tissue, a
                    few laticiferous vessels, and woody fibres resembling those of liber. As we
                    descend to the older portions of the bundle, where the tissues have become
                    permanent throughout, the spiral vessels disappear, then the pitted vessels, and
                    at the periphery nothing but pleurenchymatous tissue remains, forming a
                    complicated anastomosis or network. Not unfrequently at the nodes of the stem a
                    network of horizontal vessels occurs. They are well seen in many Grasses, where
                    the central portion of the stem has given way, and there they serve to
                    strengthen the stem. The branching of Monocotyledonous stems is originally the
                    same as in Dicotyledons, namely, a monopodial form; frequently however, the
                    axillary buds do not unfold, and the form becomes much varied. In Palms this is
                    well seen, and usually no lateral shoots are formed. In some Palms, however, as
                    the Doum Palm of Egypt <hi rend="italic">(Hyplwene thebaica),</hi> the lateral
                    shoots are developed in such a way that the stem appears to fork. Other examples
                    of the development of branches are seen in the case of the Screw-pine <hi
                    rend="italic">{Pandanus),</hi> in Grasses, as the Bamboo, in Asparagus,
                    Cordyline, Dracaena, &amp;c. In some instances the axillary shoots detach
                    themselves from the parent stem and form an independent plant, as in Lilium
                    bulbiferum (fig. 71). The bases of the leaves produced from the stem, remain
                    attached to the stem in many Palms, being surrounded by a fibrous substance, the
                    <hi rend="italic">mattulla or reticτιhιm.</hi></p>
                <p>When the internodes of the caudex of a Palm are not much elongated, the scars of
                    the leaves are seen forming spirals on the stem, as in the Coco-nut and Date. In
                    Xanthorrhoea Hastile the same arrangement is observed. In this plant also a
                    curious internal structure of the stem occurs. On making a vertical section the
                    structure appears to be that of a Dicotyledon. The woody part is formed of
                    vertical loose fibres as in Palms, and there are other fibres, radiating from
                    the centre, and cutting the preceding at right angles. These horizontal fibres
                    resemble the medullary rays, but differ in their structure. They probably serve
                    for the origin of leaves, which are numerous, and are disposed throughout the
                    whole length of the stem. In Palms, such as species of Chamaedorea, the
                    internodes are much lengthened, and rings are seen on the stem at distant
                    intervals, showing thickened node-like joints. Some Palm stems, as those of
                    Calamus Rudentum, the common Caue, are very thin and slender. In many
                    Monocotyledonous plants the stem remains below ground, developing shoots which
                    are simple, as in Banana and Plantain, or branched, as in Asparagus. In the
                    former the stem above ground is an herbaceous shoot, composed of the sheaths of
                    the leaves. It dies after fruiting, and is succeeded by other shoots from the
                    subterranean stem. The shoots or budβ from such stems occasionally remain in
                    part below ground in the form of bulbs, as in Lilies, Tulips, and Hyacinths; or
                    as corms, as in Colchicum, Crocus, Gladiolus, and Arum. In some instances the
                    aerial stem has the usual Monocotyledonous structure, while in the underground
                    stem the fibro-vascular bundles are arranged in a circle, enclosing a central
                    cellular mass or pith, and thus resembling in structure a Dicotyledonous stem.
                    This structure has been remarked in the Smilax or Sarsaparilla family. Lindley
                    calls these plants <hi rend="italic">Dictyogens,</hi> from their netted leaves,
                    by which they differ from most Monocotyledons.</p>
                <p>Amongst Acotyledonous plants there are some which possess stems consisting
                    entirely of cellular tissue, whilst in others the stems have a well-developed
                    vascular system. Of the former we have examples in Mosses, Hepaticae, and
                    Characeae; the latter we find represented in Ferns, Equisetaceae, and
                    Lycopodiaceae. The term <hi rend="italic">Acrogenous</hi> has been used as
                    descriptive of the stems of Acotyledonous plants, as they were supposed to be
                    formed by additions to the summit, and by the elongation of vessels already
                    formed. They are also sometimes called <hi rend="italic">Acrobrya.</hi> But as
                    in the case of the terms exogenous and endogenous applied to the stems of
                    Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons respectively, recent research has shown that the
                    term acrogenous cannot have the significance formerly attached to it; for in
                    some Acotyledonous plants a true cambium ring is formed by which layers of
                    tissue are successively added, and the stem increases in diameter, and also in
                    many instances the fibro-vascular bundles develop from above downwards. The
                    characters of the stem, however, enable us easily to distinguish it from that in
                    Dicotyledons or Monocotyledons. With merely a slight exception there is no
                    provision for lateral growth of the stem, and all increase in size takes place
                    by an elongation of the terminal growing-point. No cambium ring is as a rule
                    formed; where it does exist, it is not produced in the same way as in
                    Dicotyledons, but rather resembles the formation of the cambium ring in Dracaena
                    amongst Monocotyledons. When a permanent woody stem occurs amongst Acotyledonous
                    plants it resembles in general aspect the stem of a Monocotyledonous plant,
                    having nearly a uniform height, and being usually unbranched and producing a
                    tuft of leaves (fronds) at the summit. Tree-ferns furnish the best example of
                    this kind of stem. In them it is denominated a <hi rend="italic">stipe,</hi> and
                    it often attains the height of 120 feet. The stem in Acotyledonous plants is
                    distinguished from that in Dicotyledons by the absence of annual rings of wood,
                    of (with only slight exception) a cambium ring, of a separable bark, and by the
                    fact that the fibro-vascular bundles are all closed; in this latter character
                    they agree with Monocotyledons, but are distinguished from them by the
                    arrangement of the vascular bundles.</p>
                <p>In Acotyledonous stems growth takes place by division of a single apical cell,
                    situated at the extreme end of the punctum vegetationis. By divisions of this
                    cell two portions of tissue are marked out in the stem,—an inner portion, from
                    which arise the fibro-vascular tissues when they exist, and an outer or cortical
                    portion. The primary fibro-vascular bundles originate from the cellular tissue
                    of the stem in a manner analogous to what occurs in Dicotyledons and
                    Monocotyledons,—a procambial bundle being first formed, which differentiates
                    subsequently into xylem and phloem layers, but the bundles always become closed.
                    The character of the stem varies very much in the several families of
                    Acotyledonous plants.</p>
                <p>In Characeae the stem consists of a series of joints (internodes), each composed
                    of a single much elongated cell. Interposed between successive internodes are
                    the nodes, each composed of a whorl of small cells, from which the leaves are
                    developed, one leaf from every cell of the node. In the genus Chara a cortex is
                    found completely investing the internodal cell. It is formed by the development,
                    from every cell, of the nodes of an ascending and descending lobe. The ascending
                    lobes of one node and the descending lobes of the next higher node meet in the
                    middle of the intervening internode, and there interlock in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n115/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0115-0106"/> a prosenchymatous manner. Subsequently by
                    cell-division a complicated structure is developed in this investing mass. No
                    fibro-vascular bundles are found in Characeae.</p>
                <p>In Mosses and many Hepaticøe we find no fibro-vascular system, but a slender
                    leafy cellular stem. In it there is sometimes a differentiation into an inner
                    and a peripheral mass of tissue. In the former the cells have usually thin
                    walls, and are not coloured, though in some cases a thickening of the walls of
                    the central cells is observed, and a sort of rudimentary bundle is formed. The
                    circumferential cells have usually thickened walls, and are not unfrequently
                    coloured.</p>
                <p>In Ferns we have a familiar example of an Acotyledonous stem. Ordinary ferns of
                    Britain seldom attain any height, but usually creep along the ground, forming
                    rhizomes. But in the Tree-ferns of warm climates the caudex frequently attains a
                    great height. A transverse section of the stem of a fern (fig. 89) exhibits an
                    irregular circle of fibro-vascular bundles, composed of masses/, <hi
                    rend="italic">v,</hi> of various forms and sizes, situated near the
                    circumference,— the centre <hi rend="italic">m</hi> being formed of cellular
                    tissue, frequently with solitary fibro-vascular bundles scattered through it,
                    and often becoming hollow. On the outside of the vascular circle cells exist,
                    <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> covered by an epidermal layer or cellular integument
                    <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> often of hard and dense consistence, and marked with
                    the scars of the fronds.</p>
                <p>The vascular system is of greater density than the rest of the tissue, and is
                    distinguished by the dark colour of the outer portion (fig. 89, ∕), which
                    surrounds the paler vessels in the centre. In a very young stem only a single
                    fibro-vascular bundle is found in the axis of the stem, surrounded by a mass of
                    cellular tissue; but as growth proceeds a network of anastomosing bundles is
                    formed in place of the central bundle, constituting a wide meshed hollow
                    cylinder (fig. 90), and separating the fundamental cellular tissue of the stem
                    into an outer cortical and an inner medullary portion. In addition, however,
                    scattered through the pith, other bundles occur, as in Pteris aquilina, where
                    two large cauline bundles are found; and in Treeferns numerous small bundles are
                    found which pass out through the meshes of the cylinder into the leaves. The
                    primary bundles are ribbon-shaped and broad, and curve outwards at their
                    margins, from which the bundles for the leaves pass off—a leaf arising always
                    from an opening of the network. The xylem portion of the fibro-vascular bundles
                    is characterized by the great abundance of scalanform vessels, spiral vessels
                    also being present, and intermixed with them thin-walled prosenchymatous cells,
                    containing in winter a large amount of starch. This constitutes the inner,
                    lighter - coloured portion of the bundles. The phloem portion, which completely
                    surrounds the bundle, has also starch-cells, and, in addition, sievetubes and
                    elongated bast-like thick-walled fibres are found at the periphery of the
                    bundle. The whole bundle is usually enclosed by a distinct sheath of elongated
                    cells; these cells are frequently much thickened and of a dark brown colour,
                    hence the appearance presented on transverse section of a dark layer enclosing a
                    lighter-coloured part. The central cellular portion of the stem frequently
                    becomes ruptured and absorbed in old stems, which are thus hollow. The bases of
                    the leaves remain long attached, but ultimately fall off, leaving marked scars
                    (fig. 91, c), which are at first close together, but often separate afterwards
                    by interstitial growth. On these scars or <hi rend="italic">cicatrices</hi> the
                    markings of the vessels are easily seen, arranged in the same manner as those of
                    the stem. From all points of the woody cylinder stem-roots may be given off, and
                    frequently they are formed so abundantly as completely to invest the stem and
                    conceal if.</p>
                <p>In Equisetaceae or Horsetails we have another example of an Acotyledonous stem.
                    The true stem in those plants is a rhizome underground, from which aerial shoots
                    are sent up annually. Every aerial stem consists of a series of joints
                    (internodes), which are usually hollow and closed at their base by a thin septum
                    (fig. 92). Each internode passes up into a leaf-sheath embracing the next
                    internode, and this sheath is usually split into teeth at its upper margin. In
                    transverse section a circle of fibro-vascular bundles is seen (fig. 93 ) marking
                    off an inner medullary from an outer cortical portion, and separated one from
                    the other by a mass of parenchyma. These bundles are all common bundles. From
                    each tooth of the leaf-sheath the bundle may be traced, passing vertically down
                    into the internodes as far as the node beneath, and at the lower end dividing
                    into two, uniting by each branch with a bundle of the next lowest internode
                    (fig. 94). In transverse section the bundle <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0116-0107"/> resembles much that of a Monocotyledon. One
                    peculiarity, however, must be noticed. The spiral, annular, and reticulated
                    vessels at the inner side of the bundle soon disappear, and an air-canal is
                    formed in the bundle. This canal must be distinguished from the <hi
                    rend="italic">vallecular</hi> canals found in the cortex, with which they
                    alternate. Round the bundles a single layer of usually thickened and coloured
                    cells forms a sheath, and this may either run continuously round the stem, and
                    thus shut off completely the medullary from the cortical portion of the stem, or
                    may invest separately each bundle, in which case the medullary and cortical
                    portions of the stem are continuous. In some cases a layer of thickened cells is
                    found within the vascular bundles. The cortical portion is divisible into two
                    layers, an inner layer of parenchymatous cells with air canals, the <hi
                    rend="italic">vallecular</hi> canalβ, and an outer layer of thickened cells
                    immediately underlying the epidermis. The structure of the rhizome resembles
                    that of the aerial stem, differing only in the fact that the thickened cells of
                    the outer cortical layer are dark coloured, and that the central caual of the
                    internodes is often absent. In Calamites, a fossil plant which flourished
                    abundantly during the Carboniferous Period, we have a plant which in all
                    particulars is closely allied to Equisetum of the present day. But whilst the
                    young stem of Calamites presented a zone of vascular bundles separating it into
                    a medullary and cortical portion (just as in an Equisetum), new vessels were
                    added to the exterior of the pre-existing bundles as the plant grew, so that a
                    series of woody wedges were formed, increasing in growth to an enormous
                    extent.</p>
                <p>In Lycopodiaceae, or Club Mosses, the stem presents differences from that in
                    Ferns and Equisetaceae. In most members of the family there is an axial cylinder
                    formed of either one or more fibro-vascular bundles. In some cases (Selaginella)
                    the fibro-vascular bundles remain separate and do not form a cylinder. They are
                    surrounded by a mass of prosenchyιnatous cellular tissue, the cells of which may
                    be thin-walled, leaving no intercellular spaces, or the cellwalls may be much
                    thickened. Immediately surrounding the central axial bundle in Selaginella are
                    large air lacunae, which are wanting in Lycopodium. The fibro-vascular bundles
                    consist of tissues very similar to what occurs in Ferns, and the bundles are all
                    cauline. In the leaves, bundles arise which pass into the stem and coalesce with
                    the cauline bundles. In Isoetes we find a most anomalous structure. Here there
                    are no internodes in the stem; consequently, it is much shortened. The central
                    axial fibro-vascular bundle is very poorly developed, and round it a meristem is
                    formed, which, by adding new parenchyma outside, increases the diameter of the
                    stem. Thus we have here a thickening ring, but it differs from that structure in
                    Dicotyledons, inasmuch as it is not formed by a union of cambium cells of the
                    fibro-vascular bundles. It resembles more the thickening ring formed in
                    Dracaena, Yucca, and other Monocotyledons.</p>
                <p>In Rhizocarpeae the structure of the stem is very simple, consisting of an axial
                    fibro-vascular bundle surrounded by parenchyma full of air-cavities.</p>
                <p>In plants with Acotyledonous stems the mode of branching is various. In
                    Lycopodiaceae we have an example of a dichotomous branching, and the same is
                    also seen in Ferns. In the Equisetaceae a mode of branching occurs çeen nowhere
                    else in the Vegetable Kingdom. The branches arise from deeply-seated lateral
                    buds, which, upon developing, break through the superincumbent tissue; these
                    have been termed <hi rend="italic">endogenous</hi> buds. In Characeae the
                    branching is of the normal monopodial type.</p>
                <p>Amongst Thallogens, as a rule, there is no evident distinction between stem and
                    leaf. The vegetative organs consist of a number of cells separate or combined
                    into a more or less flattened expansion termed the thallus. In this group are
                    included all the Algae, Fungi, and Lichens, and many Hepaticae. The vegetative
                    structures vary much in each of these groups. In many Hepaticae, as Marchantia,
                    the vegetative structure is of a thalloid nature, and appears as a flattened,
                    broad, dichotomously-branched plate, composed of several layers of cells. The
                    upper and lower layers consist of colourless cells, and form a sort of
                    epidermis. The upper epidermal layer has stomata, while the lower gives off
                    root-like filaments, which attach it to the stratum on which it grows. The
                    stomata are, by repeated division of the guard-cells, converted into canals. The
                    central layer of cells contains green matter, and between the cellules there are
                    large intercellular spaces, which communicate with the stomata on the upper
                    surface. In what are usually termed the foliose Hepaticae, such as
                    Junger-manniae, a distinct stem is visible bearing leaves. All are cellular, no
                    differentiation occurring beyond a compacting of the peripheral layers of cells.
                    The mode of branching is usually dichotomous.</p>
                <p>In Fungi the vegetative organs consist of a mass of cellular filaments,
                    anastomosing and branching in various ways, constituting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mycelium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">spawn</hi> (fig. 95, wi.), from which
                    diversely-shaped portions of cellular tissue are developed, forming <hi
                    rend="italic">receptacles</hi> for the support of the reproductive organs. The
                    mycelium creeps along in or upon the stratum whence it is nourished, sending up
                    here and there a receptacle. The structural elements which form these are
                    colourless cellular filaments, or <hi rend="italic">lvyphoe,</hi> divided
                    usually by many transverse septa. These sometimes combine to form a dense mass
                    of parenchyma. In some cases the hyphae of the mycelium are densely interwoven,
                    and form masses of definite shape, the outer layer of which
                    (pseudo-parenchymatous) forms a hard shell or skin; such a mass is termed a <hi
                    rend="italic">sclerotium.</hi> The reproductive receptacle formed from the
                    mycelium is also composed of hyphae. When there is only a single hypha the
                    reproductive bodies are borne on the ends of its branches; but more usually the
                    branches of the hyphae bearing the reproductive bodies unite to form a flattened
                    expansion, the <hi rend="italic">hymenium.</hi> As they contain no chlorophyll,
                    Fungi take up assimilated matter from other organisms, and therefore are
                    frequently parasites.</p>
                <p>In Algae the simplest forms present nothing but a cellwall, containing a coloured
                    protoplasmic substance, as in some Nostocaceae. In some cases firmness is
                    attained by deposition of silica as in Diatoms, or by lime carbonate as in
                    Acetabularia. Lignification never occurs. More usually, however, the cells are
                    combined into a tissue, but the forms which this may assume and the modes of
                    combination are more various than in any other class of plants,—linearmasses,
                    strings, globes, laminae, &lt;fcc., being formed. There may be in some cases a
                    slight differentiation into distinct organs. Thus, in some of the higher forms,
                    as Fucaceae, a distinct stem is formed, from which flattened thalli resembling
                    leaf structures arise, and at the base root-like structures <hi rend="italic"
                    >(rhizoids)</hi> are formed. These parts, however, have none of the internal
                    structures which characterize higher plants, but consist entirely of cellular
                    tissue. At most there is a condensation of cellular tissue at the periphery,
                    forming an epidermis, and a similar condensation in the axis. The mode of
                    branching amongst Algae is either monopodial or dichotomous.</p>
                <p>In Lichens the thallus (fig. 96) consists of a <hi rend="italic">hyphal</hi>
                    element of anastomosing and interlacing filaments, amongst which are distributed
                    rounded unicellular coloured bodies, the <hi rend="italic">gonidia</hi> (fig.
                    97, <hi rend="italic">g).</hi> These gonidia are either arranged <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n117/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0117-0108"/> in one layer in the thallus, which is then said
                    to be <hi rend="italic">heteromerous</hi> (the hypha layer being divided into a
                    cortical and deeper part), or they are scattered equally throughout its
                    substance and are <hi rend="italic">homoeomerous.</hi> The gonidia are
                    separable, and may form independent plants. When they are being detached, the
                    separation begins at the centre of the thallus, so that the middle of the Lichen
                    becomes pulverulent, while its circumference may remain foliaceous or
                    crustaceous. By the continuation of this process it sometimes happens that the
                    whole Lichen becomes a mass of greenish or yellowish powder. The thallus may be
                    crustaceous, in the form of an incrustation upon rocks, trees, &amp;c., with
                    which it becomes closely connected, as in Graphis; or it may be foliaceous,
                    forming a flattened expansion easily detachable from the substratum to which it
                    is connected by small rootlike bodies or <hi rend="italic">rhizines,</hi> as in
                    Peltigera; or the lichen may be what is termed fruticose, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> composed of a much-branched thallus rising from a single point of
                    attachment, as in Usnea. Recent observations upon Lichens tend to show that they
                    are in reality composed of two distinct organisms,—one, a Fungus, being the
                    hyphal part, and the other, an Alga, the gonidial portion, and that the Fungus
                    is parasitic upon the gonidia.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Leaves and their Modifications.</hi></p>
                <p>In popular language all the green expanded organs borne upon an axis are
                    designated leaves. Investigation, however, has shown that many other parts of a
                    plant which externally appear very different from ordinary leaves are, in their
                    essential particulars, very similar to them, and are in fact their morphological
                    equivalents. Thus the scales on the bulb of the Onion, the various parts of the
                    flower, &amp;c., are all leaves. Assuming, then, that the structure ordinarily
                    termed a leaf is the typical form, these latter are designated changed or <hi
                    rend="italic">metamorphosed</hi> leaves; and all structures morphologically
                    equivalent with the leaf are included under the general term <hi rend="italic"
                    >phyllome</hi> (leaf-structure). Leaves are produced as lateral outgrowths of
                    the stem. This character, common to all leaves, distinguishes them from other
                    organs. In the higher plants we can easily recognize the distinction between
                    stem and leaf. Amongst the lower plants, however, it is found that a demarcation
                    into stem and leaf is impossible, but that there is a structure which partakes
                    of the characters of both,— such is a <hi rend="italic">thallome.</hi> The
                    leaves always arise from the outer portion of the primary meristem of the plant,
                    and the tissues of the leaf are continuous with those of the stem. Every leaf
                    originates as a simple cellular papilla, which consists of a development from
                    the cortical layers covered by epidermis; and as growth proceeds, the
                    fibro-vascular bundles of the stem are continued outwards, and finally expand
                    and terminate in the leaf. The increase in length of the leaf by growth at the
                    apex is usually of a limited nature. In some Ferns, however, there seems to be a
                    provision for indefinite terminal growth, while in others this growth is
                    periodically interrupted. It not un frequently happens, especially amongst
                    Monocotyledons, that after growth at the apex has ceased, it is continued at the
                    base of the leaf, and in this way the length may be much increased. Amongst
                    Dicotyledons this is very rare. In all cases the dimensions of the leaf are
                    enlarged by interstitial growth of it 3 parts.</p>
                <p>The simplest leaf is found in some Mosses, where it consists of a single layer of
                    cells. Usually it consists of several layers, and amongst vascular plants is
                    distinguishable into an epidermis and a central parenchyma with fibro-vascular
                    bundles distributed through it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">epidermis</hi> (fig. 98, <hi rend="italic">es,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ei),</hi> composed of cells more or less compressed, has usually a
                    different structure and aspect on the two surfaces of the leaf. It is chiefly on
                    the epidermis of the lower surface (fig. 98, <hi rend="italic">ei)</hi> that
                    stomata, <hi rend="italic">st,</hi> are produced, occupying spaces between the
                    veins, and it is there also that hairs, <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> usually occur.
                    The lower epidermis is often of a dull or pale-green colour, soft, and easily
                    detached. The upper epidermis is frequently smooth and shining, and sometimes
                    becomes very hard and dense. Many tropical plants present on the upper surface
                    of their leaves several layers of compressed epidermal cells. These appear to be
                    essential for the preservation of moisture in the leaf. In leaves which float
                    upon the surface of water, as those of the Water-lily, the upper epidermis alone
                    possesses stomata.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">parenchyma</hi> of the leaf is the cellular tissue
                    surrounding the vessels, and enclosed within the epidermis (fig. 98, <hi
                    rend="italic">ps, pi).</hi> It has sometimes received the names of <hi
                    rend="italic">diachyma, mesophyllum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">diploë.</hi> It
                    is formed of two distinct series of cells, each containing chlorophyll or
                    green-coloured granules, but differing in form and arrangement. Below the
                    epidermis of the upper side of the leaf there are one or two layers of oblong
                    blunt cells, placed perpendicularly to the surface (fig. 98, <hi rend="italic"
                    >p&gt;s),</hi> and applied so closely to each other as to leave only small
                    intercellular spaces (fig. 98, <hi rend="italic">m),</hi> except where stomata
                    happen to be present. On the under side of the leaf the cells are irregular,
                    often branched, and are arranged more or less horizontally (fig. 98, <hi
                    rend="italic">pi),</hi> leaving cavities betweeu them, <hi rend="italic">I,</hi>
                    which often communicate with stomata. On this account the tissue has received
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">cavernous.</hi> In leaves having a very firm
                    texture, as those of Coniferae and Cycadaceae, the cells of the parenchyma
                    immediately beneath the epidermis are very much thickened and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n118/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0118-0109"/> elongated in a direction parallel to the surface
                    of the leaf, so as to be fibre-like. These constitute a hypodermal layer,
                    beneath which the chlorophyll cells of the parenchyma are densely packed
                    together, and are elongated in a direction vertical to the surface of the leaf;
                    this has been termed <hi rend="italic">palisade</hi> tissue. The form and
                    arrangement of the cells, however, depend much on the nature of the plant, and
                    its exposure to light and air. Sometimes the arrangement of the cells on both
                    sides of the leaf is similar, as occurs in leaves which have their edges
                    presented to the sky. In very succulent plants the cells form a compact mass,
                    and those in the centre are often colourless. In some cases the cellular tissue
                    is deficient at certain points, giving rise to distinct holes in the leaf, as in
                    Monstera Adansonii; such a leaf has been called <hi rend="italic">pertuse.</hi>
                    In Victoria regia perforations in the leaf seem to be subservient to the
                    purposes of nutrition, by permitting the gases collected beneath the large
                    expanded leaf to escape, and thus allowing its under surface to be brought into
                    immediate contact with the water. The fibro-vascular system in the leaf
                    constitutes the <hi rend="italic">venation.</hi> The fibro-vascular bundles from
                    the stem bend out into the leaf, and are there arranged in a definite manner.
                    They usually form two layers, which may be separated by maceration. In <hi
                    rend="italic">skeleton leaves, or</hi> leaves in which the parenchyma is
                    removed, these layers are well seen. In some leaves, as in the Barberry, the
                    vessels forming the veins are hardened, producing spines without any parenchyma.
                    The hardening of the extremities of the vascular tissue is the cause of the
                    spiny margin of many leaves, such as the Holly, of the sharp-pointed leaves of
                    Madder, and of mucronate leaves, or those having a blunt end with a hard
                    projection in the centre.</p>
                <p>Submerged leaves, or leaves which are developed under water, differ in structure
                    from aerial leaves. They have usually no fibro-vascular system, but consist of a
                    congeries of cells, which sometimes become elongated and compressed so as to
                    resemble veins. They have a layer of compact cells on their surface, but no true
                    epidermis, and no stomata. Their internal structure consists of cells, disposed
                    irregularly, and sometimes leaving spaces which are filled with air for the
                    purpose of floating the leaf. When exposed to the air these leaves easily part
                    with their moisture, and become shrivelled and dry. In some instances there is
                    only a network of filamentous-like cells formed, the spaces between which are
                    not filled with parenchyma, giving a peculiar skeleton appearance to the leaf,
                    as in Ouvirandra fenestralis (Lattice plant). Such a leaf has been called <hi
                    rend="italic">fenestrate.</hi> A leaf, whether aerial.or submerged, generally
                    consists of a flat expanded portion (fig. 99, <hi rend="italic">I),</hi> called
                    the <hi rend="italic">blade, limb, or lamina,</hi> of a narrower portion called
                    the <hi rend="italic">petiole</hi> or <hi rend="italic">stalk</hi> (fig. 99, <hi
                    rend="italic">p),</hi> and sometimes of a portion at the base of the petiole,
                    which forms a <hi rend="italic">sheath</hi> or <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi>
                    (fig. 99, y), or is developed in the form of leaflets, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >stipules</hi> (fig. 123, s). The sheathing portion is sometimes incorporated
                    with the stem, and is then called <hi rend="italic">tigellary.</hi> These
                    portions are not always present. The sheathing or stipulary portion is
                    frequently wanting, and occasionally only one of the other two is developed.
                    When a leaf has a distinct stalk it is called <hi rend="italic">petiolate;</hi>
                    when it has none, it is <hi rend="italic">sessile,</hi> and if in this case it
                    embraces the stem it is said to be <hi rend="italic">amplexicaul.</hi> The part
                    of the leaf next the petiole or the axis is the <hi rend="italic">base,</hi>
                    while the opposite extremity is the <hi rend="italic">apex.</hi> The surfaces of
                    the leaf are called the <hi rend="italic">pagin&lt;x,</hi> and its edges or
                    margins form the <hi rend="italic">circumscription</hi> of the leaf. The leaf is
                    usually flattened and expanded horizontally, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> at
                    right angles to the longitudinal axis of the shoot, so that the upper pagina is
                    directed towards the heavens, and the lower pagina towards the earth. In some
                    cases leaves, as in Iris, or leaf-like petioles, as in Australian Acacias and
                    Eucalypti, have their plane of expansion parallel to the axis of the shoot; or
                    the leaf may have a cylindrical or polyhedral form, as in Mesembryanthemum. In
                    other instances, as in Aiströmeria, the leaf becomes twisted in its course, so
                    that what is superior at one part becomes inferior at another. The upper angle
                    formed between the leaf and the stem is called its <hi rend="italic">axil,</hi>
                    and everything arising at that point is called <hi rend="italic">axillary.</hi>
                    It is there that leaf-buds are usually developed. The leaf is sometimes
                    articulated with the stem, and, when it falls off, a <hi rend="italic">scar</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">cicatricula</hi> remains; at other times it is continuous
                    with it, and then decays, while still attached to the axis. In their early state
                    all leaves are continuous with the stem, and it is only in their after growth
                    that articulations are formed. When leaves fall off annually they are called <hi
                    rend="italic">deciduous;</hi> when they remain for two or more years they are
                    <hi rend="italic">persistent,</hi> and the plant is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >evergreen.</hi> The laminar portion of a leaf is occasionally articulated with
                    the petiole, as in the Orange, and a joint at times exists between the vaginal
                    or stipulary portion and the petiole.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of the fibro-vascular system in the lamina constitutes the <hi
                    rend="italic">venation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nervation.</hi> In an ordinary
                    leaf, as that of the Elm, there is observed a large central vein running from
                    the base to the apex of the leaf, this is the m'(Zrιδ (fig. 100); it gives off
                    veins laterally <hi rend="italic">(pri</hi><hi rend="italic">mary veins'),</hi>
                    which either end in a curvature within the margin <hi rend="italic"
                    >(curve-veined),</hi> as in Lilac and Belladonna, or go directly to the edge of
                    the leaf <hi rend="italic">(feather-veined),</hi> as in Elm (fig. 100) and
                    Chestnut. If they are curved, then external veins and marginal veinlets are
                    interspersed through the parenchyma external to the curvature. There are also
                    other veins of less extent <hi rend="italic">(costal veins)</hi> given off by
                    the midrib, and these give origin to small <hi rend="italic">veinlets.</hi> A
                    leaf with only a single midrib is said to be <hi rend="italic">unicostate</hi>
                    (fig. 100). In some cases, as Sycamore and Cinnamon, in place of there being
                    only a single midrib there are several large veins (ribs) of nearly equal size,
                    which diverge from the point where the blade joins the petiole or stem, giving
                    off lateral veins. The leaf in this case is <hi rend="italic">multicostate</hi>
                    (fig. 101). When there are three prominent ribs, as in Cinnamon and Cassia, the
                    leaf is <hi rend="italic">tricostate;</hi> when five, <hi rend="italic">quinque
                    cost ate.</hi> When the midrib gives off two ribs a little above the base, the
                    leaf becomes <hi rend="italic">triplicostate;</hi> when it gives off five, <hi
                    rend="italic">quintuplicostate.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n119/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0119-0110"/>
                <p>In a leaf having many ribs they may converge towards the apex, as in Cinnamon, or
                    they may diverge, as in Sycamore and the Castor-oil plant (fig. 101). Thus the
                    primary veins give off secondary veins, and these in their turn give off
                    tertiary veins, and so on until a complete network of vessels is produced, and
                    those veins usually project on the under surface of the leaf. To a distribution
                    of veins such as this the name of <hi rend="italic">reticulated</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">netted</hi> venation has been applied. In the leaves of some
                    plants there exists a midrib with large veins running nearly parallel to it from
                    the base to the apex of the lamina, as in Grasses (fig. 102); or with veins
                    diverging from the base of the lamina in more or less parallel lines, as in Fan
                    Palms (fig. 103), or with veins coming off from it throughout its whole course,
                    and running parallel to each other in a straight or curved direction towards the
                    margin of the leaf, as in Plantain and Banana. In these cases the veins are
                    often united by cross veinlets, which do not, however, form an angular network.
                    Such leaves are said to be <hi rend="italic">parallel-veined.</hi> The leaves of
                    Monocotyledons have generally this kind of venation, while reticulated venation
                    most usually occurs amongst Dicotyledons. Some plants, which in most points of
                    their structure are Monocotyledonous, yet have reticulated venation. Such have
                    been called Dictyogens. In vascular Acotyledonous plants there is frequently a
                    tendency to fork exhibited by the fibro-vascular bundles in the leaf; and when
                    this is the case we have <hi rend="italic">fork-veined</hi> leaves. This is well
                    seen in many Ferns. The distribution of the system of vessels in the leaf is
                    usually easily traced, but in the case of succulent plants, as Hoya, Agave,
                    Stonecrop, and Mesembryanthemum, the veins are obscure, and the leaves are said
                    to be <hi rend="italic">hidden-veined.</hi> In the cellular leaves of Mosses a
                    median vein of several layers of cells is often visible, but as there are no
                    fibro-vascular bundles present this is considered a false venation, and they are
                    styled <hi rend="italic">veinless {Avenid).</hi></p>

                <p>In all plants, except Thallophytes, leaves are present at some period of their
                    existence. In Cuscuta (Dodder), however, we have an exception. The forms assumed
                    by leaves vary much, not only in different plants but in the same plant. It is
                    only amongst the lower classes of plants,—Mosses, Characeøe, Ac.,—that all the
                    leaves on a plant are similar. As we pass up the scale of vegetable life we find
                    them becoming more and more variable. The, structures in ordinary language
                    designated as leaves are! considered so <hi rend="italic">par excellence,</hi>
                    and they are frequently spoken' of as <hi rend="italic">foliage leaves.</hi> In
                    relation to their production on the stem we may observe that when they are small
                    they are always produced in great number, and as they increase in size their
                    number and rapidity of growth diminish correspondingly. The cellular process
                    from the axis which develops into a leaf is simple and undivided; it rarely
                    remains so, but in progress of growth becomes segmented, in various ways, either
                    longitudinally <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> or laterally, or in both ways. By
                    longitudinal segmentation we have a leaf formed consisting of vagina, petiole,
                    and lamina; or one or other of these may be absent, and thus stalked, sessile,
                    sheathing, &amp;c., leaves are produced. Lateral segmentation affects the
                    lamina, producing indentations, lobings, or fissuring of its margins. In this
                    way two marked forms of leaf are produced—(1.) <hi rend="italic">Simple</hi>
                    form, in which the segmentation, however deeply it extends into the lamina, does
                    not separate portions of the lamina which become articulated with the midrib or
                    petiole; and (2.) <hi rend="italic">Compound</hi> form, where portions of the
                    lamina are separated as detached <hi rend="italic">leaflets</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">{foliola},</hi> which become articulated with the midrib or
                    petiole. In simple leaves, then, there is never more than one articulation,
                    which is at the point of their insertion on the stem. In compound leaves there
                    are one or more articulations beyond the point of insertion on the stem. In both
                    simple and compound leaves, according to the amount of segmentation and the mode
                    of development of the parenchyma and direction of the fibro-vascular bundles,
                    many forms are produced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Simple Leaves.—</hi> When the parenchyma is developed
                    symmetrically on each side of the midrib or stalk, the leaf is <hi rend="italic"
                    >equal;</hi> if otherwise, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">unequal</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">oblique</hi> (fig. 100). If the margins are even and present no
                    divisions, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">entire</hi> (fig. 104); if there are
                    slight projections of cellular or vascular tissue beyond the margin the leaf is
                    not entire; when the projections are irregular and more or less pointed, the
                    leaf is <hi rend="italic">dentate</hi> or toothed; when they lie regularly over
                    each other, like the teeth of a saw, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">serrate</hi>
                    (fig. 100); when they are rounded the leaf is <hi rend="italic">crenate.</hi> If
                    the divisions extend more deeply into the lamina than the margin, the leaf
                    receives different names according to the nature of the segments; thus, when the
                    divisions extend about half-way down (fig. 105), it is <hi rend="italic">cleft
                    (fissus},</hi> and its lines of separation are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >fissures:</hi> when <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n120/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0120-0111"/> the divisions extend nearly to the base or to the
                    midrib the leaf is <hi rend="italic">partite,</hi> and its lines of separation
                    are called <hi rend="italic">partitions.</hi></p>
                <p>If these divisions take place in a simple <hi rend="italic">feather-veined</hi>
                    leaf it becomes either <hi rend="italic">pinnatifid</hi> (fig. 106), when the
                    segments extend to about the middle and are broad; or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pectinate,</hi> when they are narrow; or <hi rend="italic">pinnatipartite,</hi>
                    when the divisions extend nearly to the midrib. These primary divisions may be
                    again subdivided in a similar manner, and thus a <hi rend="italic"
                    >feather-veined</hi> leaf will become <hi rend="italic">bipinnatifid</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">bipinnatipartite;</hi> and still further subdivisions give origin
                    to <hi rend="italic">tripinnatifid</hi> and <hi rend="italic">laciniated</hi>
                    leaves. If the divisions of a pinnatifid leaf are more or less triangular, and
                    point downwards towards the base, the extremity of the leaf being undivided and
                    triangular, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">runcinate</hi> (fig. 105), as in the
                    Dandelion. When the apex consists of a large rounded lobe, and the divisions,
                    which are also more or less rounded, become gradually smaller towards the base,
                    as in Barbarea, the leaf is called <hi rend="italic">lyrate,</hi> from its
                    resemblance to an ancient lyre. When there is a concavity on each side of a
                    leaf, so as to make it resemble a violin, as in Rumex pulcher, it is called <hi
                    rend="italic">panduriform.</hi> The same kinds of divisions taking place in a
                    simple leaf with <hi rend="italic">radiating</hi> venation, give origin to <hi
                    rend="italic">lobed, cleft,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">partite</hi> forms. When
                    the divisions extend about half-way through the leaves, they may be <hi
                    rend="italic">three-lobed, five-lobed, seven-lobed, many-lobed,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">trifid, quinquefid, septemfid, multifid,</hi> according to the
                    number of the divisions. The name <hi rend="italic">palmate,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">palmatifid</hi> (fig. 101), is the general term applied to leaves
                    with radiating venation, in which there are several lobes united by a broad
                    expansion of parenchyma, like the palm of the hand, as in the Castor oil plant,
                    Rheum palmatum, and Papaw. The divisions of leaves with radiating venation may
                    extend to near the base of the leaf, and the names <hi rend="italic">bipartite,
                    tripartite,</hi><hi rend="italic">quinquepartite</hi> (fig. 107), <hi
                    rend="italic">septempartite, digitipartite</hi> (Plate II. fig. 1), are given
                    according as the partitions are two, three, five, seven, or more. In Drosera
                    dichotoma bipartite and tripartite leaves are seen. The term <hi rend="italic"
                    >dissected</hi> is applied to leaves with radiating venation, having numerous
                    narrow divisions, as in Geranium dissectum.</p>
                <p>When in a radiating leaf there are three primary partitions, and the two lateral
                    lobes are again cleft, as in Helleborus</p>
                <p>(fig. 108), the leaf is called <hi rend="italic">pedate</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pedatifid,</hi> from a fancied resemblance to the claw of a bird. In all the
                    instances already alluded to the leaves have been considered as flat expansions,
                    in which the ribs or veins spread out on the same plane with the stalk. In some
                    cases, however, the veins spread at right angles to the stalk. If they do so
                    equally on all sides, and are united by parenchyma, so that the stalk occupies
                    the centre, the leaf becomes <hi rend="italic">orbicular,</hi> as in
                    Hydrocotyle; if unequally, so that the stalk is not in the centre, the leaf is
                    <hi rend="italic">peltate,</hi> as in Indian Cress (fig. 109). The edges or
                    margins of orbicular and peltate leaves are often variously divided.</p>
                <p>Without attempting to notice all the forms of leaves, the following are
                    enumerated as the most important. When the veins do not spread out, but run from
                    the base to the apex with a narrow strip of parenchyma, the leaf is <hi
                    rend="italic">linear</hi> or <hi rend="italic">acicular,</hi> as in Pines and
                    Firs. These trees are hence called in Germany <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nadel-hölzer,</hi> or needle trees. When the veins diverge, those in the middle
                    being longest, and the leaf tapering at each end (fig. 110), it becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">lanceolate.</hi> If the middle veins exceed the others slightly,
                    and the ends are convex, the leaf is either <hi rend="italic">rounded,
                    elliptical, oval,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">oblong</hi> (fig. 111). If the veins
                    at the base are longest, and the leaf narrows to the top, it is <hi
                    rend="italic">ovate</hi> or egg-shaped (fig. 104), as in Chickweed; if the apex
                    is broadest, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">obovate,</hi> or inversely egg-shaped
                    (fig. 112). Leaves are <hi rend="italic">cuneate</hi> or wedge-shaped, in
                    Saxifraga; <hi rend="italic">spathulate,</hi> or spatula-like, having a broad
                    rounded apex, and tapering <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n121/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0121-0112"/> down to the stalk, as in the Daisy; <hi
                    rend="italic">subulate,</hi> narrow and tapering like an awl; <hi rend="italic"
                    >acuminate,</hi> or drawn out into a long point, as in Ficus religiosa; <hi
                    rend="italic">mucronate,</hi> with a hard stiff point or mucro at the apex. When
                    the parenchyma is deficient at the <hi rend="italic">apex</hi> so as to form two
                    rounded lobes, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">obcordate</hi> or inversely
                    heart-shaped; when the deficiency is very slight the leaf is called <hi
                    rend="italic">emarginate</hi> (fig. 112), as having a portion taken out of the
                    margin; when the apex is merely flattened or slightly depressed the leaf is <hi
                    rend="italic">retuse;</hi> and when the apex ends abruptly in a straight margin,
                    as in the Tulip-tree, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">truncate.</hi> When the
                    veins at the base of the lamina are prolonged downwards at an obtuse angle with
                    the midrib, and rounded lobes are formed, as in</p>
                <p>Dog-violet, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">cordate or</hi> heart-shaped; it is
                    kidneyshaped or <hi rend="italic">reniform</hi> (fig. 113), when the apex is
                    rounded as in Asarum. When the lobes are prolonged downwards and are acute, the
                    leaf is <hi rend="italic">sagittate</hi> (fig. 114); when they proceed at right
                    angles, as in Rumex Acetosella, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">hastate</hi> or
                    halbert-shaped. When a simple leaf is divided at the base into two leaf-like
                    appendages, it is called <hi rend="italic">auriculate.</hi> When the veins
                    spread out in various planes, and there is a large development of cellular
                    tissue, so as to produce a succulent leaf, such forms occur as <hi rend="italic"
                    >conical, prismatical, ensiform</hi> or sword-like, <hi rend="italic"
                    >acinaciform</hi> or scimitar-shaped, and <hi rend="italic">dolabriform</hi> or
                    axeshaped. When the development of parenchyma is such that it more than fills up
                    the spaces between the veins, the margins become <hi rend="italic">wavy,
                    crisp,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">undulated,</hi> as in Rumex crispus and Rheum
                    undulatum. By cultivation the cellular tissue is often much increased, giving
                    rise to the <hi rend="italic">curled</hi> leaves of Greens, Savoys, Cresses,
                    Lettuce, &amp;c. In Rushes the shoots which act as leaves are often <hi
                    rend="italic">terete.</hi> They are either barren or bear flowers. Their
                    cellular tissue is often stellate, and the shoots sometimes exhibit a peculiar
                    spiral twisting. Amongst parallel veined leaves the margins are usually entire,
                    especially when the veins converge.</p>
                <p>Compound leaves are those in which the divisions extend to the midrib or petiole,
                    and the separated portions become each articulated with it, and receive the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">foliola</hi> or <hi rend="italic">leaflets.</hi> The
                    midrib, or petiole, has thus the appearance of a branch with separate leaves
                    attached to it, but it is considered properly as one leaf, because in its
                    earliest state it arises from the axis as a single piece, and its subsequent
                    divisions in the form of leaflets are all in one plane. The leaflets are either
                    sessile (fig. 115), or have stalks, called <hi rend="italic">petiolules</hi>
                    (fig. 116), according as the vascular bundles of the veins spread out or
                    divaricate at once, or remain united for a certain length. Compound leaves have
                    been classified according to the nature of the venation and the development of
                    parenchyma, If we suppose that in a simple feather-veined unicostate leaf the
                    divisions extend to the midrib, and each of the primary veins spreads out or
                    branches, and becomes surrounded with parenchyma, and the leaflets thus formed
                    become articulated to the pe tiole or midrib (fig. 116), the leaf becomes
                    compound and <hi rend="italic">pinnate.</hi> If the midrib and primary veins are
                    not covered with parenchyma, while the <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi> (or
                    those coming off in a feather-like manner from the primary veins) are, and
                    separate leaflets are thus formed which are articulated with the veins, the leaf
                    is <hi rend="italic">bipinnate.</hi> In this case the secondary veins form as it
                    were partial petioles. A farther subdivision, in which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tertiary</hi> veins only are covered with parenchyma and have separate
                    leaflets, gives <hi rend="italic">tripinnate</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >decompound</hi> forms, in which case the tertiary veins form the partial
                    petioles. A leaf divided still more is called <hi rend="italic"

                    >unequally pinnate</hi> (impari-pinnate); when the leaflets or pinnae are placed
                    alternately on either side of the midrib, and not directly opposite to each
                    other, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">alternately pinnate;</hi> and when the
                    pinnae are of different sizes, the leaf is <hi rend="italic">interruptedly
                    pinnate.</hi> In the case of a simple multicostate leaf with radiating venation,
                    if we suppose the ribs to be covered with parenchyma, so as to form separate
                    leaflets, each of which is articulated to the petiole, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >digitate</hi> form of compound leaf is produced; if there are three leaflets
                    the form is <hi rend="italic">ternate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">trifoliate;</hi>
                    if four, <hi rend="italic">quaternate;</hi> if five, <hi rend="italic"
                    >quinate;</hi> if seven, <hi rend="italic">septenate;</hi> and so on. If the
                    three ribs of a ternate leaf subdivide each into three primary veins, which
                    become covered with parenchyma so as to be separate articulated leaflets, the
                    leaf is <hi rend="italic">biternate;</hi> and if another threefold division
                    takes place, it is <hi rend="italic">triternate.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">petiole</hi> or leaf-stalk is the part which unites the
                    limb or blade of the leaf to the stem (fig. 99, <hi rend="italic">p).</hi> It is
                    absent in <hi rend="italic">sessile</hi> leaves, and this is also frequently the
                    case when the vagina is present, as in Grasses. It consists of a mass of
                    fibro-vascular bundles with a varying amount of cellular <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n122/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0122-0113"/> tissue. The vessels are enclosed in an epidermal
                    covering, with few stomata, and are more or less compressed. When the vascular
                    bundles reach the base of the lamina they separate and spread out in various
                    ways, as already described under venation. At the place where the petiole joins
                    the stem there is frequently an articulation, or a constriction with a tendency
                    to disunion, and at the same time there exists a swelling (fig. 117, <hi
                    rend="italic">p),</hi> called <hi rend="italic">pulvinus,</hi> formed of
                    cellular tissue, the cells of which exhibit the phenomenon of irritability
                    (figs. 117, 118). At the point where the petiole passes into the lamina, or
                    where the midrib joins the leaflets of a compound leaf, there is occasionally a
                    cellular dilatation called <hi rend="italic">struma,</hi> and an articulation.
                    In Mimosa pudica a sensitiveness is located in the pulvinus (fig. 117, <hi
                    rend="italic">p),</hi> which upon irritation induces a depression of the whole
                    bipinnate leaf; a similar property exists in the struma at the base of the
                    leaflets which fold upwards. In Desmodium gyrans (fig. 118) the pulvinus and
                    struma have a similar power of causing movements of the large terminal leaflet
                    and the two smaller lateral ones. In other cases the petiole is not articulated,
                    but is continuous either with the stem, or with the sheath (vagina). The
                    articulation or joint is by many considered as indicating a compound leaf, and
                    hence the leaf of the Orange is considered as such, although it has an undivided
                    lamina (fig. 119, <hi rend="italic">I).</hi> In articulated leaves, the pulvinus
                    may be attached either to the petiole or to the axis, and may fall with the
                    leaf, or remain attached to the stem. When articulated leaves drop, their place
                    is marked by a cicatrix or scar, seen below the bud in fig. 63. In this scar the
                    remains of the vascular bundles <hi rend="italic">c</hi> are seen; and its form
                    furnishes characters by which particular kinds of trees may be known when not in
                    leaf. In the case of many Palms and Tree-ferns the scars or cicatrices of the
                    leaves are very conspicuous. In fossil plants important characters are founded
                    on them.</p>
                <p>When there is no articulation between the petiole and the stem, as is the case
                    with many Monocotyledons, the leaf is continuous with the axis, and is not
                    deciduous, but withers on the stalk. In many Liliaceous plants the leaves during
                    their decay continue attached to the plants. The petiole varies in length, being
                    usually shρrter than the lamina, but sometimes much longer. In some Palms it is
                    15 or 20 feet long, and is so firm as to be used for poles or walking-sticks. In
                    general, the petiole is more or less rounded in its form, the upper surface
                    being flattened or grooved. Sometimes it is compressed laterally, as in the
                    Aspen, and to this peculiarity the trembling of the leaves of this tree is
                    attributed. In aquatic plants the leaf-stalk is sometimes distended with air, as
                    in Pontederia and</p>
                <p>Trapa, so as to float the leaf. At other times it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >winged,</hi> and is either leafy, as in the Orange (fig. 119, <hi rend="italic"
                    >p},</hi> Lemon, and Dionaea (fig. 46, <hi rend="italic">p),</hi> or
                    pitcher-like, as in the Pitcher-plant</p>
                <p>(fig. 120, <hi rend="italic">p~)</hi> and Sarracenia (fig. 121). Leafy petioles
                    are occasionally united to the axis for some extent, and thus become <hi
                    rend="italic">decurrent.</hi> In some Australian Acacias, and in some species of
                    Oxalis and Bupleurum, the petiole is flattened in a vertical direction, the
                    vascular bundles separating immediately after quitting the stem, and running
                    nearly parallel from base to apex. This kind of petiole (fig. 122, <hi
                    rend="italic">p)</hi> has been called <hi rend="italic">phyllodium.</hi> In
                    these plants the laminae or blades of the leaves are pinnate, bipinnate, or
                    ternate, and are produced at the extremities of the phyllodia in a horizontal
                    direction; but in many instances they are not developed, and the phyllodium
                    serves the purpose of a leaf. Hence some Acacias are called leafless. These
                    phyllodia, by their vertical position and their peculiar form, give a remarkable
                    aspect to vegetation. On the same Acacia there occur leaves with the petiole and
                    lamina <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n123/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0123-0114"/> perfect; others having the petiole slightly
                    expanded or winged, and the lamina imperfectly developed; and others in which
                    there is no lamina, and the petiole becomes large and broad. Some petioles, in
                    place of ending in a lamina become changed into a delicate filiform body, a <hi
                    rend="italic">tendril</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cirrus,</hi> so as to enable the
                    plant to climb. In many leaves interposed betwixt the petiole and the stem, or,
                    in sessile leaves, betwixt the lamina and the stem, an expansion of the foliar
                    tissue takes place, so that a <hi rend="italic">sheath (vagina)</hi> is formed,
                    which embraces the whole or part of the circumference of the stem (fig. 102, <hi
                    rend="italic">gv).</hi> This sheath is comparatively rare in Dicotyledons, but
                    is seen in Umbelliferous plants, where it constitutes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pericladium,</hi> and in the Rhubarb order, where it is large and membranous,
                    and has received the name of <hi rend="italic">ochrea</hi> or boot. It is much
                    more common amongst Monocotyledons. In Palms it forms a kind of network, to
                    which the name of <hi rend="italic">reticulum</hi> has been given. In Sedges the
                    sheath forms a complete investment of the stem, whilst in Grasses (fig. 102) it
                    is split on one side. In the latter plants there is also a membranous outgrowth
                    at right angles to the median plane of the leaf from the point where the sheath
                    passes into the lamina (there being no petiole). To this structure the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">ligule</hi> (fig. 102, <hi rend="italic">gl)</hi> lias been
                    given. It is of various dimensions, and thus gives a character to the
                    plants.</p>
                <p>In leaves in which no sheath is produced we not unfrequently find small foliar
                    organs at the base of the petiole. These have been denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >stipules</hi> (fig. 123, s). The stipules are often two in number, and they are
                    important as supplying characters in certain natural orders. Thus they occur in
                    the Pea and Bean family, in Rosaceous plants, and the Cinchona bark family. They
                    are not common in Dicotyledons with opposite leaves. Plants having stipules are
                    called <hi rend="italic">stipulate;</hi> those having none are <hi rend="italic"
                    >exstipulate.</hi> Stipules are formed by some of the vascular bundles diverging
                    as they leave the stem, and becoming covered with parenchyma, so as to resemble
                    true leaves. Like leaves they are large or small, entire or divided, deciduous
                    or persistent, articulated or non-articulated. They are not usually of the same
                    form as the ordinary foliage leaves of the plant, from which they are
                    distinguished by their lateral position at the base of the petiole. In the Pansy
                    (fig. 123) the true leaves <hi rend="italic">I</hi> are stalked and crenate,
                    while the stipules 3 are large, sessile, and pinnatifid. In Lathyrus Aphaca, and
                    some other plants, the true pinnate leaves are abortive, the petiole forms a
                    tendril, and the stipules alone are developed, performing the office of leaves.
                    When stipules are attached separately to the stem at the base of the leaf, they
                    are called <hi rend="italic">caulinary,</hi> as in Salix aurita. When stipulate
                    leaves are opposite to each other, at the same height on the stem, it
                    occasionally happens that the stipules on the two sides unite wholly or
                    partially, so as to form an <hi rend="italic">interpetiolary</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">interfoliar</hi> stipule, as in Cinchona and in Ipecacuan. In the
                    case of alternate leaves, the stipules at the base of each leaf are sometimes
                    united to the petiole and to each other, so as to form an <hi rend="italic"
                    >adnate, adherent, or petiolary</hi> stipule, as in the Rose, or an <hi
                    rend="italic">axillary</hi> stipule, as in Houttuynia cordata. In other
                    instances the stipules unite together on the side of the stem opposite the leaf,
                    and become <hi rend="italic">synochreate,</hi> as in Astragalus. This so-called
                    unionor adhesion of stipules is not an accidental adhesion taking place after
                    they have been developed. In these cases the parts never were separate; from the
                    first they are developed as one portion. In the development of the leaf the
                    stipules frequently play a most important part. They begin to be formed after
                    the origin of the leaves, but grow much more rapidly than the leaves, and in
                    this way they arch over the young leaves and form protective chambers wherein
                    the parts of the leaf may develop. In Ficus, Magnolia, and Potamogeton they are
                    very large and completely envelop the young leaf-bud. The stipules are sometimes
                    so minute as to be scarcely distinguishable without the aid of a lens, and so
                    fugacious as to be visible only in the very young state of the leaf. They may
                    assume a hard and spiny character, as in Robinia Pseudacacia, or maybe cirrose,
                    as in Smilax, where each stipule is represented by a tendril; while in
                    Cucurbitaceae there is only one cirrose stipule. At the base of the leaflets or
                    foliola of a compound leaf, small stipules are occasionally produced, to which
                    some have given the name of <hi rend="italic">stipels.</hi></p>
                <p>Variations in the structure and forms of leaves and leaf-. stalks are produced by
                    the increased development of cellular ι tissue, by the abortion or degeneration
                    of parts, by the multiplication or repetition of parts, and by adhesion. When
                    cellular tissue is developed to a great extent, leaves become succulent and
                    occasionally assume a crisp or curled appearance. Such changes take place
                    naturally, but they are often increased by the art of the gardener, and the
                    object of many horticultural operations is to increase the bulk and succulence
                    of leaves. It is in this way that Cabbages and Savoys are rendered more delicate
                    and nutritious. By a deficiency in development of parenchyma and an increase in
                    the fibro-vascular tissue, leaves are liable to become hardened and spinescent.
                    The leaves of Barberry and of some species of Astragalus, and the stipules of
                    the False Acacia (Robinia) are spiny. To the same cause is attributed the spiny
                    margin of the Holly-leaf. In the Gooseberry, the swelling (pulvinus) at the base
                    of the petiole, and below the leaf, assumes a spinose character. Changes in the
                    appearances of leaves are produced by adhesions and foldings of various kinds.
                    When two lobes at the base of a leaf are prolonged beyond the stem and unite
                    (fig. 124), the leaf is <hi rend="italic">perfoliate,</hi> the stem appearing to
                    pass through it, as in Bupleurum perfoliatum and Chlora perfoliata; when two
                    leaves unite by their bases they become <hi rend="italic">connate</hi> (fig.
                    125), as in Lonicera Caprifolium; and when leaves adhere to the stem, forming a
                    sort of winged or leafy appendage, they are <hi rend="italic">decurrent,</hi> as
                    in Thistles. The formation of peltate and orbicular leaves has been traced to
                    the union of the lobes of a cleft leaf. In the leaf of the Victoria regia the
                    transformation may be traced during germination. The first leaves produced by
                    the young plant are linear, the second are sagittate and hastate, the third are
                    rounded-cordate, and the next are orbicular. The cleft indicating the union of
                    the lobes remains in the large leaves. The parts of the leaf are frequently
                    transformed into <hi rend="italic">tendrils (cirri),</hi> with the view of
                    enabling the plants to twine round others for support. In Leguminous plants (the
                    Pea tribe) the pinnae are frequently cirrose. When tendrils occupy the place of
                    leaves, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n124/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0124-0115"/> appear as a continuation of the leaf-stalk, they
                    are called <hi rend="italic">petiolary,</hi> as in Lathyrue Λphaca, in which the
                    stipules perform the function of true leaves. In Flagellaria Indica, Gloriosa
                    superba, Anthericum cirrhatum, and Albuca cirrhata, the midrib of the leaf ends
                    in a tendril. In Smilax there are two stipulary tendrils, while in the Cucumber
                    tribe there is a single one at the base of each leaf. In the Passion-flower the
                    lateral leaf-buds, and in the Vine the terminal ones, become tendrils. In the
                    Vanille plant <hi rend="italic">( Vanilla</hi><hi rend="italic">aromatica)</hi>
                    the tendrils are produced opposite the leaves, until the plant gains the top of
                    the trees by which it is supported,—the upper tendrils beiDg then developed as
                    leaves. The midrib is sometimes prolonged in a cup-like or funnel-shaped form;
                    this is occasionally seen in the common Cabbage, and seems to depend on the
                    vascular bundles of the midrib spreading out at their extremity in a radiating
                    manner, and becoming covered with parenchyma in such a way as to form a hollow
                    cavity in the centre.</p>
                <p>The vascular bundles and cellular tissue are sometimes developed in such a way as
                    to form a circle, with a hollow in the centre, and thus give rise to what are
                    called <hi rend="italic">fistular</hi> or hollow leaves, as in the Onion, and to
                    <hi rend="italic">ascidia oτ pitchers.</hi> Pitchers are formed either by
                    petioles or by laminae, and they are composed of one or more leaves. In
                    Sarracenia (tig. 121) and Heliamphora, the pitcher is composed apparently of the
                    petiole of the leaf. In Nepenthes (fig. 120) and perhaps in Cephalotus, while
                    the folding of a winged petiole <hi rend="italic">p</hi> forms the pitcher, the
                    lid <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> which is united by an articulation, corresponds to
                    the lamina. This kind of ascidium is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >calyptrimorphous,</hi> and may be considered as formed by a leaf, such as that
                    of the Orange (fig. 119); the lamina <hi rend="italic">I</hi> being articulated
                    to the petiole <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which, when folded, forms the pitcher.
                    In Dischidia Rafflesiana, a climbing plant of India, the pitchers are formed by
                    the lamina of the leaf, and have an open orifice into which the rootlets at the
                    upper part of the plant enter. These pitchers would seem, therefore, to contain
                    a supply of fluid for the nourishment of the upper branches of the plant. In
                    Utricularia the leaves form sacs called <hi rend="italic">ampullae.</hi> Some
                    suppose that pitchers are not due to folding and adhesion, but that they are
                    produced by a hollowing out of the extremity of the stalk. In some cases the
                    leaves are reduced to mere <hi rend="italic">scales;</hi> they are then
                    frequently called <hi rend="italic">cataphyllary</hi> leaves. They are produced
                    abundantly upon underground shoots. In parasites (Lathraea, Orobanche), and in
                    plants growing on decaying vegetable matter <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Saprophytes),</hi> in which no chlorophyll is formed, these scales are the
                    only leaves produced. In Pinus the only leaves produced on the main stem and the
                    lateral shoots are scales, the acicular leaves of the tree growing from axillary
                    shoots. In Cycas whorls of scales alternate with large pinnate leaves. In mauy
                    plants, as already noticed, phyllodia or stipules perform the function of
                    leaves. The production of leaf-buds from leaves has already been noticed. Such
                    leaves are termed <hi rend="italic">proliferous.</hi> In Bryophyllum (fig. 67)
                    this is a common occurrence, and it is met with in many plants of the order
                    Gesneraceae. The leaf of Venus’s Fly-trap (Dionaea muscipula, fig. 46), when cut
                    off and placed in damp moss, with a pan of water underneath and a bell-glass for
                    a cover, has produced buds from which young plante were obtained. Some species
                    of Saxifrage and of Ferns also produce buds on their leaves and fronds. In
                    Nymphaea micrantha buds appear at the upper part of the petiole.</p>
                <p>Amongst Dicotyledons we have leaves which present the greatest amount of
                    variation in structure and form. The venation is reticulated. They are
                    frequently articulated, exhibit divisions at their margin, and become truly
                    compound. There are, no doubt, instances in which the veins proceed in a
                    parallel manner, but this will be found to occur chiefly in cases where the
                    petiole may be considered as occupying the place of the leaf. Examples of this
                    kind are seen in Acacias (fig. 122). Dicotyledons rarely have a sheath
                    developed, but stipules are very commonly present.</p>
                <p>In Monocotyledons the leaves do not present an angular network of vessels, nor do
                    they, as a rule, exhibit divisions on their margin. Exceptions to this occur in
                    some plants, as Tamus and Dioscorea, which have been called Dictyogens by
                    Lindley, on account of their somewhat netted venation; and in Palms, in which,
                    although the leaves are entire at first, they afterwards become split into
                    various lobes. They are rarely stipulate, and very frequently have a sheath at
                    their base. The petiole is often absent, and a sheathing ligule takes its place.
                    The leaves are often continuous with the stem. In some aquatic Monocotyledons
                    the submerged and floating leaves are narrow, like petioles, while those growing
                    erect above the water expand. This is seen in Sagittaria sagittifolia, in which
                    the erect leaves assume an arrow-like shape.</p>
                <p>In Acotyledons the leaves vary much, being entire or divided, stalked or sessile,
                    often feather-veined, occasionally with radiating venation, the extremities of
                    the veins being forked. In Ferns the leaf (frond) is usually stalked, with
                    frequently a much-divided lamina, remarkable for the prolonged growth at the
                    apex, and in the young state usually covered with curious flattened hairs <hi
                    rend="italic">(paleae).</hi> In Equisetaceae the leaves are sheathing cylinders
                    embracing successive internodes of the stem, and subsequently splitting at the
                    top into few or many teeth. In Lycopodiaceae the leaves vary from mere
                    rudimentary scales, as in Psiloturn, to the flattened acuminate leaf of
                    Selaginella, with only a single fibr∩-vascular bundle, and then to the more
                    complicated form in Isoetes, in which the longest leaves in the order occur, and
                    these have a sheathing basal part and an upper lamina. On the face of the
                    sheathing part is a depression or <hi rend="italic">fovea,</hi> in which rests
                    the sporangium, the margin of it rising as a thin membranous outgrowth, the <hi
                    rend="italic">velum.</hi> Above the fovea, and separated from it by a
                    saddle-like ridge, lies a smaller depression the <hi rend="italic">foveola,</hi>
                    the lower margin of which forms a lip, the <hi rend="italic">labium,</hi> and
                    from its bottom is prolonged beyond the foveola an apiculate membranous
                    structure, which is termed the <hi rend="italic">ligule.</hi> In Mosses we have
                    the simplest form of leaf, composed of one or more layers of cells, sometimes
                    the central ones being more or less compacted and forming a median vein.</p>
                <p>Leaves occupy various positions on the stem and branches, and have received
                    different names according to their situation. Thus leaves arising from the crown
                    of the root, as in the Primrose, are called <hi rend="italic">radical;</hi>
                    those on the stem are <hi rend="italic">cauline;</hi> on the branches, <hi
                    rend="italic">ramal;</hi> on flower-stalks, <hi rend="italic">floral</hi>
                    leaves. The first leaves developed are denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >seminal</hi> leaves or <hi rend="italic">cotyledons,</hi> and those which
                    succeed are <hi rend="italic">primordial.</hi> The arrangement of the leaves on
                    the axis and its appendages is called <hi rend="italic">phyllotaxis.</hi> In
                    their arrangement leaves follow a definite order. It has been stated already
                    that there are regular <hi rend="italic">nodes</hi> or points on the stem at
                    which leaves appear, and that the part of the stem between the nodes is the <hi
                    rend="italic">internode.</hi> Each node is capable of giving origin to a leaf.
                    Occasionally several nodes are approximated so as to form as it were one, and
                    then several leaves may be produced at the same height on the stem. When two
                    leaves are thus produced, one on each side of the stem or axis, and at the same
                    level, they are called <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> (fig. 126); when more
                    than two are produced (fig. 127), they are <hi rend="italic">verticillate,</hi>
                    and the circle of leaves is then called a <hi rend="italic">verticil</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">whorl.</hi> When the zone of the axis which produces the circle of
                    leaves is transverse from its origin, the whorl is a <hi rend="italic">true</hi>
                    one; but when the zone is the result of unequal development or of displacement
                    the whorl is <hi rend="italic">spurious.</hi> Again, in each whorl the leaves
                    may be all <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n125/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0125-0116"/> formed together, and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >simultaneous</hi> whorl results; or they may be formed one after the other, as
                    in Characeae, when a <hi rend="italic">successive</hi> whorl is formed. When
                    leaves are opposite, each successive pair may be placed at right angles to the
                    pair immediately preceding. They are then said to <hi rend="italic"
                    >decussate,</hi> following thus a law of alternation. The same occurs in the
                    verticillate arrangement, the leaves of each whorl rarely being <hi
                    rend="italic">superposed</hi> on those of the whorl next it, as on the branches
                    of Chara, but usually alternating so that each leaf in a whorl occupies the
                    space between two leaves of the whorl next to it. There are considerable
                    irregularities, however, in this respect, and the number of leaves in different
                    whorls is not always uniform, as may be seen in Lysimachia vulgaris. When a
                    single leaf is produced at a node, and the nodes are separated so that each leaf
                    is placed at a different height on the stem, the leaves are <hi rend="italic"
                    >alternate</hi> (fig. 128). A plane passing through the point of insertion of
                    the leaf in the node, dividing the leaf into two similar halves, is the median
                    plane of the leaf; and when the leaves are arranged alternately on an axis so
                    that their median planes coincide they form a straight row or <hi rend="italic"
                    >orthostichy.</hi> On every axis there are usually two or more orthostichies.
                    The leaves in such a case are said to be rectiserial. In fig. 129, leaf 1 arises
                    from a node <hi rend="italic">n;</hi> leaf 2 is separated by an internode <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> and is placed to the right or left; while leaf 3 is
                    situated directly above leaf 1. In this case, then, there are two orthostichies,
                    and the arrangement is said to be <hi rend="italic">distichous.</hi> When the
                    fourth leaf is directly above the first, the arrangement is <hi rend="italic"
                    >tristichous.</hi> The same arrangement continues throughout the branch, so that
                    in the latter case the 7th leaf is above the 4 th, the 10th above the 7th also
                    the 5th above the 2d, the 6th above the 3d, and so on. The size of the angle
                    between the median planes of two consecutive leaves in an alternate arrangement
                    is their <hi rend="italic">divergence;</hi> and it is expressed in fractions of
                    the circumference of the axis which is supposed to be a circle. In a
                    regularly-formed straight branch covered with leaves, if a thread is passed from
                    one to the other, turning always in the same direction, a spiral is described,
                    and a certain number of leaves and of complete turns occur before reach ing the
                    leaf directly above that from which the enumeration commenced. If this
                    arrangement is expressed by a fraction, the numerator of which indicates the
                    number of turns, and the denominator the number of internodes in the spiral
                    cycle, the fraction will be found to represent the angle of divergence of the
                    consecutive leaves on the axis. Thus, in fig. 130, α, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>
                    the cycle consists of five leaves, the 6th leaf being placed vertically over the
                    1st, the 7th Over the 2d, and so on; while the number of turns between the 1st
                    and 6th leaf is two; henee this arrangement is indicated by the fraction ∙∣. In
                    other words, the distance or divergence between the first and second leaf,
                    expressed in parts of a circle, is ⅜ of a circle, or 360° ÷⅜= 144°. In fig. 129,
                    α, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the spiral is ⅜, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> one
                    turn and two leaves; the third leaf being placed vertically over the first, and
                    the divergence between the first and second leaf being one-half the
                    circumference of a circle, 360° ÷⅜=180°. Again, in a tristichous arrangement the
                    number is ⅜, or one turn and three leaves, the angular divergence being
                    120°.</p>
                <p>By this means we have a convenient mode of expressing on paper the exact position
                    of the leaves upon an axis. And in many cases such a mode of expression is of
                    excellent service in enabling us readily to understand the relations of the
                    leaves. The divergences may also be represented diagrammatically on a horizontal
                    projection of the vertical axis, as in fig. 131. Here the outermost circle
                    represents a section of that portion of the axis bearing the lowest leaf, the
                    innermost represents the highest. The broad dark lines represent the leaves, and
                    they are numbered according to their age and position. It will <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n126/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0126-0117"/> be seen at once that the leaves are arranged in
                    orthostichies marked I.-V., and that these divide the circumference into five
                    equal portions. But the divergence between leaf 1 and leaf 2 is equal to fths of
                    the circumference, and the same is the case between 2 and 3, 3 and 4, &amp;c.
                    The divergence, then, is ⅜, and from this we learn that, starting from any leaf
                    on the axis, we must pass twice round the stem in a spiral through five leaves
                    before reaching one directly over that with which we started. When the leaves or
                    scales are alternate, and run in a single series, they are <hi rend="italic"
                    >unijugate;</hi> when the leaves are opposite, and there are two series, the
                    arrangement is <hi rend="italic">bijugate;</hi> while in the case of whorled
                    leaves the arrangement may be <hi rend="italic">trijugate</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">quadrijugate.</hi> The line which, winding round an axis either to
                    the right or to the left, passes through the points of insertion of all the
                    leaves on the axis is termed the <hi rend="italic">genetic</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">generating spiral;</hi> and that margin of each leaf which is
                    towards the direction from which the spiral proceeds is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >kathodic</hi> side, the other margin facing the point whither the spiral passes
                    being the <hi rend="italic">anodic</hi> side.</p>
                <p>In cases where the internodes are very short, and the leaves are closely applied
                    to each other, as in the House-leek, it is difficult to trace the <hi
                    rend="italic">generating spiral.</hi> Thus, in fig. 132 there are thirteen
                    leaves which are numbered in their order, and five turns of the spiral marked by
                    circles in the centre</p>
                <p>(⅛ indicating the arrangement); but this could not be detected at once. So also
                    in Fir cones (fig. 133), which are composed of scales or modified leaves, the
                    generating spiral cannot be determined easily. But in such cases a series of <hi
                    rend="italic">secondary spirals</hi> or <hi rend="italic">parastichies</hi> are
                    seen running parallel with each other both right and left, which to a certain
                    extent conceal the genetic spiral. Thus, in fig. 133, it will be found that
                    there are five secondary spirals running towards the right and parallel to each
                    other, the first passing through the scales 1, 6, 11, 16, &lt;fcc.; the second
                    through 9, 14, 19, 24, &amp;c.; the third through 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, &lt;fcc.;
                    the fourth through 30, 35, 40, 45, &amp;c.; the fifth through 43, 48, 53,
                    &amp;c. The number of these secondary spirals indicates the number of scales
                    intervening between every two scales in each of these spirals, the common
                    difference being five. Again, it will be found on examination that there are
                    secondary spirals running to the left, in which the common difference between
                    every two scales is eight, and that this corresponds to the number of secondary
                    spirals, the first of which passes through the scales 1, 9, 17, &lt;kc.; the
                    second through 6, 14, 22, 30, &amp;c.; the third through 3, 11, 19, 27, 35, 43,
                    and so on. Thus it is that, by counting the secondary spirals, all the scales
                    may be numbered, and by this means the generating spiral may be discovered. From
                    the number of secondary spirals the angle of divergence may be easily
                    calculated, the sum of those which wind in both directions giving the
                    denominator of the fraction, while the smaller of the two numbers representing
                    those winding in each direction is the numerator. Thus in the instance last

                    American larch (fig. 134) there is a quincuncial arrangement of scales marked by
                    the fraction ∙∣. There are five vertical ranks, as marked in the tabular
                    numerical view at the side of the cone, which represents the unwound surface of
                    the cone, viz., 2, 7, 12; 4, 9, 14;</p>
                <p>1, 6,11; 3,8, 13; 5, 10,15,—the common difference in each row being 5. On looking
                    at the cone we find also parallel oblique ranks, two of which, ascending to the
                    left, are marked by the numbers 1, 3, 5, which, if the diagram is coiled round a
                    cylinder, continue in the numbers 7, 9, 11, 13, 15; and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
                    continued into 12, 14. There are thus two lefthanded spirals, with 2 as the
                    common difference in the numbering of the scales. Again, three oblique parallel
                    spirals ascend to the right, marked by the numbers 1, 4, 7, running into 10, 13;
                    3, 6, 9, 12, going on to 15; and 5, 8, 11, 14; here the common difference in the
                    numbering of the scales is 3, corresponding with the oblique right-handed
                    spirals.</p>

                <p>The spiral is not always constant throughout the whole length of an axis. The
                    angle of divergence may alter either abruptly or gradually, and the phyllotaxis
                    thus becomes very complicated. This change may be brought about by arrest of
                    development, by increased development of parts, or by a torsion of the axis. The
                    former are exemplified in many Crassulaceae and Aloes. The latter is seen well
                    in the Screw pine (Pandanus). In the bud of the screw pine the leaves are
                    arranged in three orthostichies with the phyllotaxis ⅜, but by torsion the
                    developed leaves become arranged in three strong spiral rows running round the
                    stem. These causes of change in phyllotaxis are also well exemplified in the
                    alteration of an opposite or verticillate arrangement to an alternate, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> thus the effect of interruption of growth, in
                    causing alternate leaves to become opposite and verticillate, can be distinctly
                    shown in Rhododendron ponticum. Again, parts which are usually opposite or
                    verticillate become alternate by the vigorous development of the axis, as in
                    Hippuris, and also in Lysimachia vulgaris, where on different parts of the same
                    stem there may be seen alternate, opposite, and <pb break="no"

                    development takes place at the end of a branch, the leaves become <hi
                    rend="italic">fasciculate</hi> or clustered, as in the Larch. The primitive or
                    generating spiral may pass either from right to left or from left to right. It
                    sometimes follows a different direction in the brauches from that pursued in the
                    stem. When it follows the same course in the stem and branches, they are <hi
                    rend="italic">homodromous;</hi> when the direction differs, they are <hi
                    rend="italic">heterodromous.</hi> In different species of the same genus the
                    phyllotaxis frequently varies.</p>
                <p>All modifications of leaves follow the same laws of arrangement as true leaves—a
                    fact which is of importance in a morphological point of view. In Dicotyledonous
                    plants the first leaves produced (the cotyledons) are opposite, in some cases
                    verticillate. This arrangement often continues during the life of the plant, but
                    at other times it changes, passing into distichous and spiral forms. Some tribes
                    of plants are distinguished by their opposite or verticillate, others by their
                    alternate, leaves. Labiate plants have decussate leaves, while Boraginaceae have
                    alternate leaves, and Tiliaceae usually have distichous leaves; Cinchonaceae
                    have opposite leaves; Galiaceae, verticillate. Such arrangements as ⅜, f, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛, and ⅛ are common in Dicotyledons. The first of
                    these, called a <hi rend="italic">quincunx,</hi> is met with in the Apple, Pear,
                    and Cherry (fig. 130); the second, in the Bay, Holly, Plantago media; the third,
                    in the cones of Pinus (Abies) alba (fig. 133); and the fourth in those of the
                    Pinus (Abies) Picea. In Monocotyledonous plants there is only one seed-leaf or
                    cotyledon produced, and hence the arrangement is at first alternate; and it
                    generally continues so more or less, rarely being verticillate. Such
                    arrangements as ∣, ⅜, and -j are common in Monocotyledons, as in Grasses,
                    Sedges, and Lilies. In Acotyledons the leaves assume all kinds of arrangement,
                    being opposite, alternate, and verticillate. It has been found in general that,
                    while the number 5 occurs in the phyllotaxis of Dicotyledons, 3 is common in
                    that of Monocotyledons.</p>
                <p>Tn the axil of previously formed leaves leaf-buds arise. These leaf-buds contain
                    the rudiments of a shoot, and consist of leaves covering a growing point. The
                    buds of trees of temperate climates, which lie dormant during the winter, are
                    protected by cataphyllary leaves constituting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tegmenta</hi> or <hi rend="italic">peruloe.</hi> These scales or protective
                    appendages of the bud consist either of the altered laminae, or of the enlarged
                    petiolary sheath, or of stipules, as in the Fig and Magnolia, or of one or two
                    of these parts combined. These are often of a coarse nature, serving a temporary
                    purpose, and then falling off when the leaf is expanded. They are frequently
                    covered with a resinous matter, as in Balsampoplar and Horse-chestnut, or by a
                    thick downy covering as in the Willow. In plants of warm climates the buds have
                    often no protective appendages, and are then said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >naked.</hi></p>
                <p>The arrangement of the leaves in the bud has been denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >vernation, prefoliation,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gemmation.</hi> In
                    considering vernation we must take into account both the manner in which each
                    individual leaf is folded and also the arrangement of the leaves in relation to
                    each other. These vary in different plants, but in each species they follow a
                    regular law. The leaves in the bud are either placed simply in apposition, as in
                    the Mistleto, or they are folded or rolled up longitudinally or laterally,
                    giving rise to different kinds of vernation, as delineated in figs. 135 to 144,
                    where the folded or curved lines represent the leaves, the thickened part being
                    the midrib. The leaf taken individually is either folded longitudinally from
                    apex to base, as in the Tulip-tree, and called <hi rend="italic">reclinate</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">replicate;</hi> or rolled up in a circular manner from apex
                    to base, as in Ferns (fig. 135), and called <hi rend="italic">circinate;</hi> or
                    folded laterally, <hi rend="italic">conduplicate</hi> (fig. 136), as in Oak; or
                    it has several folds like a fan, <hi rend="italic">plicate</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">plaited</hi> (fig. 137), as in Vine and Sycamore, and in leaves
                    with radiating vernation, where the ribs mark the foldings; or it is rolled upon
                    itself, <hi rend="italic">convolute</hi> (fig. 138), as in Banana and Apricot;
                    or its edges are rolled inwards, <hi rend="italic">involute</hi> (fig. 139), as
                    in Violet; or outwards, <hi rend="italic">revolute</hi> (fig. 140), as in
                    Rosemary. The different divisions of a cut leaf may be folded or rolled up
                    separately, as in Ferns, while the entire leaf may have either the same or a
                    different kind of vernation. The leaves have a definite relation to each other
                    in the bud, being either opposite, alternate, or verticillate; and thus
                    different kinds of vernation are produced. Sometimes they are nearly in a circle
                    at the same level, remaining flat, or only slightly convex externally, and
                    placed so as to touch each other by their edges, thus giving rise to <hi
                    rend="italic">valvate</hi> vernation. At other times they are at different
                    levels, and are applied over each other, so as to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >imbricated,</hi> as in Lilac, and in the outer scales of Sycamore (fig. 63);
                    and occasionally the margin of one leaf overlaps that of another, while it in
                    its turn is overlapped by a third, so as to be <hi rend="italic">twisted,
                    spiral, or contortive.</hi> When leaves are applied to each other face to face,
                    without being folded or rolled together, they are <hi rend="italic"
                    >oppressed.</hi> When the leaves are more completely folded they either touch at
                    their extremities and are <hi rend="italic">accumbent</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >opposite</hi> (fig. 141), or are folded inwards by their margin, and become <hi
                    rend="italic">induplicate;</hi> or a conduplicate leaf covers another similarly
                    folded, which in turn covers a third, and thus the vernation is <hi
                    rend="italic">equitant</hi> (fig. 142), as in Privet; or conduplicate leaves are
                    placed so that the half of the one covers the half of another, and thus they
                    become <hi rend="italic">half-equitant</hi> or <hi rend="italic">obvolute</hi>
                    (fig. 143), as in Sage. When in the case of convolute leaves one leaf is rolled
                    up within the other, it is <hi rend="italic">supervolute</hi> (fig. 144). The
                    scales of a bud sometimes exhibit one kind of vernation, and the leaves another.
                    The same modes of arrangement occur in the flower-buds, as will be afterwards
                    shown.</p>
                <p>Leaves expose the fluids of plants to the influence of air <pb break="no"

                    and thus fitted for the formation of the various vegetable tissues and
                    secretions. For the proper performance of this function the structure of the
                    leaves, and their arrangement on the stem and branches, render them well
                    adapted. The cells in the lower side of a leaf where stomata exist are chiefly
                    concerned in the aeration of the sap, whilst other assimilative processes go on
                    in the upper cells. The elaboration of fluids in the leaves necessarily implies
                    interchange of their constituents with those of the surrounding atmosphere;
                    hence two processes are inevitable—a passing inwards into the leaf of the
                    atmospheric elements by a <hi rend="italic">process of absorption,</hi> and an
                    outward current of the components of the plant-juices by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >process of exhalation.</hi> The absorption of carbonic acid, water, and other
                    fluids is carried on by the leaves, chiefly through their stomata, and most
                    rapidly by the under surface of ordinary leaves in which the cuticle is
                    thinnest, the cellular tissue least condensed, and stomata most abundant; the
                    upper surface of the leaf, which usually presents a polished and dense epidermis
                    with few stomata, taking little part in such a process. An exhalation of both
                    liquids and gases also takes place from the leaves, regulated by the number and
                    the size of stomata as well as by the nature of the epidermis. The process of
                    <hi rend="italic">transpiration</hi> of fluids imparts moisture to the
                    atmosphere, and hence the difference between the air of a wooded country and
                    that of a country deprived of forests. Thus leaves have an important influence
                    upon the climate of a country. In darkness little or no transpiration takes
                    place, and in diffuse daylight it is less than in the sun’s rays. The exhalation
                    of gases constitutes the process of <hi rend="italic">respiration.</hi> The
                    nature and amount of the gases respired depends both on the circumstances in
                    which the leaves are placed and on the condition of the plant. But normally at
                    all times there seems to be a respiration of carbonic acid, which, under the
                    influence of light, is at once decomposed by the green parts of the plant, the
                    carbon being fixed and the oxygen set free; consequently, in darkness no oxygen
                    is eliminated. Leaves, after performing their functions for a certain time,
                    wither and die. In doing so they frequently change colour, and hence arise the
                    beautiful and varied tints of the autumnal foliage. This change of colour is
                    chiefly occasioned by the diminished circulation in the leaves, and the higher
                    degree of oxidation to which their chlorophyll has been submitted.</p>
                <p>Leaves which are articulated with the stem, as in the Walnut and Horse-chestnut,
                    fall and leave a scar, while those which are continuous with it remain attached
                    for some time after they have lost their vitality, as in the Beech. Most of the
                    trees of Great Britain have deciduous leaves, their duration not extending over
                    more than a few months, while in trees of warm climates the leaves often remain
                    for two or more years. In tropical countries, however, many trees lose their
                    leaves in the dry season. The period of defoliation varies in different
                    countries according to the nature of their climate. Trees which are called
                    evergreen, as Pines and Evergreen-oak, are always deprived of a certain number
                    of leaves at intervals, sufficient being left, however, to preserve their green
                    appearance. The cause of the fall of the leaf in cold climates 8eem3 to be
                    deficiency of light and heat in winter, which causes a cessation in the
                    functions of the cells of the leaf; its fluids disappear by evaporation; its
                    cells and vessels become contracted and diminished in their calibre; various
                    inorganic matters accumulate in the textures; the whole leaf becomes dry; its
                    parts lose their adherence; a process of disjunction takes place by a folding
                    inwards of the tissue at the point where the leaf joins the stem or branch which
                    gradually extends until complete separation takes place, and the leaf either
                    falls by its own weight or is detached by tbe wind. In warm climates the dry
                    season gives rise to similar phenomena.</p>
                <p>II. ORGANS OF REPRODUCTION.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to pass in review the reproductive organs of plants. In
                    Phanerogamous plauts, as already mentioned, these organs are conspicuous, and
                    constitute what is known as the flower; in Cryptogamous plants they are
                    inconspicuous. All Dicotyledonous and Monocotyledonous plants are included in
                    the former; Acotyledonous and Thallogenous plants compose the latter. The
                    structures which go to form these organs are not, however, formations of a new
                    type, but are merely modifications of those structures which we have already
                    considered under the nutritive organs. For example, the various parts of the
                    flower in Phanerogams are really phyHomes, the supporting structures of the
                    flower are caulomes, the spore-bearing sac of many Cryptogams is a trichome; and
                    in this way a morphological equivalency may be traced betwixt the two series of
                    organs. Further, the difference betwixt the reproductive organs of Phanerogams
                    and those of Cryptogams is one more of degree of differentiation than of actual
                    morphological difference. In Phanerogams the flowers or floral axes are produced
                    from flower-buds, just as leaf-shoots arise from leaf-buds. These two kinds of
                    buds have a resemblance to each other as regards the arrangement and the
                    development of their parts; and it sometimes happens, from injury and other
                    causes, that the part of the axis which, in ordinary cases, would produce a
                    leaf-bud, gives origin to a flowerbud. A flower-bud has not in ordinary
                    circumstances any power of extension by the development of its central cellular
                    portion. In this respect it differs from a leaf-bud. In some cases, however, of
                    monstrosity, especially seen in the Rose (fig. 145) and Geum, the central part
                    is prolonged, and bears leaves or flowers. In such cases the flowers, so far as
                    their functional capabilities are concerned, are usua∏y abortive.</p>
                <p>Flower-buds, like leafbuds, are produced in the axil of leaves, which are called
                    <hi rend="italic">floral</hi> leaves, <hi rend="italic">bracts,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">hypsophyllary</hi> leaves.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">bract</hi> is properly applied to the leaf from which
                    the primary floral axis, whether simple or branched, arises, while the leaves
                    which arise on the axis between the bract and the outer envelope of the flower
                    are <hi rend="italic">bracteoles</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bractlets.</hi>
                    Bracts sometimes do not differ from the ordinary leaves, and are then called <hi
                    rend="italic">leafy,</hi> as in Veronica hederifolia, Vinca, Anagallis, and
                    Ajuga. Like leaves they are entire or divided. In general as regards their form
                    and appearance, they differ from ordinary leaves, the difference being greater
                    in the upper than in the lower branches of an inflorescence. They are
                    distinguished by their position at the base of the flower or flower-stalk. Their
                    phyllotaxis is similar to that of the leaf. When the flower is sessile the
                    bracts are often <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n129/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0129-0120"/> applied closely to the calyx, and may thus be
                    confounded with it, as in Malvaceae and species of Dianthus and Eranthis, where
                    they have received the name of <hi rend="italic">epicalyx</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">calyculus.</hi> In some Rosaceous plants an epicalyx is present,
                    due to the formation of stipulary structures by the sepals. In many cases bracts
                    seem to perform the function of protective organs, within or beneath which the
                    young flowers are concealed in their earliest stage of growth.</p>
                <p>When bracts become coloured, as in Amherstia nobilis, Euphorbia splendens, Erica
                    elegans, and Salvia splendens, they may be mistaken for parts of the corolla.
                    They are sometimes mere scales or threads, and at other times they are abortive,
                    and remain undeveloped, giving rise to the <hi rend="italic">ebracteated</hi>
                    inflorescence of Cruciferae and some Boraginaceae. Sometimes no flower-buds are
                    produced in their axil, and then they are <hi rend="italic">empty.</hi> A series
                    of empty coloured bracts terminates the inflorescence of Salvia Horminum. The
                    smaller bracts or bracteoles, which occur among the subdivisions of a branching
                    inflorescence, often produce no flower-buds, and thus anomalies occur in the
                    floral arrangements. Bracts are occasionally persistent, remaining long attached
                    to the base of the peduncles, but more usually they are deciduous, falling off
                    early by an articulation. In some instances they form part of the fruit,
                    becoming incorporated with other organs. Thus, the cones of Firs and the
                    strobili of the Hop are composed of a series of bracts arranged in a spiral
                    manner, and covering fertile flowers; and the scales on the fruit of the
                    Pine-apple are of the same nature. In amenta or catkins the bracts are called
                    <hi rend="italic">sguamae</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi> scales. At the base of
                    the general umbel in Umbelliferous plants, a whorl of bracts often exists,
                    called a <hi rend="italic">general involucre,</hi> and at the base of the
                    smaller umbels or umbellules there is a similar leafy whorl called <hi
                    rend="italic">involucel</hi> or <hi rend="italic">partial involucre.</hi> In
                    some instances, as in Fool’s-parsley, there is no general involucre, but simply
                    an involucel; while, in other cases, as in Fennel, neither involucre nor
                    involucel is developed. In Composite the name involucre is applied to the
                    leaves, scales, or <hi rend="italic">phyllaries,</hi> surrounding the head of
                    flowers (fig. 146, t), as in Dandelion, Daisy, Artichoke. This involucre is
                    frequently composed of several rows of leaflets, which are either of the same or
                    of different forms and lengths, and often lie over each other in an imbricated
                    manner. When the bracts are arranged in two rows, and the outer row is
                    perceptibly smaller than the inner, the involucre is sometimes said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">caliculate,</hi> as in Senecio. The leaves of the involucre are
                    spiny in Thistles and in Dipsacus, and hooked in Burdock. Such whorled or
                    verticillate bracts may either remain separate <hi rend="italic"
                    >(poiyphytious),</hi> or may be united by cohesion <hi rend="italic"
                    >(gamophyllous),</hi> as in many species of Bupleurum, and in Lavatera. In
                    Composite besides the general envelope called the involucre, there are
                    frequently <hi rend="italic">chaffy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">setose</hi>
                    bracts at the base of each flower, and in Dipsacaceae a membranous tube
                    surrounds each flower. These structures are of the nature of an epicalyx. In the
                    acorn the <hi rend="italic">cupula</hi> or cup (fig. 147, α) is formed by a
                    growing upwards of the flowerstalk immediately beneath the flower, upon which
                    scaly or spiny protuberances appear. It is of the nature of bracts. Bracts also
                    compose the husky covering of the Hazel-nut. In the Yew the succulent covering
                    of the seed is by some considered to be formed by the bracts.</p>
                <p>When bracts become united together, and overlie each other in several rows, it
                    often happens that the outer ones do not produce flowers, that is, are empty or
                    sterile. In the Artichoke the outer imbricated scales or bracts are in this
                    condition, and it is from the membranous white scales or bracts <hi
                    rend="italic">(paleati)</hi> forming the choke attached to the edible receptacle
                    that the flowers are produced. The sterile bracts of the Daisy occasionally
                    produce <hi rend="italic">capitula,</hi> and give rise to the Hen-and-Chickens
                    Daisy. In place of developing flowerbuds, bracts may, in certain circumstances,
                    as in proliferous or <hi rend="italic">viviparous</hi> plants, produce
                    leaf-buds, and the flower-buds, like the leaf-buds, may be <hi rend="italic"
                    >terminal</hi> or they may be <hi rend="italic">lateral.</hi></p>
                <p>A sheathing bract enclosing one or several flowers is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >spatha</hi> or <hi rend="italic">spathe.</hi> It is common among
                    ΛIonocotyledons, as Narcissus (figure 148), Snow - flake, Arum, and Palms. In
                    some Palms it is 20 feet long, and encloses 200,000 flowers. It is often
                    associated with that form of inflorescence termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spadix,</hi> and may be coloured, as in Richardia aethiopica, sometimes called
                    the Aethiopian or Trumpet Lily. When the spadix is compound or branching, as in
                    Palms, there are smaller spathes, surrounding separate parts of the
                    inflorescence, to which the name <hi rend="italic">spathéllae</hi> has sometimes
                    been given. The spathe protects the flowers in their young state, and often
                    falls off after they are developed, or hangs down in a withered form, as in some
                    Palms, Typha, and Pothos. In Grasses the outer scales of the spikelets have been
                    considered as sterile bracts, and have received the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >glumes</hi> (fig. 149, <hi rend="italic">gï)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    in Cyperaceae bracts enclose the organs of reproduction. Bracts are frequently
                    changed into complete leaves. This change is called phyllody of bracts. It is
                    seen in species of Plantago, especially in the variety of Plantago media, called
                    the Rose-plantain in gardens. In this plant the bracts become leafy, and form a
                    rosette round the flowering axis. Similar changes occur in Plantago major, P.
                    lanceolata, Ajuga reptans, the Dandelion, the Daisy, the Dahlia, and in
                    Umbelliferous plants. The conversion of bracts into stamens has been observed in
                    the case of Abies excelsa. This has been called staminody of bracts. A
                    lengthening of the axis of the female strobilus of Coniferae is not of
                    infrequent occurrence in Cryptomeria japonica, Larix europaea, &lt;tc., and this
                    is usually associated with a leaf-like condition of the bracts, and sometimes
                    even with the development of leaf-bearing shoots in place of the scales.</p>

                <p>The arrangement of the flowers on the axis, or the ramification of the floral
                    axie, is called <hi rend="italic">inflorescence</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >anthotaxis.</hi> The primary axis of inflorescence is sometimes called <hi
                    rend="italic">rachis;</hi> its branches, whether terminal or lateral, which form
                    the stalks supporting flowers or clusters of flowers, are <hi rend="italic"
                    >peduncles,</hi> and if small branches are given off by it, they are called <hi
                    rend="italic">pedicels.</hi> A flower having a stalk is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >pedunculate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pedicellate',</hi> one having no stalk is
                    <hi rend="italic">sessile.</hi> In describing a branching inflorescence, it is
                    common to speak of the rachis as the <hi rend="italic">primary</hi> floral axis,
                    its branches as the <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi> floral axes, their
                    divisions as the <hi rend="italic">tertiary</hi> floral axes, and so on; thus
                    avoiding any confusion that might arise from the use of the terms <hi
                    rend="italic">rachis,</hi><hi rend="italic">peduncle,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >pedicel.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">peduncle τa⅛y</hi> be cylindrical, compressed, or grooved;
                    simple, bearing a single flower, as in Primrose; or branched, as in
                    London-pride. It is sometimes succulent, as in the Cashew, in which it forms the
                    large coloured expansion supporting the nut; spiral, as in Cyclamen and
                    Vallisneria; or spiny, as in Alyssum spinosum. In some Rushes there is a green
                    terete, and sometimes spiral, floral axis. Sometimes the peduncle proceeds from
                    radical leaves, that is, from an axis which is so shortened as to bring the
                    leaves close together in the form of a cluster, as in the Primrose, Auricula,
                    Hyacinth, &lt;fcc. In such cases it is termed a <hi rend="italic">scape.</hi>
                    The floral axis may be shortened, assuming a flattened, convex, or concave form,
                    and bearing numerous flowers, as in the Artichoke, Daisy, and Fig (fig. 150). In
                    these cases it is called a <hi rend="italic">receptacle</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">phoranthium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">clinanthium.</hi> The floral
                    axis sometimes assumes a leaf-like or <hi rend="italic">phylloid</hi>
                    appearance, bearing numerous flowers at its margin, as in Xylophylla longifolia
                    and in Ruscus; or it appears as if formed by several peduncles united together,
                    constituting a fasciated axis, as in the Cockscomb, in which the flowers form a
                    peculiar crest at the apex of the flattened peduncles. Adhesions occasionally
                    take place between the peduncle and the bracts or leaves of the plant, as in the
                    Lime-tree (fig. 151), Helwingia, Chailletia, several species of Hibiscus, and
                    Zostera. The adhesion of the peduncles to the stem accounts for the
                    extra-axillary position of flowers, as in many Solanaceae. When this union
                    extends for a considerable length along the stem, several leaves may be
                    interposed between the part where the peduncle becomes free and the leaf whence
                    it originated, and it may be difficult to trace the connection. The peduncle
                    occasionally becomes abortive, and in place of bearing a flower, is transformed
                    into a tendril; at other times it is hollowed at the apex, so as apparently to
                    form the lower part of the outer whorl of floral leaves as in Eschscholtzia. The
                    termination of the peduncle, or the part on which the whorls of the flower are
                    arranged, is called the <hi rend="italic">thalamus</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >torus.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic">receptacle</hi> is also sometimes
                    applied to this, whether expanded and bearing several flowers, or narrowed so as
                    to bear one. It may be considered as the growing point of the axis, which
                    usually is arrested by the production of the flowers, but which sometimes
                    becomes enlarged and expanded. Thus, in the Geranium (fig. 152) it is prolonged
                    beyond the flower in the form of a beak <hi rend="italic">(rostrate)</hi>; in
                    the Arum (fig. 153) it is a clubshaped fleshy column; in the Strawberry (fig.
                    154) it becomes a conical succulent mass, on which the seed-vessels are placed;
                    while in Nelumbium it forms a truncated tabular top-like expansion <hi
                    rend="italic">(turbinate),</hi> enveloping the seedvessels., The margins of the
                    receptacle may grow up whilst the centre remains depressed, and thus a concave
                    torus is formed, as in the Rose (fig. 155). In some monstrous flowers of the
                    Rose and Geum it is prolonged as a branch bearing leaves. Peduncles and pedicels
                    sometimes become remarkably elongated, and this elongation of the flower-stalks
                    sometimes alters the general character of the inflorescence. We occasionally
                    observe the heads of flowers of the common White Clover becoming racemose by the
                    lengthening of the flower-stalks.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding to an examination of the parts of the flower-bud, we will
                    consider the various modes of arrangement of the flowers upon the axis, or the
                    <hi rend="italic">inflorescence.</hi></p>

                <p>We may recognize two distinct types of inflorescence—one in which the flowers
                    always arise as lateral shoots from a primary axi≡, which goes on elongating,
                    and the lateral shoots never exceed in their development the length of the
                    primary axis beyond their point of origin. The flowers are thus always <hi
                    rend="italic">axillary.</hi> Exceptions, such as in Cruciferous plants, are due
                    to the non-appearance of the bracts. In the other type the primary axis
                    terminates in a single flower, but lateral axes are given off from the axil of
                    bracts, which again repeat the primary axis, and the development of each lateral
                    axis is stronger than the primary axis beyond its point of origin. The flowers
                    produced in this inflorescence are thus <hi rend="italic">terminal.</hi> The
                    first kind of inflorescence is <hi rend="italic">indeterminate, indefinite,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">axillary.</hi> Here the axis is either elongated, producing
                    flower-buds as it grows, the lower expanding first; or it is shortened and
                    depressed, and the outer flowers expand first. The expansion of the flowers is
                    thus <hi rend="italic">centripetal,</hi> that is, from base to apex, or from
                    circumference to centre. This kind of inflorescence is shown in fig. 156, where
                    the leaf from which the cluster of flowers is produced, <hi rend="italic"
                    >f,</hi> represents the bract or floral leaf. The <hi rend="italic">rachis,</hi>
                    or primary axis of the flower is a'; this produces small leaflets <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> which bear smaller flower-leaves or bractlets, from which
                    pedunclee or secondary axes spring, each bearing single flowers. In fig. 157 the
                    same kind of inflorescence is shown on a shortened axis, the outer flowers
                    expanding first, and those in the centre last.</p>
                <p>The second kind of inflorescence is <hi rend="italic">determinate, definite,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">terminal.</hi> In this the axis is either elongated and
                    ends in a solitary flower, which thus terminates the axis, and if other flowers
                    are produced, they belong to secondary axes farther from the centre; or the axis
                    is shortened and flattened, producing a number of separate floral axes, the
                    central one expanding first, while the others are developed in succession
                    farther from the centre. The expansion of the flowers is in this case <hi
                    rend="italic">centrifugal,</hi> that is, from apex to base, or from centre to
                    circumference. It is illustrated in fig. 158, where a representation is given of
                    a plant of Ranunculus bulbosus; <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> is the primary axis
                    swollen at the base in a bulb-like manner <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and with
                    roots proceeding from it. From the leaves which are radical proceeds the axis
                    ending in a solitary terminal flower/'. About the middle of this axis there is a
                    leaf or bract, from which a secondary floral axis <hi rend="italic">a"</hi> is
                    produced, ending m a single flower ∕", less advanced than the flower ∕'. This
                    secondary axis bears a leaf also, from which a tertiary floral axis <hi
                    rend="italic">a "</hi> is produced, bearing an unexpanded <hi rend="subscript">
                    ι</hi> solitary flower ∕'". From this tertiary axis a fourth is in progress of
                    formation. Here/' is the termination of the primary axis, and this flower
                    expands first, while the other flowers are developed centrifugally on separate
                    axes.</p>
                <p>A third series of inflorescences, termed <hi rend="italic">mixed,</hi> may be
                    recognized. In them the primary axis has an arrangement belonging to the
                    opposite type from that on the branches, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi>
                    According to the mode and degree of development of the lateral shoots and also
                    of the bracts, various forms of both inflorescences result.</p>
                <p>Amongst indefinite forms the simplest occurs when a lateral shoot produced in the
                    axil of a large single foliage leaf of the plant ends in a single flower, the
                    axis of the plant elongating beyond, as in Veronica hederifolia, Vinca minor,
                    and Lysimachia nemorum. The flower in this case is <hi rend="italic"
                    >solitary,</hi> and the Inflorescence has been designated <hi rend="italic"
                    >solitarιj axillary.</hi> The ordinary leaves in this case become floral leaves
                    or bracts, by producing flower-buds in place of leaf-buds. The flowers, being
                    all offshoots of the same axis, are said to be of the same generation or degree,
                    and their number, like that of the leaves of this main axis, is indefinite,
                    .varying with the vigour of the plant. Usually, however, the floral axis,
                    arising from a more or less altered leaf or bract, instead of ending in a
                    solitary flower, is prolonged, and bears numerous leaflets, called <hi
                    rend="italic">bracteoles</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bractlets,</hi> from which
                    smaller peduncles are produced, and those again in their turn may be branched in
                    a similar way. Thus the flowers are arranged in groups, and frequently very
                    complicated forms of inflorescence result. When the primary peduncle or floral
                    axis, as in fig. 156, <hi rend="italic">a',</hi> is elongated, and gives off
                    pedicels <hi rend="italic">a",</hi> of nearly equal length ending in single
                    flowers, a <hi rend="italic">raceme</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cluster</hi> is
                    produced, as in Currant, Hyacinth, and Barberry. If the secondary floral axes
                    give rise to tertiary ones, the raceme is branching, and forms what is by some
                    called a <hi rend="italic">panicle,</hi> as in Yucca gloriosa; but it is better
                    to restrict this term to the lax inflorescence of some Grasses and Rushes. If in
                    a raceme the lower flower-stalks are developed more strongly than the upper, and
                    thus all the flowers are nearly on a level, a <hi rend="italic">corymb</hi> is
                    formed, which may be simple, as in fig. 159, where the primary axis <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> divides into secondary axes a", a", which end in single
                    flowers; or branching, where the secondary axes again subdivide. If the
                    peduncles or secondary axes are very short or awanting, so that the flowers are
                    sessile, a <hi rend="italic">spike</hi> is produced, as in Plantago and Verbena
                    officinalis (fig. 160). The spike sometimes bears unisexual flowers, usually
                    staminiferous, the whole falling off by an articulation, as in Willow or Hazel
                    (fig. 161), and then it is called an <hi rend="italic">amentum</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">catkin,</hi> hence such trees are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >amentiferous;</hi> at other times it becomes succulent, bearing numerous
                    flowers, surrounded by a sheathing bract or spathe, and then it constitutes a
                    <hi rend="italic">spadix,</hi> which may be simple, as in Arum maculatum (fig.
                    153), or branching, as in Palms. A spike bearing female flowers only, and
                    covered with scales, is either a <hi rend="italic">strobilus,</hi> as in the
                    Hop; or a <hi rend="italic">cone,</hi> as in the Fir (fig. 133). It may be
                    mentioned here that many do not consider the cone of Firs an axis ⅛f
                    inflorescence, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n132/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0132-0123"/> but regard it as a single flower with the floral
                    leaves placed at different heights. In Grasses there are usually numerous
                    sessile flowers arranged in small spikes, called <hi rend="italic">locustae</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">spikelets,</hi> which are either set closely along a
                    central axis, or produced on secondary axes formed by the branching of the
                    central one; to the latter form the term <hi rend="italic">panicle</hi> is
                    applied.</p>
                <p>If the primary axis, in place of being elongated, is contracted, it gives rise to
                    other forms of indefinite inflorescence. When the axis is so shortened that the
                    secondary axes arise from a common point, and spread out as <hi rend="italic"
                    >radii</hi> of nearly equal length, each ending in a single flower, or dividing
                    again in a similar radiating manner, an <hi rend="italic">umbel</hi> is
                    produced, as in fig. 162. From the primary floral axis <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    the secondary axes come off in a radiating or umbrella-like manner, and end in
                    small umbels <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >partial umbels</hi> or <hi rend="italic">umbellules,</hi> to distinguish them
                    from the <hi rend="italic">general umbel</hi> formed by the branching of the
                    primary axis. This inflorescence is seen in Hemlock, and other allied plants,
                    which are hence called Umbelliferous. If there are numerous flowers on a
                    flattened, convex, or slightly concave receptacle, having either very short
                    pedicels or none, a <hi rend="italic">capitιdum</hi> (head), <hi rend="italic"
                    >anthodium,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">calathium,</hi> is formed, as in
                    Dandelion, Daisy, and other Composite plants (fig. 146), also in Scabiosa (fig.
                    157) and Dipsacus. In the American Button-bush the heads are globular, in some
                    species of Teazel, elliptical, while in Scabious, and in Com posite plants, as
                    Sunflower, Dandelion, Thistle, Centaury, and Marigold, they are somewhat
                    hemispherical, with a flattened, slightly hollowed, or convex disk. If the
                    margins of such a receptacle be developed upwards, the centre not developing, a
                    concave receptacle is formed, which may partially or completely enclose a number
                    of flowers that are generally unisexual. This gives rise to the peculiar
                    inflorescence of Dorstenia (fig. 163), or to that of the Fig (fig. 150), where
                    the flowers are placed on the inner surface of the hollow receptacle, and are
                    provided with bracteoles. This inflorescence has been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >lιypanthodium.</hi></p>
                <p>Lastly, we have what are called <hi rend="italic">compound indefinite</hi>
                    inflorescences. In these forms the lateral shoots, developed centripetally upon
                    the primary axis, bear numerous bracteoles, from which floral shoots arise which
                    may have a centripetal arrangement similar to that on the mother shoot, or it
                    may be different. Thus we may have a group of racemes, arranged in a racemose
                    manner on a common axis, forming a raceme of racemes or compound raceme, as in
                    Astilbe. In the same way we may have compound umbels, as in Hemlock and most
                    Umbelliferae (fig. 162), a compound spike, as in Rye-grass, a compound spadix,
                    as in some Palms, and a compound capitulum, as in the Hen-and-Chickens Daisy.
                    Again, there may be a raceme of capitula, that is, a group of capitula disposed
                    in a racemose manner, as in Petasites, a raceme of umbels, as in Ivy, and so on,
                    all the forms of inflorescence being indefinite in disposition.</p>
                <p>The elongation of secondary flower-stalks sometimes alters the general character
                    of the inflorescence, changing a spike into a raceme, a raceme into a corymb, a
                    capitulum into an umbel, and so forth. The capitulum of flowers in some
                    Compositae, such as Hypochaeris radicata and Senecio vulgaris, by a similar
                    change in the pedicels assumes the form of an umbel. Among Umbelliferae the
                    umbels are sometimes supported on very long 3talks, while the pedicels of the
                    individual flowers are not lengthened. In Eryngium the shortening of the
                    pedicels changes an umbel into a capitulum. The umbellate inflorescence of
                    Pelargonium has been seen changed into a raceme.</p>
                <p>The simplest form of the definite type of inflorescence is seen in Anemone
                    nemorosa and in Gentianella (Gentiana acaulis, fig. 164), where the axis
                    terminates in a single flower, no other flowers being produced upon the plant.
                    This is <hi rend="italic">solitary terminal</hi> inflorescence. If other flowers
                    were produced, they would arise as lateral shoots from the bracts below the
                    first-formed flower. The general name of <hi rend="italic">cyme</hi> is applied
                    to the arrangement of a group of flowers in a definite inflorescence. A <hi
                    rend="italic">cymose</hi> inflorescence is an inflorescence where the primary
                    floral axis before terminating in a flower gives off one or more lateral
                    unifloral axes which repeat the process,—the development being only limited by
                    the vigour of the plant. The floral axes are thus centrifugally developed. The
                    cyme, according to its development, has been characterized as <hi rend="italic"
                    >biparous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">uniparous.</hi> In fig. 165 the biparous
                    cyme is represented in the flowering branch of Erythraea Centaurium. Here the
                    primary axis <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> ends in a flower/', which has passed <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n133/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0133-0124"/> into the state of fruit. At its base two leaves
                    are produced, each of which is capable of developing buds. These are
                    flower-buds, and constitute secondary axes <hi rend="italic">a" a",</hi> ending
                    in single flowers/"/''', which are thus terminal and solitary; and at the base
                    of these axes a pair of opposite leaves is produced, giving rise to tertiary
                    axes <hi rend="italic">a'" a'" a'",</hi> ending in single flowers <hi
                    rend="italic">f"' f"' f</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">",</hi> and so on. The term <hi
                    rend="italic">dichotomous</hi> has also been applied to this form of cyme. But
                    these terms are not strictly correct, for here there is no dichotomous
                    branching, although, when the terminal flower ∕ of the generating axis has
                    withered, an apparent dichotomy occurs; but the lateral axes on the several
                    shoots are produced monopodially, and therefore the term is apt to lead to
                    confusion regarding the development of the shoots. The name <hi rend="italic"
                    >dichasium</hi> has, therefore, been substituted for the old term. In the
                    natural order Caryophyllaceae (Pink family) the dichasial cymose form of
                    inflorescence is very general. In some members of the tribe, as Dianthus
                    barbatus, D. Carthusianorum, &lt;fcc., in which the peduncles are short, and the
                    flowers closely approximated, with a centrifugal expansion, the inflorescence
                    has the form of a contracted dichasium, and receives the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">fascicle</hi> (fig. 166). A</p>
                <p>similar inflorescence is seen in Xylophylla longifolia. When the axes become very
                    much shortened, the arrangement is more complicated in appearance, and the
                    nature of the inflorescence can only be recognized by the order of opening of
                    the flowers. In Labiate plants, as the Dead-nettle (Lamium), the flowers are
                    produced in the axil of each of the foliage leaves of the plant, and they appear
                    as if arranged in a simple whorl of flowers. But on examination it is found that
                    there is a central flower expanding first, and from its axis two secondary axes
                    spring bearing solitary flowers; the expansion is thus centrifugal. The
                    inflorescence is therefore a contracted dichasium, the flowers being sessile, or
                    nearly so, and the clusters are called <hi rend="italic">verticillasters</hi>
                    (fig. 167).</p>
                <p>Sometimes, especially towards the summit of a dichasium, owing to the exhaustion
                    of the growing power of the plant, only one of the bracts gives origin to a new
                    axis, the other remaining empty; thus the inflorescence becomes unilateral, and
                    further development is arrested. In addition to the dichasial form there are
                    others where more than two lateral axes are produced from the primary floral
                    axis, each of which in turn produces numerous axes. To this form the terms <hi
                    rend="italic">trichotomous</hi> and <hi rend="italic">polytomous cyme</hi> have
                    been applied; but these are now usually designated <hi rend="italic">cymose
                    umbels.</hi> They are well seen in some species of Euphorbia. Another term, <hi
                    rend="italic">anthela,</hi> has been used to distinguish such forms as occur in
                    several species of Luzula and Juncus, where numerous lateral axes arising from
                    the primary axis grow very strongly, and develop in an irregular manner.</p>
                <p>In the uniparous cyme a number of floral axes are successively developed one from
                    the other, but the axis of each successive generation, instead of producing a
                    pair of bracts, produces only a single one. The basal portion of the consecutive
                    axes may become much thickened and arranged more or less in a straight line, and
                    thus collectively form an apparent or false axis or <hi rend="italic"
                    >sympodium,</hi> and the inflorescence thus simulates a raceme. In the true
                    raceme, however, we find only a single axis, producing in succession a series of
                    bracts, from which the floral peduncles arise as lateral shoots, and thus each
                    flower is on the same side of the floral axis as the bract in the axil of which
                    it is developed; but in the uniparous cyme the flower of each of these axes, the
                    basal portions of which unite to form the false axis, is situated on the
                    opposite side of the axis to the bract from which it apparently arises (fig.
                    168). This bract is not, however, the one from which the axis terminating in the
                    flower arises, but is a bract produced upon it, and gives origin in its axil to
                    a new axis, the basal portion of which, constituting the next part of the false
                    axis, occupies the angle between this bract and its parent axis, —the bract from
                    which the axis really does arise being situated lower down upon the same side of
                    the axis with itself. The uniparous cyme presents two forms, the scor- <hi
                    rend="italic">pioid</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cicinal</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">helicoid</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bostrychoid.</hi></p>
                <p>Γn the scorpioid cyme the flowers are arranged alternately in a double row along
                    one side of the false axis (fig. 169) the bracts when developed forming a second
                    double <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n134/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0134-0125"/> row on the opposite side, as seen in the Henbane;
                    the whole inflorescence usually curves on itself like a scorpion’s tail, hence
                    its name. In fig. 170 is shown a diagrammatic sketch of this arrangement. The
                    false axis, <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> is formed by successive generations of
                    unifloral axes, the flowers being arranged along one side alternately and in a
                    double row; had the bracts been developed they would have formed a similar
                    double row on the opposite side of the false axis; the whole inflorescence is
                    represented as curved on itself. In fig. 169 the same scorpioid form of
                    uniparous cyme is seen in the Forget-me-not, with the double row of flowers on
                    one side of the false axis, but in this case the bracts, which should appear on
                    the opposite side, are not developed, and hence the cyme is not complete. The
                    inflorescences in the family Boraginaceae are usually regarded as true scorpioid
                    cymes. But it has been recently shown that in Myosotis (Forget-me-not) the axis
                    is not a sympodium, but the branching takes place monopodially, therefore it
                    should more correctly be regarded as a raceme with flowers only on one side and
                    curving on itself. In Hyoscyamus (Henbane) and other Atropaceae the branching is
                    dichotomous, so that the inflorescence in this case also ought not to be
                    regarded as a scorpioid cyme.</p>
                <p>In the helicoid cyme there is also a false axis formed by the basal portion of
                    the separate axes, but the flowers are not placed in a double row, but in a
                    single row, and form a spiral or helix round the false axis. In Alströmeria, as
                    represented in fig. 168 the axis <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> ends in a flower (cut
                    off in the figure) and bears a leaf. From the axil of this leaf, that is,
                    between it and the primary axis <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> arises a secondary
                    axis <hi rend="italic">a",</hi> ending in a flower/", and producing a leaf about
                    the middle. From the axil of this leaf a tertiary floral axis <hi rend="italic"
                    >a'",</hi> ending in a flower <hi rend="italic">f"',</hi> takes origin. In this
                    case the axes are not arranged in two rows along one side of the false axis, but
                    are placed at regular intervals, so as to form an elongated spiral round it.</p>
                <p>Compound definite inflorescences are by no means common, but in Streptocarpus
                    polyanthus, and in several Calceolarias, we probably have examples. Here there
                    are <hi rend="italic">scorpioid cymes of pairs of flowers,</hi> each pair
                    consisting of an older and a younger flower.</p>
                <p>Forms of inflorescence occur, in which both the definite and indefinite types are
                    represented; these, then, are <hi rend="italic">mixed</hi> inflorescences. Thus
                    in Composite plants, such as Hawkweeds (Hieracia) and Ragworts (Senecio, fig.
                    171), the <hi rend="italic">heads</hi> of flowers, taken as a whole, are
                    developed centrifugally, the terminal head first, while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >florets,</hi> or small flowers on the receptacle, open centripetally, those at
                    the circumference first. So also in Labiatae, such as Dead-nettle (Lamium), the
                    different whorls of inflorescence are developed centripetally, while the florets
                    of the verticillaster are centrifugal. This mixed character presents
                    difficulties in such cases as Labiatae, where the leaves, in place of retaining
                    their ordinary form, become bracts, and thus might lead to the supposition of
                    the whole series of flowers being one inflorescence. In such cases the cymes are
                    described as spiked, racemose, or panicled, according to circumstances. In
                    Saxifraga umbrosa (London-pride) and in the Horse-chestnut we meet with a raceme
                    of scorpioid cymes; in Sea-pink, a capitulum of contracted scorpioid cymes
                    (often called a glomerulus); in Laurustinus, a compound umbel of dichasial
                    cymes; a scorpioid cyme of capitula in Vernonia centriflora. In the catkins of
                    the Birch we have, in reality, spikes of contracted dichasial cymes. In the
                    Bell-flower (Campanula), there is a racemose uniparous cyme. In the Privet
                    (Ligustrum vulgare) there are numerous racemes of dichasia arranged in a
                    racemose manner along an axis; the whole inflorescence thus has an appearance
                    not unlike a bunch of grapes, and has been called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >thyrsus.</hi></p>

                <p>’ The flower is the <hi rend="italic">tout ensemble</hi> of those organs which
                    are concerned in reproduction. It is constituted by a portion of the floral axis
                    bearing the sexual organs, usually with certain protective envelopes. The parts
                    borne on the floral axis and composing the flower are all metamorphosed leaves,
                    and, though usually very different in appearance from foliage leaves, their
                    morphological resemblance is frequently shown by their developing as foliage
                    leaves. The axis bearing the parts of the flower is usually very much
                    contracted, no internodes being developed, and it frequently expands into a
                    flattened or hollowed expansion termed the <hi rend="italic">thalamus</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">torus;</hi> at other times, though rarely, the internodes are
                    developed and it is elongated. Upon this torus the parts of the flower are
                    arranged in a crowded manner, usually forming a series of verticils, the parts
                    of which alternate; but they are sometimes arranged in a spiral manner,
                    especially if the floral axis be elongated. In a typical flower, as in fig. 172,
                    we recognize four distinct whorls of leaves :—an outer whorl of five parts, the
                    <hi rend="italic">calyx;</hi> within it, another whorl of five parts alternating
                    with those of the outer whorl, the <hi rend="italic">corolla;</hi> next comes a
                    whorl of parts alternating with the parts of the corolla, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >androecium;</hi> and in the centre is the <hi rend="italic">gynoecium.</hi> Fig
                    173 is a diagrammatic representation of the arrangement of the parts of such a
                    flower. The flower is supposed to be cut transversely, and the parts of each
                    whorl are distinguished by a different symbol. Of these whorls the two internal,
                    forming the male and female sexual organs, constitute the <hi rend="italic"
                    >essential</hi> organs of reproduction; the two outer whorls are the protective
                    coverings <hi rend="italic">or floral envelopes.</hi> The calyx or outer
                    covering (fig. 172, c) is formed of leaves, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >sepals,</hi> which are generally of a greenish colour. The corolla <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> the next covering, is composed of leaves, called <hi
                    rend="italic">petals,</hi> which are often showy, and normally alternate with
                    the sepals. Sometimes, as in many Monocotyledons, the calyx and corolla both
                    display rich colouring, and are apt to be confounded. In such cases the term <hi
                    rend="italic">perianth,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">perigone,</hi> has been
                    applied to avoid ambiguity. Thus, in the Tulip, Crocus, Lily, Hyacinth, authors
                    speak of the parts of the perianth, in place of calyx and corolla, although in
                    these plants an outer whorl (calyx) may be detected, of three parts, and an
                    inner (corolla), of a similar number, alternating with them. When the parts of
                    the calyx are in appearance like petals they are said to <hi rend="italic"
                    >∖&gt;o, petaloid,</hi> as in Liliaceae. In some cases the petals have the
                    appearance of sepals, then they are <hi rend="italic">sepaloid,</hi> as in
                    Juncaceae. The term perianth is usually confined to the flowers of
                    Monocotyledons, whatever colour they present, whether green, as in Asparagus, or
                    coloured, as in Tulip. Some use the term perianth as a general one, and restrict
                    the use of perigone to cases where a pistil only is present. In plants, as
                    Nymphsea alba, where a spiral arrangement of the floral leaves occur, it is not
                    easy to say where the calyx ends and the corolla begins, as these two whorls
                    pass insensibly into each other. When both calyx and corolla are present, the
                    plants are <hi rend="italic">dichlamydeous;</hi> occasionally one becomes
                    abortive, and then the flower is <hi rend="italic">monochlamy deous</hi> (fig.
                    174), having a calyx only, or <hi rend="italic">apetalous,</hi> having no
                    petals. At times both are abortive, and then the flower is <hi rend="italic"
                    >achlamydeous,</hi> or naked. It is important to remember that if only one
                    perianth-whorl is present it is the calyx. The outermost whorl of the essential
                    organs, collectively termed the <hi rend="italic">androecium,</hi> is composed
                    of a series of leaves distinguished as the staminal leaves or <hi rend="italic"
                    >stamens.</hi> These are the male sexual organs. In their most differentiated
                    form each consists of a stalk, either filiform or foliaceous, the <hi
                    rend="italic">filament</hi> (fig. 175, ∕) supporting at its summit a lobed
                    saccate mass, the <hi rend="italic">anther</hi> (fig. 175, a), which contains a
                    powdery matter, the <hi rend="italic">pollen</hi> (fig. 175, <hi rend="italic"
                    >p),</hi> which is discharged therefrom. In many cases, however, the staminal
                    leaf resembles more nearly a cataphyllary leaf, bearing the pollen-sacs
                    scattered over its surface, as in Cycadacese. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >gynoecium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pistil</hi> is the central portion of the
                    flower, and is the female sexual organ. It consists of one or more folded
                    leaves, called <hi rend="italic">carpels,</hi> either separate (fig. 172, c) or
                    combined (fig. 174.) The parts distinguished in the pistil are the <hi
                    rend="italic">ovary</hi> (fig. 176, <hi rend="italic">o'),</hi> which is the
                    lower portion enclosing the <hi rend="italic">ovules</hi> destined to become
                    seeds, and the <hi rend="italic">stigma</hi> (fig. 176, <hi rend="italic"
                    >g),</hi> a portion of loose cellular tissue uncovered by epidermis, which is
                    either sessile on the apex of the ovary, as in the Poppy, or is separated from
                    it by a prolonged portion called the <hi rend="italic">style</hi> (fig. 176, s).
                    The androecium and gynoecium are not present in all flowers. When both are
                    present the flower is <hi rend="italic">hermaphrodite;</hi> and in descriptive
                    botany such a flower is indicated by the symbol ?. When <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n136/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0136-0127"/> only one of those organs is present the flower is
                    <hi rend="italic">unisexual</hi> or <hi rend="italic">diclinous,</hi> and is
                    cither male <hi rend="italic">{staminate),</hi> J, or female <hi rend="italic"
                    >{pistillate), ?.</hi> A flower then normally consists of the four whorls of
                    leaves,—calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium,—and when these are all
                    present the flower is <hi rend="italic">complete.</hi> These several whorls of
                    the flower arc usually densely crowded upon the thalamus, but in some instances,
                    after apical growth has ceased in the axis, an elongation of portions of the
                    receptacle by intercalary growth occurs, by which changes in the position of the
                    parts may be brought about. Thus in Lychnis an elongation of the axis betwixt
                    the calyx and the corolla takes place, and in this way they are separated by an
                    interval. Again, in Passiflora the stamens are separated from the corolla by an
                    elongated portion of the axis, which has consequently been termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">androphore;</hi> and in Passiflora, Fraxinella (fig. 177),
                    Capparidaceae, and some other plants, the ovary is raised upon a distinct stalk
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">gynophore;</hi> it is thus separated from the
                    stamens, and is said to be <hi rend="italic">stipitate.</hi> The apical growth
                    of the floral axis in the flower soon ceases, and therefore the parts are
                    arranged in whorls; but at times, as in the Ranunculaceae, Magnoliaceae,
                    &amp;c., the growth is of sufficient duration to permit a spiral arrangement of
                    parts. Usually the successive whorls of the flower disposed from below upwards
                    or from without inwards upon the floral axis are of the same number of parts, or
                    are a multiple of the same number of parts, those of one whorl alternating with
                    those of the whorls next it.</p>
                <p>When a flower consists of parts arranged in whorls it is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">cyclic,</hi> and if all the whorls have an equal number of parts
                    and are alternate it is <hi rend="italic">encyclic.</hi> In contrast to the
                    cyclic flowers are those, as in Magnoliaceae, where the parts are in spirals.
                    When in such a flower the transition from one foliar structure to another, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from calyx to corolla, from corolla to stamens,
                    &amp;c., does not coincide with a definite number of turns of the spiral it is
                    said to be <hi rend="italic">acyclic;</hi> if it does so correspond it is termed
                    <hi rend="italic">hemicyclic;</hi> the latter term also includes flowers which
                    are cyclic at one portion and spiral at another, as in many Ranunculaceae. In
                    spiral flowers the distinction into whorls is by no means easy, and usually
                    there is a gradual passage from sepaloid through petaloid to staminal parts, as
                    in Nymphaeaceae (figs. 178, 179), although in some plants there is no such
                    distinction, the parts being all petaloid, as in Trollius. We may again note
                    here that some regard the cone in C'oniferae and Cycadaceae as a single flower,
                    and in that case the whorls are much separated and arranged spirally along the
                    floral axis. Normally, the parts of successive whorls alternate; but in some
                    cases we find the parts of one whorl opposite or <hi rend="italic"
                    >superposed</hi> to those of the next whorl. In some cases, as in the
                    Ampelideae, this seems to be the ordinary mode of development, but in
                    Caryophyllaceae the superposition of the stamens on the sepals in many plants
                    seems to be due to the suppression or abortion of the whorl of petals, and this
                    idea is borne out by the development, in some plants of the order, of the
                    suppressed whorl. In Primulaceae, again, where there is a superposition of
                    stamens and petals the abnormality is due apparently to another cause. The
                    petals are developed after the stamens, and are to be regarded as appendages
                    from them, of the same nature as the appendages to the stamens in
                    Asclepiadaceae, so that morphologically in Primulaceae, according to this view,
                    there are no petals. As a rule, whenever we find the parts of one whorl
                    superposed to those of another we may suspect some abnormality. Frequently, when
                    parts are superposed they become adherent to one another; thus the stamens
                    become adherent to the petals or are <hi rend="italic">epipetalous,</hi> or to
                    the sepals and are <hi rend="italic">episepalous.</hi></p>
                <p>A flower is said to be <hi rend="italic">symmetrical</hi> when each of its whorls
                    consists of an equal number of parts, or when the parts of any one whorl are
                    multiples of that preceding it. Thus, a symmetrical flower may have five sepals,
                    five petals, five stamens, and five carpels, or the number of any of these parts
                    may be ten, twenty, or some multiple of five. Fig. 173 is a diagram of a
                    symmetrical flower, with five parts in each whorl, alternating with each other.
                    In fig. 180 there is a section of a symmetrical flower of Stone-crop, with five
                    sepals, five alternating petals, ten stamens, and five carpels. Here the number
                    of parts in the staminal whorl is double that in the others, and in such a case
                    the additional five parts form a second row alternating with the others. In the
                    staminal whorl especially it is common to find additional rows. In fig. 181
                    there is a symmetrical flower, with five parts in the three outer rows and ten
                    divisions in the inner. In this case it is th gynoecium which has an additional
                    number of parts. Fig 182 shows a flower of Heath, with four divisions of th
                    calyx and corolla, eight stamens in two rows, and fou divisions of the pistil.
                    In fig. 183 there are three part: in each whorl; and in figs. 184 there are
                    three divi sions of the calyx, corolla, and pistil, and six stamen: in two rows.
                    In all these cases the flower is symmetrical Where, as in the Stone-crop, an
                    extra row of parts is deve loped in any whorl they may be either formed in
                    regula succession within the first row, or they may be <hi rend="italic"
                    >interposée</hi> to them, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> formed between them, or
                    even external to am beneath them. We have examples of the former in man]
                    Caryophyllaccous plants, the latter being well seen iι Crassulaceae,
                    Geraniaceae, &lt;kc. In Monocotyledons it i <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0137-0128"/> usual for the staminal whorl to be double, it
                    rarely having more than two rows, whilst amongst Dicotyledons there are often
                    very numerous rows of stamens. The floral envelopes are rarely multiplied
                    Flowers in which the number of parts in each whorl is the same, are <hi
                    rend="italic">isomerous</hi> (of equal number); when the number in some of the
                    whorls is different, the flower is <hi rend="italic">anisomerous</hi> (of
                    unequal number). The pistilline whorl is very liable to changes. It frequently
                    happens that when it is fully formed, the number of its parts is not in
                    conformity with that of the other whorls. In such circumstances, however, a
                    flower has been called symmetrical, provided the parts of the other whorls are
                    normal, —the permanent state of the pistil not being taken into account in
                    determining symmetry. Thus, fig. 185 shows a pentamerous symmetrical flower,
                    with dimerous pistils. Symmetry, then, in botanical language, has reference to a
                    certain definite numerical relation of parts. A flower in which the parts are
                    arranged in twos, is called <hi rend="italic">dimerous,</hi> the symmetry being
                    <hi rend="italic">binary</hi> and the arrangement marked thus ^∕∙ This may be
                    considered either as analogous to opposite decussating leaves, or as composed of
                    distichous alternate leaves belonging to the one-half series. When the parts of
                    the floral whorls are three, the flower is <hi rend="italic">trimerous,</hi> and
                    the symmetry being <hi rend="italic">ternary or</hi> trigonal is marked <hi
                    rend="italic">f∕.</hi> This may be looked upon as composed of verticillate
                    leaves, or of tristichous alternate leaves with the angular divergence ⅜. When
                    floral whorls have parts in a series of four, the flower is <hi rend="italic"
                    >tetramerous,</hi> its symmetry being <hi rend="italic">quaternary,</hi> and
                    marked ty. A <hi rend="italic">pentamerous</hi> flower, marked ty, has <hi
                    rend="italic">quinary</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pentagonal</hi> symmetry. The
                    symmetry which is most commonly met with in the vegetable kingdom is trimerous
                    and pentamerous—the former occurring generally among Monocotyledons, the latter
                    among Dicotyledons. Dimerous or tetramerous symmetry occurs also among
                    Dicotyledonous plants, and the numbers 2 and 4 prevail in the reproductive
                    organs of Acotyledons. The various parts of the flower have a certain definite
                    relation to the axis. Thus, in axillary tetramerous flowers (fig. 182), one
                    sepal is next the axis, and is called <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">posterior;</hi> another is next the bract, and is <hi
                    rend="italic">inferior</hi> or <hi rend="italic">anterior,</hi> and the other
                    two are <hi rend="italic">lateral;</hi> and certain terms are used to indicate
                    that position. A plane passing through the anterior and posterior sepal and
                    through the floral axis is termed the <hi rend="italic">median plane</hi> of the
                    flower; a plane cutting it at right angles, and passing through the lateral
                    sepals, is the <hi rend="italic">lateral plane;</hi> whilst the planes which
                    bisect the angles formed by the lateral and median planes are the <hi
                    rend="italic">diagonal planes,</hi> and in these flowers the petals which
                    alternate with the sepals are cut by the diagonal planes.</p>
                <p>In a pentamerous flower one sepal may be superior, as in the calyx of Rosaceae
                    and Labiatae; or it may be inferior, as in the calyx of Leguminosae (fig.
                    186),—the reverse, by the law of alternation, being the case with the petals.
                    Thus, in the blossom of the Pea (fig. 187), the odd petal (vexillum) <hi
                    rend="italic">st</hi> is superior, while the odd sepal is inferior. In the
                    Figwort order one of the two carpels is posterior and the other anterior, whilst
                    in Convolvulaceae the carpels are arranged laterally. Sometimes the twisting of
                    a part makes a change in the position of other parts, as in Orchids, where the
                    twisting of the ovary changes the position of the labellum. When the different
                    members of each whorl are like in size and shape, the flower is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">regular;</hi> while differences in the size and shape of the parts
                    of a whorl make the flower <hi rend="italic">irregular,</hi> as in the
                    Papilionaceous flower, represented in fig. 187. When a flower can be divided by
                    a single median plane into two exactly similar parts, then it is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">zygomorphic.</hi> Such flowers as Papilionaceae, Labiatae, are
                    examples. In contrast with this are <hi rend="italic">poly symmetrical</hi>
                    flowers, which can be divided by several planes into several exactly similar
                    portions; such are all regular, symmetrical flowers. When the parts of any whorl
                    are not equal to or some multiple of the others, then the flower is <hi
                    rend="italic">unsymmetrical.</hi> This want of symmetry may be brought about in
                    various ways. A consideration of the various unsymmetrical, irregular, and
                    incomplete forms of the flower, and the processes by which they have been
                    brought about, constitutes <hi rend="italic">Teratology.</hi> Alteration in the
                    symmetrical arrangement as well as in the completeness and regularity of flowers
                    has been traced to <hi rend="italic">suppression</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >non-development</hi> of parts, <hi rend="italic">degeneration</hi> or imperfect
                    formation, <hi rend="italic">cohesion</hi> or union of parts of the same whorl,
                    <hi rend="italic">adhesion</hi> or union of the parts of different whorls, <hi
                    rend="italic">multipli·</hi><hi rend="italic">cation</hi> of parts, and <hi
                    rend="italic">deduplication</hi> (sometimes called <hi rend="italic"
                    >chorisis)</hi> or splitting of parts.</p>
                <p>By <hi rend="italic">suppression</hi> or non-appearance of a part at the place
                    where it ought to appear if the structure was normal, the symmetry or
                    completeness of the flower is disturbed. This suppression when confined to the
                    parts of certain verticils makes the flower unsymmetrical. Thus, in the flowers
                    of Staphylea there are five parts of the calyx, five petals, five stamens, and
                    only two carpels; in many Caryophyllaceae, as Polycarpon and Holosteum, while
                    the calyx and corolla are pentamerous, there are only three or four stamens and
                    three carpels; in Impatiens noli-me-tangere the calyx is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n138/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0138-0129"/> composed of three parts, while the other
                    verticils have five; in Labiate flowers there are five parts of. the calyx and
                    corolla, and only four stamens; and in Tropaeolum pentaphyllum there are five
                    sepals, two petals, eight stamens, and three carpels. In all these cases the
                    want of symmetry is traced to the suppression of certain parts. In the
                    last-mentioned plant the normal number is five, hence it is said that there are
                    three petals suppressed, as shown by the position of the two remaining ones;
                    there are two rows of stamens, in each of which one is wanting, and there are
                    two carpels suppressed. In many instances the parts which are afterwards
                    suppressed can be seen in the early stages of growth, and occasionally some
                    vestiges of them remain in the fully developed flower. By the suppression of the
                    verticil of the stamens, or of the carpels, flowers become <hi rend="italic"
                    >unisexual,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">diclinous,</hi> and by the suppression of
                    one or both of the floral envelopes, monochlamydeous and achlamydeous flowers
                    are produced. The suppression of parts of the flower may be carried so far that
                    at last a flower consists of only one part of one whorl. In the Euphorbiaceae we
                    have an excellent example of the gradual suppression of parts, where from an
                    apetalous trimerons staminal flower we pass to one where one of the stamens is
                    suppressed, and then to forms where two of them are wanting. We next have
                    flowers in which the calyx is suppressed, and its place occupied by one, two, or
                    three bracts (so that the flower is, properly speaking, achlamydeous), and only
                    one or two stamens are produced. And finally, we find sterile flowers consisting
                    of a single stamen with a bract, and fertile flowers consisting of a single
                    carpel with a bract. There is thus traced a <hi rend="italic">degradation,</hi>
                    as it is called, from a flower with three stamens and three divisions of the
                    calyx, to one with a single bract and a single stamen or carpel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Degeneration,</hi> or the transformation of parts, often gives
                    rise either to an apparent want of symmetry or to irregularity in form. In
                    unisexual flowers it is not uncommon to find vestigee of the undeveloped stamens
                    in the form of filiform bodies or scales. To many of these staminal
                    degenerations Linnaeus gave the name of <hi rend="italic">nectaries.</hi> In
                    double flowers transformations of the stamens and pistils take place, so that
                    they appear as petals. In C’anna, what are called petals are in reality
                    metamorphosed stamens. In the capitula of Compositae we sometimes find the
                    florets converted into green leaves. The limb of the calyx may appear as a rim,
                    as in some Umbelliferae; or as pappus, in Compositae and Valeriana. In
                    Scrophularia the fifth stamen appears as a scale-like body, called <hi
                    rend="italic">staminodium;</hi> in other Scrophulariaceae,as inPentstemon,it
                    assumes the form of a filament, with hairs at its apex in place of an
                    anther.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cohesion,</hi> or the union of parts of the same whorl, and <hi
                    rend="italic">adhesion,</hi> or the growing together of parts of different
                    whorls, are very common causes of change both as regards form and symmetry. Thus
                    in Cucurbita the stamens are originally five in number, but subsequently some
                    cohere, so that three stamens only are seen in the mature flower. Again, amongst
                    Malvaceae the stamens cohere by their margins. Cases of what are called
                    gamopetalous corollas, gamosepalous calyces, Ac., must be distinguished
                    carefully from such a process as this <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> in these
                    cases the parts were never free from one another, but developed from the very
                    first as one mass; and the same caution is necessary in many instances of
                    so-called union of stameps, which are really cases of branching. Adhesion is
                    well seen in the <hi rend="italic">gynostemium,</hi> of Orchids, where the
                    stamens and ovary adhere; and in flowers where the stamens are <hi rend="italic"
                    >perigynous, i.e.,</hi> are adherent to the calyx. In Capparidaceae the calyx
                    and petals occupy their usual position, but the axis is prolonged in the form of
                    a gynophore, to which the stamens are united. Cohesion and adhesion are rare
                    amongst Monocotyledons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Multiplication,</hi> or an increase of the number of parts,
                    gives rise to changes in plants. We have already alluded to the interposition of
                    new members in a whorl. This takes place chiefly in the staminal whorl, but
                    usually the additional parts produced form a symmetrical whorl with the others.
                    In some instances, however, this is not the case. Thus in the Horse-chestnut
                    there is an interposition of two stamens betwixt the other whorl, and thus seven
                    stamens are formed in the flower, which is unsymmetrical.</p>
                <p>Parts of the flower are often increased by a process of <hi rend="italic"
                    >deduplication, unlining, dilamination,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chorization,
                    i.e.,</hi> the splitting of a part so that two or more parts are formed out of
                    what was originally one. This is believed by some to take place in a remarkable
                    degree in the case of appendages to petals. Thus, in Ranunculus, the petal has a
                    scale at its base, which is looked upon as a mere fold of it. This fold may in
                    some cases be more highly developed, as in Caryophyllaceae, and in Crassula
                    rubens (fig. 172, a). Others refer such cases to the formation of outgrowths
                    similar in nature to the ligule in Grasses. In Cruciferous plants a case of
                    chorisis is said to occur. There the staminal whorl consists of four long
                    stamens and two short ones <hi rend="italic">(tetradynamous').</hi> The symmetry
                    in the flower is evidently dimerous, and the abnormality in the androecium,
                    where the four long stamens are opposite the posterior sepals, is said to take
                    place by a splitting of the filaments of two stamens into four; and thus the two
                    long stamens on each side are, by <hi rend="italic">gemination,</hi> normally
                    one. This view is supported by cases in which the filaments of the long stamens
                    are more or less united; also by cases in which the shorter filaments exhibit
                    tooth-like processes on both sides, while the longer ones have them only on the
                    outer side. In such cases the two long filaments, if united, would present the
                    same appearance as the shorter ones, and occupy their usual position of
                    alternation with the petals. In some instances, by <hi rend="italic"
                    >pelorization,</hi> it is found that tetradynamous plants become tetrandrous,
                    with stamens of equal length alternating with the petals. Many cases of what was
                    considered chorisis are in reality due to the development of stipules from the
                    staminal leaf. Thus in Dicentra and Corydalis there are six stamens in two
                    bundles; the central one of each bundle alone is perfect, the lateral ones have
                    each only half an anther, and they are really stipules formed from the staminal
                    leaf. Branching of stamens also produces apparent want of symmetry; thus, in the
                    so called polyadelphous stamens of Hypericaceae there are really only five
                    stamens which give off numerous branches, but the basal portion remaining short,
                    the branches have the appearance of separate stamens, and the flower thus seems
                    unsymmetrical.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cultivation</hi> has a great effect in causing changes in the
                    various parts of plants. Many alterations in form, size, number, and adhesion of
                    parts are due to the art of the horticulturist. The changes in the colour and
                    forms of flowers thus produced are endless. In the Dahlia the florets are
                    rendered quilled, and are made to assume many glowing colours. In Pelargonium
                    the flowers have been rendered larger and more showy; and such is also the case
                    with the Ranunculus, the Auricula, and the Carnation. Some flowers, with spurred
                    petals in their usual state, as Columbine, are changed so that the spurs
                    disappear; and others, as Linaria, in which one petal only is usually spurred,
                    are altered so as to have all the petals spurred, and to present what are called
                    <hi rend="italic">pelorian</hi> varieties.</p>
                <p>As a convenient method of expressing the arrangement of the parts of the flower,
                    floral formulae have been devised. Several modes of expression are employed. The
                    following is a very simple mode which has been proposed :—The several whorls are
                    represented by the letters S sepals, P petals, St stamens, C carpels, and a
                    figure marked after each indicates the number of parts in that whorl. Thus the
                    formula S <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> P.StC <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> means
                    that the flower is perfect, and has <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n139/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0139-0130"/> pentamerous symmetry, the whorls being isomerous.
                    Such a flower as that of Sedum (fig. 180) would be represented by the formula S
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> St <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s+6</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>, where St <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5+6</hi> indicates that the staminal whorl consists of two
                    rows of five parts each. A flower such as the male flower of the Nettle (fig.
                    188) would be expressed S <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> P <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi> St <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>. It is
                    also possible to indicate, in cases where members of a whorl are absent, which
                    of them are wanting; thus, in the flower of an Orchis we have S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> St <hi rend="subscript">
                    i+0</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, Here St∙ <hi rend="subscript"> i+0</hi>
                    indicates that the anterior stamen of the outer row is present, the other two
                    stamens of the row, marked as dots, are wanting, as also all the stamens of the
                    inner row. In Cypripedium, on the other hand, the formula is S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> St <hi rend="subscript">
                    0+2</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, for here all the stamens of the outer
                    row and the anterior one of the inner row are absent. When no other mark is
                    appended the whorls are supposed to be alternate; but if it is desired to mark
                    the position of the whorls special symbols are employed. Thus, to express the
                    superposition of one whorl upon another, a line is drawn between them, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the symbol S <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi>] St <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 5</hi> is the formula of the flower of Primulaceae. To indicate the
                    interposition of a row of parts in a whorl a dot is placed between the
                    coefficients, thus S <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> p</hi>
                    St <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> indicates that an extra row of five stamens has been
                    interposed between those already in existence. To represent adhesions and
                    cohesions leads to complicated formulae, but in many cases cohesion A A A</p>
                <p>can be easily indicated. Thus in the formula S <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> St <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, we have the arrangement of the parts of thefloweι <hi rend="superscript"

                    two carpels also being united into one pistil. The papilionaceous flower, of
                    which fig. 186 is a diagram, may be formulated A</p>

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>)C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. We thus learn that
                    there are five sepals united, five free petals, ten stamens in two rows, of
                    which nine are united and one is free, and there is one carpel. When the parts
                    of the flower are arranged spirally on the floral axis, as in Magnoliaceae and
                    other flowers, the formula is prefixed by a curved line thus G—and then the
                    angle of divergence of the members may be marked in addition to their number.
                    Many other points in the arrangement of the flower may be attached to the
                    formula by different symbols, according to the object which one has in view.</p>
                <p>. To the flower-bud the name <hi rend="italic">aldbastrus</hi> is sometimes
                    given, and its period of opening has been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >anthesis,</hi> whilst the manner in which the parts are arranged with respect
                    to each other before opening is the <hi rend="italic">aestivation</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">proefloration.</hi> The latter terms are applied to the flowerbud
                    in the same way as vernation is to the leaf-bud, and distinctive names have been
                    given to the different arrangements exhibited, both by the leaves individually
                    and in their relations to each other. As regards each leaf of the flower, it is
                    either spread out, as the sepals in the bud of the Lime-tree, or folded upon
                    itself (conduplicate), as in in ζ <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>!^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> s some</hi> species of
                    Lysimachia, or slightly folded inwards or outwards at the edges, as in the calyx
                    of some species of Clematis, -and of some herbaceous plants, or rolled up at the
                    edges (involute or revolute), or folded transversely, becoming <hi rend="italic"
                    >crumpled</hi> or <hi rend="italic">corrugated,</hi> as in the Poppy. When the
                    parts of a whorl are placed in an exact circle, and are applied to each other by
                    their edges only, without overlapping or being folded, thus resembling the
                    valves of a seed-vessel, the aestivation is <hi rend="italic">valvate,</hi> as
                    in the calyx of Guazuma ulmifolia (fig. 189). The edges of each of the parts may
                    be turned either inwards or outwards; in the former case, the aestivation is <hi
                    rend="italic">induplicate,</hi> as in the corolla of Guazuma ulmifolia (fig.
                    190), in the latter case, <hi rend="italic">reduplicate,</hi> as in the calyx of
                    Althaea rosea (fig. 191). When the parts of a single whorl are placed in a
                    circle, each of them exhibiting a torsion of its axis, so that by one of its
                    sides it overlaps its neighbour, whilst its side is overlapped in like manner by
                    that standing next to it, the aestivation is <hi rend="italic">tιvisted</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">contortive,</hi> as in the corolla of Althaea rosea (fig.
                    192). This arrangement is characteristic of the flower-buds of</p>
                <p>Malvaceae and Apocynaceae, and it is also seen in Convolvulaceae and
                    Caryophyllaceae. When the flower expands, the traces of twisting often
                    disappear, but sometimes, as in Apocynaceae, they remain. Those forms of
                    aestivation are such as occur in cyclic flowers, and they are included under <hi
                    rend="italic">circular</hi> aestivation. But in spiral flowers we have a
                    different arrangement, the leaves of the calyx of Camellia japonica cover each
                    other partially like tiles on a house. This aestivation is <hi rend="italic"
                    >imbricate.</hi> At other times, as in the petals of Camellia, the parts
                    envelope each other completely, so as to become <hi rend="italic"
                    >convolute.</hi> This is also seen in a transverse section of the calyx of
                    Magnolia grandiflora, where each of the three leaves embraces that within it.
                    When the parts of a whorl are five, as occurs in many Dicotyledons, and the
                    imbrication is such that there are two parts external, two internal, and a fifth
                    which partially covers one of the internal parts by its margin, and is in its
                    turn partially covered by one of the external parts, the aestivation is <hi
                    rend="italic">quincuncial</hi> (fig. 193). This quincunx is common in the
                    corolla of Rosaceae. In fig. 194 a section is given of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n140/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0140-0131"/> bud of Antirrhinum majus, showing the imbricate
                    spiral arrangement. In this case it will be seen that the part marked 5 has, by
                    a slight change in position, become overlapped by 1. This variety of imbricate
                    aestivation has been termed <hi rend="italic">cochlear.</hi> In flowers, such as
                    those of the Pea (fig. 187), one of the parts, the vexillum, is often large and
                    folded over the others, giving rise to <hi rend="italic">vexillary</hi>
                    aestivation (fig. 195), or the carina may perform a similar office, and then the
                    aestivation is <hi rend="italic">carinal,</hi> as in the Judas-tree (Cereis
                    Siliquastrum). The parts of the several verticils often differ in their mode of
                    aestivation. Thus, in Malvaceae the corolla is contortive and the calyx valvate,
                    or reduplicate; in St John’s-wort the calyx is imbricate, and the corolla
                    contortive. In Convolvulaceae, while the corolla is twisted, and has its parts
                    arranged in a circle, the calyx is imbricate, and exhibits a spiral arrangement.
                    In Guazuma the calyx is valvate, and the corolla induplicate. The circular
                    aestivation is generally associated with a regular calyx and corolla, while the
                    spiral aestivations are connected with irregular as well as with regular
                    forms.</p>

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Calyx.</hi></p>
                <p>The calyx is the external envelope of the flower, and consists of verticillate
                    leaves, called <hi rend="italic">sepals,</hi><hi rend="italic">foliola,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">plιylla.</hi> These calycine leaves are sometimes separate
                    from each other, at other times they are united to a greater or less extent; in
                    the former case, the calyx is <hi rend="italic">dialysepalous</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">eleutherosepalous, poly sepalous</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >polyphyllous,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">apo-sepalous;</hi> in the latter, <hi
                    rend="italic">gamosepalous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gamoplιyllous,
                    mono-sepalous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">monophyllous,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >synsepalous.</hi> The divisions of the calyx present usually all the characters
                    of leaves, and in some cases of monstrosity they are converted into the ordinary
                    leaves of the plant. Their structure consists of cellular tissue or parenchyma,
                    traversed by vascular bundles, in the form of ribs and veins, containing spiral
                    vessels, which can be unrolled, delicate woody fibres, and other vessels, the
                    whole being enclosed in an epidermal covering, having stomata and often hairs on
                    its outer surface, which corresponds to the under side of the leaf. In the great
                    divisions of the vegetable kingdom the venation of the calyx is similar to that
                    of the leaves,—parallel in Monocotyledons, reticulated in Dicotyledons. The
                    leaves of the calyx are usually entire, but occasionally they are cut in various
                    ways, as in the Rose, and they are sometimes hooked at the margin, as in Rumex
                    uncatus. It is rare to find the leaves of the calyx stalked. They are usually
                    sessile leaves, in which the vaginal portion is only slightly developed, and
                    frequently the laminar part is alone present. Sepals are generally of a more or
                    less oval, elliptical, or oblong form, with their apices either blunt or acute.
                    In their direction they are erect or reflexed (with their apices downwards),
                    spreading outwards <hi rend="italic">{divergent</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >patulous),</hi> or arched inwards <hi rend="italic">{connivent).</hi> They are
                    usually of a greenish colour, and are called <hi rend="italic">foliaceous</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">herbaceous;</hi> but sometimes they are coloured, as in the
                    Fuchsia, Tropaeolum, Globe-flower, and Pomegranate, and are then called <hi
                    rend="italic">petaloid.</hi> Whatever be its colour, the external envelope of
                    the flower must be considered as the calyx. The nature of the hairs on the calyx
                    gives rise to terms similar to those already mentioned as applied to the
                    surfaces of other parts of plants. The vascular bundles sometimes form a
                    prominent rib, which indicates the middle of the sepal; at other times they form
                    several ribs. The venation is useful as pointing out the number of leaves which
                    constitute a gamosepalous calyx. In a polysepalous calyx the number of the parts
                    is marked by Greek numerals prefixed. Thus, a calyx which has three sepals is
                    <hi rend="italic">trisepalous;</hi> one with five sepals is <hi rend="italic"
                    >pentasepalous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pentaphyllous.</hi> The sepals
                    occasionally are of different forms and sizes. In Aconit» one of them is shaped
                    like a helmet, and has been callee <hi rend="italic">galeate.</hi> In a
                    gamosepalous calyx the sepals are united in various ways, sometimes very
                    slightly, and their number is marked by the divisions at the apex. These
                    divisions eitheι are simple projections in the form of acute or obtuse teeth; or
                    they extend down the calyx as fissures about halfway, the calyx being <hi
                    rend="italic">trifid</hi> (three-cleft), <hi rend="italic">quinquefid</hi>
                    (five-cleft), (fig. 196), &amp;c., according to their number; or they reach to
                    near the base in the form of partitions, the calyx being <hi rend="italic"
                    >tripartite, quaaripartite,</hi><hi rend="italic">quinquepartite,</hi> &amp;c.
                    The union of the parts may be complete, and the calyx may be quite entire or <hi
                    rend="italic">truncate,</hi> as in some Correas, the venation being the chief
                    indication of the different parts. The cohesion is sometimes irregular, some
                    parts uniting to a greater extent than others; thus a two-lipped or <hi
                    rend="italic">labiate</hi> calyx is formed, which, when the upper or posterior
                    lip is arched, becomes <hi rend="italic">ringent.</hi> The upper lip is often
                    composed of three parts, which are thus posterior or next the axis, while the
                    lower has two, which are anterior. The part formed by the union of the sepals is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">tube</hi> of the calyx; the portion where the
                    sepals are free is the <hi rend="italic">limb.</hi></p>
                <p>Occasionally, certain parts of the sepals undergo marked enlargement. In the
                    Violet the calycine segments <hi rend="italic">(laciniae)</hi> are prolonged
                    downwards beyond their insertions, and in the Indian Cress (Tropaeolum) this
                    prolongation is in the form of a spur <hi rend="italic">(calcar),</hi> formed by
                    three sepals; in Delphinium it is formed by one. When one or more sepals are
                    thus enlarged, the calyx is <hi rend="italic">calcarate</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">spurred.</hi> In Pelargonium the spur from one of the sepals is
                    adherent to the flower-stalk. When an epicalyx is present, as in the Mallow
                    order, the flower appears to be provided with a double calyx, and has been
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">caliculate.</hi> Degenerations take place in the
                    calyx, so that it becomes dry, scaly, and glumaceous (like the glumes of
                    grasses), as in the Rush tribe; hairy, as in Compositae; or a mere rim, as in
                    some Umbelliferae and Acanthaceae, and in Madder (Rubia tinctorum, fig. 198),
                    when it is called <hi rend="italic">obsolete</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >marginate.</hi> In Diplolaena it is reduced to five scales. In Compositae,</p>
                <p>Dipsacaceae, and Valerianaceae, the calyx is attached to the pistil, and its limb
                    is developed in the form of hairs called <hi rend="italic">pappus</hi>
                    (fig.197). This pappus is either simple <hi rend="italic">(pilose}</hi> or <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n141/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0141-0132"/> feathery <hi rend="italic">(plumose).</hi> In
                    Valeriana the superior calyx is at first an obsolete rim, but as the fruit
                    ripens it is shown to consist of hairs rolled inwards, which expand so as to
                    waft the fruit. The calyx sometimes falls off before the flower expands, as in
                    Poppies, and is <hi rend="italic">caducous</hi> (fig. 199); or along with the
                    corolla, as in Ranunculus, and is <hi rend="italic">deciduous;</hi> or it
                    remains after flowering, as in Labiatae, Scrophulariaceae, and Boraginaceae; or
                    its base only is persistent, as in Datura Stramonium. In Eschscholtzia and
                    Eucalyptus the sepals remain united at the upper part, and become disarticulated
                    at the base or middle, so as to come off in the form of a lid or funnel. Such a
                    calyx is <hi rend="italic">operculate</hi><hi rend="italic">or calyptrate.</hi>
                    The existence or non-existence of an articulation determines the deciduous or
                    persistent nature of the calyx. In the case of Eschscholtzia the axis seems to
                    be prolonged so as to form a sort of tube, from which the calyx separates. In
                    Eucalyptus the calyx consists of leaves, the laminae or petioles of which are
                    articulated like those of the Orange, and the separation between the parts
                    occurs at this articulation. The receptacle bearing the calyx is sometimes
                    uuited to the pistil, and enlarges so as to form a part of the fruit, as in the
                    Apple, Pear, Pomegranate, Gooseberry, &lt;fcα In these fruits the withered calyx
                    is seen at the apex. Sometimes a persistent calyx increases much after
                    flowering, and encloses the fruit without being incorporated with it, becoming
                    <hi rend="italic">accrescent,</hi> as in various species of Physalis (fig. 200);
                    at other times it remains in a withered or <hi rend="italic">marcescent</hi>
                    form, as in Erica; sometimes it becomes <hi rend="italic">inflated</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">vesicular,</hi> as in Sea Campion (Silene maritima).</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Corolla.</hi></p>
                <p>The corolla is the more or less coloured inner floral envelope, forming the whorl
                    of leaves between the calyx and the stamens. It is generally the most
                    conspicuous whorl. The gay colours and fragrant odours of flowers are resident
                    in it. It is present in the greater number of Dicotyledons. Petals differ more
                    from leaves than sepals do, and are much more nearly allied to the staminal
                    whorl. In some cases, however, they are transformed into leaves, like the calyx,
                    and occasionally leaf-buds are developed in their axil. They are seldom green,
                    although occasionally that colour is met with, as in some Cobaeas, Hoya
                    viridiflora, Gonolobus viridiflorus, and Pentatropis spiralis. As a rule they
                    are highly coloured, the colouring matter being contained in cells, and
                    differing in its nature from the chlorophyll of the leaves. As regards their
                    structure petals consist of cellular tissue, traversed by true spiral vessels
                    and thin-walled tubes. In delicate flowers, as Convolvulus and Anagallis, these
                    vessels are easily seen under the microscope. Petals do not usually present
                    numerous layers of cells like the leaves, neither is the epidermis always
                    distinct, although in some instances it may be detached, especially from the
                    surface next the calyx. The cuticle of the petal of a Pelargonium, when viewed
                    with a ∣ or ∣-inch object glass, shows beautiful hexagons, the boundaries of
                    which are ornamented with several inflected loops in the sides of the cells</p>
                <p>On the outer surface of petals, corresponding to the lower side of leaves,
                    stomata are sometimes found. Petals are generally glabrous or smooth; but, in
                    some instances, hairs are produced on their surface. Petaline hairs, though
                    sparse and scattered, present occasionally the same arrangement as those which
                    occur on the leaves; thus, in Bombaceae they are stellate. Coloured hairs are
                    seen on the petals of Menyanthes, and on the segments of the perianth of the
                    Iris. Although petals are usually very thin and delicate in their texture, they
                    occasionally become thick and fleshy, as in Stapelia and Rafllesia; or dry, as
                    in Heaths; or hard and stiff, as in Xylopia. A petal often consists of two
                    portions—the lower narrow, resembling the petiole of a leaf, and called the <hi
                    rend="italic">unguis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">claw;</hi> the upper broader,
                    like the blade of a leaf, and called the <hi rend="italic">lamina</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">limb.</hi> These parts are seen in the petals of the Wallflower
                    (fig. 201), where c is the claw and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> the limb. The claw
                    is often wanting, as in the Crowfoot (fig. 202) and the Poppy, and the petals
                    are then <hi rend="italic">sessile.</hi> Petals having a claw are <hi
                    rend="italic">unguiculate.</hi> According to the development of veins and the
                    growth of cellular tissue, petals present varieties similar to those already
                    noticed in the case of leaves. Thus the margin is either entire or divided into
                    lobes or teeth. These teeth sometimes form a regular fringe round the margin,
                    and the petal becomes <hi rend="italic">fimbriated,</hi> as in the Pink; or <hi
                    rend="italic">laciniated,</hi> as in Lychnis Flos-cuculi; or <hi rend="italic"
                    >crested,</hi> as in Polygala. Sometimes the petal becomes pinnatifid, as in
                    Schizopetalum. The median vein is occasionally prolonged beyond the summit of
                    the petals in the form of a long process, as in Strophanthus hispidus, where it
                    extends for 7 inches; and at other times it ends in a free point or <hi
                    rend="italic">cuspis,</hi> and the petal becomes <hi rend="italic"
                    >cuspidate;</hi> or the prolonged extremity is folded downwards or inflexed, as
                    in Umbelliferae, so that the apex approaches the base. The limb of the petal may
                    be flat or concave, or hollowed like a boat. In Hellebore the petals become
                    folded in a tubular form, resembling a horn (fig. 203); in Aconite (fig. 205)
                    some of the petals resemble a hollow-curved horn, supported on a grooved stalk;
                    while in Columbine (fig. 204), Violet, Snapdragon, and Centranthus, one or all
                    of them are prolonged in the form of a spur, and are <hi rend="italic"
                    >calcarate.</hi> In Valeriana, Antirrhinum, and Corydalis, the spur is very
                    short, and the corolla or petal is said to be <hi rend="italic">gibbous,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">saccate,</hi> at the base.</p>
                <p>A corolla rarely consists of one petal, and when this occurs, as in Amorpha, it
                    depends on the abortion or nondevelopment of others. Such a corolla is <hi
                    rend="italic">unipetalous,</hi> a term quite distinct from monopetalous. A
                    corolla is <hi rend="italic">dipetalous, tripetalous, tetr apetalous,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">pentapetalous,</hi> according as it has two, three, four, or
                    five separate petals. The general name of <hi rend="italic">polypetalous,
                    dialypetalous, eleuthero-petalous,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">apopetalous,</hi>
                    is given to corollas having separate petals, while <hi rend="italic"
                    >monopetalous, gamopetalous,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sympetalous</hi> is
                    applied to those in which the petals are united. This union generally takes
                    place at the base, and extends more or less towards the apex; in Phyteuma the
                    petals are united at their apices also. In some polypetalous corollas, as that
                    of the Vine, the petals are separate at the base, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n142/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0142-0133"/> adhere by the apices. When the petals are equal
                    as regards their development and size, the corolla is <hi rend="italic"
                    >regular;</hi> when unequal, it is <hi rend="italic">irregular.</hi> When a
                    corolla is gamopetalous, it usually happens that the claws are united into a
                    tube, while the upper parts are either free or partially united, so as to form a
                    common limb, the point of union of the two portions being the <hi rend="italic"
                    >faux</hi> or <hi rend="italic">throat,</hi> which often exhibits a distinct
                    constriction or dilatation. The number of parts forming such a corolla can be
                    determined by the divisions, whether existing as teeth, crenations, fissures, or
                    partitions, or if, as rarely happens, the corolla is entire, by the venation The
                    union may be equal among the parts, or some may unite more than others.</p>
                <p>Amongst regular polypetalous corollas may be noticed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rosaceous</hi> corolla (fig. 206), in which there are five spreading petals,
                    having no claws, and arranged as in the single Rose and Potentilla; the <hi
                    rend="italic">caryophyllaceous</hi> corolla, in which there are five petals with
                    long narrow tapering claws, as in many of the Pink tribe; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >alsinaceous,</hi> where the claw is less narrow, and there are distinct spaces
                    between the petals, as in some species of Chickweed; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cruciform,</hi> having four petals, often unguiculate, placed opposite in the
                    form of a cross, as seen in Wallflower, and in other plants called <hi
                    rend="italic">cruciferous.</hi> Of irregular polypetalous corollas the most
                    marked is the <hi rend="italic">papilionaceous</hi> (fig. 187), in which there
                    are five petals :—one superior (posterior), <hi rend="italic">st,</hi> placed
                    next to the axis, usually larger· than the rest, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vexillum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">standard;</hi> two lateral, <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">alee</hi> or wings; two inferior
                    (anterior), partially or completely covered by the alae, and often united
                    slightly by their lower margins, so as to form a single keel-like piece, <hi
                    rend="italic">car,</hi> called <hi rend="italic">carina</hi> or keel, which
                    embraces the essential organs. This form of corolla is characteristic of British
                    Leguminous plants. Among the irregular polypetalous corollas might be included
                    the <hi rend="italic">orchideous</hi> (fig. 207), although it is really the
                    perianth of a Monocotyledon. This perianth consists of three outer portions
                    equivalent to the calyx, and three inner parts alternating with them,
                    constituting the petals. The latter are often very irregular, some being
                    spurred, others hooded, &amp;c.; and there is always one, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">labellum</hi> or lip <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> which presents a
                    remarkable development, and.gives rise to many of the anomalous forms exhibited
                    by these flowers.</p>
                <p>Regular gamopetalous corollas are sometimes <hi rend="italic">campanulate</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">bell-shaped,</hi> as in Campanula rotundifolia (fig. 208); <hi
                    rend="italic">infundibuliform</hi> or <hi rend="italic">funnel-shaped,</hi> when
                    the tube is like an inverted cone, and the limb becomes more expanded at the
                    apex, as in Tobacco; <hi rend="italic">hypocrateriform</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >salver-shaped,</hi> when there is a straight tube surmounted by a flat
                    spreading limb, as in Primula (fig. 209); <hi rend="italic">tubular,</hi> having
                    a long cylindrical tube, appearing continuous with the limb, as in Spigelia and
                    Comfrey; <hi rend="italic">rotate or wheel-shaped,</hi> when the tube is very
                    short, and the limb flat and spreading, as in Myosotis (when the divisions of
                    the rotate corolla are very acute, as in Galium, it is sometimes called <hi
                    rend="italic">stellate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">starlike); urceolate</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">um-shaped,</hi> when there is scarcely any limb, and the tube
                    is narrow at both ends, and expanded in the middle, as in Bell-heath (Erica
                    cinerea). Some of these forms may become irregular in consequence of certain
                    parts being more developed than others. Thus, in Veronica, the rotate corolla
                    has one division much smaller than the rest, and in Digitalis there is a
                    slightly irregular campanulate corolla which some have called <hi rend="italic"
                    >digitaliform. Of</hi> irregular gamopetalous corollas there may be mentioned
                    the <hi rend="italic">labiate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lipped</hi> (fig. 210),
                    having two divisions of the limb in the form of what are called <hi
                    rend="italic">labia</hi> or lips (the upper one, <hi rend="italic">u,</hi>
                    composed usually of two united petals, and the lower, <hi rend="italic">I,</hi>
                    of three), separated by a <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi> or gap. In such cases
                    the tube varies in length, and the parts in their union follow the reverse order
                    of what occurs in the calyx, where two sepals are united in the lower lip, and
                    three in the upper. When the upper lip of a labiate corolla is much arched, and
                    the lips separated by a distinct gap, it is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ringent</hi> (fig. 210). The labiate corolla characterizes the natural order
                    Labiatae. When the lower lip is pressed against the upper, so as to leave only a
                    chink or <hi rend="italic">rictus</hi> between them, the corolla is said to be
                    <hi rend="italic">personate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">masklike,</hi> as in
                    Frogsmouth, Snapdragon, and some other Scrophulariaceae, and the projecting
                    portion of the lower lip is called the <hi rend="italic">palate.</hi> In some
                    corollas the two lips become hollowed out in a remarkable manner, as in
                    Calceolaria, assuming a slipper-like appearance, similar to what occurs in the
                    labellum of some Orchids, as Cypripedium. The <hi rend="italic">calceolate</hi>
                    corolla of Calceolaria may be considered as consisting of two slipper-like lips.
                    When a tubular corolla is split in such a way as to form a strap-like process on
                    one side with several tooth-like projections at its apex, it becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">ligulate,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">strap-shaped</hi> (fig.
                    211).</p>

                <p>This corolla occurs in many Composite plants, as in the florets of Dandelion,
                    Daisy, and Chicory. The number of divisions at the apex indicates the number of
                    united petals, some of which, however, may be abortive. Occasionally some of the
                    petals become more united than others, and then the corolla assumes a <hi
                    rend="italic">bilabiate,</hi> or two-lipped form, as seen in the division of
                    Compositae called Labiatiflorae.</p>
                <p>In Grasses and Sedges, in place of verticillate leaves forming the flower, there
                    are alternate scales or glumes. The flow ers of Grasses usually occur in
                    spikelets (fig. 212), which consist of one or two glumes <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> covering several flowers <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The spikelets are
                    associated in spikes or panicles. In Wheat these spikelets are arranged
                    alternately along a common rachis. Each spikelet consists of two empty glumes
                    <hi rend="italic">a, a,</hi> having the form represented in fig. 212, and
                    enclosing flowers composed of scales <hi rend="italic">(paleoe</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">glumellce),</hi> which are placed at different heights in an
                    alternate manner. In the flower of the Oat (fig. 213), after removing the outer
                    pale or <hi rend="italic">glumelloe,</hi> the inner one <hi rend="italic"
                    >pi</hi> is seen with two scales <hi rend="italic">(lodiculoe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">or</hi><hi rend="italic">squamee)</hi><hi rend="italic">sq,</hi>
                    at the base, enclosing the essential organs of reproduction. The paleae of
                    grasses are called by some flowering glumes, while hypogynous scales (lodiculae)
                    within them are considered as the rudimentary perianth. In Wheat (Triticum)
                    there are two empty glumes and two flowering glumes, or, as some say, one
                    flowering glume and one pale. In the Oat (Avena) there are two empty glumes,
                    usually three flowering glumes with awns, and two lodicules representing the
                    perianth. In Sedges (Carices) the male flowers are borne on scales, and so are
                    the female, as shown in fig. 214, in which the scale « is placed on one side.
                    Within the scale the female flower is situated, having a peculiar baglike
                    covering <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> termed perigynium.</p>
                <p>The parts of the corolla frequently adhere to those of the calyx,. and any change
                    in the latter causes also an alteration in the former. Petals are sometimes
                    suppressed, and sometimes the whole corolla is absent. In Amorpha and Afzelia
                    the corolla is reduced to a single petal, and in some other Leguminous plants it
                    is entirely wanting. In the natural order Ranunculacese, some genera, such as
                    Ranunculus, Globe-flower, and Paeony, have both calyx and rîTii <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> ’ Λ <hi rend="superscript"> sr</hi> kilθ others, such
                    as Clematis, Anemone, and Caltha, have only a coloured calyx. Flowers become
                    double by the multiplication of the parts of the corolline whorl. This arises in
                    general from a metamorphosis of the stamens. Union of separate flowers <hi
                    rend="italic">(synanthos)</hi> occasionally occurs, and the adhesion which thus
                    takes place causes various changes in the whorls. Flowers may be united by their
                    peduncles, as seen in some anomalous specimens of Dandelion, Hyacinth, and
                    Centaury; or by their outer parts, such as the calyx. At other times there is a
                    complete fusion, as it were, of all the parts of the flowers, some continuing
                    normal, others being suppressed or abortive.</p>
                <p>Certain abnormal appearances occur in the petals of some flowers, which received
                    in former days the name of <hi rend="italic">nectaries.</hi> The term nectary
                    was very vaguely applied by Linnaeus to any part of the flower which presented
                    an unusual aspect, as the crown <hi rend="italic">(corona)</hi> of Narcissus,
                    the fringes of the Passion-flower, &amp;c. If the name is retained rt ought
                    properly to include only those parts which secrete a honey-like matter, as the
                    glandular depression at the base of the perianth of the Fritillary, or on the
                    petal of Ranunculus, or on the stamens of Rutaceae. The honey secreted by
                    flowers attracts insects, which, by conveying the pollen to the stigma, effect
                    fertilization. What have usually, however, been called nectaries, are mere
                    modifications of somo part of the flower, especially of the corolla and stamens,
                    produced either by degeneration or outgrowth, or by <hi rend="italic"
                    >dilamination, chorisis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">deduplication.</hi> Of this
                    nature are the scales on the petals in Lychnis, Silene, Cynoglossum, and
                    Ranunculus (fig. 202). Others consider these outgrowths of the petal to be
                    formed in the same way as the ligules of Grasses. Corollas having these scaly
                    appendages are sometimes denominated <hi rend="italic">appendiculate.</hi> In
                    Cuscuta and Samolus the scales are alternate with the petals, and may represent
                    altered stamens. The parts formerly called nectaries are mere modifications of
                    the corolla or stamens. Thus the so-called horn-like nectaries under the galeate
                    sepal of Aconite (fig. 205-) are modified petals, so also are the tubular
                    nectaries of Hellebore (fig. 203). The nectaries of Menyanthes and of Iris
                    consist of hairs developed on the petals. Those <hi rend="italic">oi</hi>
                    Parnassia and the Passion-flower, Stapelia, Asclepias, and Canna, are fringes,
                    rays, and processes, which are probably modifications of stamens; and some
                    consider the crown of Narcissus as consisting of a membrane similar to that
                    which unites the stamens in Pancratium. It is sometime3 difficult to say whether
                    these nectaries are to be referred to the corolline or to the staminal row. The
                    paraphyses of the Passion-flower, the crown of Narcissus, and the coronet of
                    Stapelia are referred sometimes to the one and sometimes to the other. In
                    general, they may be said to belong to that series with which they are
                    immediately connected. Some have given names indicating the parts of which they
                    are modifications, by prefixing the term <hi rend="italic">para,</hi> using such
                    terms as <hi rend="italic">paracorolla</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >parastemones.</hi></p>
                <p>Petals are attached to the axis usually by a narrow base, but occasionally the
                    base is larger than the limb, as in the Orange flower. When this attachment
                    takes place by an articulation, the petals fall off either immediately after
                    expansion <hi rend="italic">(caducous),</hi> or after fertilization <hi
                    rend="italic">(^deciduous).</hi> A corolla which is continuous with the axis and
                    not articulated to it, as in Campanula and Heaths, may be persistent, and remain
                    in a withered or marcescent state while the fruit is ripening. A gamopetalous
                    corolla falls off in one piece; but sometimes the base of the corolla remains
                    persistent, as in Rhinanthus and Orobanche,.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Essential Organs.</hi></p>
                <p>These organs are the <hi rend="italic">stamens</hi> and the∕&gt;⅛tiζ the latter
                    containing the seeds or germs of young plants, and corresponding to the female,
                    wdιile the former produces a powder necessary for fecundation, and is looked
                    upon as performing the part of the male. The presence of both is required in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n144/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0144-0135"/> order that perfect seed may be produced. A flower
                    may have a calyx and corolla, but it will be imperfect if the essential organs
                    are not present. The name of <hi rend="italic">hermaphrodite</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">bisexual</hi> is given to flowers in which both these organs are
                    found; that of <hi rend="italic">unisexual or diclinous</hi> to those in which
                    only one of these organs appears,—those bearing stamens only, being <hi
                    rend="italic">staminiferous</hi> or male; those having the pistil only, <hi
                    rend="italic">pistilliferous</hi> or female. But even in plants with
                    hermaphrodite flowers it is rare that self-fertilization take3 place, and this
                    is provided against by the structure of the parts or by the period of ripening
                    of the organs. For instance, in Primula and Linum some flowers have long stamens
                    and a pistil with a short style, the others having short stamens and a pistil
                    with a long style. The former occur in what are called thrum-eyed Primroses, the
                    latter in those called pin-eyed. Such plants are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >dimorphic.</hi> Other plants are <hi rend="italic">trimorphic</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> as species of Lythrum, and proper fertilization
                    is only effected by combination of parts of equal length. In some plants the
                    stamens are perfected before the pistil; they are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >proterandrous,</hi> as in Ranunculus repens, Silene maritima, Zea Mays. In
                    other plants the pistil is perfected before the stamen3, as in Potentilla
                    argentea, Plantago major, Coix Lachryma, and they are <hi rend="italic"
                    >}&gt;roterogynous</hi> plants. Plants in which proterandry or proterogyny
                    occurs are called <hi rend="italic">dichogamous.</hi> When in the same plant
                    there are unisexual flowers, both male and female, the plant is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">monoecious</hi> or <hi rend="italic">monoicoτιs,</hi> as in the
                    Hazel and Castor-oil plant. This is indicated by the symbol Ô - When the male
                    and female flowers of a species are found on separate plants, the term <hi
                    rend="italic">dioecious</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dioicous</hi> is applied, as
                    in Mercurialis and Hemp, and the symbol J: 5 is used; and when a species has
                    male, female, and hermaphrodite flowers on the same or different plants, as in
                    Parietaria, it is <hi rend="italic">polygamous,</hi> for which J φ Ç is the
                    symbol.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Male Organs in Phanerogams.</hi></p>
                <p>The stamens <hi rend="italic">(stamina)</hi> arise from the thalamus or torus
                    within the petals, with -which they alternate, forming one or more verticils or
                    whorls, which collectively constitute the <hi rend="italic">androecium,</hi> or
                    the male organs of the plant. Their normal position is below the inner whorl or
                    thé pistil, and when they are so placed (tig. 215, <hi rend="italic">e)</hi>
                    upon the thalamus they are <hi rend="italic">hypogynous.</hi> Sometimes they
                    become adherent to the petals, or are <hi rend="italic">epipetalous,</hi> and
                    the insertion of both is looked upon as similar, so that they are still
                    hypogynous provided they are independent of the calyx and the pistil. Frequently
                    the margins of the thalamus bearing the floral envelopes and stamens elongates,
                    and the gynoecium remains in the centre of the concave receptacle; thus the
                    stamens as it were rise from the calyx, and they surround the ovary, and are <hi
                    rend="italic">perigynous;</hi> but when the ovary becomes completely inferior by
                    the growing upwards and inwards of the receptacle, the parts of the flower
                    rising from its summit, the stamens are <hi rend="italic">epigynous</hi> (fig.
                    216). Numerous intermediate forms occur, especially amongst Saxifragaceae, where
                    the parts are <hi rend="italic">half superior</hi> or <hi rend="italic">half
                    inferior.</hi> In the Orchis tribe, where the stamens become adherent to the
                    pistil so as to form a column, the flowers are said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >gynandrous.</hi> The same is the case in Aristolochia (fig. 217). These
                    arrangements of parts are of great importance in classification. The stamens
                    vary in number, from one to many hundreds. Like the other parts of the flower
                    they are modified leaves, resembling leaves in their structure, development, and
                    arrangement. They consist of cellular and vascular tissues. They appear at first
                    in the form of cellular projections, and are arranged in a more or less spiral
                    form. In their general aspect they have a greater resemblance to petals than to
                    the leaves, and there is often seen a gradual transition from petals to stamens,
                    especially in spiral flowers, as Nymphaea alba. When flowers become double by
                    cultivation, the stamens are converted into petals, as in the Paeony, Camellia,
                    Rose, &lt;tc. When there 's or.ly one whorl the stamens are usually equal in
                    number to the sepals or petals, and are arranged opposite to the former, and
                    alternate with the latter. The flower is then <hi rend="italic"
                    >isostemonous.</hi> When the stamens are not equal in number to the sepals or
                    petals, the flower is <hi rend="italic">anisostemonous.</hi> When there is more
                    than one whorl of stamens, then the parts of each successive whorl alternate
                    with those of the whorl preceding it. The staminal row is more liable to
                    multiplication of parts than the outer whorls. A flower with a single row of
                    stamens is <hi rend="italic">aplostemonous.</hi> If the stamens are double the
                    sepals or petals as regards number, the flower is <hi rend="italic"
                    >diplostemonous;</hi> if more than double, <hi rend="italic">polystemonous.</hi>
                    The additional rows of stamens may be developed in the usual centripetal
                    (acropetal) order, as in Rhamnaceae; or they may be interposed between the
                    pre-existing ones or be placed outside them, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    develop centrifugally (basipetally), as in Geranium and Oxalis. When the stamens
                    are neither equal to, nor a multiple of, the floral envelopes, but are less
                    numerous, the flower is <hi rend="italic">miostemonous.</hi> When the stamens
                    are fewer than twenty they are said to be <hi rend="italic">definite,</hi> and
                    the flower is <hi rend="italic">oligandrous;</hi> when above twenty they are <hi

                    ∞. The number of stamens is indicated by the Greek numerals prefixed to the term

                <p>The simplest form of stamens is seen in Cycadaceous plants, where cataphyllary
                    leaves (the scales of the cone) are the staminal leaves, bearing the pollen-sacs
                    scattered over their under surface. The stamen usually consists of two parts, a
                    contracted portion, often thread-like, termed the <pb break="no"

                    a broader portion, usually of two lobes, termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >anther</hi> (fig. 175, <hi rend="italic">a),</hi> containing a powdery matter,
                    called <hi rend="italic">pollen (p),</hi> and supported upon the end of the
                    filament. That portion of the filament in contact with the anther lobes is
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">connective.</hi> The exact morphological relations
                    of these parts is not definitely settled. Some consider the filament as
                    representing the petiole, and the anther as being the folded lamina; others
                    again regard the connective as representing the lamina, the rest of the filament
                    being the petiole, and the anther lobes as mere appendages of the lamina. The
                    filament is no more essential to the stamen than the petiole is to the leaf, or
                    the claw to the petal. If the anther is absent the stamen is abortive, and
                    cannot perform its functions. The anther is developed before the filament, and
                    when the latter is not produced, the anther is sessile, or has no stalk, as in
                    the Mistleto.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">filament,</hi> when structurally considered, is found to
                    consist of a thin epidermis, on which occasionally stomata and hairs occur, and
                    a layer of cellular tissue enclosing a bundle of spiral vessels, which traverses
                    its whole length, and terminates at the junction between the filament and the
                    anther. The filaments of Callitriche verna are said to have no vessels. The
                    filament is usually, as its name imports, filiform or thread-like, cylindrical,
                    or slightly tapering towards its summit. It is often, however, thickened,
                    compressed, and flattened in various ways, becoming <hi rend="italic"
                    >petaloid</hi> in Canna, Maranta, Nymphaea alba (fig. 179); <hi rend="italic"
                    >subulate</hi> or slightly broadened at the base, and drawn out into a point
                    like an awl, as in Butomus umbellatus; <hi rend="italic">clavate,</hi> that is,
                    narrow below and broad above, as in Thalictrum. In some instances, as in Tamarix
                    gallica, Peganum Harmala, and Campanula, the base of the filament is much
                    dilated, and ends suddenly in a narrow thread-like portion. In these cases the
                    base may represent the sheath or vagina of the leaf, and may give off stipulary
                    processes in a lateral direction, as in Allium and Alyssum calycinum. The
                    filament varies much in length and in firmness. The length sometimes bears a
                    relation to that of the pistil, and to the position of the flower, whether erect
                    or drooping. The filament is usually of sufficient solidity to support the
                    anther in an erect position; but sometimes, as in Grasses, it is very delicate
                    and capillary, or hair-like, so that the anther is pendulous (fig. 212, s). The
                    filament is generally continuous from one end to the other, but in some cases it
                    is bent or jointed, becoming <hi rend="italic">geniculate;</hi> at other times,
                    as in the Pellitory, it is spiral. It is frequently colourless; but, in many
                    instances, it exhibits different colours. In Fuchsia and Poinciana, it is red;
                    in Adamia and Tradescantia virginica, blue; in Oenothera and Ranunculus acris,
                    yellow.</p>
                <p>Hairs, scales, teeth, or processes of different kinds are sometimes developed on
                    the filament. In Tradescantia virginica, or Spiderwort, the hairs are
                    beautifully coloured, moniliform or necklace-like, <hi rend="italic">⅛rd∖,
                    rotation</hi> is seen in them (p. 84). Such a filament is bearded or <hi
                    rend="italic">stupose.</hi> At the base of the filament glandular or scaly
                    appendages are occasionally produced, either on its internal or its external
                    surface. These may be either parts of a whorl, to be afterwards noticed under
                    the name of the disk, or separate prolongations from the filament itself, which
                    is hence called <hi rend="italic">appendiculate,</hi> or sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">strumose.</hi> Filaments are usually articulated to the thalamus
                    or torus, and the stamens fall off after fertilization; but in Campanula and
                    some other plants they are continuous with the torus, and the stamens remain
                    persistent, although in a withered state. Changes are produced in the whorl of
                    stamens by cohesion of the filaments to a greater or less extent, while the
                    anthers remain free; thus, all the filaments of the androecium may unite,
                    forming a tube round the pistil, or a central bundle when the pistil is
                    abortive, the stamens becoming <hi rend="italic">monadelphous,</hi> as occurs in
                    plants of the Mallow tribe; or they may be arranged in two bundles, the stamens
                    being <hi rend="italic">diadelphous,</hi> as in Polygala, Fumaria, and Pea; in
                    this case the bundles may be equal or unequal. It frequently happens, especially
                    in Papilionaceous flowers, that out of ten stamens nine are united by their
                    filaments, while one (the posterior one) is free (fig. 218). When there are
                    three or more bundles the stamens are <hi rend="italic">triadelphous,</hi> as in
                    Hypericum aegyptiacum, or <hi rend="italic">polyadelphous,</hi> as in Luhea
                    paniculata and Ricinus communis. In some cases, especially in the Mallow tribe,
                    the stamens cohere, having been originally separate, but in most other cases
                    each bundle is produced by the branching of a single stamen. When there are
                    three stamens in a bundle we may conceive the lateral ones as of a stipulary
                    nature. In Lauraceae there are perfect stamens, each having at the base of the
                    filament two abortive stamens or staminodes, which may be analogous to stipules.
                    Filaments sometimes are adherent to the pistil, forming a <hi rend="italic"
                    >columna</hi> or column, as in Stylidium, Asclepiadaceae, Rafflesia,
                    Orchidaceae, and Aristolochiaceae (fig. 217). The column is called <hi
                    rend="italic">gynostemium,,</hi> and the flowers are denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">gynandrous.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">anther</hi> consists of lobes containing minute powdery
                    matter, called <hi rend="italic">pollen,</hi> which, when mature, is discharged
                    by a fissure or opening of some sort. The anther-lobes are considered by some as
                    formed by the two halves of the lamina, their back corresponding to the under
                    surface, and their face to the upper surface, united by the midrib, the pollen
                    being the cellular tissue, and the fissure of the anther taking place at the
                    margin, which, however, is often turned towards the face. In this view, the two
                    cavities which are found to exist in each lobe may correspond with the upper and
                    under layer of cells, separated by a septum equivalent to the fibro-vascular
                    layer of the leaf. Others view the anther as formed by each half of the lamina
                    being folded upon itself, so that the outer surface of both face and back
                    corresponds to the lower side of the leaf, and the septum dividing each cavity
                    into two is formed by the united upper surfaces of the folded half. Again,
                    others hold that the connective represents the lamina of the leaf to which the
                    anther lobes are mere appendages. There is a double covering of the anther—the
                    outer, or <hi rend="italic">exothecium,</hi> resembles the epidermis, and often
                    presents stomata and projections of different kinds (fig. 219); the inner, or
                    <hi rend="italic">endothecium,</hi> is formed by a layer or layers of cellular
                    tissue (fig. 219, <hi rend="italic">cf),</hi> the cells of which have a spiral,
                    annular, or reticulated fibre in their interior. This internal lining varies in
                    thickness, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n146/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0146-0137"/> generally becoming thinner towards the part where
                    the anther opens, and there disappears entirely. The walls of the cells are
                    frequently absorbed, so that when the anther attains maturity the fibres are
                    alone left, and these by their elasticity assist in discharging the pollen. The
                    anther is developed before the filament, and is always sessile in the first
                    instance, and sometimes continues so. It appears at first as a simple cellular
                    papilla of meristem, upon which an indication of two lobes soon appears. Upon
                    these projections the rudiments of the pollen-sacs are then seen, usually four
                    in number, two on each lobe. In each a differentiation takes place in the layers
                    beneath the epidermis, by which an outer layer of small-celled tissue surrounds
                    an inner portion of large cells. Those central cells are the mothercells of the
                    pollen, whilst the small-celled layer of tissue external to them becomes the
                    endothecium, the exothecium being formed from the epidermal layer.</p>
                <p>In the young state there are usually four pollen-sacs or cavities produced, two
                    for each anther-lobe, and when these remain permanently complete, it is a <hi
                    rend="italic">quadrilocular</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tetrathecal</hi> anther
                    (fig. 220). The four cavities are sometimes placed in apposition, as in
                    Poranthera, and Tetratheca juncea, and at other times two are placed above and
                    two below, as in Persea gratissima. Sometimes, however, only two cavities remain
                    in the anther, by union of the sacs in each lobe, in which case the anther is
                    said to be <hi rend="italic">bilocular</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dithecal.</hi>
                    Sometimes the anther has a single cavity, and becomes <hi rend="italic"
                    >unilocular,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">monothecal,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >dimidiate,</hi> either by the disappearance of the partition between the two
                    lobes, or by the abortion of one of its lobes, as in Styphelia laeta and Althaea
                    officinalis. Occasionally there are numerous cavities in the anther, as in
                    Viscum and Rafflesia. The form of the anther-lobes varies. They are generally of
                    a more or less oval or elliptical form, or they may be globular, as in
                    Mercurialis annua; at other times linear or clavate, curved, flexuose, or
                    sinuose or <hi rend="italic">anfractuose,</hi> as in Bryony and Gourd. According
                    to the amount of union of the lobes and the unequal development of different
                    parts of their surface an infinite variety of forms are produced. That part of
                    the anther to which the filament is attached, and which is generally towards the
                    petals, is the <hi rend="italic">back,</hi> the opposite being the <hi
                    rend="italic">face.</hi> The division between the lobes is marked on the face of
                    the anther by a groove or <hi rend="italic">furrow,</hi> and there is usually on
                    the face a <hi rend="italic">suture,</hi> indicating the line where the
                    membranous coverings open to discharge the pollen. The suture is often towards
                    one side in consequence of the valves being unequal. The stamens may cohere by
                    their anthers, and become <hi rend="italic">syngenesious</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">synantherous,</hi> as in Composite flowers, and in Lobelia, J
                    asione, Viola, Ac.</p>
                <p>The anther-lobes are united to the <hi rend="italic">connective,</hi> which may
                    be either continuous with the filament or articulated with it. It consists of
                    parenchyma, in which the spiral vessels of the filament terminate. From the
                    connective a partition or <hi rend="italic">septum</hi> extends across each
                    antherine loculus, dividing it either partially or completely. The septum
                    sometimes reaches the suture When the filament is continuous with the
                    connective, and is prolonged so that the anther-lobes appear tobe united to it
                    throughout their whole length, and lie in apposition to it and on both sides of
                    it, the anther is said to be <hi rend="italic">adnate</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >adherent;</hi> when the filament ends at the base of the anther, then the
                    latter is <hi rend="italic">innate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">erect.</hi> In
                    these cases the anther is to a greater or less degree fixed. When, however, the
                    attachment is very narrow, and an articulation exists, the anthers are movable,
                    and are easily turned by the wind. This is well seen in what are called <hi
                    rend="italic">versatile</hi> anthers, as in Tritonia, Grasses, &amp;c. (fig.
                    212), where the filament is attached only to the middle of the connective; and
                    it may occur also in cases where it is attached to the apex, as in pendulous
                    anthers. The connective may unite tħe ant∩er-lobes completely, or only
                    partially. It is sometimes very short, and is reduced to a mere point, so that
                    the lobes are separate or free. At other times it is prolonged upwards beyond
                    the lobes, assuming various forms, as in Acalypha, and Nerium Oleander; or it is
                    extended backwards and downwards, as in Violet (fig. 221), and Ticorea
                    febrifuga. In Salvia officinalis the connective is attached to the filament in a
                    horizontal manner, so as to separate the two anther-lobes, and then it is called
                    <hi rend="italic">distractile</hi> (fig. 222); one of the lobes only being
                    perfect or fertile, containing pollen, the other imperfectly developed and
                    sterile. In Stachys the connective is expanded laterally, so as to unite the
                    bases of the antherine lobes, and bring them into a horizontal line.</p>
                <p>The opening of the anthers to discharge their contents is denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">dehiscence.</hi> This takes place either by clefts, by hinges, or
                    by pores. When the anther-lobes are erect, the cleft takes place lengthwise
                    along the line of the suture, constituting <hi rend="italic">longitudinal
                    dehiscence</hi> (fig. 175). At other times the slit takes place in a horizontal
                    manner, from the connective to the side, as in Alchemilla arvensis (fig. 223)
                    and in Lemna; the dehiscence is then <hi rend="italic">transverse.</hi> When the
                    anther-lobes are rendered horizontal by the enlargement of the connective, then
                    what is really longitudinal dehiscence may appear to be transverse. In other
                    cases, when the lobes are united at the base, the fissure in each of them may be
                    continuous, and the two lobes may appear as one. The cleft does not always
                    proceed the whole length of the anther-lobe at once, but often for a time it
                    extends only partially. In other instances the opening is confined to the base
                    or apex, each loculament opening by a single pore, as in Pyrola, Tetratheca
                    juncea, Rhododendron, Vaccinium, and Solanum (fig. 224), where there are two,
                    and Poranthera, where there are four; whilst in the Mistleto the anther has
                    numerous pores for the discharge of the pollen. Another mode of dehiscence is
                    called <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n147/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0147-0138"/><hi rend="italic">hinged.</hi> In the Barberry
                    (fig. 225) each lobe opens by a valve on the outer side of the suture,
                    separately rolling up from base to apex; in some of the Laurel tribe there are
                    two such valves for each lobe, or four in all. This may be called a combination
                    of transverse and hinged dehiscence. In some Guttiferae, as Hebradendron
                    cambogioides (the Ceylon Gamboge plant), the anther opens by a lid separating
                    from the apex; this is called <hi rend="italic">circumscissile</hi>
                    dehiscence.</p>
                <p>The anthers dehisce at different periods during the process of flowering;
                    sometimes in the bud, but more commonly when the pistil is fully developed, and
                    the flower is expanded. They either dehisce simultaneously or in succession. In
                    the latter case individual stamens may move in succession towards the pistil and
                    discharge their contents, as in Parnassia palustris, or the outer or the inner
                    stamens may first dehisce, following thus a centripetal or centrifugal order.
                    The anthers are called <hi rend="italic">introrse</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >anticoe,</hi> when they dehisce by the surface next to the centre of the
                    flower; they are <hi rend="italic">extrorse,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >posticce,</hi> when they dehisce by the outer surface; when they dehisce by the
                    sides, as in. Iris and some grasses, they are <hi rend="italic">laterally</hi>
                    dehiscent. Sometimes, from their versatile nature, anthers originally introrse
                    become extrorse, as in the Passionflower and Oxalis.</p>
                <p>The usual colour of anthers is yellow, but they present a great variety in this
                    respect. They are red in the Peach, dark purple in the Poppy and Tulip, orange
                    in Eschscholtzia, &lt;fcc. The colour and appearance of the anthers often change
                    after they have discharged their functions.</p>
                <p>Stamens occasionally become sterile by the degeneration or non-development of the
                    anthers. Such stamens receive the name of <hi rend="italic">staminodia,</hi> or
                    rudimentary stamens. In Scrophularia the fifth stamen appears in the form of a
                    scale; and in many Pentstemons it is reduced to a filament with hairs or a
                    shrivelled membrane at the apex. In other cases, as in double flowers, the
                    stamens are converted into petals; this is also probably the case with such
                    plants as Mesembryanthemum, where there is a multiplication of petals in several
                    rows. Sometimes, as in Ganna, one of the anther-lobes becomes abortive, and a
                    petaloid appendage is produced. Stamens vary in length as regards the corolla.
                    Some are enclosed within the tube of the flower, as in Cinchona, and are called
                    <hi rend="italic">included;</hi> others are <hi rend="italic">exserted,</hi> or
                    extend beyond the flower, as in Littorella, Plantago, and Exostemma. Sometimes
                    the stamens in the early state of the flower project beyond the petals, and in
                    the progress of growth become included, as in Geranium striatum. Stamens also
                    vary in their relative lengths as respects each other. When there is more than
                    one row or whorl in a flower, those on the outside are sometimes longest, as in
                    many Rosaceae; at other times those in the interior are longest, as in Luhea.
                    When the stamens are in two rows, those opposite the petals are usually shorter
                    than those which alternate with the petals. It sometimes happens that a single
                    stamen is longer than all the rest. A definite relation, as regards number,
                    sometimes exists between the long and the short stamens. Thus, in some flowers
                    the stamens are <hi rend="italic">didynamous,</hi> having only four out of five
                    stamens developed, and the two corresponding to the upper part of the flower
                    longer than the two lateral ones. This occurs in Labiatae and Scrophulariaceae
                    (fig. 226). Again; in other cases, there are six stamens, whereof four long ones
                    are arranged in pairs opposite to each other, and alternate with two isolated
                    short ones (fig. 227), giving rise to <hi rend="italic">tetradynamous</hi>
                    flowers, as in Cruciferae. Stamens, as regards their direction, may be erect,
                    turned inwards, outwards, or to one side. In the last-mentioned case they are
                    called <hi rend="italic">declinate,</hi> as in Amaryllis, Horse-chestnut, and
                    Fraxinella.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pollen</hi> or powdery matter contained in the anther
                    consists of small cells developed in the interior of other cells. These are
                    produced in the large thick-walled mother cells or pollen utricles, formed in
                    the interior of the pollen-sacs of the young anther. These mother-cells are
                    either separated from one another and float in the granular fluid which fills up
                    the cavity of the pollen-sac, or are not so isolated. A division takes place, by
                    which four cells are formed in each, the exact mode of division differing in
                    Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons. These cells are the pollen-cells or grains.
                    They increase in size and acquire a cell-wall, which becomes differentiated into
                    an outer, cuticular layer, or <hi rend="italic">extine,</hi> and an inner layer,
                    or <hi rend="italic">intine.</hi> Then the walls of the mother-cells are
                    absorbed, and the pollen-grains float freely in the fluid of the pollen-sacs,
                    which gradually disappears, and the mature grains form a powdery mass within the
                    anther. They then either remain united in fours, or multiples of four, as in
                    some Acacias, Periploca graeca, and Inga anomala, or separate into individual
                    grains, which by degrees become mature pollen. Occasionally the membrane of the
                    pollen-cell is not completely absorbed, and traces of it are detected in a
                    viscous matter surrounding the pollen-grains, as in Onagraceae. In Orchidaceous
                    plants the pollen-grains are united into masses, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pollinia</hi> (fig. 228), by means of viscid matter.</p>
                <p>In Orchids each of the pollen-masses has a prolongation or stalk, called a <hi
                    rend="italic">caudicle,</hi> which adheres to a prolongation at the base of the
                    anther, called <hi rend="italic">rostellum,</hi> by means of a viscous gland,
                    called <hi rend="italic">retinaculum.</hi> The gland is either naked or covered.
                    The term <hi rend="italic">clinandrium</hi> is sometimes applied to the part of
                    the column in Orchids where the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n148/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0148-0139"/> stamens are situated. In some Orchids, as
                    Cypripedium, the pollen has its ordinary character of separate grains. The
                    number of pollinia varies; thus, in Orchis there are usually two, in Cattleya
                    four, and in Laelia eight. The two pollinia in Orchis Morio contain each about
                    200 secondary smaller massée. These small masses, when bruised, divide into
                    grains which are united in fours. In Asclepiadaceae the pollinia are usually
                    united in pairs (fig. 229), belonging to two contiguous antherine cavities,—
                    each pollen-mass having a caudicular appendage, ending in a common gland, by
                    means of which they are attached to a process of the stigma. The pollinia are
                    also provided with an appendicular staminal covering (fig. 230).</p>
                <p>When mature, the pollen-grain is a cellular body having an external covering, <hi
                    rend="italic">extine,</hi> and an internal, <hi rend="italic">intine.</hi>
                    Fritzsche states that he has detected, in some cases, other two coverings, which
                    he calls <hi rend="italic">intextine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">exintine.</hi>
                    They occur between the extine and intine, and are probably formed by foldings of
                    these membranes. In some aquatics, as Zostera marina, Zannichellia pedunculata,
                    Naias minor, &lt;fcc., only one covering exists, and that is said to be the
                    intine. The extine is a firm membrane, which defines the figure of the
                    pollen-grain, and gives colour to it. It is either smooth, or covered with
                    numerous projections (fig. 231), granules, points, minute hairs, or crested
                    reticulations. The colour is generally yellow, and the surface is often covered
                    with a viscid or oily matter. The intine is uniform in different kinds of
                    pollen, thin and transparent, and possesses great power of extension.</p>
                <p>Pollen-grains vary from <hi rend="subscript"> 7r</hi> ⅜θ∙ to <hi rend="subscript"
                    > τ</hi> ⅜θ of an inch or less in diameter. Their forms are various. The most
                    common form of grain is ellipsoidal, more or less narrow at the extremities,
                    which are called its <hi rend="italic">poles,</hi> in contradistinction to a
                    line equidistant from the extremities, and which is its equator. Pollen-grains
                    are also spherical; cylindrical and curved, as in Tradescantia virginica;
                    polyhedral in Dipsacaceae and Compositae: nearly triangular in Proteaceae and
                    Onagraceae (fig. 232). The surface of the pollen-grain is either uniform and
                    homogeneous, or it is marked by folds dipping in towards the centre, and formed
                    by thinnings of the membrane. In Monocotyledonous plants there is usually a
                    single fold; in Dicotyledons, often three. Two, four, six, and even twelve folds
                    are also met with. There are also rounded portions of the membrane or points of
                    perforation or pores visible in the pollen-grain. These vary in number from one
                    to fifty. In Monocotyledons, as in Grasses, there is often only one, while in
                    Dicotyledons they number from three upwards. When numerous, these points are
                    either scattered irregularly, or in a regular order, frequently forming a circle
                    round the equatorial surface. Sometimes at the place where they exist, the outer
                    membrane, in place of being thin and transparent, is separated in the form of a
                    lid, thus becoming <hi rend="italic">operculate,</hi> as in the Passion-flower
                    and Gourd. Grains of pollen have sometimes both folds and pores. Within the
                    pollengrain a granular semifluid matter called <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ovilla</hi> is contained, along with some oily particles, and
                    occasionally starch. The fovilla contains small spherical granules, sometimes
                    the <hi rend="strikethrough">¾¾o</hi><hi rend="subscript
                    strikethrough"> go</hi><hi rend="strikethrough">∙</hi> of an inch in diameter,
                    and large ellipsoidal or elongated corpuscles, which exhibit molecular movements
                    under the microscope. The application of moisture affects very markedly the
                    pollen-grain, causing it to swell up by endosmose. If the moisture be long
                    applied the distension becomes so great as to rupture the extine irregularly if
                    it is homogeneous, or to cause projections and final rupture at the folds or
                    pores when they exist. The intine, from its distensibility, is not so liable to
                    rupture; it is often forced through the ruptured extine, or through the pores,
                    in the form of small sac-like projections. The internal membrane ultimately
                    -gives way, and allows the granular fovilla to escape (fig. 233). If the fluid
                    is applied only to one side of the pollen-grain, as when the pollen is applied
                    to the pistil, the distension goes on more slowly, and the intine is prolonged
                    outwards like a hernia, and forms an elongated tube called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >pollen-tube</hi> (fig. 232). This tube, at its base, is often covered by the
                    ruptured extine, and it contains in its interior fovilla-granules. The number of
                    pollen-tubes which may be produced depends on the number of pores. In some
                    pollinia the number of tubes which are formed is enormous. Thus, it has been
                    calculated that two pollenmasses of Orchis Morio may give out 120,000 tubes.</p>
                <p>When the pollen-grains are ripe, the anther dehisces (figs. 175,223), and the
                    pollen is shed. In order that fertilization may be effected the pollen must be
                    conveyed to the female organ of reproduction. This process, termed <hi
                    rend="italic">pollination,</hi> is promoted in various ways,—the whole form and
                    structure of the flower having relation to the process. In some plants, as
                    Kalmia and Pellitory (fig. 234), the mere elasticity of the filaments is
                    sufficient to effect this; in other plants pollination is effected by the wind,
                    as in Coniferae, and in such cases enormous quantities of pollen are produced.
                    These plants are <hi rend="italic">anemophilous.</hi> But the common agents for
                    pollination are insects. To allure and attract them to visit the flower the
                    odoriferous secretions and gay colours are developed, and the position and
                    complicated structure of the parts of the flower are adapted to the perfect
                    performance of the process. It is rare in hermaphrodite flowers for
                    self-fertilization to occur, and the various forms of dichogamy, dimorphism, and
                    trimorphism are fitted to prevent this.</p>
                <p>Under the term <hi rend="italic">dish</hi> is included every structure
                    intervening between the stamens and the pistil. It was to such structures that
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">nectary</hi> was applied by old authors. It
                    presents great varieties of form, such as a ring, scales, glands, hairs,
                    petaloid appendages, &amp;c., and in the progress of growth it often contains
                    saccharine matter, thus becoming truly nectariferous. The disk is frequently
                    formed by degeneration or transformation of the staminal row. It may consist of
                    processes rising from the torus, alternating with the stamens, and thus
                    representing an abortive whorl; or its parts may be opposito<pb break="no"

                    In some flowers, as Jatropha Curcas, in which the stamens are not developed,
                    their place is occupied by glandular bodies forming the disk. In Gesneraceae and
                    Cruciferae the disk consists of tooth-like scales at the base of the stamens
                    (fig. 227). The parts composing the disk sometimes unite and form a glandular
                    ring, as in the Orange; or they form a dark-red lamina covering the pistil, as
                    in Paeonia Moutan (fig. 235); <hi rend="italic">or</hi> a waxy lining of the
                    calyx tube or hollow receptacle, as iu the Bose; or a swelling at the top of the
                    ovary, as in Umbelliferιe, in which the disk is said to be epigynous. The
                    enlarged t0ru3</p>
                <p>covering the ovary in Nymphaea and Nelumbium may be regarded as a form of

                <p>Sexual organs have not as yet been demonstrated in all Cryptogamie plants; but in

                    >Pollinodia</hi> (figs. 236, 250). They are closed sacs of various
                    forms,—rounded, ovate, oblong, clavate, flask-like, &lt;fcc.,—developed from
                    various parts of the plants, and composed either of one or of many cells
                    enclosing a single central cell. In the interior of this organ small cells (fig.
                    236, c) are formed of varying shape, containing in their interior peculiar
                    bodies, termed <hi rend="italic">antherozoids,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >spermatozoïde,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">phytozoa</hi> (fig. 237). These are in
                    most cases filamentous spirally coiled cells, frequently with <hi rend="italic"
                    >cilia</hi> attached, by means of which they move rapidly through the water. In
                    some cases there are no cilia, as in the Λlgal group of Floridese; and the
                    autherozoids of all Algae differ from those of other Cryptogams in never being
                    filamentous, but short and more or less rounded. The amount of twisting of the
                    antherozoid varies; in some Rhizocarps there are as many as a dozen coils.
                    Antheridia of this kind have been demonstrated in all vascular Cryptogams, but
                    only iu some Thallogens have such structures been seen.</p>
                <p>In Characeae, however, the antheridium, which is here termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >globule</hi> (fig. 240), has a peculiar structure, differing from all other
                    Cryptogams. It is a globular case, formed by eight flat cells, of which four are
                    quadrangular aud four are triangular; and these are folded at the margins so
                    that the edges of contiguous plates dovetail (fig. 241). These are termed <hi
                    rend="italic">shields.</hi> Into the cavity of the globule the terminal cell of
                    the stalk supporting it projects. From the centre of each shield projects on the
                    inner surface a large oblong cell or <hi rend="italic">manubrium,</hi> which in
                    turn bears at its apex a roundish cell termed the <hi rend="italic">head.</hi>
                    From each head-cell six secondary head-cells project, from each of which pass
                    off four slender separate filaments (fig. 242) containing antherozoids.</p>
                <p>When mature the antheridium is ruptured, and the mother-cells of the antherozoid
                    escape and discharge the antherozoids into the surrounding medium which is
                    always water—fertilization only being effected in water, by which the
                    antherozoids are carried to the female organ. In some cases, however, among
                    Thallogens the antheridium actually penetrates into the female organ.</p>
                <p>Antheridia are produced on various parts of plants. Where they have been found
                    amongst Thallogens, they arise from definite portions of the cellular thallus.
                    In thalloid Hepaticae they may be sunk in the substance of the thallus, or they
                    may be imbedded in the upper surface of a peltate stalked disk rising from the
                    thallus, as in Marchantia (figs. 243,244). In Mosses they may be seated within
                    the same whorl of leaves or perichaetium as the female organs, or they may be
                    separate and surrounded by a <hi rend="italic">perigone;</hi> but they are
                    always formed upon the leaf-bearing axis, either terminal or lateral. In Ferns
                    and Equisetum they are produced on the surface—usually the lower surface—of a
                    cellular flattened expansion, termed a <hi rend="italic">prothallus</hi> (figs.
                    245, 250), in close proximity to the female organs. In Characeae they always
                    arise from the termination of one of the whorled leaflets.</p>
                <p>In some Lycopodiaceae no antheridia have as yet been found; but in Selaginella,
                    Isoetes, and in the Rhizocarpeae, hollow sacs, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >microsporangia</hi> (figs. 246, 248), are produced in the axil of certain
                    leaves of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n150/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0150-0141"/> plant, in which small cells, <hi rend="italic"
                    >microspores</hi> (fig. 249), are found, each consisting of an outer covering or
                    <hi rend="italic">exospore,</hi> and an inner or <hi rend="italic"
                    >endospore.</hi> Within those microspores (the manner varying iu different
                    genera) smaller cells are formed, which are the mother-cells of the
                    antherozoids. In this development of Lycopodiaceae we have parts which are
                    analogous to those of the stamens in Phanerogams. The microsporangium evidently
                    corresponds to the pollen-sac, and the microspores are the equivalents of the
                    pollengrains,—the forms seen in such Gymnosperms as Cycadaceae being the link
                    connecting them with the highest forms.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Female Organs in Phanerogams.</hi></p>
                <p>The pistil or <hi rend="italic">gynoecium</hi> occupies the centre or axis of the
                    flower, and is surrounded by the stamens and floral envelopes when these are
                    present. It constitutes the innermost whorl, and is the female organ of the
                    plant, which after flowering is changed into the fruit, and contains the seeds.
                    It consists essentially of two parts, a basal portion forming a chamber, the <hi
                    rend="italic">ovary</hi> or <hi rend="italic">germen,</hi> containing ovules or
                    young seeds attached to a part called the <hi rend="italic">placenta,</hi> and
                    an upper portiou, the <hi rend="italic">stigma,</hi> a cellular secreting body,
                    which is either seated on the ovary, and is then called <hi rend="italic"
                    >sessile,</hi> as in the Tulip and Poppy, or is elevated on a stalk called the
                    <hi rend="italic">style,</hi> interposed between the ovary and stigma. The style
                    is not necessary for the perfection of the pistil. Like the other organs, the
                    pistil consists of one or more modified leaves, which in this instance are
                    called <hi rend="italic">carpels.</hi> When a pistil consists of a single carpel
                    it is <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> or monocarpellary (fig. 253), a state
                    usually depending on the nondevelopment of other carpels. When it is composed of
                    several carpels, more or less united, it is <hi rend="italic">compound</hi> or
                    polycarpellary. In the first-mentioned case the terms carpel and pistil are
                    synonymous. Each carpel has its own ovary, style (when present), and stigma, and
                    is formed by a folded leaf, the upper surface of which is turned inwards towards
                    the axis, and the lower outwards, while from its margins are developed one or
                    more buds called <hi rend="italic">omdes.</hi> That this is the true nature of
                    the pistil may be seen by examining the flower of the doubleflowering Cherry. In
                    it no fruit is produced, and the pistil consists of sessile leaves (fig. 251),
                    the limb of each being green and folded, with a narrow prolongation upwards, as
                    if from the midrib, and ending in a thickened portion. The ovary then represents
                    the limb or lamina of the leaf, and is composed of cellular tissue with
                    fibro-vascular bundles, and an epidermal covering. The cellular tissue, or
                    parenchyma, often becomes much developed, as will be seen particularly when
                    fleshy fruits are considered. The outer epidermis corresponds to the lower side
                    of the leaf, exhibiting stomata, and sometimes hairs; the inner surface
                    represents the upper side of the leaf, being usually very delicate and pale, and
                    forming a layer called sometimes <hi rend="italic">epithelium,</hi> which does
                    not exhibit stomata. The vascular bundles correspond with the veins of the leaf,
                    and consist of spiral, annular, and other vessels. Iu Cycas the carpels are
                    ordinary leaves, with ovules upon their margin.</p>
                <p>A pistil is usually formed by more than one carpel. The carpels may be arranged
                    like leaves, either at the same or nearly the same height in a verticil, or at
                    different heights in a spiral cycle. When they remain separate and distinct,
                    thus showing at once the composition of the pistil, as in Caltha, Ranunculus,
                    Hellebore, and Spiraea (fig. 252), the term <hi rend="italic">apocarpous</hi> is
                    applied. Thus, in Crassula rubens (fig. 172) the pistil consists of five
                    verticillate carpels <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> alternating with the stamens <hi
                    rend="italic">e.</hi> In the Tulip-tree and Ranunculus (fig. 254) the separate
                    carpels are numerous and are arranged in a spiral cycle upon an elongated axis
                    or receptacle. In the Raspberry the carpels are on a conical <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n151/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0151-0142"/> receptacle; in the Strawberry, on a swollen
                    succulent one (fig. 154); and in the Rose (fig. 155), on a hollow one. When the
                    fruit consists of several rows of carpels, the innermost have their margins
                    directed to the centre, while the margins of the outer rows are arranged on the
                    back of the inner ones. When the carpels are united, as in the Pear, Arbutus,
                    and Chickweed, the pistil becomes <hi rend="italic">syncarpous.</hi> The number
                    of carpels in an apocarpous pistil, or the number of separate styles in a
                    syncarpous one, is indicated in the following way :—</p>

                <p>The union in a syncarpous pistil is not always complete; it may take place by the
                    ovaries alone, while the styles and stigmata remain free, the pistil being then
                    <hi rend="italic">gamogastrous</hi> (fig. 255), and in this case, when the
                    ovaries form apparently a single body, the organ receives the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">compound</hi> ovary; or the union may take place by the ovaries
                    and styles, while the stigmata are disunited; or by the stigmata and the summit
                    of the style only. Various intermediate states exist, such as partial union of
                    the ovaries, a3 in the Rue, where they coalesce at their base; and partial union
                    of the styles, as in Malvaceae. The union is usually most complete at the base;
                    but in Labiatae the styles are united throughout their length, and in
                    Apocynaceae and Asclepiadaceae the stigmata only. When the union is incomplete,
                    the number of the parts of a compound pistil may be determined by the number of
                    styles and stigmata; when complete, the external venation, the grooves on the
                    surface, and the internal divisions of the ovary, indicate the number. The
                    changes which take place in the pistil by adhesion, degeneration, and abortion,
                    are frequently so great as to obscure its composition, and to lead to
                    anomalies.</p>
                <p>Ιhe pistil is more liable to changes of this kind than any other part of the
                    flower. The carpels are usually sessile leaves, but sometimes they are
                    petiolate, and then are elevated above the external whorls. This elevation of
                    the pistil may in general, however, be traced to an elongation of the axis
                    itself, in such a way that the carpels, in place of being dispersed over it,
                    arise only from its summit, and the pistil becomes <hi rend="italic"
                    >stipitate,</hi> or supported on a stalk called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >gynophore</hi> or <hi rend="italic">thecapkore,</hi> as in the Passion-flower
                    and Dictamnus (fig. 177). Sometimes the axis is produced beyond the ovaries, and
                    the styles become united to it, as in Geraniaceae (fig. 152) and Umbelliferae.
                    In this case the prolongation is called a <hi rend="italic">carpophore.</hi> A ]
                    monstrosity often occurs in the Rose (fig. 145) by which the axis is prolonged,
                    and bears the carpels <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in the form of alternate
                    leaves.</p>
                <p>The ovary contains the ovules. These are attached to ' the <hi rend="italic"
                    >placenta.</hi> This, sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">trophosperm,</hi> J
                    consists of a mass of cellular tissue, through which the vessels pass to the
                    ovule. The placenta is usually formed on the edges of the carpellary leaf (fig.
                    256), and is then said to be of the <hi rend="italic">marginal</hi> type. In
                    many cases, however, the placentas are formations from the axis, and are not
                    connected with the carpellary leaves; they are then said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >axi,le.</hi> Some restrict the term placenta to the point of attachment of a
                    single ovule, and call the union of placentas, bearing several ovules, <hi
                    rend="italic">placentaries</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pistillary cords.</hi> In
                    marginal placentation the part of the carpel bearing the placenta is the <hi
                    rend="italic">inner</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ventral</hi><hi rend="italic">su
                    faire,</hi> corresponding to the margin of the folded carpellary leaf, while the
                    <hi rend="italic">outer</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dorsal suture</hi> corresponds
                    to the midrib of the carpellary leaf. As the placenta is formed on each margin
                    of the carpel it is essentially double. This is seen in cases where the margins
                    of the carpel do not unite, but remain separate, and consequently two placentas
                    are formed in place of one. When the pistil is formed by one carpel the inner
                    margins unite in the axis, and form usually a common marginal placenta. This
                    placenta may extend along the whole margin of the ovary as far as the base of
                    the style (fig. 256), or it may be confined to the base or apex only. When the
                    pistil is composed of several separate carpels, or, in other words, is
                    apocarpous, there are generally separate placentas at each of their margins. In
                    a syncarpous pistil, on the other hand, the carpels are so united that the edges
                    of each of the contiguous ones, by their union, form a <hi rend="italic"
                    >septum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dissepiment,</hi> and the number of these
                    septa consequently indicates the number of carpels in the compound pistil (fig.
                    257) It is obvious then that each dissepiment is formed by a double wall or two
                    laminae; that the presence of a septum implies the presence of more than one
                    carpel; and that, when carpels are placed side by side, true dissepiments must
                    be vertical, and not horizontal. When the dissepiments extend to the centre or
                    axis, the ovary is <pb break="no"

                    >cells,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">loculaments,</hi> and it may be <hi
                    rend="italic">bilocular, trilocular</hi> (fig. 257), <hi rend="italic"
                    >quadrilocular, quinquelocular,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">multiloσular,</hi>
                    according as it is formed by two, three, four, five, or many carpels, each
                    carpel corresponding to a single cell or loculament. In these cases the marginal
                    placentas meet in the axis, and unite so as to form a single <hi rend="italic"
                    >central</hi> one (figs. 257, 258), and the ovules appear in the central angle
                    of the loculi, as in Canna, Lily (fig. 257). The number of loculaments is equal
                    to that of the dissepiments. When the carpels in a syncarpous pistil do not fold
                    iuwards completely so as to meet in the centre, but only partially, so that the
                    dissepiments appear as projections on the walls of the ovary, then the ovary is
                    <hi rend="italic">unilocular</hi> (fig. 260), and the placentas are <hi
                    rend="italic">parietal,</hi> as in Viola (fig. 261). In these instances the
                    placentas may be formed at the margin of the united contiguous leaves, so as to
                    appear single, or the margins may not be united, each developing a placenta.
                    Frequently the margins of the carpels, which fold in to the centre, split there
                    into two lamellae, each of which is curved outwards and projects into the
                    loculament, dilating at the end into a placenta. This is well seen in
                    Cucurbitaceae (fig. 262), Pyrola, &amp;c. From this it will be seen that
                    dissepiments are opposite to placentas formed by the union of the margins of two
                    contiguous carpels, but alternate with those formed by the margins of the same
                    carpel. The carpellary leaves may fold inwards very slightly, or they may be
                    applied in a valvate manner, merely touching at their margins, the placentas
                    then being parietal (fig. 259), and appearing as lines or thickenings along the
                    walls. Cases occur, however, in which the placentas are not connected with the
                    walls of the ovary, and form what is called a/ree <hi rend="italic">central
                    placenta</hi> (fig. 263).’</p>
                <p>This is seen in many of the Caryophyllaceae and Primulaceae (figs. 264, 265). In
                    Caryophyllaceae, however, while the placenta is free in the centre, there are
                    often traces found at the base of the ovary of the remains of septa, as if
                    rupture had taken place, and, in rare instances, ovules are found on the margins
                    of the carpels. But in Primulaceae, Myrsinaceae, and Santalaceae, no vestiges of
                    septa or marginal ovules can be perceived at any period of growth; the placenta
                    is always free, and rises in the centre of the ovary, and the part uncovered by
                    ovules gradually extends into the style. Free central placentation, therefore,
                    has been accounted for in two ways; either by supposing that the placentas in
                    the early state were formed on the margins of carpellary leaves, and that in the
                    progress of development these leaves separated from them, leaving the placentas
                    and ovules free in the centre; or by supposing that the placentas are not <hi
                    rend="italic">marginal</hi> but <hi rend="italic">axile</hi> formations,
                    produced by an elongation of the axis, the ovules being lateral buds, and the
                    carpels verticillate leaves, united together around the axis. The first of these
                    views would apply well to Caryophyllaceae, the second to Primulaceae. The latter
                    case has also been explained, on the marginal hypothesis, by considering the
                    placentas as formed from the carpels by a process of chorisis, and united
                    together in the centre.</p>
                <p>Some consider the axile view of placentation as applicable to all cases, the axis
                    in some· instances remaining free and independent, at other times sending
                    prolongations along the margins of the car ellary leaves, and thus forming the
                    marginal placentas. Occasionally, divisions take place in ovaries which are not
                    formed by the edges of contiguous carpels. These are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >spmrious dissepiments.</hi> They are often horizontal, and are then called <hi
                    rend="italic">phragmata,</hi> as in Cathartocarpus Fistula, where they consist
                    of transverse cellular prolongations from the walls of the ovary, only developed
                    after fertilization, and therefore more properly noticed under fruit. At other
                    times they are vertical, as in Datura, where the ovary, in place of being
                    two-celled, becomes four-celled; in Cruciferae, where the prolongation of the
                    placentas forms a <hi rend="italic">replum</hi> or partition; in Astragalus and
                    Thespesia, where the dorsal suture is folded inwards; in Oxytropis, where the
                    ventral suture is folded inwards; and in Diplophractum, where the inner margin
                    of the carpels is inflexed. In Cucurbitaceae divisions are formed in the ovary
                    apparently by peculiar projections inwards from curved parietal placentas. In
                    some cases horizontal dissepiments are supposed to be formed by the union of
                    carpels situated at different heights, so that the base of one becomes united to
                    the apex of another. In such cases the divisions are true dissepiments formed by
                    carpellary leaves. The anomalous divisions in the ovary of the Pomegranate have
                    been thus explained.</p>
                <p>The ovary is usually of a more or less spherical or curved form, sometimes smooth
                    and uniform on its surface, at other times hairy and grooved. The grooves
                    usually indicate tho divisions between the caιpels, and correspond to the
                    dissepiments. The dorsal suture may be marked by a slight projection, or by a
                    superficial groove. When the ovary is situated on the centre of the receptacle,
                    free from the other whorls, so that its base is above the insertion of the
                    stamens, it is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n153/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0153-0144"/> termed <hi rend="italic">superior,</hi> as in
                    Lychnis, Primula, and Geranium (fig. 215). When the margin of the receptacle is
                    prolonged upwards, carrying with it the floral envelopes and staminal leaves,
                    the basal portion of the ovary being formed by the receptacle, and the
                    carpellary leaves alone closing in the apex, the ovary is <hi rend="italic"
                    >inferior,</hi> as in Pomegranate, Apple, Pear, Gooseberry, and Fuchsia. In some
                    plants, as many Saxifragaceae, there are intermediate forms, in which the term
                    <hi rend="italic">half-inferior</hi> is applied to the ovary, whilst the floral
                    whorls are <hi rend="italic">half-superior.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">style</hi> proceeds from the summit of the carpel, and may
                    be looked upon as a prolongation of it in an upward direction (fig. 2G7). It is
                    hence called <hi rend="italic">apicilar.</hi> It consists not merely of the
                    midrib but of the vascular and cellular tissue of the carpel, and when carefully
                    examined is found to be traversed by a narrow canal, in which there are some
                    loose projecting cells, a continuation of the placenta, constituting what is
                    called conducting tissue, which ends in the stigma. This is particularly
                    abundant when the pistil is ready for fertilization. In some cases, owing to
                    more rapid growth of the dorsal side of the ovary, the style becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">lateral</hi> (fig. 266); this may so increase that the style
                    appears to arise from near the base, as in the Strawberry, or from the base, as
                    in Chrysobalanus Icaco, when it is called <hi rend="italic">basilaι.</hi> In all
                    these cases the style still indicates the organic apex of the ovary, although it
                    may not be the apparent apex. When in a compound pistil the style of each carpel
                    is thus displaced, it appears as if the ovary were depressed in the centre, and
                    the style rising from the depression in the midst of the carpels seems to come
                    from the torus. Such a style is <hi rend="italic">gynobasic,</hi> and is well
                    seen in Boraginaceae and Ochnaceae. The form of the style is usually
                    cylindrical, more or less filiform and simple; sometimes it is grooved on one
                    side, at other times it is flat, thick, angular, compressed, and even petaloid,
                    as in Iris and Canna. In Goodeniaceae it ends in a cup like expansion, enclosing
                    the stigma. It may be smooth and covered with glands and hairs. These hairs
                    occasionally aid in the application of the pollen to the stigma; and are called
                    <hi rend="italic">collecting hairs,</hi> as in Goldfussia, in Campanula, where
                    they appear double and retractile, and also in Aster and other Compositae. These
                    hairs, during the upward development of the style, come into contact with the
                    already ripened pollen, and carry it up along with them, ready to be applied by
                    insects to the mature stigma of other flowers. In Vicia and Lobelia the hairs
                    frequently form a tuft below the stigma. The styles of a syncarpous pistil may
                    be either separate or united; when separate, they alternate with the septa. When
                    united completely, it is usual to call the style <hi rend="italic">simple</hi>
                    (fig. 267); when the union is partial, then the style is said to be 6z∕Z√, <hi
                    rend="italic">trifid, m/ultifid,</hi> according as it is two-cleft, three-cleft,
                    many-cleft; or, to speak more correctly, according to the mode and extent of the
                    union of two, three, or many styles. The style is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >bipartite, tripartite,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">multipartite,</hi> when the
                    union of two, three, or many styles only extends a short way above the apex of
                    the ovary. The style of a single carpel, or of each carpel of a compound pistil,
                    may also be divided. Each division of the tricarpellary ovary of Jatropha Curcas
                    has a <hi rend="italic">bifurcate</hi> or forked style, and the ovary of Emblica
                    officinalis has three styles, each of which is divided twice in a bifurcate
                    manner, exhibiting thus a dichotomous division. The length of the style is
                    determined by the relation which ought to subsist between the position of the
                    stigma and that of the anthers, so as to allow the proper application of the
                    pollen. In some cases the ovary passes insensibly into the style, as in
                    Digitalis, in other instances there is a marked transition from one to the
                    other. The style may remain <hi rend="italic">persistent,</hi> or it may fall
                    off after fertilization is accomplished, and thus be <hi rend="italic"
                    >deciduous.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stigma</hi> is the termination of the conducting tissue <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> of the style, and is usually in direct communication
                    with the placenta. It may, therefore, in most instances, be considered as the
                    placental portion of the carpel, prolonged upwards. In Armeria, and some other
                    plants, this connection with the placenta cannot be traced. The stigma consists
                    of loose cellular tissue, and secretes a viscid matter which detains the pollen
                    and causes it to protrude tubes. This secreting portion is, strictly speaking,
                    the true stigma, but the name is generally applied to all the divisions of the
                    style on which the stigmatic apparatus is situated. The stigma alternates with
                    the dissepiments of a syncarpous pistil, or, in other words, corresponds with
                    the back of the loculaments; but in some cases it would appear that half the
                    stigma of one carpel unites with half that of the contiguous carpel, and thus
                    the stigma is opposite the dissepiments, that is, alternates with the
                    loculaments, as in the Poppy. If the stigma is viewed as essentially a
                    prolongation of the placenta, then there is no necessary alternation between it
                    and the placenta, both being formed by the margins of carpellary leaves, which
                    in the one case are ovuliferous, in the other stigmatiferous. There is often a
                    notch on one side of a stigma (as in some Rosaceae), indicating apparently that
                    it is a double organ like the placenta. To the division of a compound stigma the
                    terms <hi rend="italic">bifid,</hi> as in Labiatae, Compositae, <hi
                    rend="italic">trifid,</hi> as in Polemonium, &amp;c., are applied, according to
                    the number of the divisions. When the divisions are large, they are called <hi
                    rend="italic">lobes,</hi> and when flattened like bands, <hi rend="italic"
                    >lamelloe</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that stigmas may be <hi rend="italic"
                    >bilobate, trilobate, bilamellar, tτilamellar,</hi> àc.</p>
                <p>It has already been stated that the divisions of the stigma mark the number of
                    carpels which are united together. A quinquefid or five-cleft stigma indicates
                    five carpels, as in Campanula, although the other parts are united. In
                    Bignoniaceae, as well as i ι Scrophulariaceae and Acanthaccae, the two-lobed or
                    bilamellar stigma indicates a bilocular ovary. Sometimes, however, as in the
                    case of the styles, the stigma of a single carpel may divide. It is probable
                    that in many instances what is called bifurcation of the style is only the
                    division of the stigma. In Gramineae and Compositae there is a bifid stigma, and
                    only one cavity in the ovary. This, however, may be probably traced to
                    subsequent abortion in the ovary of one of the carpels. Its position may be
                    terminal or lateral; either on one side of the style, <hi rend="italic"

                    on both sides, <hi rend="italic">bilateral,</hi> as in Plantago. Occasionally,
                    as in Tasmannia, it is prolonged along the inner surface of the style. In Iris
                    it is situated on a cleft on the back of the petaloid divisions of the style
                    (fig. 268). Some stigmata, as those of the Mimulus, present sensitive flattened
                    laminae, which close when touched. The stigma presents various forms. It may be
                    globular, as in Mirabilis Jalapa; orbicular, as in Arbutus Andrachne;
                    umbrella-like, as in Sarracenia, where, however, the proper stigmatic surface is
                    beneath the angles of the large expansion of the apex of the style; ovoid, as in
                    Fuchsia; hemispherical; polyhedral; radiating, as in the Poppy (fig. 269), where
                    the true stigmatic rays are attached to a sort of <hi rend="italic">peltate</hi>
                    or shield-like body, which may represent depressed or flattened styles; <hi
                    rend="italic">cucullate, i.e.,</hi> covered by a hood, in Calabar Bean, where it
                    is situated on the apex of a declinate style, bearded (hairy) on its concave
                    surface The lobes of a stigma may be flat and pointed, as in Mimulus and
                    Bignonia, fleshy and blunt, smooth or granular, or they may be feathery, as in
                    many Grasses (fig. 213). In Orchidaceae the stigma is situated on the anterior
                    surface of the column formed by the union of the styles and filaments,—the point
                    where it occurs being called <hi rend="italic">gynizus.</hi> In Asclepiadacese
                    the stigmas are united to the face of the anthers, and along with them form a
                    solid mass (fig. 229).</p>
                <p>Transformations of the pistil are of frequent occurrence, and depend generally on
                    abortion of a certain number of carpels, and on adhesions of various kinds. In
                    the apocarpous pistils of Aconite, Nigella, Larkspur, and Paeony, we find on the
                    same plant pistils composed of two, three, four, five, and six carpels. In some
                    of the Brambles, all the carpels except one have been observed to disappear,
                    thus making the fruit resemble that of the Plum. In the case of Leguminous
                    plants there is usually only a single carpel, although the flower is
                    pentamerous; this state has been traced to abortion of carpels, and the view is
                    confirmed by finding plants in the same natural order with more than one carpel.
                    Pistils of a succulent nature, such as those of the Sloe and Bird-cherry,
                    sometimes assume the form of a pod, like that of the Pea. Occasionally stamens
                    are changed into carpels, and at other times the carpels are transformed into
                    stamens, and bear pollen.</p>
                <p>The ovule is the body attached to the placenta, and destined to become the seed.
                    Ovules are most usually produced on the margins of the carpellary leaves, but
                    are also formed over the whole surface of the leaf, as in Cupressus. In other
                    instances they rise from the floral axis itself, either as terminal buds, as in
                    Polygonaceae and Piperaceae, or as lateral buds, as in Primulaceae and
                    Compositae. The ovule is usually contained in an ovary, and all plants in which
                    the ovule is so enclosed are termed <hi rend="italic">angiospermous;</hi> but in
                    Conifer» and Cycadaceae it is generally considered as having no proper ovarian
                    covering, and is called <hi rend="italic">naked,</hi> these orders being
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">gymnospermous</hi> The gymnospermal view is not
                    adopted by all botanists, some maintaining that there is a true ovarian covering
                    In Cycas the altered leaf, upon the margin of which the ovule is produced, and
                    the peltate scales, from which they are pendulous in Zamia, are regarded by all
                    botanists as carpellary leaves. But in the Conifer» great discussion has arisen
                    regarding the morphology of parts in many genera; some considering the scales at
                    the base of the scaly bracts of the cone as a placental process growing from the
                    bract, which is thus a carpellary leaf opened out and bearing a sessile ovule,
                    the whole cone representing a single flower; while others, again, regard the
                    scale as an ovular integument, and the ovule as being destitute of ovary, the
                    outer scales being bracts, and the cone therefore being an inflorescence. The
                    carpellary leaves are sometimes united in such a way as to leave an opening at
                    the apex of the pistil, so that the ovules are exposed or <hi rend="italic"
                    >seminude,</hi> as in Mignonette. In Leontice thalictroides (Blue Cohosh),
                    species of Ophiopogon, Peliosanthes, and Stateria, the ovary ruptures
                    immediately after flowering, and the ovules are exposed; and in species of
                    Cuphea the placenta ultimately bursts through the ovary and corolla, and becomes
                    erect, bearing the exposed ovules. The ovule is attached to the placenta either
                    directly, when it is called <hi rend="italic">sessile,</hi> or by means of a
                    prolongation called a <hi rend="italic">funiculus, umbilical cord,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">podosperm</hi> (fig. 2 7 Oct, ∕). This cord sometimes becomes much
                    elongated after fertilization. The part by which the ovule is attached to the
                    placenta or cord is its <hi rend="italic">base</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >hilum,</hi> the opposite extremity being its <hi rend="italic">apex.</hi> The
                    latter is frequently turned round in such a way as to approach the base. The
                    ovule is sometimes embedded in the placenta, as in Hydnora.</p>
                <p>The ovule appears at first as a small cellular projection from the placenta. The
                    cells multiply until they assume a more or less enlarged ovate form,
                    constituting what has been called the <hi rend="italic">nucleus</hi> (fig. 270,
                    n), or central cellular mass of the ovule. The nucleus may remain naked, and
                    alone form the ovule, as in Balanophoraceae, Santalaceae, &amp;c.; but in most
                    plants it becomes surrounded by certain coverings or integuments during its
                    development. These appear first in the form of cellular rings at the base of the
                    nucleus, which gradually spread over its surface. In some cases only one
                    covering is formed, especially amongst gamopetalous Dicotyledons, as in
                    Compositae, Campanulaceae, also.in Walnut, &amp;c. But usually besides the
                    single covering (fig. 270α, s) another is developed subsequently (fig. 270α, <hi
                    rend="italic">ρ),</hi> which gradually extends over that first formed, and
                    ultimately covers it completely, except at the apex. There are thus two
                    integuments to the nucleus, an outer and an inner, called respectively <hi
                    rend="italic">primine, p,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">secundine, s,—</hi> the
                    terms having reference to their position as regards the nucleus and not
                    indicating the order of development. The name <hi rend="italic">tercine</hi> has
                    been given to the outer layer of cells of the nucleus. The integuments do not
                    completely invest the apex of the nucleus, but an opening termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">foramen</hi> or <hi rend="italic">micropyle</hi> is left. This
                    foramen in most ovules extends through both coats, the opening in the primine
                    (fig. 270«, <hi rend="italic">ex)</hi> being the <hi rend="italic"
                    >exostome;</hi> that in the secundine (fig. 270«, <hi rend="italic">end)</hi>
                    being the <hi rend="italic">endostome.</hi> But in many Monocotyledons the
                    exostome has no share in the formation of the micropyle. The micropyle indicates
                    the organic apex of the ovule. The term micropyle is sometimes restricted to the
                    foramen in the perfect seed. The size <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n155/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0155-0146"/> of the micropyle depends on the development of
                    the nucleus, as well as on the thickness of the integuments. Where the
                    integument is very thick and the nucleus small, the micropyle is a long canal,
                    as in Hippuris; but more usually the nucleus is large, and the integuments
                    reduced to a few layers of cells, and in this case the micropyle is
                    correspondingly reduced. The nucleus alters in the progress of growth so as to
                    be prepared for the development of the embryo in its interior. A single cell of
                    the nucleus near its centre enlarges greatly until it forms a hollow cavity
                    surrounded by the smaller cells of the nucleus. This cavity is the <hi
                    rend="italic">embryo-sac</hi> (fig. 274, s), and the protoplasmic contents have
                    been termed the <hi rend="italic">amnios.</hi> This embryo-sac increases in
                    size, gradually supplanting the surrounding cellular tissue of the nucleus until
                    it remains surrounded only by a thin layer of it; or it may actually extend at
                    the apex beyond it, as in Phaseolus and Alsine media <hi rend="italic">; or
                    it</hi> may pass into the micropyle, as in Santalum. In Gymnosperms it usually
                    remains deep in the nucleus and surrounded by a thick mass of cellular tissue
                    (fig. 272). In Veronica, Euphrasia, and many Labiatae, the neck of the
                    embryo-sac becomes elongated and swollen, and from it are developed certain
                    vermiform or filamentous appendages, which are probably connected with the
                    nutrition of the embryo. In some cases more than one embryo-sac is formed. This
                    occurs in some gymnospermous plants, as the Yew, and it is also seen in
                    Cruciferae. In the Mistleto several sacs are formed, but it is doubtful whether
                    in this case several ovules have not coalesced. Usually only one becomes fully
                    developed. When the embryo-sac has reached a certain stage of growth, a
                    development of cellular tissue takes place within it by free cell formation.
                    This occurs in all gymnospermous plants, and constitutes what is known as the
                    <hi rend="italic">endosperm</hi> (fig. 280, δ). In angiospermous plants the
                    endosperm is not formed until after fertilization, and it is rare to find any
                    special development of cellular tissue within the embryo-sac before
                    fertilization. But in some cases at the base of the embryo-sac a few cells are
                    formed, which have been termed <hi rend="italic">antipodal cells,</hi> and are
                    frequently afterwards absorbed, or may be incorporated in the true endosperm
                    when it is formed. The further processes of growth in gymnospermous ovules on
                    the one hand, and angiospermous ovules on the other, differ so much that they
                    must be noted separately.</p>
                <p>At the apex of the embryo-sac in gymnosperms, two or more cells of the endosperm
                    enlarge so as to form what have been termed <hi rend="italic">corpuscles</hi>
                    (fig. 273). Each of these divides so as to form a large lower terminal or <hi
                    rend="italic">central cell,</hi> and an upper <hi rend="italic">neck</hi> of
                    smaller cells <hi rend="italic">(stigmatιc cells'),</hi> appearing as four when
                    viewed from above, enclosing a <hi rend="italic">canal.</hi> From the upper part
                    of the central cell at the bottom of the neck, a small portion is separated—the
                    <hi rend="italic">canal cell.</hi> It is from a portion of the central cell
                    that, after fertilization, the embryo is formed. Those parts all have great
                    physiological importance in connection with fertilization. In angiosperms from
                    the protoplasmic mass at the apex of the embryo-sac by free cell formation two
                    (rarely one) elongated ovoid cells are produced. These are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >germinal vesicles</hi> (fig. 274). In some angiosperms as Crocus, Maize,
                    &amp;c., the vesicles placed side by side are both equally elongated; to a
                    considerable extent their lower ends are rounded, and there it is that the
                    nucleus is found. The upper end projects into the micropyle, and is marked by
                    distinct striae longitudinally. This portion has been distinguished as the <hi
                    rend="italic">filiform apparatus.</hi> From the germinal vesicles after
                    impregnation the embryo is formed, only one vesicle developing. This filiform
                    apparatus is considered as corresponding to the canal cell formed from the
                    corpuscula in gymnosperms, and it seems to serve for conducting the impregnating
                    influence to the lower part of the central cell. In most angiosperms the
                    germinal vesicles are placed obliquely over each other—one attached to the apex
                    of the sac, the other lower down, and there is no filiform apparatus. Of these
                    two vesicles the lower one alone forms an embryo, the upper one performing the
                    same function as the filiform apparatus of other angiosperms, and the canal cell
                    of gymnosperms. The point where the integuments are united to the base of the
                    nucleus is called the <hi rend="italic">chalaza</hi> (fig. 278, <hi
                    rend="italic">ch).</hi> This is often coloured, is of a denser texture than the
                    surrounding tissue, and is traversed by fibro-vascular bundles, which pass from
                    the placenta to nourish the ovule.</p>
                <p>When the ovule is so developed that the point of union between the integuments
                    and nucleus (the chalaza) is at the hilum (next the placenta), and the micropyle
                    is at the opposite extremity, there being a short funiculus, the ovule is <hi
                    rend="italic">orthotropal, orthotropous,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >atropous.</hi> This form is well seen in Polygonaceae (fig. 271), Cistaceae,
                    and most gymnosperms. In such an ovule a straight line drawn from the hilum to
                    the micropyle passes along the axis of the ovule. Where, by more rapid growth on
                    one side than on the other, the nucleus, together with the integuments, is
                    curved upon itself, so that the micropyle approaches the hilum, and ultimately
                    is placed close to it, while the chalaza is at the hilum, the ovule is <hi
                    rend="italic">campylotropal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">campylotropous</hi> (fig.
                    275) when the portions on the two sides of the line bisecting the angle of
                    curvature are unequal, or <hi rend="italic">camptotrσpal</hi> when they are
                    equal. Curved ovules are found in Leguminosae, Cruciferae, and Caryophyllaceae.
                    Usually the opposite faces of the concavity of curvature of such ovules
                    coalesce, and outwardly no indication of curvature is visible; but in some cases
                    there is no coalition, and the ovule is <hi rend="italic">lecotropal,</hi> or
                    horse-shoe shaped. The inverted, <hi rend="italic">anatropal,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">anatropous</hi> ovule (figs. 276, 277, 278) is the commonest form
                    amongst <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n156/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0156-0147"/> angiosperms. In this ovule the apex with the
                    micropyle is turned towards the point of attachment of the funiculus to the
                    placenta, the chalaza being situated at the opposite extremity; and the
                    funiculus, which runs along the side usually next the placenta, coalesces with
                    the ovule and constitutes the <hi rend="italic">raplie (r),</hi> which often
                    forms a ridge. The anatropal ovule arises from the placenta as a straight or
                    only slightly curved cellular process, and as it grows, gradually becomes
                    inverted, curving from the point of origin of the integuments. As the first
                    integument (secundine) grows round it, the amount of inversion increases, and
                    the funiculus becomes adherent to the side of the nucleus. Then if a primine be
                    formed it covers all the free part of the ovule, but does not form on the side
                    to which, the raphe is adherent. Some anatropal ovules, however, seem to be
                    formed in a different manner, the nucleus arising as a lateral bud from the apex
                    of the funiculus, as in some Compositae. These may be taken as the three types
                    of ovule in the vegetable kingdom; but there are various intermediate forms,
                    such as <hi rend="italic">semi-anatropal, amphitropal,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">heterotropal</hi> (transverse) ovules, where the funiculus is
                    only, as it were, partially attached along one side, becoming free in the
                    middle.</p>
                <p>The position of the ovule relative to the ovary varies. When there is a single
                    ovule, with its axis vertical, it may be attached to the placenta at the base of
                    the ovary <hi rend="italic">(fiasal placenta),</hi> and it is then <hi
                    rend="italic">erect,</hi> as in Polygonaceae and Composite; or it may be
                    inserted a little above the base, on a parietal placenta, with its apex upwards,
                    and then is <hi rend="italic">ascending,</hi> as in Parietaria. It may hang from
                    an apicilar placenta at the summit of the ovary, its apex being directed
                    downwards, and is <hi rend="italic">inverted</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pendulous,</hi> as in Hippuris vulgaris; or from a parietal placenta near the
                    summit, and then is <hi rend="italic">suspended,</hi> as in Daphne Mezereum,
                    Polygalaceae, and Euphorbiaceae. Sometimes a long funiculus arises from a basal
                    placenta, reaches the summit of the ovary, and there bending over suspends the
                    ovule, as in Λrmeria (Sea-pink); at other times the hilum appears to be in the
                    middle, and the ovule becomes <hi rend="italic">horizontal, peltate,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">peritropous.</hi> When there are two ovules in the same cell, they
                    may be either <hi rend="italic">collateral,</hi> that is, placed side by side
                    (fig. 257), or the one may be erect and the other inverted, as in some species
                    of Spiraea and Aesculus; or they may be placed one above another, each directed
                    similarly, as is the case in ovaries containing a moderate or definite number of
                    ovules. Thus, in the ovary of Leguminous plants (fig. 256), the ovules <hi
                    rend="italic">o,</hi> are attached to the extended marginal placenta, one above
                    the other, forming usually two parallel rows corresponding to each margin of the
                    carpeL When the ovules are <hi rend="italic">definite (i,e.,</hi> are uniform,
                    and can be counted), it is usual to find their attachment so constant as to
                    afford good characters for classification. When the ovules are very numerous <hi
                    rend="italic">(indefinite),</hi> while at the same time the placenta is not much
                    developed, their position exhibits great variation, some being directed upwards,
                    others downwards, others transversely; and their form is altered by pressure
                    into various polyhedral shapes. In such cases it frequently happens that some of
                    the ovules are arrested in their development and become abortive.</p>
                <p>The homology of the ovule is by no means the same in all plants. In such cases as
                    Polygonum and Piperaceae, it represents the termination of the floral axis, and
                    therefore is of the nature of a caulome. Again, in such plants as Primulaceae
                    and Composite, it is produced laterally upon the axis, and therefore represents
                    a leaf, the integuments representing the lamina, and the funiculus the
                    petiole,—the nucleus being an outgrowth from them. In some instances of
                    malformation a transformation into these parts actually takes place. In cases
                    where they are produced on the margin of the carpellary leaves (the usual mode),
                    the ovules represent lobes of a leaf, and in some cases of monstrosity, as in
                    Delphinium datum, they appear as lobes of the carpellary leaf, whilst in
                    Cupressus they are evidently outgrowths of the leaf. Further, the ovules in
                    Orchidaceae must be considered as mere trichomes, as they have no fibro-vascular
                    bundles, and are developed from superficial cells of the placenta.</p>
                <p>When the pistil has reached a certain stage in growth it becomes ready for
                    fertilization. Pollination having been effected, and the pollen-grain having
                    reached the stigma in angiosperms, the summit of the nucleus in gymnosperms, it
                    is detained there, and the viscid secretion from the glands of the stigma in the
                    former case, and the moisture from the ovule in the latter, induce the
                    protrusion of the intine as a pollen-tube through the pores or points of
                    perforation of the grain, many or few tubes being formed according to the number
                    of pores. The pollen-tube or tubes pass down the canal (fig. 279), through t⅛e
                    conducting tissue of the style when present, and reach the interior of the ovary
                    in angiosperms, and then pass to the micropyle of the ovule, one pollen-tube
                    going to each ovule. Sometimes the micropyle lies close to the base of the
                    style, and then the pollen-tube enters it at once, but frequently it has to pass
                    some distance into the ovary, being guided in its direction by various
                    contrivances, as hairs, grooves, &amp;c. In gymnosperms the pollen-grain resting
                    on the apex of the nucleus sends out its pollen-tubes, which at once penetrate
                    the nucleus of the ovule (fig. 280). In angiosperms when the pollen-tube reaches
                    the micropyle it passes down into the canal, and this portion of it increases
                    considerably in size. Where, as in Santalum album, Crocus, &lt;tc., there is a
                    filiform apparatus, the pollen-tube comes in contact with it. In most cases,
                    however, it reaches the apex of the embryo-sac, sometimes slightly indenting it,
                    as in Narcissus poeticus and Digitalis purpurea, or even perforating it, as in
                    Canna. The granular protoplasmic matter in the pollen (fovilla) is then
                    transmitted to the embryonal vesicle and fertilization is effected. Consequent
                    upon this, after a longer or shorter period, those changes commence in the
                    embryonal vesicle which result in the formation of the embryo plant, the ovule
                    also undergoing changes which convert it into the seed, and fit it for a
                    protective covering, and a store of nutriment for the embryo. Nor are the
                    effects of fertilization confined to the ovule; they extend to other parts of
                    the plant. The ovary enlarges, and, with the seeds enclosed, constitutes <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n157/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0157-0148"/> the fruit, frequently incorporated with which are
                    other parts of the flower, as receptacle, calyx, &amp;c. In gymnosperms the
                    pollen-tubes, having penetrated a certain distance down the tissue of the
                    nucleus, are usually arrested in growth for a longer or shorter period,
                    sometimes nearly a year. Subsequently growth recommences; the tube advances to
                    the apex of the embryo-sac, which it pierces, and reaches the mouth of the canal
                    of the corpuscle. It either descends the canal or remains attached at the mouth.
                    The fovilla is transmitted to the central cell, and fertilization is complete,
                    the central cell giving rise to the embryo. In angiosperms usually only one
                    embryonal vesicle is fertilized, and one embryo is produced— <hi rend="italic"
                    >monoembryony;</hi> but in some plants where many embryonal vesicles are formed,
                    as in Citrus and Scabiosa, several of them may be fertilized, and thus many
                    embryos produced— <hi rend="italic">polyembryony.</hi> Usually, however, only
                    one develops, so as to be capable of germination or growth. In gymnosperms it is
                    very common to have polyembryony, although produced in a dιf-erent way, for each
                    central cell of a corpuscle may produce four embryos, and as the central cell of
                    more than one corpuscle may be fertilized a great many embryos may be formed.
                    They do not, however, all come to maturity.</p>

                    Fruit.</hi></p>
                <p>After fertilization various changes take place in the parts of the flower. Those
                    more immediately concerned in the process, the anther and stigma, rapidly wither
                    and decay, while the filaments and style often remain for some time; the floral
                    envelopes become dry, the petals fall, and the sepals are either deciduous, or
                    remain persistent in an altered form; the ovary becomes enlarged, forming the
                    pericarp; and the ovules are developed as the <hi rend="italic">seeds,</hi>
                    containing the <hi rend="italic">embryo-plant.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic"
                    >fruit</hi> is strictly applied to the mature pistil or ovary, with the seeds in
                    its interior. But it often includes other parts of the flower, such as the
                    bracts and floral envelopes. Thus the fruit of the Hazel and Oak consists of the
                    ovary and bracts and calyx combined; that of the Apple, Pear, and Gooseberry, of
                    the ovary and calyx; and that of the Pine-apple, of the ovaries and floral
                    envelopes of several flowers combined. Such fruits are by some distinguished as
                    <hi rend="italic">pseudocarps.</hi> In popular language, the fruit includes all
                    those parts which exhibit a striking change as the result of fertilization. In
                    general, the fruit is not ripened unless fertilization has been effected: but
                    cases occur in which the fruit swells, and becomes to all appearance perfect,
                    while no seeds are produced. Thus, there are seedless Oranges, Grapes, and
                    Pine-Apples. When the ovules are unfertilized, it is common to find that the
                    ovary withers and does not come to maturity; but in the case of Bananas,
                    Plantains, and Breadfruit, the non-development of seeds seems to lead to a
                    larger growth, and a greater succulence of fruit.</p>
                <p>The fruit, like the ovary, may be formed of a single carpel, or of several. It
                    may have one cell or cavity, being <hi rend="italic">unilocular;</hi> or many,
                    <hi rend="italic">multilocular,</hi> &amp;c. The number and nature of the
                    divisions depend on the number of carpels, and the extent to which their edges
                    are folded inwards. The appearances presented by the ovary do not always remain
                    permanent in the fruit. Great changes are observed to take place, not merely as
                    regards the increased size of the ovary, its softening and hardening, but also
                    in its internal structure, owing to the suppression, additional formation, or
                    enlargement of parts. Thus, in the Ash (fig. 281) an ovary with two cells, each
                    containing an ovule attached to a central placenta, is changed into a unilocular
                    fruit with one seed; one ovule, <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> becoming abortive,
                    while the other, <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> gradually enlarging until the septum
                    is pushed to one side, unites with the walls of the cell, and the placenta
                    appears to be parietal. In the Oak and Hazel, an ovary with three cells, and two
                    ovules in each, changes into a one-celled fruit with one seed. In the Coco-nut,
                    a trilocular and triovular ovary is changed into a one-celled, one-seeded fruit.
                    This abortion may depend on the pressure caused by the development of certain
                    ovules, or it may proceed from non fertilization of all the ovules and
                    consequent non-enlarge ment of the carpels. Again, by the growth of the
                    placenta, or the folding inwards of parts of the carpels, divisions occur in the
                    fruit which did not exist in the ovary. In Pretrea zanzibarica, a one-celled
                    ovary is changed into a four-celled fruit by the extension of the placenta. In
                    Cathartocarpus Fistula a one· celled ovary is changed into a fruit, having each
                    of its seeds in a separate cell, in consequence of spurious dissepiments <hi
                    rend="italic">(plιragmatd)</hi> being produced in a horizontal manner, from the
                    inner wall of the ovary. In Linum, by the folding inwards of the back of the
                    carpels a five-celled ovary becomes a ten-celled fruit. In Astragalus, the
                    folding inwards of the dorsal suture converts a one-celled ovary into a
                    two-celled fruit; and in Oxytropis the folding of the ventral suture gives rise
                    to a similar change in the fruit. The development of cellular or pulpy matter,
                    and the enlargement of parts not forming whorls of the flower, frequently alter
                    the appearance of the fruit, and render it difficult to discover its formation.
                    In the Gooseberry, Grape, Guava, Tomato, and Pomegranate, the seeds nestle in
                    pulp, formed apparently by the placentas. In the Orange, the pulpy matter
                    surrounding the seeds is formed by succulent cells, which are produced from the
                    inner partitioned lining of the pericarp. In the Strawberry the receptacle
                    becomes succulent, and bears the carpels on its convex surface (fig. 154); in
                    the Rose there is a fleshy hollowtorus or disk, which bears the carpels on its
                    concave surface (fig. 155). In the Juniper the scaly bracts grow up round the
                    seeds and become succulent, and in the Fig (fig. 150) the receptacle becomes
                    succulent and encloses an inflorescence.</p>
                <p>The pistil, in its simplest state, consists of a carpel or folded leaf, with
                    ovules at its margin; and the same structure will be found in the fruit, where
                    the pericarp represents the carpellary leaf, and the seeds correspond to the
                    ovules. The pericarp consists usually of three layers, the external, or <hi
                    rend="italic">epicarp</hi> (fig. 282, <hi rend="italic">ep∖</hi> corresponding
                    to the lower epidermis of the leaf; the middle, or <hi rend="italic">mesocarp,
                    me,</hi> representing the parenchyma of the leaf; and the internal, or <hi
                    rend="italic">endocarp,</hi><hi rend="italic">en,</hi> equivalent to the upper
                    epidermis of the leaf, or the epithelium of the ovary. These layers are well

                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n158/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0158-0149"/> a fruit as the Peach or Plum, where they are
                    separable one from the other; in them the epicarp forms what is commonly called
                    the skin; the mesocarp, much developed, forms the flesh or pulp, and hence has
                    sometimes been called <hi rend="italic">sarcocarp;</hi> while the endocarp,
                    hardened by the production of woody cells, forms the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stone</hi> or <hi rend="italic">putamen,</hi> immediately covering the kernel
                    of the seed. The pulpy matter found in the interior of fruits, such as the
                    Gooseberry, Grape, and Cathartocarpus Fistula, is formed from the placentas, and
                    must not be confounded with the sarcocarp. In some fruits, as in the Nut, the
                    three layers become blended together, and are indistinguishable. In Bladder
                    Senna (Colutea arborescens) the pericarp retains its leaf-like appearance, but
                    in most cases it becomes altered both in consistence and in colour. Thus in the
                    Date the epicarp is the outer brownish skin, the pulpy matter is the mesocarp or
                    sarcocarp, and the thin papery-like lining is the endocarp covering the hard
                    seed. In the Medlar the endocarp becomes of a stony hardness. In the Melon the
                    epicarp and endocarp are very thin, while the mesocarp forms the bulk of the
                    fruit, differing in texture and taste in its external and internal parts. The
                    rind of the Orange consists of epicarp and mesocarp, while the endocarp forms
                    partitions in the interior, filled with pulpy cells. The part of the pericarp
                    attached to the peduncle is called its <hi rend="italic">base,</hi> and the
                    point where the style or stigma existed is the <hi rend="italic">apex.</hi> This
                    latter is not always the apparent apex, as in the case of the ovary; it may be
                    lateral or even basilar. The style sometimes remains in a hardened form,
                    rendering the fruit <hi rend="italic">apiculate;</hi> at other times it falls
                    off, leaving only traces of its existence. The presence of the style or stigma
                    serves to distinguish certain singleseeded pericarps from seeds.</p>
                <p>When the fruit is mature and the contained seeds ripe, the carpels usually give
                    way either at the ventral or dorsal suture or at both, and so allow the seeds to
                    escape. The fruit in this case is <hi rend="italic">dehiscent.</hi> But some
                    fruits are <hi rend="italic">indehiscent,</hi> falling to the ground entire, and
                    the seeds eventually reaching the soil by their decay. By <hi rend="italic"
                    >dehiscence</hi> the pericarp becomes divided into different pieces, or <hi
                    rend="italic">valves,</hi> the fruit being <hi rend="italic">univalvτdar,
                    biυalvular,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mτdtivalvular,</hi> &amp;c., according as
                    there are one, two, or many valves. The splitting may extend the whole length of
                    the fruit, or it may be only partial, the valves forming teeth at the apex of
                    the fruit, and the dehiscence being <hi rend="italic">apicilar,</hi> as in
                    Caryophyllaceae (fig. 283). Sometimes the valves are detached only at certain
                    points, and thus dehiscence takes place by pores at the apex, as in Poppy (fig.
                    269), or at the base, as in Campanula. Indehiscent fruits are either dry, as the
                    Nut, or fleshy, as the Cherry and Apple. They may be formed of one or several
                    carpels. In the former case they usually contain only a single seed, which may
                    become so incorporated with the pericarp as to appear to be naked. Such fruits
                    are called <hi rend="italic">p&gt;seudospermmιs</hi> or false-seeded, and are
                    exemplified in the grain of Wheat. In such cases the presence of the style or
                    stigma determines their true nature.</p>
                <p>Dehiscent fruits, when composed of single carpels, may open by the ventral suture
                    only, as in the Paeony, Hellebore, Aquilegia (fig. 300), and Caltha; by the
                    dorsal suture only, as in Magnolias and some Proteaceae, or by both together, as
                    in the Pea (fig. 256) and Bean; in these cases the dehiscence is called <hi
                    rend="italic">sutural.</hi> When composed of several united carpels, two types
                    of dehiscence may be recognized —a longitudinal type and a transverse type. In
                    the longitudinal type the separation may take place by the dissepiments
                    throughout their length, so that the fruit is resolved into its original
                    carpels, and each valve will be a carpel, as in Rhododendron, Colchicum, &amp;c.
                    This dehiscence, in consequence of taking place through the lamellae of the
                    septum, is called <hi rend="italic">septicidal</hi> (figs. 284, 285).</p>
                <p>The valves may separate from their commissure, or central line of union, carrying
                    the placentas with them, or they may leave the latter in the centre, so as to
                    form with the axis a column of a cylindrical, conical, or prismatic shape, which
                    is termed the <hi rend="italic">columella.</hi> The union between the edges of
                    the carpels may be persistent, and they may dehisce by the dorsal suture, or
                    through the back of the loculaments, as in the Lily and Iris (figs. 286, 287).
                    In these cases each valve consists of a half of each of two contiguous carpels.
                    The placentas either remain united to the axis, or they separate from it, being
                    attached to the septa on the valves. This dehiscence is <hi rend="italic"
                    >loculicidal.</hi> When the outer walls of the carpels break off from the septa,
                    leaving them attached to the columella, the dehiscence is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">septifragal</hi> (fig. 288), and where, as in Linum catharticuni
                    and Calluna, the splitting takes place first of all in a septicidal manner, the
                    fruit is described as <hi rend="italic">septicidally septifragal;</hi> while in
                    other cases, as in Thorn Apple (Datura Stramonium), where the splitting is at
                    first loculicidal, the dehiscence is <hi rend="italic">loculicidally
                    septifragal.</hi> In all those forms the separation of the valves takes place
                    either from above downwards or from below upwards. But when the splitting only
                    extends for a short distance, then dehiscence takes place by <hi rend="italic"
                    >pores,</hi> which are situated either at the apex, base, or side, depending on
                    the position of the valves. In the Poppy (fig. 269) the opening takes place by
                    numerous pores under the peltate processes bearing the stigmas. In Campanula
                    there are irregular openings towards the middle or base of the pericarp. In
                    Frogsmouth or Snapdragon tho pericarp gives way at certain fixed points, forming
                    two or three orifices, one of which corresponds to the upper carpel, and the
                    other to the lower. These orifices have a ragged appearance at the margins,
                    which has given rise to tho term <hi rend="italic">rupturing,</hi> sometimes
                    applied to this mode of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n159/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0159-0150"/> dehiscence. In Saxifraga a splitting for a short
                    distance of the ventral sutures of the carpels takes place, so that a single
                    large apical pore is formed. In Caryopliyllaceae (fig. 283) numerous small
                    valvular splittings occur, forming teeth at the apex, and a single apical
                    orifice is formed. In the fruit of Cruciferae, as Wallflower, there is a form of
                    longitudinal dehiscence (fig. 289) in which the valves separate from the base of
                    the fruit, leaving a central <hi rend="italic">replum,</hi> or frame, which is a
                    phragma formed by a prolongation from the parietal placentas on opposite sides
                    of the fruit, extending between the ventral sutures of the carpels. In
                    Orchidaceae (fig. 290) the pericarp, when ripe, separates into three valves, in
                    a loculicidal manner, but the midribs of the carpels, to which the placentas are
                    attached, remain adherent to the axis both at the apex and base, and form three
                    arches, bearing the seeds, after the valves have fallen. In fruits with a free
                    central placenta it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the dehiscence is
                    septicidal or loculicidal, inasmuch as there are no dissepiments, and the
                    placentas and seeds form a column in the axis. Their number, as well as
                    alternation or opposition, as compared with the sepals, will aid in determining
                    whether the valves are the entire carpellary leaves, as in septicidal
                    dehiscence, or only half carpels united, as in loculicidal dehiscence. The other
                    type of dehiscence is transverse, the dehiscence in this case being called <hi
                    rend="italic">circumscissile.</hi> In this dehiscence the upper part of the
                    united carpels falls off in the form of a lid or operculum, as in Anagallis and
                    in Henbane (Hyoscyamus) (fig. 291), and hence the fruit is often denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">opercidate.</hi> In such instances we may either suppose that the
                    fruit or seed-vessel is formed by a number of articulated leaves like those of
                    the Orange, the division taking place where the laminae join the petioles, or
                    that the receptacle is prolonged in the form of a hollow cup, and the lid
                    represents leaves united to it by articulation.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the axis is prolonged beyond the base of the carpels, as in the Mallow
                    and Castor-oil plant, the carpels being united to it throughout their length by
                    their faces, and separating from it without opening. In the Umbelliferae the two
                    carpels separate from the lower part of the axis, and remain attached by their
                    apices to a prolongation of it, called a <hi rend="italic">carpophore</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">podocarp,</hi> which splits into two (fig. 292) and suspends
                    them; hence the name <hi rend="italic">cremocarp</hi> is applied to this fruit,
                    which divides into two suspended mericarps. The general term <hi rend="italic"
                    >schizocarp</hi> is applied to all dry fruits, which break, up into two or more
                    one-seeded indehiscent mericarps, as in Hedysarum (fig. 293). In Geraniaceae the
                    axis is prolonged beyond the carpels, forming a carpophore,· to which the styles
                    are attached, and the pericarps separate from below upwards, before dehiscing by
                    their ventral suture (fig. 152). Carpels which separate one from another in this
                    manner are called <hi rend="italic">cocci.</hi> They are well seen in
                    Euphorbiaceae, where there are usually three such carpels, and the fruit is
                    designated tricoccous. In many of them, as Hura crepitans, the cocci separate
                    with great force and elasticity, the cells being called <hi rend="italic"
                    >dissilient.</hi> In many Leguminous plants, such as Ornithopus, Hedysarum (fig.
                    293),Entada, Coronilla, and the Gum-arabic plant (Acacia arabica), the fruit
                    becomes a schizocarp by the formation of transverse partitions from the folding
                    in of the sides of the pericarp, and distinct separations taking place at these
                    partitions by what has been termed <hi rend="italic">solubility.</hi> In
                    Cathartocarpus Fistula the schizocarp exhibits no evident depressions
                    externally. Some look upon these pods as formed by pinnate leaves folded, and
                    the divisions as indicating the points where the differént pairs of pinnae are
                    united.</p>
                <p>Fruits may be formed by one flower, or they may be the product of several flowers
                    combined. In the former case they are either <hi rend="italic">apocarpous,</hi>
                    of one mature carpel or of several separate free carpels; or <hi rend="italic"
                    >sιjncarpous,</hi> of several carpels, more or less completely united. These
                    different kinds of fruits may be <hi rend="italic">indehiscent</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">dehiscent.</hi> When the fruit is composed of the ovaries of
                    several flowers united, it is usual to find the bracts and floral envelopes also
                    joined with them, so as to form one mass; hence such fruits are called <hi
                    rend="italic">multiple, confluent,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">anthocarpous.</hi>
                    The term <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> is perhaps properly applied to fruits
                    which are formed by the ovary of a single flower, whether they are composed of
                    one or several carpels, and whether these carpels arc separate or combined.
                    Simple fruits are hence sometimes denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >monogynoecial,</hi> as being formed by one gynoecium; while multiple fruits are
                    called <hi rend="italic">polygynoedal,</hi> as being formed by many
                    gynoecia.</p>

                <p>Simple fruits are either <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >succulent,—</hi> the pericarp, in the former instance, remaining more or less
                    foliaceous in its structure, and sometimes being incorporated with the seed,
                    while it is in the latter thick and fleshy or pulpy.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">achoenium</hi> is a dry unilocular monospermous indehiscent
                    fruit, the pericarp of which is closely applied to the seed, but separable from
                    it. It may be <hi rend="italic">solitary,</hi> forming a single fruit, as in the
                    Dock (fig. 294), and in the Cashew, where it is supported on a fleshy peduncle;
                    or <hi rend="italic">aggregate,</hi> as in Ranunculus (figs. 254, 295), where
                    several achaenia are placed on a common elevated receptacle. In the Strawberry
                    the achaenia (fig. 154) are aggregated on a convex succulent receptacle. In the
                    Rose they are supported on a concave receptacle (fig. 155), and in the Fig the
                    succulent receptacle completely encloses the achenes (fig. 150). In Dorstenia
                    (fig. 163) the achenes are situated on a flat or slightly concave receptacle. In
                    the Rose the aggregate achaenia with their covering are sometimes collectively
                    called <hi rend="italic">cynarrhodum.</hi> It will thus be remarked that what in
                    common language are called the seeds of the Strawberry, Rose, and Fig, are in
                    reality carpels, which are distinguished from seeds by the presence of styles
                    and stigmas. The styles occasionally remain attached to the achaenia, in the
                    form of feathery appendages, as in Clematis, and they arc called <hi
                    rend="italic">caudate.</hi> In Composite, the fruit, which is sometimes called
                    <hi rend="italic">cypsela,</hi> is an achaenium (fig. 197), to which the pappose
                    or obsolete calyx remains adherent. Such is also the nature of the fruit in
                    Dipsacaceae. When the pericarp is thin, and appears like a bladder surrounding
                    the seed, the achaenium is termed a <hi rend="italic">utricle,</hi> as in
                    Amarantaceae. When the pericarp is extended in the form of a winged appendage, a
                    <hi rend="italic">samara</hi> or <hi rend="italic">samaroid achoenium</hi> is
                    produced, as in the Ash (fig. 281), Common Sycamore (fig. 296), and Hiraea. In
                    these cases there are usually tw o achaenia united, one of which, however, as in
                    Fraxinus oxyphylla (fig. 281), may be abortive. The wing is either <hi
                    rend="italic">dorsal,</hi> that is, it is a prolongation from the median vein
                    (fig. 296, α) or it is <hi rend="italic">margined,</hi> that is, formed by the
                    lateral veins. It surrounds the fruit longitudinally in the Elm. When the
                    pericarp becomes so incorporated with the seed as to bo inseparable from it, as
                    in grains of Wheat, Maize, Oats (fig. 297), and other Grasses, then the name <hi
                    rend="italic">caryopsis</hi> is given. There are some fruits which consist of
                    two or more achaenia, although originally the carpels were united into a
                    syncarpous pistil, as in Labiatae and Boraginaceae (fig. 298). To this form of
                    schizocarpic fruit, as well as to that of Tropaeolum and Mallow, the name <hi
                    rend="italic">career ulus</hi> is given. The <hi rend="italic">cremocarp,</hi>
                    or the fruit of (Jmbelliferae (figs. 292 and 299), is composed of two achaenia
                    united by a commissure to a <hi rend="italic">carpophore,</hi> from which they
                    are suspended at maturity. It is sometimes denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >diachoenium,</hi> from the union of two achaenia, which in this instance
                    receive the name of <hi rend="italic">mericarps</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >hemicarps.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">nut</hi> or <hi rend="italic">glans</hi> is a dry
                    one-celled indehiscent fruit with a hardened pericarp, surrounded by bracts at
                    the base, and, when mature, containing only one seed. In the young state the
                    ovary contains two or more ovules, but only one comes to maturity. It is
                    illustrated by the fruits of the Hazel and Chestnut, which are covered by leafy
                    bracts, in the form of a <hi rend="italic">husk,</hi> and by the Acorn, in which
                    the bracts and receptacle form a <hi rend="italic">cupula</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">cup</hi> (fig. 147). The parts of the pericarp of the nut are
                    united so as to appear one. In common language the term nut is very vaguely
                    applied both to fruit and seeds.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">drupe</hi> is a succulent usually monospermal and
                    unilocular indehiscent fruit, with a pericarp easily distinguishable into
                    epicarp, mesocarp, and endocarp. This term is applied to such fruits as the
                    Cherry (fig. 282), Peach, Plum, Apricot, Mango, Walnut, Nutmeg, and Date. Tbe
                    endocarp is usually hard, forming the stone <hi rend="italic">{putamen)</hi> of
                    the fruit, which encloses the kernel or seed. The mesocarp is generally pulpy
                    and succulent, so as to be truly a <hi rend="italic">sarcocarp,</hi> as in the
                    Peach, but it is sometimes of a tough texture, as in the Almond, and at other
                    times is more or less fibrous, as in the Coco-nut. In the Almond there, are
                    often two ovules formed, only one of which comes to perfection. In the Walnut,
                    prolongations from the endocarp, which is of two layers, extend into the
                    substance of the seed, and give rise to its characteristic convoluted lobate
                    appearance. This fruit has been sometimes called <hi rend="italic">tryma.</hi>
                    In the Raspberry and Bramble several drupes or <hi rend="italic">drupels</hi>
                    are aggregated so as to constitute an <hi rend="italic">et&lt;xrio.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">follicle</hi> is a dry monocarpellary unilocular
                    polyspermal (many-seeded) fruit, dehiscing by the ventral suture. It is rare to
                    meet with a solitary follicle forming the fruit. There are usually several
                    aggregated together, either in a circular manner on a shortened receptacle, as
                    in Hellebore, Aconite, Delphinium, Aquilegia (figs. 300, 301) Crassulaceae (fig.
                    172), Butomus, and Asclepiadaceae; or in a spiral manner on an elongated
                    receptacle, as in Magnolia, Banksia, and Liriodendron. Occasionally, follicles
                    dehisce by the dorsal suture, as in Magnolia grandiflora and Banksia.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">legume</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pod</hi> is a dry
                    monocarpellary unilocular polyspermal fruit, dehiscing both by the ventral and
                    the dorsal suture. It characterises Leguminous plants, as the Bean and Pea (fig.
                    256). In the Bladder-senna it retains its leaf-like appearance, and forms an
                    inflated legume. In some Leguminosae, as Arachis, Cathartocarpus Fistula, and
                    the Tamarind, the fruit must be considered a legume, although it does not
                    dehisce. The first of these plants produces its fruit underground, and is called
                    earth-nut; the second has a partitioned legume and is schizocarpic; and both the
                    second and third have pulpy matter surrounding the seeds. Some legumes are
                    schizocarpic by the formation of constrictions externally. Such a form is the
                    <hi rend="italic">lomentum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lomentaceous legume</hi> of
                    Hedysarum coronarium (fig. 293), Coronilla, Ornithopus, Entada, and of some
                    Acacias. In Medicago the legume is twisted like a snail, and in Caesalpinia
                    coriaria, or Divi-divi, it is vermiform or curved like a worm; in Carmichaelia
                    the valves give way close to the suture, and separate from it, leaving a
                    division. Sometimes the number of seeds is reduced, as in Erythrina monosperma
                    and Geoftroya superba, which are one-seeded, and in Pterocarpus and Dalbergia,
                    which are two-seeded.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">berry (bacca)</hi> is a succulent syncarpous polyspermal
                    unilocular indehiscent fruit, with seeds immersed in a pulpy <pb break="no"

                    usually given to such fruits as the Gooseberry (fig. 302) and Currant, in which
                    the ovary is inferior, and the placentas are parietal, the seeds being
                    ultimately detached from the placenta, and lying loose in the pulp. Others have
                    applied it also to those in which the ovary is superior, as in the Grape,
                    Potato, and Ardisia, and the placentas are central or free central. The latter
                    are frequently separated under the name <hi rend="italic">uva</hi> (grape). In
                    general, the name of <hi rend="italic">baccate</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >berried</hi> is applied to all pulpy fruits. In the Pomegranate there is a
                    peculiar baccate many-celled inferior fruit, having a tough rind, enclosing two
                    rows of carpels placed one above the other. The seeds are immersed in pulp, and
                    are attached irregularly to the parietes, base, and centre of the loculi. The
                    fruit has been called <hi rend="italic">balausta,</hi> and the tough rind is
                    called <hi rend="italic">malicorium.</hi> In the Baobab there is a multilocular
                    syncarpous fruit, in which the seeds are immersed in pulp, to which the name <hi
                    rend="italic">amphisarca</hi> is given.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pepo</hi> or <hi rend="italic">peponida,</hi> another
                    indehiscent syncarpous fruit, is illustrated by the fruit of the Gourd, Melon
                    (fig. 262), and other Cucurbitaceae. It is formed of three carpels, to which the
                    calyx is superior; the rind is thick and fleshy, partly formed by the calyx; and
                    there are three or more seed-bearing parietal placentas, either surrounding a
                    central cavity, or prolonged inwards into it. The fruit of the Papaw resembles
                    the pepo, but the calyx is not superior.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hesperidium</hi> is the name given to such indehiscent
                    syncarpous fruits as the Orange, Lemon, and Shaddock, in which the epicarp and
                    mesocarp form a separable rind, and the endocarp sends prolongations inwards,
                    forming triangular divisions, to the inner angle of which the seeds are
                    attached, pulpy cells being developed around them. Both pepo and hesperidium may
                    be considered as modifications of the berry.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pome,</hi> seen in the Apple, Pear, Quince, Medlar, and
                    Hawthorn, is a fleshy indehiscent syncarpous fruit with the calyx attached, and
                    has an outer skin or epicarp, a fleshy mesocarp, and a scaly or horny endocarp
                    (the core) enclosing the seeds (fig. 303). Some look upon the so-called epicarp
                    and mesocarp as formed by the prolonged receptacle on the inner surface of which
                    a fleshy lining is developed, while the endocarp represents the true carpels. In
                    this view the endocarp might be regarded as consisting of a number of
                    indehiscent follicles (usually five) surrounded by a succulent receptacle. In
                    the Medlar the endocarp (or what may be called the true pericarp) is of a stony
                    hardness, while the outer succulent covering is open at the summit. The stones
                    of the Medlar are called <hi rend="italic">ρyrenae;</hi> some apply the term <hi
                    rend="italic">mιcιdanium</hi> to the Medlar. Taking this view of the pome it may
                    be said to resemble in a manner the fruit of the Rose, the cynarrhodum producing
                    achenes, and the pome closed follicles.</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">capsule</hi> is applied generally to a <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> I dry syncarpous fruits, which dehisce by valves of
                    whatever kind. It may thus be unilocular or multilocular, monospermous or
                    polyspermous. The true valvular capsule is observed in Colchicum (fig. 284),
                    Lily, and Iris (fig. 286). <hi rend="italic">Υheporose capsule</hi> is seen in
                    the Poppy (fig. 269), Antirrhinum majus, and Campanula persicifolia. In
                    Campanula the pores occur at the base of the capsule, and it has been designated
                    a <hi rend="italic">diplotegia.</hi> When the capsule opens by a lid, or by
                    circumscissile dehiscence, it is called a <hi rend="italic">pyxidium,</hi> as in
                    Anagallis arvensis, Henbane (fig. 291), and Monkey pot (Lecythis). The capsule
                    assumes a screw-like form in Helicteres, and a star-like or stellate form in
                    Illicium anisatum. In certain instances the cells of the capsule separate from
                    each other, and open with elasticity to scatter the seeds. This kind of capsule
                    is met with in the Sandbox tree (Hura crepitans), and other Euphorbiacese, where
                    the cocci, containing each a single seed, burst asunder with force; and in
                    Geraniaceae, where the cocci, each containing, when mature, usually one seed,
                    separate from the carpophore, become curved upwards by their adherent styles,
                    and open by the ventral suture (fig. 152). In the former case the fruit
                    collectively has been called <hi rend="italic">regma.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">siliqua</hi> is a dry syncarpous bicarpellary bilocular
                    polyspermal fruit with a replum, dehiscing by two valves from below upwards, the
                    valves separating from the placentas and leaving them united by the replum. The
                    seeds are attached on both sides of the replum, either in one row or in two.
                    When the fruit is long and narrow it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n162/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0162-0153"/> is called <hi rend="italic">siliqua</hi> (fig.
                    304); when broad and short, it is called <hi rend="italic">silicula</hi> (figs.
                    305, 306). It occurs in Cruciferous plants, as Wallflower, Cabbage, and Cress.
                    In Glaucium and Eschscholtzia (Papaveraceous plants) the fruit is siliquaeform,
                    the dissepiment or replum being of a spongy nature, and it has been termed a <hi
                    rend="italic">ceratium.</hi> In its normal state a siliqua is supposed to
                    consist of four carpels, but two of these are abortive. There are four bundles
                    of vessels in it, one corresponding to each valve which may be called <hi
                    rend="italic">valvular</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pericarpial,</hi> and others
                    running along the edge called <hi rend="italic">placental.</hi> The replum
                    consists of two lamellae. It sometimes exhibits perforations, becoming <hi
                    rend="italic">fenestrate.</hi> Rarely its central portion is absorbed, so that
                    the fruit becomes one-celled. It may become <hi rend="italic">lomentaceous,</hi>
                    as in Raphanus and Sea-kale, and it may be reduced, as in Woad (Isatis), to a
                    monospermal condition.</p>
                <p>It sometimes happens that the ovaries of two flowers unite so as to form a double
                    fruit. This may be seen in many species of Honeysuckle. But the fruits which are
                    now to be considered consist usually of the floral envelopes, as well as the
                    ovaries of several flowers united into one, and are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >multiple, confluent,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">polygynoecial.</hi> The term <hi
                    rend="italic">anthocarpous</hi> has also been applied as indicating that the
                    floral envelopes as well as the carpels are concerned in the formation of the
                    fruit.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sorosis</hi> is a succulent multiple fruit formed by the
                    confluence of a spike of flowers, as in the fruit of the Pine-apple (fig. 307),
                    the Bread-fruit, and Jack-fruit. Sometimes a fruit of this kind resembles that
                    formed by a single flower, and a superficial observer might have some difficulty
                    in marking the difference.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sycon us</hi> is an anthocarpous fruit, in which the
                    receptacle completely encloses numerous flowers and becomes succulent. The Fig
                    (fig. 150) is of this nature, and what are called its seeds are the achaenia of
                    the numerous flowers scattered over the succulent hollowed receptacle. In
                    Dorstenia (fig. 163) the axis is less deeply hollowed, and of a harder texture,
                    the fruit exhibiting often very anomalous forms.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">strobilus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cone,</hi> is a
                    fruit-bearing spike, more or less elongated, covered with scales (fig. 134),
                    each of which represents a separate flower, and has often two seeds at its base,
                    the scales being considered as bracts and the seeds naked, and no true ovary
                    present with its style or stigma. This fruit is seen in the cones of Firs,
                    Spruces, Larches, and Cedars, which have received the name of Coniferae, or
                    cone-bearers, on this account. Cone-like fruit is also seen in some Cycadaceae.
                    The scales of the strobilus are sometimes thick and closely united, so as to
                    form a more or less angular and rounded mass, as in the Cypress; while in the
                    Juniper they become fleshy, and are so incorporated as to form a globular fruit
                    like a berry. The dry fruit of the Cypress, and the succulent fruit of the
                    Juniper, have received the name of <hi rend="italic">galbulus.</hi> The fruit of
                    the Yew (Taxus baccata) is regarded as a cone reduced to a single naked seed,
                    covered by succulent scales, which unite to form a scarlet fleshy envelope. In
                    the Hop the fruit is called also a strobilus, but in it the scales are thin and
                    membranous, and the seeds are not naked but are contained in pericarps.</p>
                <p>The same causes which produce alterations in the other parts of the flower give
                    rise to anomalous appearances in the fruit. The carpels, in place of bearing
                    seeds, are sometimes changed into leaves, with lobes at their margins. Leaves
                    are sometimes produced from the upper part of the fruit, which is then called
                    <hi rend="italic">frondiparous.</hi> In the genus Citrus, to whiclι the Orange
                    and Lemon belong, it is very common to meet with a separation of the carpels, so
                    as to produce what are called horned oranges and fingered citrons. In this case
                    a syncarpous fruit has a tendency to become apocarpous. In the Orange we
                    occasionally find a supernumerary row of carpels produced, giving rise to the
                    appearance of small and imperfect oranges enclosed within the original one. The
                    Navel Orange of Pernambuco is of this nature. It sometimes happens that, by the
                    union of flowers, double fruits are produced. Occasionally a double fruit is
                    produced, not by the incorporation of two flowers, but by the abnormal
                    development of a second carpel in the flower.</p>

                    Seed.</hi></p>
                <p>When the ovule arrives at maturity it constitutes the seed, which is contained in
                    a seed-vessel in the plants called <hi rend="italic">angiospermous</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> while in <hi rend="italic">gymnospermous plants,</hi> such
                    as Coniferae and Cycadaceae, it is naked, or, in other words, has no true
                    pericarp. It sometimes happens in angiosperms, that the seed-vessel is ruptured
                    at an early period of growth, so that the seeds become more or less exposed
                    during their development; this occurs in Mignonette, where the capsule opens at
                    the apex, and in Cuphea platycentra, where the placenta bursts through the ovary
                    and floral envelopes, and appears as an erect process bearing the young seeds.
                    After impregnation the ovule is greatly changed, in connection with the
                    formation of the embryo. In the embryo-sac of most angiosperms there is a
                    development of cellular tissue, enveloping, when not previously absorbed, the
                    <hi rend="italic">antipodal cells,</hi> and more or less filling the embryo sac.
                    In gymnosperms, as already mentioned, the endosperm is formed preparatory to
                    fertilization. The germinal vesicle in angiosperms, the central cell of the
                    corpuscle in cryptogams, enlarges and divides, forming the embryo. The
                    embryo-sac enlarges greatly, displacing gradually the nucleus, which may
                    eventually form merely a thin layer around the sac, or it may completely
                    disappear. The integuments also become much altered, and frequently appendages
                    are developed from them.</p>
                <p>The general integumentary covering of the seed is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >spermoderm.</hi> In it are recognized two parts, an <hi rend="italic">external
                    membrane,</hi> called the <hi rend="italic">episperm</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >testa</hi> (fig. 308, <hi rend="italic">te),</hi> and an <hi rend="italic"
                    >internal membrane,</hi> called <hi rend="italic">endopleura or tegmen, e,</hi>
                    which however is often incorporated with the testa, and hardly separable from
                    it. The testa may consist of a union of the primine and secundine, or of the
                    primine only, when, as occasionally happens, the secundine is absorbed; the
                    endopleura, of a combination betw een the outer layer of the nucleus (sometimes
                    termed the tercine), and the embryo-sac, or of one of these parts alone.
                    Sometimes the secundine remains distinct in the seed, forming what has been
                    called a <hi rend="italic">mesosperm</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when it
                    assumes a fleshy <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n163/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0163-0154"/> character, it has received the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">sarcosperm</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sarcoderm.</hi> The nature of
                    the testa depends upon that of the pericarp. When the pericarp is dehiscent then
                    the seed-covering is of a strong and tough character; but when the pericarp is
                    indehiscent and encloses the seed for a long period, its outer covering has a
                    proportional softness. The cells of the testa are often coloured, and have
                    projections and appendages of various kinds. Thus in Abrus precatorius and
                    Adenanthera pavonina it is of a bright red colour; in French beaus it is
                    beautifully mottled; in the Almond it is veined; in the Tulip and Primrose it is
                    rough; in the Snapdragon it is marked with depressions; in Cotton and Asclepias
                    (fig. 309) it has hairs attached to it; and in Mahogany, Bignonia, and Firs it
                    is expanded in the form of wing-like appendages (fig. 310). In Collomia,
                    Acantho-dium, and other seeds, it contains spiral cells, from which, when
                    moistened with water, the fibres uncoil in a beautiful manner; so also in Cobaea
                    scandens and Calempelis scaber. In the testa of the seed of Ulmus campestris the
                    cells are compressed, and their sinuous boundaries are traced out by minute
                    rectangular crystals adhering to their walls; and in such plants as the Flax
                    (Linum) the cells are converted into mucilage. These structural peculiarities of
                    the testa in different plants have relation to the scattering of the seed and
                    its germination upon a suitable nidus. But in some plants the pericarps assume
                    structures which subserve the same purpose; this especially occurs in small
                    pericarps enclosing single seeds, as achenes, caryopsides, &amp;c. Thus in
                    Compositae (fig. 197) and Valerian, the pappose limb of the calyx forms a
                    parachute to the pericarp; in Labiatae and some Compositae spiral cells are
                    formed in the epicarp; and the epicarp is prolonged as a wing in Fraxinus (fig.
                    281) and Acer (fig. 296).</p>
                <p>The endopleura (fig. 308, <hi rend="italic">e</hi>) is usually a thin and
                    transparent layer of cells underneath the testa, frequently incorporated with
                    it. It represents the outer layer of the cells of the nucleus, constituting the
                    tercine of the ovule, though frequently the embryo-sac is incorporated with it.
                    Sometimes there is an additional covering to the seed, formed after
                    fertilization, to which the name <hi rend="italic">arillus</hi> has been given
                    (fig. 311). This is seen in the Passion-flower, where the covering arises from
                    the placenta or extremity of the funiculus at the base of the ovule and passes
                    upwards towards the apex, leaving the micropyle uncovered. In the Nutmeg and
                    Spindle-tree this additional coat commences at the side of the exostome, and is
                    formed from above downwards, constituting in the former case a laciniated
                    scarlet covering called <hi rend="italic">mace.</hi> In such instances it has
                    been called by some an <hi rend="italic">arillode</hi> (fig. 312). This
                    arillode, after growing downwards, may be reflected upwards so as to cover the
                    foramen. The fleshy scarlet covering formed around the naked seed in the Yew is
                    by some considered of the nature of an aril. On the testa, at various points,
                    there are produced at times cellular bodies, which are not dependent on
                    fertilization, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">stropihioles,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">caruncules,</hi> has been given, the seeds being strophiolate or
                    carunculate. These tumours may occur near the base of the seed, as in Polygala,
                    or at the apex, as in Ricinus, where they are swellings of the exostome; or they
                    may occur in the course of the raphe, as in Blood-root and Asarabacca. The
                    funiculi of the ovules frequently attain a great length in the seed, and in some
                    Magnolias, when the fruit dehisces, they appear as long scarlet cords suspending
                    the seeds outside. The hilum or umbilicus of the seed is usually well marked, as
                    a scar of varying size, in the Calabar bean and in some species of Macuna and
                    Dolichos, extending along a large portion of the edge of the seed; and it
                    frequently exhibits marked colours, being black in the Bean, white in many
                    species’ of Phaseolus, &amp;c. The <hi rend="italic">micropyle</hi> (fig. 308,
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi>) of the seed, with its exostome and endostome, may be
                    recognizable by the naked eye, as in the Pea and Bean tribe, Iris, &amp;c., or
                    it may be very minute or microscopic. It indicates the true apex of the seed,
                    and is important as marking the point to which the root of the embryo is
                    directed. At the micropyle in the Bean is observed a small process of
                    integument, which, when the young plant sprouts, is pushed up like a lid, and is
                    called <hi rend="italic">embryotega.</hi> The chalaza (fig. 311, <hi
                    rend="italic">ch)</hi> is often of a different colour from the rest of the seed.
                    In the Orange (fig. 313) it is of a reddish-brown colour, and is easily
                    recognized at one end of the seed when the integuments are carefully removed. In
                    anatropal seeds the raphe forms a distinct ridge along one side of the seed
                    (fig. 314).</p>
                <p>The position of the seed as regards the pericarp resembles that of the ovule in
                    the ovary, and the same terms are applied—erect, ascending, pendulous,
                    suspended, curved, &amp;c. These terms have no reference to the mode in which
                    the fruit is attached to the axis. Thus the seed may be erect while the fruit
                    itself is pendent, in the ordinary meaning of that term. The part of the seed
                    next the axis or the ventral suture is its <hi rend="italic">face</hi>, the
                    opposite side being the <hi rend="italic">back.</hi> Seeds exhibit great
                    varieties of form. They may be flattened laterally (<hi rend="italic"
                    >compressed)</hi> or from above <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n164/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0164-0155"/> downwards <hi rend="italic">(depressed).</hi>
                    They may be round, oval, triangular, polygonal, rolled up like a snail, as in
                    Physostemon, or coiled up like a snake, as in Ophiocaryon paradoxum.</p>
                <p>The endosperm formed in the embryo-sac of angiosperms after fertilization, and
                    found previous to it in gymnosperms, consists of cells containing protoplasmic
                    substance and starchy or fatty matter, or both, destined for the nutriment of
                    the embryo. It arises by free-cell division from the protoplasm of the
                    embryo-sac,—and may occupy the whole cavity of the embryo-sac, or may be formed
                    only at certain portions of it, at the apex, as in Rhinanthus, at the base, as
                    in Vaccinium, or in the middle, as in Veronica. As the endosperm increases in
                    size along with the embryo-sac and the embryo, the substance of the original
                    nucleus of the ovule is gradually absorbed, and usually at last disappears
                    except the layer constituting the endopleura, and in some cases this goes also.
                    Sometimes, however, as in Musaceae, Cannaceae, Zingiberaceae, no endosperm is
                    formed; the celle of the original nucleus, becoming filled with food-materials
                    for the embryo, are not absorbed, but remain surrounding the embryo-sac with the
                    embryo, and constitute the <hi rend="italic">perisperm,.</hi> Again, in other
                    plants, as Nymphaeaceae (fig. 311) and Piperaceae, both endosperm and perisperm
                    are present. It was from observations on cases such as these that old authors,
                    imagining a resemblance betwixt the plant-ovule and the animal ovum, applied the
                    name <hi rend="italic">albumen</hi> to the outer nutrient mass or perisperm, and
                    designated the endosperm as <hi rend="italic">vitellus.</hi> The term albumen is
                    very generally used as including all the nutrient matter stored up as a separate
                    mass in the ovule, but it would be advisable to discard the name as implying a
                    definite chemical substance. There is a large class of plants in which although
                    at first after fertilization a mass of endosperm is formed, yet, as the embryo
                    increases in size, the nutrient matter from the endospermic cells passes out
                    from them, and is absorbed by the cells of the embryo plant. In the mature seed,
                    in such cases, there is no separate mass of tissue containing nutrient
                    food-material apart from the embryo itself. Such a seed is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">exalbuminous,</hi> as in Compositae, Cruciferae, and most
                    Leguminosae. When either endosperm or perisperm or both are present the seed is
                    said to be <hi rend="italic">albuminous.</hi></p>
                <p>The albumen varies much in its nature and consistence, and furnishes important
                    characters. It may be <hi rend="italic">farinaceous</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >mealy,</hi> consisting chiefly of cells filled with starch, as in cereal
                    grains, where it is abundant <hi rend="italic">; fleshy</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">cartilaginous,</hi> consisting of thicker cells which are still
                    soft, as in the Coco-nut, and which sometimes contain oil, as in the oily
                    albumen of Croton, Ricinus, and Poppy; <hi rend="italic">horny,</hi> when the
                    cell-walls are slightly thickened and capable of distension, as in Date and
                    Coffee; and they sometimes become greatly thickened, filling up the testa as a
                    hard mass, as in Vegetable Ivory. The albumen may be uniform throughout, or it
                    may present a mottled appearance, as in the Nutmeg, the seeds of Anonaceae, and
                    some Palms, where it is called <hi rend="italic">ruminated.</hi> This mottled
                    appearance is due to a protrusion of a dark lamella of the endopleura between
                    folded protuberances of albumen. The endosperm within the embryo-sac is
                    developed from the protoplasm of that sac, but in many cases as it grows inward
                    the whole protoplasm is not converted into a solid mass, but a cavity is left in
                    the centre which is usually filled with fluid, as in the Coco-nut. In the
                    thickened albumen of this Palm, as well as in that of the Attalea funifera, the
                    Date, and the Doum Palm, the small cavity in the centre and radiating spaces are
                    well seen under the microscope. The albumen is a store of matter laid up for the
                    nourishment of the embryo. The relative size of the embryo and of the endosperm
                    varies much. In Monocotyledons the embryo is usually small, and the endosperm
                    large, and the same is true in the case of Coffee and many other plants amongst
                    Dicotyledons. The opposite is the case in other plants, as in the Labiatae,
                    Plumbaginaceae, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In angiosperms after fertilization the embryonal vesicle undergoes changes by
                    which the embryo plant is eventually formed. The portion of the vesicle nearest
                    the apex of the embryo-sac coalesces with it. The lower portion enlarges and
                    lengthens greatly, and divides by transverse partition until a large terminal
                    cell is formed at the extremity of a <hi rend="italic">suspensor or
                    proembryo</hi> (figs. 316, 317), formed of smaller cells. It is this terminal
                    cell which immediately forms the embryo. By longitudinal growth the terminal
                    cell becomes pushed into the endosperm (when present) of the sac, and becomes
                    completely surrounded by it. In the lower part of the central cell of
                    gymnosperms a cell is produced which divides until a proembryo is formed, which
                    elongates and bursts through the central cell. The divisions in this proembryo
                    take place so that several suspensors are formed, penetrating the endosperm.
                    Usually, each of these elongates and bears a large cell at its extremity, which
                    becomes an embryo; thus polyembryony occurs. The terminal cell of the proembryo
                    in both angiosperms and gymnosperms increases in size, and divides repeatedly,
                    until a cellular axis is formed. This is the rudiment of the embryo. Upon this
                    axial mass, one, two, or more rounded cellular protuberances appear, the
                    indications of the first leaves or cotyledons; and at the point where the embryo
                    joins the proembryo is intercalated a mass of cellular tissue forming the <hi
                    rend="italic">hypophysis,</hi> from which subsequently the young root or radicle
                    is formed. The axial mass continues to grow, and soon a differentiation is
                    observable into an outer peripheral layer, the <hi rend="italic">dermatogen</hi>
                    or primordial epidermis, covering over the central mass, which soon is
                    distinguishable into a <hi rend="italic">plerome</hi> or axial mass, from which
                    the fibro-vascular bundles develop, and a portion between it and the
                    dermatogen,—the <hi rend="italic">periblem</hi> or primordial cortex. After this
                    has been formed a differentiation. takes place in the hypophysis, by which an
                    upper and a lower layer of cells is formed. The upper divides into two layers,
                    the lower of which forms a continuation of the dermatogen of the axial mass, the
                    upper being continuous with the central portion of the axis. The lowermost cells
                    of the hypophysis form the first layer of the root-cap. Lateral roots are
                    frequently given off from <pb break="no"

                    these arise as cellular processes from the outer or pericambial layer of the
                    plerome in the hypocotyledonary portion of the axis. The primary root of the
                    embryo is, by reason of its formation, always directed to the micropyle In
                    Monocotyledons and some Dicotyledons the young root rises deep in the tissues of
                    the embryo, which, when it sprouts, form a sheath or coleorhiza around it. The
                    lateral roots have also sheaths.</p>
                <p>The embryo then consists of <hi rend="italic">cotyledons</hi> (figs. 52, 53, 58,
                    c), or the first leaves of the plant produced upon a cellular axial mass. To
                    that part of this axis immediately beneath the cotyledons the terms <hi
                    rend="italic">hypocotyledonary portion, caulicle,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tigellus (t)</hi> have been applied, and continuous backwards with it is the
                    young root or <hi rend="italic">radicle</hi> (r), the descending axis, their
                    point of union being the <hi rend="italic">collum,</hi> collar, or neck. The
                    terminal growing bud of the axis is called the <hi rend="italic">plumule</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">gemmule (g),</hi> and represents the ascending axis. That
                    extremity of the embryo which produces the first leaves or cotyledons is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">cotyledonary</hi> extremity of the embryo, while the
                    opposite is the <hi rend="italic">radicular</hi> extremity. The radicular
                    extremity being continuous with the suspensor points towards the micropyle (fig.
                    318), or the summit of the nucleus, an important fact in practical botany; while
                    the cotyledonary extremity is pointed towards the base of the nucleus or the
                    chalaza. Hence, by ascertaining the position of the micropyle and chalaza, the
                    two extremities of the embryo can in general be discovered. In some rare
                    instances, in consequence of a thickening in the coats of the seed, as in
                    Ricinuβ and some other Euphorbiaceae, there is an alteration in the micropyle,
                    so that the radicle does not point directly to it. It is in many cases difficult
                    to recognize the parts in an embryo; thus in Cuscuta, the embryo appears as an
                    elongated axis without divisions; and in Caryocar butyrosum, the mass of the
                    embryo is made up by the radicular extremity and tigelle, in a groove of which
                    the cotyledonary extremity lies embedded. In some Monocotyledonous embryos, as
                    in Orchidaceae, the parts of the embryo of the ripe seed are not differentiated,
                    and only become so after germination. In parasitic plants which form no
                    chlorophyll, as Orobanche, Monotropa, &amp;c., the embryo remains without
                    differentiation, consisting merely of a mass of cells until the ripening of the
                    seed. When the embryo is surrounded by the endosperm on all sides except its
                    radicular extremity it becomes <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">intrarius;</hi> when lying outside the endosperm, and only coming
                    into contact with it at certain points, it is <hi rend="italic">external</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">extranus.</hi> When the embryo follows the direction of the
                    axis of the seed, it is <hi rend="italic">axile</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >axial</hi> (fig. 318), and it may be either <hi rend="italic">external,</hi> so
                    as to come into contact with the endosperm only by its cotyledonary apex, or <hi
                    rend="italic">internal.</hi> In the latter case the radicular extremity may, as
                    in some Coniferae, become incorporated with the endosperm apparently by means of
                    a thickened suspensor. When the embryo is not in the direction of the axis, it
                    becomes <hi rend="italic">dbaxüe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">abaxial;</hi> and in
                    this case it may be either straight or curved, internal or external. In
                    campylotropal seeds the embryo is curved, and in place of being embedded in
                    endosperm, is frequently external to it, following the concavity of the seed
                    (fig. 319), and becoming <hi rend="italic">peripherical,</hi> with the chalaza
                    situated in the curvature of the embryo, as in Caryophyllaceae</p>
                <p>It has been already stated that the radicle of the embryo is directed to the
                    micropyle, and the cotyledons to the chalaza. In some cases, by the growth of
                    the integuments, the former is turned round so as not to correspond with the
                    apex of the nucleus, and then the embryo has the radicle directed to one side,
                    and is called <hi rend="italic">excentric,</hi> as is seen in Primulaceae,
                    Plantaginaceae, and many Palms, especially the Date. The position of the embryo
                    in different kinds of seeds varies. In an orthotropal seed the embryo is
                    inverted or <hi rend="italic">antitropal,</hi> the radicle pointing to the apex
                    of the seed, or to the part opposite the hilum. Again, in an anatropal seed the
                    embryo is <hi rend="italic">erect</hi> or <hi rend="italic">homo-tropal</hi>
                    (fig. 318), the radicle being directed to the base of the seed. In some
                    anatropal seeds, as in Castor oil, the exostome is thickened or carunculate, and
                    the endostome does not correspond exactly to it, so that the radicle of the
                    embryo is directed to a point a little removed from the exostome. In curved or
                    campylotropal seeds the embryo is folded so that its radicular and cotyledonary
                    extremities are approximated, and it becomes <hi rend="italic">amphitropal.</hi>
                    In this instance the seed may be exalbuminous, and the embryo may be folded on
                    itself; or albuminous, the embryo surrounding more or less completely the
                    endosperm, and being peripherical. According to the mode in which the seed is
                    attached to the pericarp, the radicle may be directed upwards or downwards, or
                    laterally, as regards the ovary. In an orthotropal seed attached to the base of
                    the pericarp it is superior, as also in a suspended anatropal seed. In other
                    anatropal seeds the radical is inferior. When the seed is horizontal as regards
                    the pericarp, the radicle is either centrifugal, when it points to the outer
                    wall of the ovary; or centripetal, when it points to the axis or inner wall of
                    the ovary.</p>
                <p>Plants in which there are two cotyledons produced in the embryo are <hi
                    rend="italic">Dicotyledonous.</hi> The form of this embryo varies much; and
                    although sometimes resembling in its general aspect that of Monocotyledons, yet
                    it is always distinguished by a division taking place at the cotyledonary
                    extremity (fig. 317), by which two, more or less evident, lobes are formed. The
                    two cotyledons thus formed are opposite to each other (figs. 58 and 320). The
                    cotyledons are not always, however, of the same size. Thus, in a species of
                    Hiraea, one of them is smaller than the other; and in Carapa guianensis there
                    appears to be only one, in consequence of the intimate union which takes place
                    between the two. The union between the cotyledonary leaves may continue after
                    the young plant begins to germinate. Such embryos have been called <hi
                    rend="italic">pseudo-monocotyledonous.</hi> The texture of the cotyledons
                    varies. They may be thick, as in the Pea (fig. 58), exhibiting only slight
                    traces of venation, with their flat internal surfaces in contact, and their
                    backs more or less convex; or they may be in the form of thin and delicate
                    laminae, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n166/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0166-0157"/> flattened on both sides, and having distinct
                    venation, as in Ricinus, Jatropha, Euonymus, &amp;c. In the former case they are
                    called <hi rend="italic">fleshy,</hi> or seminal lobes; in the latter, <hi
                    rend="italic">foliaceous,</hi> or seminal leaves. The cotyledons usually form
                    the greater part of the mature embryo, and this is remarkably well seen in such
                    exalbumiuous seeds as the Bean and Pea.</p>
                <p>Cotyledons are ’usually entire and sessile. But they occasionally become lobod,
                    as in the Walnut and the Lime, where there are five lobes; or petiolate, as in
                    Geranium molle; or auriculate, as in the Ash. Like leaves in the bud, cotyledons
                    may be either applied directly to each other, or may be folded in various ways.
                    In Geranium the cotyledons a. a twisted and doubled; in Convolvulus they are
                    corrugated; and in the Potato and in Bunias, they are spiral,—the same terms
                    being applied as to the foliage leaves. The radicle and cotyledons may be either
                    straight or curved in various ways. Thus, in some Cruciferous plants, as the
                    Wallflower, the cotyledons are applied by their faces, and the radicle (fig.
                    321) is folded on their edges, so as to be <hi rend="italic">lateral;</hi> the
                    cotyledons are here <hi rend="italic">accumbent.</hi> In others, as the
                    Hesperis, the cotyledons (fig. 322) are applied to each other by their faces,
                    and the radicle, <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> is folded on their back, so as to be
                    <hi rend="italic">dorsal,</hi> and the cotyledons are <hi rend="italic"
                    >incumbent.</hi> Again, the cotyledons are <hi rend="italic">conduplicate</hi>
                    when the radicle is dorsal, and enclosed between their folds. In other divisions
                    the radicle is folded in a spiral manner, and the cotyledons follow the same
                    course.</p>
                <p>I In many gymnosperms more than two cotyledons are present, and they are arranged
                    in a whorl. This occurs in Coniferae, especially in the Fir (fig. 323), Spruce,
                    and Larch, in which six, nine, twelve, and even fifteen have been observed. They
                    are linear, and resemble in their form and mode of development the clustered or
                    fasciculated leaves of the Larch. Plants having numerous cotyledons are
                    occasionally denominated <hi rend="italic">pdlycotyledonous.</hi> In the
                    gymnospermous genus Welwitschia, there are two cotyledons which last throughout
                    its life (more than a century), and in the course of time they grow to an
                    enormous size, being sometimes six feet long and two or three feet in breadth.
                    They constitute the only leaves of the plant. In species of Strepto∙ carpus the
                    cotyledons are also permanent, and act the part of leaves. One of them is
                    frequently largely developed, while the other is small or abortive.</p>
                <p>In those plants in which there is only a single cotyledon (fig. 53) in the
                    embryo, hence called <hi rend="italic">Monocotyledonous,</hi> the embryo usually
                    has a cylindrical form more or less rounded at the extremities, or elongated and
                    fusiform, often oblique. The axis is usually very short compared with the
                    cotyledon, which in general encloses the plumule by its lower portion, and
                    exhibits on one side a small slit which indicates the union of the edges of the
                    vaginal or sheathing portion of the leaf (fig. 324). In Grasses, by the
                    enlargement of the embryo in a particular direction, the endosperm is pushed on
                    one side, and thus the embryo comes to lie outside at the base of the endosperm.
                    The lamina of the cotyledon is not developed. Upon the side of the embryo next
                    the endosperm and enveloping it is a large shieldshaped body, termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">scutellum.</hi> This is by some authors considered to be an
                    outgrowth from the hypocotyledonary portion of the axis or expansion of the
                    radicular extremity, enveloping more or less the cotyledon and plumule, in some
                    cases, as in Maize, completely investing it; in other cases, as in Rice, merely
                    sending small prolongations over its anterior face at the apex. By others this
                    scutellum is considered as the true cotyledon, and the sheathing structure
                    covering the plumule is regarded as a ligule or axillary stipule. In several
                    other Monocotyledonous plants, as Ruppia and Zostera, this scuteliar structure
                    is well seen, and in these cases its homology, as an expansion of the radicular
                    extremity of the embryo, is clearly discernible; and this is further borne out
                    by such cases as that of Caryocar butyrosum among Dicotyledons, where the
                    radicular swelling occupies most of the embryo (fig. 326). In some Grasses, as
                    Oats and Rice, a projection of cellular tissue is seen upon the side of the
                    embryo opposite to the scutellum, that is, on the anterior side. This has been
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">epiblast.</hi> It is very large in Rice. This by
                    some was considered the rudimentary second cotyledon; but this is impossible, as
                    it arises outside, and after the first cotyledon. It is merely an outgrowth of
                    the radicular extremity like the scutellum. The radicular portion of the axis is
                    usually shorter than the cotyledon, and more dense in structure; but in some
                    instances it becomes much larger, giving rise to what has been called a <hi
                    rend="italic">macropodous</hi> embryo.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Female Organs and Reproduction in Cryptogams.</hi></p>
                <p>The female organs of reproduction, like the male organs, have not been
                    demonstrated in all Cryptogams. In all vascular Cryptogams, and in Mosses and

                    new plants (fig. 54). These archegonia have the general structure of a large
                    cell, the <hi rend="italic">central cell</hi> or <hi rend="italic">oosphere</hi>
                    (c) surrounded by a layer of smaller cells. From the apex of this oosphere leads
                    a canal, which is bounded by four rows of small cells and constitutes the <hi
                    rend="italic">neck,</hi> and in it is a large cell full of soft mucilaginous
                    matter, which has been formed from the central cell, and is the <hi
                    rend="italic">canal cell.</hi> Upon the wall of the oosphere, turned towards the
                    neck, a small portion different from the surrounding part is the <hi
                    rend="italic">receptive spot.</hi> Fertilization is effected by the anthérozoïde
                    freed from the antheridium, penetrating the neck of the archegonium, and
                    eventually reaching the receptive spot of the central cell or oosphere; they
                    then enter the oosphere and coalesce with it. The fertilized oosphere is termed
                    an <hi rend="italic">oospore,</hi> and it then may escape from the archegonium,
                    and sooner or later germinates; or it germinates within the archegonial cells.
                    These archegonia are, in vascular Cryptogams, produced upon a cellular expansion
                    formed asexually from a spore, and termed the <hi rend="italic">prothallus
                    (flζ.</hi> 245), which is of varying size and form. Both archegonia and
                    antheridia may be formed on one prothallus, or only one form of organ may be
                    produced, thus indicating a tendency to diclinisπι.</p>
                <p>In Characeae the female organ has a peculiar structure, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n167/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0167-0158"/> and is termed a <hi rend="italic">nucule</hi>
                    (fig. 240, ?i). This consists of a large <hi rend="italic">central cell,</hi> of
                    which the contents a't the apex are clear and hyaline, while the lower part
                    contains much starch and fat. Rising from its base and twisting round it are
                    five long tubes (fig. 328), at the extremity of each of which abovo the apex of
                    the central cell is a single short cell in Chara, while in Nitella it is divided
                    transversely into two. These five or ten short cells form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >crown.</hi> They unite together so that their apices project as small teeth.
                    Between the crown and the apex of the central cell, which is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">apical papilla,</hi> a cavity is included, bounded at the sides by
                    the five enveloping tubes, which at this point form the of the nucule. The
                    cavity of the neck is constricted in the middle by the projection inwards of the
                    tubes to form a sort of diaphragm, so that the enclosed cavity has a rude
                    hour-glass-like shape, the upper cavity closed above by the crown being
                    connected by a narrow canal with a lower cavity bounded beneath by the apical
                    papilla of the central cell. When fertilization takes place slits are formed
                    betwixt the five tubes of the neck, beneath the crown and above the diaphragm.
                    The antherozoids from the globule enter by them into the upper cavity, pass
                    through the canal into the lower one, and fuse with the apical papilla of the
                    central cell or oosphere. The oospore thus formed becomes detached from the
                    plant, being covered by the thickened inner wall of the tube which invested it.
                    The nucule rises from the base of one of the whorl leaves in Chara, and is
                    therefore above the globule; in Nitella it is produced upon the leafy axis
                    beneath the globule.</p>
                <p>In Mosses the archegonia are frequently situated along with the antheridia and
                    paraphyses. They are surrounded by the same whorl of leaves, or <hi
                    rend="italic">perichoetium,</hi> when the moss is said to be hermaphrodite, or
                    they occur separately on the same or on different plants, the moss being then
                    monoecious or dioecious. The term <hi rend="italic">perigone</hi> is applied to
                    the whorl of leaves around the antheridia. The basal portion of the archegonia
                    which surrounds the oosphere is termed the <hi rend="italic">epigone.</hi> In
                    Hepaticae the archegonia (fig. 329) are situated in the substance of the thallus
                    itself, or they may be in various situations, as in Jungermannia (fig. 330); in
                    Marchantia they are produced upon the under surface of a stalked stellate disk
                    (fig. 331).</p>
                <p>In many Thallogens no structure analogous to a female organ has been as yet
                    discovered; in some, however, such structures have been met with. Thus amongst
                    Algae large cells, termed <hi rend="italic">oogonia,</hi> are found, in which
                    usually one, sometimes many (Fucaceae), oosphères are produced (fig. 332). The
                    antherozoids from the antheridium fertilize these, penetrating the oogonia at a
                    definite point thinner than the surrounding portion; and oospores are formed. In
                    the Florideae, a group of Algae, the organs are different in character. Here the
                    antherozoids are not motile, having no cilia. On discharge from the antheridium,
                    these are washed into a long filiform hollow body, termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >trichogynium.</hi> This is supported usually upon a cellular stalk—the <hi
                    rend="italic">tτichophore—</hi> at the side of the base of which is a small
                    cellular mass. The antherozoids having entered the trichogynium, fertilization
                    is effected, and results in the formation, from the cellular mass at the base of
                    the trichophore, of a large cell, the <hi rend="italic">cystocarp,</hi> in which
                    spores are formed. In the Saprolegnieae the antheridia actually penetrate into
                    the oogonium and discharge their antherozoids. Amongst Fungi it is rare to find
                    sexual organe. In some thecasporous fungi, as Eurotium, a sexual process has
                    been observed. The female organ, here termed <hi rend="italic">ascogonium</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">carpogonium,</hi> is of a spiral elongated character,
                    immediately surrounding which are the antheridia, few in number, which open into
                    the apex of the female organ, and discharge their antherozoids. The result is
                    the formation of cellular tissue round the ascogonium, forming what is termed a
                    <hi rend="italic">perithecium,</hi> and within the ascogonium large cells <hi
                    rend="italic">(asci)</hi> are produced, in which spores <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n168/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0168-0159"/> or sporidia are subsequently developed. In
                    Lichens no sexual organs have as yet been clearly demonstrated.</p>
                <p>Amongst Fungi and Lichens there are certain bodies to be noted, which may be
                    connected with sexual reproduction, but the function of which is at present
                    unknown. Embedded in the margin of the thallus in Lichens and on various parts
                    of the plant in Fungi, certain hollow urnshaped bodies are found, which have
                    been termed <hi rend="italic">spermagones</hi> (conceptacles) (fig. 334). These
                    are usually closed all but a small opening at the apex. From their base rise
                    peg-shaped projections or <hi rend="italic">sterigmata</hi> (fig. 335), bearing
                    at their summit elongated, sometimes curved, bodies, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >spermatia,</hi> which, when mature, are discharged through the apex of the
                    spermagone. These are by some considered the analogues of the anthérozoïde in
                    other Cryptogams. There are also found other conceptacles, to which the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">pycnidia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pycnides</hi> is given.
                    These contain large spores, which have been termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >stylospores</hi> (fig. 336), but their homology is at present unknown.</p>
                <p>Another process of reproduction is seen amongst Cryptogams. This is termed <hi
                    rend="italic">conjugation</hi> (fig. 333). It differs from the process of
                    fertilization just described in that it consists of a union of the contents of
                    two similar cells, whilst fertilization essentially consists in the mutual
                    influence of dissimilar cells. It is well seen in many Algae, such as Diatoms,
                    Volvocineae, Conjugatae, also in some Fungi, such as species of Rhizopus and
                    Zyzygites. It may consist in the coming together of two cells,—either moving
                    spores, as in Pandorinia, or motionless, as in Diatoms,—which completely fuse,
                    and a compound spore, or <hi rend="italic">zygospore,</hi> results; or
                    prolongations of the wall of two adjacent cells meet, the partition between the
                    two gives way and the contents from the one pass into the other, and a zygospore
                    is formed, as in Zygnema. Zygospores germinate only after a long period of
                    rest.</p>
                <p>Amongst Thallogens especially, though it also occurs in other Cryptogams, the
                    asexual mode of reproduction is very common. But the manner of formation and the
                    nature of the spores is diversified.</p>
                <p>Amongst Algae two modes of asexual reproduction are seen,—by motile spores and by
                    motionless or resting spores. In the former case the contents of a cell form a
                    new cell, which escapes from the mother-cell, and moves about by means of cilia,
                    which are formed either all round it, as in Vaucheria (fig. 337), or as a tuft
                    at one end, as in Oedogonium. These are termed <hi rend="italic">swarm
                    spores,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">zoospores,</hi> and frequently are of
                    different sizes, being termed respectively <hi rend="italic">microgonidia</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">macrogonidia.</hi> After swimming about for a time they
                    fix themselves, and develop small rhizoids from one extremity, the other growing
                    up into the plant. The motionless spores are seen in the Florideae, where they
                    are formed in cells, four in each, attached together in a row, or as a
                    tetrahedron, constituting the <hi rend="italic">tetraspore</hi> (fig. 338).</p>
                <p>Amongst Fungi asexual reproduction is very common. Swarm spores are rarely
                    formed; but the mode of formation of motionless spores is very various. They may
                    be produced in the interior of distinct sacs called <hi rend="italic"
                    >thecoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">asci,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cystidia</hi>
                    (fig. 339), when they are denominated <hi rend="italic">endospores</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ascospores,</hi> and the plants are said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >thecasporous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ascosporous.</hi> When they are
                    developed on the exterior of sacs called <hi rend="italic">basidia</hi> (fig.
                    340), they are denominated <hi rend="italic">exospores,</hi> and the plants are
                    <hi rend="italic">basi-</hi><hi rend="italic">diosporous.</hi> When produced in
                    the midst of a gelatinous mass, without any evident differentiation, they are
                    called <hi rend="italic">myxospores,</hi> the plants being <hi rend="italic"
                    >myxosporous.</hi> Both the endospores and the exospores may by division become
                    <hi rend="italic">septate,</hi> and form <hi rend="italic">compound spores,</hi>
                    each of the secondary spores so formed being termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >merispore.</hi> Four or eight basidiospores are usually produced from each
                    basidium. In the asci numerous spores are formed. Other forms of spores seen in
                    Fungi are the conûiïct. These are stalked spores which arise from a
                    mycelium.</p>
                <p>In Lichens we find asci which produce spores or sporidia just as in Fungi; and in
                    addition there also exist spermogones with their sterigmata and spermatia as
                    well as pycnides and stylospores. Besides the spores there are organs called <hi
                    rend="italic">soredia</hi> in Lichens. These are groups of small round cells or
                    <hi rend="italic">gonidia</hi> (fig. 97), surrounded by hyphae, which are
                    capable of independent growth after removal from the thallus. These gonidia are
                    now regarded by many as an Alga, upon which the hypha, which is supposed to be
                    an ascomycetous Fungus, is parasitic.</p>
                <p>In Chara a curious mode of asexual reproduction is seen which presents several
                    well-marked modifications, the process always proceeding at the nodes, and
                    consisting in the growth of a new axis from a nodal cell either isolated or
                    united with other cells.</p>
                <p>In all vascular Cryptogams, Muscîneae, and many Thallogens, that process of
                    development in which successive different generations are produced finally
                    returning to the original form, usually termed alternation of generations, is
                    well seen. The number of such generations varies.</p>

                <p>Amongst Ferns the oospore germinates and produces an asexual generation. The
                    embryo plant formed from this spore is a simple mass of cellular tissue, no
                    cotyledons being formed. This, then, is an <hi rend="italic">Acotyledonous</hi>
                    embryo (fig. 54). The same happens in other vascular Cryptogams, which are
                    therefore also Acotyledonous. The embryo so formed has a primary meristem, with
                    an apical cell, by division of which it increases in size,—roots being formed
                    downwards and a leaf-bearing axis upwards, upon which, eventually, the <hi
                    rend="italic">fructification</hi> (fig. 341) is formed. This consists in Ferns
                    of the production of either stalked or sessilo spore-cases or <hi rend="italic"
                    >sporangia,</hi> from the epidermis on the back (Aspidium) cr edges (Pteris) of
                    a leaf (frond), or upon a special branching axis (Osmunda), or a spicate one
                    (Ophioglossum). These, when situated on the frond, arc arranged in definite
                    clusters or <hi rend="italic">sori</hi> (fig. 342), either rounded or elongated.
                    With the sporangia are usually associated jointed cells or <hi rend="italic"
                    >paraphyses.</hi> Frequently the sori are covered by a thin cellular layer
                    forming an <hi rend="italic">indusium</hi> or involucre, or the margin of the
                    frond folds over them, forming a false indusium. Within the sporangium spores
                    are produced, and when ripe these escape by the rupture of the sporangium, this
                    in many cases being provided for by the formation, at a definite point, of an
                    <hi rend="italic">annulus</hi> or ring (fig. 343) of unequally thickened cells.
                    Hence some Ferns are <hi rend="italic">annulate,</hi> others <hi rend="italic"
                    >exannulate.</hi> The cell-wall of each spore is divisible into an outer layer
                    or <hi rend="italic">exospore,</hi> and an inner or <hi rend="italic"
                    >endospore.</hi> When the spore reaches the soil it germinates, and after a
                    longer or shorter period produces t he sexual generation. In this process the
                    variously marked exospore is ruptured by the enlarging endospore, which divides
                    so as eventually to form a flattened cellular expansion or <hi rend="italic"
                    >prothallus</hi> (fig. 344) with small cellular <hi rend="italic">rhizoids.</hi>
                    Upon this, usually on the under surface, the sexual organs, consisting cf
                    antheridia and archegonia, are produced. A tendency to <hi rend="italic"
                    >dioecïsm</hi> is observed in prothalli, frequently producing only one kind of
                    sexual organs. By the mutual influence of those sexual organs an oospore is
                    formed, from which a new asexual generation arises. Thus in Ferns the
                    alternation consists of two dissimilar generations,—a sexual or prothallial
                    generation, and an asexual generation.</p>
                <p>In Equisetaceae the same alternation of two dissimilar generations occurs. Upon
                    an asexual generation the fructification is formed at the apex of a leaf-bearing
                    axis. Peltate hexagonal stalked scales (fig. 345) are arranged in close whorls
                    round the apex of the axis, forming a pyramidal head (fig. 346, ∕), the surface
                    of the scales being directed tangentially to the axis. Round the margin of tho
                    inner surface of these scales the sporangia are produced projecting towards the
                    axis. When ripe each sporangium opens towards the stalk of the scale, and the

                    which are very hygroscopic. By germination of these spores a sexual generation
                    or prothallus is formed.</p>
                <p>In Lycopodiaceae a sexual process has not been observed in all genera; but in
                    Selaginella and Isoetes, where it has been observed, it is exceedingly
                    instructive, as it forms a connecting link between the process as seen in
                    Cryptogams and that observed in Angiosperms. The asexual generation produces the
                    fructification which consists in the formation of a single sporangium in the
                    axil of each leaf of a certain part of the axis. In those genera iu which sexual
                    organs have been discovered these sporangia are of two sizes, termed <hi
                    rend="italic">macrosporangia</hi> (fig. 347) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >microsporangia</hi> respectively. The whole fructification frequently forms a
                    spike. In the <hi rend="italic">macrosporangium</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >oophoridium</hi> few, usually four, largo spores <hi rend="italic"
                    >(macrospores')</hi> are formed, having each an exospore and an endospore. In
                    the microsporangium (fig. 248) numerous small spores or microspores are formed
                    of a similar structure. When the sporangia are shed the capsule decays, and the
                    spores escape. Within the endospore of the macrospore, a development of cellular
                    tissue takes place which eventually completely fills it and constitutes <hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> Ülq</hi><hi rend="italic">prothallus,</hi> termed
                    sometimes on this account <hi rend="italic">endothallus</hi> (fig. 348). As it
                    increases in size the exospore is ruptured triradiately, and the endospore
                    projecting is also ruptured, and thus the prothallus is protruded, in the
                    substance of which archegonia are formed. The microspores, on the other hand,
                    produce within their endospore, sometimes after the formation of a rudimentary
                    prothallus, antherozoid mother-cells, which are discharged by the rupture of the
                    exospore and endospore (fig. 249). By fertilization of the oosphere of the
                    archegonium an oospore is formed, from which the sexual generation arises. The
                    embryo is formed from the lower part of the oospore, the upper half elongates
                    and forms a <hi rend="italic">sτιspensor</hi> (fig. 349) of several cells, by
                    which the embryo is pushed downwards into the substance of the prothallium, and
                    there develops into a young plant, rudimentary cotyledons being formed upon the
                    young axis. It will be observed that this process resembles very much the mode
                    of embryogeny in Phanerogams, and, indeed, from this it is but a step to the
                    form found in Gymnosperms and thence to Phanerogams.</p>
                <p>In Rhizocarps the sporangia are formed in the interior of ovoid sacs, termed <hi
                    rend="italic">sporocarps</hi> (fig. 350), which arc usually supported on stalks,
                    and rise from the leaves near their base, one or many on the same stalk. In each
                    sporocarp, microsporangia and macrosporangia are formed in various positions;
                    and a prothallium (fig. 351) is formed iu the macrospore, as in Lycopodiaceae.
                    From the oospores formed in it the embryos are produced, but without
                    suspensors.</p>
                <p>In Characeae there is an alternation of a sexual with an asexual condition. From
                    the oospore a small proembryo is first formed, from a cell of which the sexual
                    plant is developed.</p>
                <p>In Mosses the sexual generations are produced as lateral shoots from a
                    filamentous <hi rend="italic">proenibryo</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >protonema</hi> (fig. 352). Upon this leaf-bearing axis either at the apex
                    (acrocarpous) or laterally (pleurocarpous) the sexual organs arise. The asexual
                    generation rises from the oospore and constitutes what is usually termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">fruit</hi> (fig. 353) of the moss. It has been designated the <hi
                    rend="italic">sporogonium.</hi> The sporogonium is formed by the enlargement of
                    the oospore into an ovoid embryo which presses against the epigone, finally
                    rupturing it, and carries the upper portion upwards with it as the <hi
                    rend="italic">calyptra</hi> or cap, the lower portion forming a sheath or <hi
                    rend="italic">vaginula</hi> at the base. This calyptra may be either split on
                    one side, <hi rend="italic">dimidiate,</hi> or entire, then termed <hi
                    rend="italic">mitriform.</hi> The upper part of the sporogonium forms a <hi
                    rend="italic">capsule, um</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> or <hi

                    forming the <hi rend="italic">apophysis</hi> (fig. 354, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a).</hi> In Sphagnum the sporogonium is fully developed within the epigonal
                    leaves, and when complete the axis beneath it elongates, forming the <hi
                    rend="italic">pseudopodium,</hi> and projects considerably beyond the
                    perichaetium. The walls of the capsule of the sporogonium consist of several
                    layers of cells. It has a central axis or <hi rend="italic">columella,</hi>
                    surrounding which aro the <hi rend="italic">spores.</hi> When mature the capsule
                    usually dehisces, either by four longitudinal valves, as in Andraea, or most
                    commonly by a lid or <hi rend="italic">operculum</hi> (fig. 355), between which
                    and the capsule an <hi rend="italic">annulus</hi> or ring of cells is separated.
                    On removal of the operculum the stoma or opening of the capsule is seen. The
                    margin of this is sometimes entire <hi rend="italic">(gymnostomn),</hi> more
                    usually fringed with <hi rend="italic">teeth</hi> or cellular prolongations,
                    constituting a <hi rend="italic">peristome</hi> (fig. 355, <hi rend="italic"
                    >p),</hi> cither in one row <hi rend="italic">(aploperistomi)</hi> or in two
                    rows <hi rend="italic">(diploperistomi).</hi> Stretching across the mouth of the
                    capsule is frequently seen a thin cellular membrane, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >epiphragm</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tympanum,</hi> as in Polytrichum. The
                    spores shed from the capsule germinate and give rise to the proembryo which by
                    budding gives off the sexual plants.</p>

                    small proembryo is first formed. The <hi rend="italic">sporogonium</hi> is of
                    various forms, and originates differently in different groups from the oospore.
                    It is always formed within a cellular covering or epigone. In Anthoceros the
                    sporogonia are elongated and open by two valves, and there is a central cellular
                    columella. In Jungermannia the sporogonia are globular, and open by four
                    spreading valves. There is no central column, but the inner wall displays
                    cellules, called <hi rend="italic">elaters,</hi> fixed by one extremity, and
                    containing one or two spiral fibres which by their elasticity scatter the
                    spores. In Riccia the sporogonia are globular, and there are neither elaters nor
                    columella.</p>
                <p>Very little is known of the sexual reproduction of Fungi, and regarding the
                    alternation of sexual and asexual generations in them. But we have abundant
                    instances of alternation amongst the asexual generations, and along with this of
                    that curious phenomenon included under the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >heteroecism,</hi> which consists in the growth of one generation of a parasitic
                    Fungus upon one host, and the development of another generation upon a different
                    host. By tracing out this phenomenon, many forms, described formerly as distinct
                    species, are now shown to be generations of one and the same Fungus. The asexual
                    spores of Fungi are produced upon certain structures which have been frequently
                    termed the fructification. For instance, in basidiosporous Fungi the collection
                    of basidia forming the <hi rend="italic">hymenium</hi> is usually situated on
                    large receptacles. The structure commonly known as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >fungus</hi> (fig. 356) is a receptacle produced upon a <hi rend="italic"
                    >mycelium (my).</hi> In its young state it appears as a tubercle upon the
                    mycelium covered by a <hi rend="italic">volva</hi> (fig. 356, <hi rend="italic"
                    >vol),</hi> or wrapper, which it bursts during growth. It consists of a <hi
                    rend="italic">pileus</hi> or cap <hi rend="italic">(p),</hi> at the extremity of
                    a stalk, the <hi rend="italic">stipe (st).</hi> On the under surface of the
                    pileus are the <hi rend="italic">lamelloe</hi><hi rend="italic">(la)</hi> or
                    gills, of various forms, which constitute the hymenial <hi rend="italic"
                    >(hy)</hi> layer, to which the spores are attached. At first the hymenium is
                    covered by a veil or <hi rend="italic">indusium,</hi> which during the growth of
                    the stipe is ruptured, the base remaining on the stipe as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >annulus (an)</hi> or ring. When, as in the Mushroom, the hymenium is exposed,
                    the fungus is said to be <hi rend="italic">gymnocarpous</hi> (fig. 356). In
                    other cases, as in Phalloideae, it is covered over by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >peridium,</hi> and the whole mass so enclosed is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gleba,</hi> and the fungus is <hi rend="italic">angiocarpous</hi> (fig. 357).
                    In .ascosporous Fungi, as Sphaeria, the asci are usually formed within small
                    roundish receptacles, termed <hi rend="italic">perithecia;</hi> and along with
                    the asci are usually numerous abortive filaments or paraphyses. Sometimes these
                    perithecia are situated upon cushions or branching masses of tissue, the <hi
                    rend="italic">stroma.</hi> In the myxosporous Fungi the <hi rend="italic"
                    >plasmodium,</hi> or whole protoplasmic mass of the plant, forms receptacles, in
                    each of which is a <hi rend="italic">capillitium,</hi> or network of fine
                    filaments, in the interstices of which are numerous spores.</p>
                <p>In Lichens spores are formed in asci, which are arranged along with paraphyses,
                    forming a hymenium in receptacles situated on the thallus, and termed <hi
                    rend="italic">apothecia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lirellae,</hi> which are
                    sometimes (fig.' 95) supported on a stalk or <hi rend="italic">podetium.</hi>
                    The hyphae, from which the asci arise, form a layer immediately beneath the
                    hymenium, termed the <hi rend="italic">subhymenial</hi> layer, the thick mass of
                    hyphae beneath being the <hi rend="italic">hypothecium.</hi> The outermost layer
                    of the tissue of the apothecium is termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >excipulum.</hi></p>
                <p>Amongst Algae alternation of generations is very common; and here, as in the case
                    of Fungi, it may pass through several generations before reaching the original
                    form. This is well seen in Diatoms, also in Oedogonieae, where three generations
                    are passed through, and in Coleochaete, where there are four dissimilar
                    generations,— sexual and various forms of asexual reproduction alternating. (j.
