                    named by the British and Dutch colonists of the Cape, but calling themselves <hi
                    rend="italic">Saab</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Saan,</hi> are an aboriginal race
                    of South Africa, allied in some respects to the Hottentots, but differing from
                    them in several essential points, and along with these having nothing whatever
                    in common with the Kaffre 0r the Negro. The area in which they are found in
                    nomadic families may be described as extending from the inner ranges of the
                    mountains of Cape Colony, through the central Kalahari desert to near Lake
                    Ngami, and thence north-westward to the districts about the Ovambo River north
                    of Damara Land, in about 18° S. lat., or only over the most barren portions of
                    the South African deserts, into which they have been pressed by the
                    encroachments of the Kaffre, Hottentots, and Europeans, a few also remaining in
                    the most inaccessible clefts of tho Drakenberg range about the sources of tho
                    Vaal. They rank with the savages of Australia as the lowest existing type of
                    mankind, human nature being nowhere seen in a more destitute or degraded
                    condition. The Bushmen with whom tho colonists of the south have come most in
                    contact are of very small stature, of a dirty yellow colour, and generally
                    repulsive countenance. In type they somewhat resemble the Mongolians; the
                    cheek-bcres are large and prominent, the eyes deeply set and crafty in
                    expression, the nose small and depressed; tho hair appears in small woolly tufts
                    with spaces between. Among 150 of their number measured by the traveller Barrow,
                    tho tallest man was 4 feet 9 inches, the tallest woman 4 feet 4 inches. A
                    hollowed back and protruding slcmach, with thick hinder parts and small limbs,
                    are frequent characteristics of their figure, but many of them are
                    well-proportioned, all being active and capable of enduring great privations and
                    fatigue. Northward the Bι.shmen appear to improve both in general condition and
                    in stature. Those met with towards Lake Ngami by Dr Livingstone are described by
                    him as differing from those of the thirsty plains of the Kalahari, being of
                    darker colour and of good proportions; some of those seen by the traveller
                    Baines in this region are also noticed as being taller, some 5 feet 6 inches in
                    height. Their clothing consists of a mantle of skins, termed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >kaross;</hi> but they are fond of ornament, and decorate the arms and legs with
                    beads and iron or copper rings, and the women sometimes stain their faces with
                    red colour. For dwellings in the plains they have low huts formed of reed mats,
                    or may simply occupy a hole in the earth; in the mountain districts they make a
                    shelter among the rocks by hanging mats on the windward side. They do not
                    possess cattle, and have no animals of any sort excepting a few half-wild dogs,
                    nor have they the smallest rudiments of agriculture. Living by hunting, they are
                    thoroughly acquainted with the habits Und movements of every kind of wild
                    animals following the antelope herds in their -migrations. Theiι weapon is a
                    small bow, strung with twisted sinew, used with arrows, which are neatly made of
                    a reed with a barbed head of bo» o, sometimes tipped with a triangular piece of
                    iron, and always coated with a gummy poisonous compound, which is variously made
                    in different localities. The chief sources of the poison are the milky juice of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Amaryllis toxicaria,</hi> which is abundant in South
                    Africa, or of the <hi rend="italic">Euphorbia arborescens,</hi> generally mixed
                    with the venom of snakes or of a large black spider of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Mygale</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or the entrails of a very
                    deadly caterpillar, called N’gwa or ’ Kaa, are used alone. From their use of
                    these poisons the Bushmen are held in great dread by the neighbouring races. A
                    rude implement, called the <hi rend="italic">gragf stock</hi> or digging-stick
                    by the boers,-—consisting of a sharpened spike of hardwood over which a stone,
                    ground to a circular form and perforated, is passed and secured by a wedge,— is
                    used by the Buβhmen in uprooting the succulent tuberous roots of the several
                    species of creeping plants of the desert. These perforated stones have a special
                    interest in indicating the former extension of the race of the Bushmen, since
                    tbey are found far beyond the area now occupied by their families.</p>
                <p>There does not appear to be the least approach to any tribal unity in the
                    wandering groups of the Bushmen; they have no chiefs, bodily strength alone
                    forming a distinction among them. Their language, which exists in several
                    dialects, is not intelligible to the Hottentots, but has in common with it the
                    nasal, snapping, hissing, or grunting’sounds, only used more numerously. The
                    Hottentot language is more agglutinative, the Bushman’s more monosyllabic; the
                    former recognizes a gender in names, the latter does not; the Hottentots form
                    the plural by a suffix, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n637/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0637-0576"/> the Bushmen by repetition of the name; the former
                    count up to twenty, the latter can only number two, all above that being “many.”
                    The Bushmen possess a remarkable faculty which is not known in any other South
                    African natives, that of graphic illustration; the rocks of the mountains of
                    Cape Colony and of the Drakenberg have everywhere examples of Bushman drawings
                    of men, women, children, and animals characteristically sketched. Rings,
                    crosses, and other signs drawn in blue pigment on some of the rocks, and
                    believed to be some centuries old, have given rise to the speculation that these
                    may be remains of a hieroglyphic writing; and the discovery of drawings of men
                    and women, with antelope heads, in the recesses of the Drakenberg in 1873 (Orpen
                    in <hi rend="italic">Cape Monthly Magazine,</hi> July 1874), also very ancient,
                    recalls the mythological figures of Egypt. The Bushmen are not deficient in a
                    certain intelligence, and are valued as servants by the boers, being much more
                    energetic than the Hottentots; of all the South African races they have the
                    greatest aptitude for music and the dance. A regularly planned and wholesale
                    destruction of this race on the borders of the colony in the earlier years,
                    reduced their numbers to a great extent; and though this cruel hunting of the
                    Bushmen has ceased, their children are still captured by the boers as servants.
                    In retaliation, the Bushmen have loug been the scourge of the farms on the outer
                    borders of the colonies, making raids on the cattle and driving them off in
                    large numbers. On the western side of the deserts they are generally at enmity
                    with the Koranna Hottentots, but on the eastern border of the Kalahari they have
                    to some extent become tributary to the Bechwana Kaffres. Formerly occupying a
                    much larger area, it appears probable that the Bushmen are the earliest
                    remaining aborigines of South Africa, and that they existed there before the
                    Kaffres, and perhaps also anterior to the Hottentots. The discoveries of the
                    dwarf race of the Akka by Dr Schweinfurth beyond the Upper Nile basin, of the
                    little Bushman-like Obongo on the western equatorial coastland by Du Chaillu,
                    and of the Okota, an undersized people leading a miserable existence in bark
                    huts on a branch of the Ogowé River, by De Compiègne in 1874, point to a former
                    more general distribution of this primitive race.</p>
