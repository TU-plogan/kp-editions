                    from the severity of her father to her mother, gave her an invincible repugnance
                    to marriage,—so much so that when it was desired that she should marry at the
                    age of twenty she fled from her father’s house in disguise. Her disguise,
                    however, was soon discovered, and having fallen into the hands of a soldier, she
                    ran worse risks than if she had remained to face her destiny at home. Her
                    autobiography dwells upon these and other similar events of her life, when her
                    virtue underwent violent assault, which she was happily able to resist. She is
                    said to have been “endowed with a wonderful chastity, which remained
                    unassailable by all force or enticement, and which not only preserved her own
                    person pure, but diffused around her an ardour of continence.”</p>
                <p>Having been delivered from the hands of the soldier into which she had fallen in
                    her wanderings, she became known to the archbishop of Cambray, under whose
                    sanction she established a small society of nuns. She soon, however, became
                    restless in her new occupation, in which she does not seem to have been
                    successful. The archbishop withdrew his countenance, and for a time she returned
                    to her native country, where she is said to have “passed many years in privacy
                    and in. a great simplicity of life.” On the death of her parents she became
                    entitled to some fortune, which she at first declined, but afterwards took
                    possession of. She seems then to have become the head of a hospital at Lille for
                    some time (1653, <hi rend="italic">etseq.),</hi> but scandal having broken out
                    in connection with it. she left and fled to Ghent (1662).</p>

                <p>Here, apparently, she entered upon the higher prophetic phase of her life. “God
                    revealed great secrets to her,” which she began to proclaim; and soon she
                    gathered around her a few ardent disciples. Her prophetic views were specially
                    expounded in one of her books published at this time at Amsterdam, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Light of the World.</hi> Some of her disciples formed the
                    design of settling in the island of Noordstrand in Holstein. At first she seems
                    to have declined to join them, but afterwards set out for the purpose. She did
                    not remain long, disturbances having arisen not only against her opinions, but
                    in the ranks of her own followers. She was evidently impatient of sharing her
                    influence with any one, and is said to have been of very difficult and
                    self-willed temper. She returned to Holland, and died there in 1680.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to give any estimate of A. Bourignon’s character and opinions. So
                    far as appears, she was a visionary of the ordinary type, only distinguished by
                    the rare persistency and audacity of her pretensions. Amidst all her enthusiasms
                    she seem to have known how to look after her own interests. She is said never to
                    have given alms to the poor, not even to the hospital which she superintended.
                    She was willing to assist with her hand, but not with her money. Her main idea
                    about religion was that it was a mere internal ecstasy, independent of both
                    church and Bible. She had innumerable visions, from which source she chiefly
                    drew her religious inspiration and knowledge. Among others she saw in vision
                    Antichrist and Adam before the Fall; and she describes the appearance of the
                    former minutely, even to the colour of his hair. Her visions and views she gave
                    to the world in numerous treatises and pamphlets.</p>
                <p>Her followers in Holland seem to have dwindled rapidly away, if they ever had any
                    of the life of a distinct sect; but, strangely, her influence revived in
                    Scotland in the beginning of the 18th. century, so much so as to be a source of
                    alarm to the Presbyterian Church, and to call forth not only one but several
                    Act3 of the General Assembly in denunciations of her doctrines and earnest
                    caution against their contagion. These Acts are found severally in 1701, 1709,
                    and 1710; and even at this last date it is alleged that “the gross heresies and
                    errors going under the name of Bourignianism are greatly prevailing in the
                    bounds of the national church.” This is the explanation, no doubt, of the fact
                    that Bourignianism is amongst the heretical sects which the clergy of the Church
                    of Scotland are taken bound to “disown” at their ordination in a series of
                    questions appointed to be put in 1711. The very name, however, is now generally
                    unknown in Scotland, notwithstanding this strange survival of it; and should any
                    one turn to the Act of Assembly of 1701, which professes to enumerate the
                    opinions of Μ. Antonia Bourignon, and describes them as “impious, pernicious,
                    and damnable,” he will hardly get more light as to the nature of these opinions
                    than elsewhere. They present an unintelligible conglomeration without coherency
                    or order,—such subjects as the denial of election, the permission of sin, and
                    the bondage of the will being mixed up with the quality of Christ’s human
                    nature, the perfection of the present life, and “that generation takes place in
                    heaven, aud that there are no true Christians in the world.” Mlle. Bourignon’s
                    works were published in French at Amsterdam in 1686, in 19 vols. 8vo. Her <hi

                    is the chief authority for the earlier part of her life. <hi rend="italic">La

                    Bourignon,</hi> which occupies the whole of the second volume (author’s name not
                    given), treats of her life at length, but in a semi-legendary manner. Three of
                    her works at least have been translated into English,— <hi rend="italic">An
                    Abridgment of the Light of the World,</hi> London, 1786; <hi rend="italic">A
