                    fertile plain, intersected by the canals of Ghent, Ostend, and Sluys, in 51° 12'
                    N. lat. and 3° 13' E. long. It is, in a direct line, about 7 miles from the sea,
                    12 miles E. of Ostend, 24 N.W. of Ghent, and 60 miles in the same direction from
                    Brussels. The history of Bruges dates from about the 3d century of the Christian
                    era. In the 7th it had emerged into importance; and its corporation of weavers,
                    which afterwards in its best days numbered 50,000 men, was already highly
                    renowned in the time of Charlemagne. In the 9th century Bruges became subject to
                    the counts of Flanders, who resided there, and made the city one of the most
                    populous and wealthy in Europe by the great advantages and immunities which they
                    offered to merchants and manufacturers. The inhabitants guarded with the most
                    jealous care the privileges which they sometimes received and sometimes exacted
                    from their rulers, and not unfrequently rose in arms for their defence. Though
                    Bruges, and Ghent, and other Flemish towns owned a common lord, their interests
                    were never identified, and they seldom let an opportunity pass of doing each
                    other as much injury as possible. In the middle of the 14th century Bruges
                    passed by marriage into the hands of the dukes of Burgundy, under whom it
                    reached the highest point of its prosperity. The magnificence of the Flemish
                    court was such that no European monarch could equal or approach it. When the
                    wife of Philip the Fair of France visited Bruges at the beginning of the 14th
                    century, “There are hundreds here,” she exclaimed, “who have more the air of
                    queens than myself;” and to such an extent was this extravagance ultimately
                    carried that Charles V. was obliged, in the 16th century, to repress it by
                    severe sumptuary laws. In 1430 Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, instituted at
                    Bruges the chivalric order of the Golden Fleece, a compliment to the town, no
                    small portion of whose prosperity arose from its woollen trade. In the 14th and
                    15th centuries, Bruges was the chief emporium of the cities of the Hanseatic
                    league; and merchants from ever)' quarter of the world found there a ready
                    market for their <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0443-0396"/> goods. The argosies of Venice and Genoa came
                    laden with the produce of the East; ships of every nation took inand discharged
                    their cargoes at the quays; the warehouses were filled with bales of wool from
                    England, and with silk from Persia. Not the least famous of the manufactures was
                    that of tapestry, in which the people of Bruges acquired great skill a century
                    before the looms of Beauvais or the Gobelins were set up. The prosperity of
                    Bruges was undiminished till it passed under the dominion of the house of
                    Hapsburg. For a violation of some of their prerogatives, the inhabitants
                    imprisoned the Archduke Maximilian in 1488, and a terrible vengeance was
                    inflicted upon the town for this outrage. Its trade was transferred to Antwerp,
                    and its ruin was ultimately completed by the religious persecutions of the
                    bloody duke of Alva at the end of the 16th century. Such of the inhabitants as
                    escaped with their lives fled to England and introduced into that country many
                    of the artsand manufactures which they and their forefathers had cultivated with
                    success for many generations. In more modern times the town ha≡ frequently
                    suffered from the effects of war. In 1704 it was besieged by the Dutch, and in
                    1708 and 1745 it was captured by the French. The contrast between the Bruges of
                    the 15th century and the Bruges of recent times is as striking as it is painful.
                    As Wordsworth says —</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ In Bruges town is many a street Whence busy life hath fled,</p>
                <p>Where, without hurry, noiseless feet The grass-grown pavement tread.”</p>
                <p>The great circumference of the city, its numerous squares and streets, and the
                    number and magnificence of its public buildings, all attest its former
                    importance; while the comparative absence of commercial activity, and the
                    general air of desolation, bear witness to its present insignificance. Its trade
                    has, however, considerably revived during the present century, and its great
                    advantages in canal and railway communication, its spacious docks and excellent
                    quays, and the great fertility of the surrounding country, are once more
                    restoring it to its high place among cities. Of the public buildings of Bruges
                    the most remarkable are the Church of Nôtre Dame, containing a sculpture of the
                    Virgin and Child, said to be by Michel Angelo, effigies in copper of Charles the
                    Bold and Mary of Burgundy, who are buried in the church; the cathedral of St
                    Sauveur, built of brick, but internally the handsomest church in Bruges, with
                    some fine pictures by Hemling (or, more correctly, Memling,—see <hi
                    rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> No. 2513) and Peter Porbus; the hospital of St
                    John, a charitable institution, where sick persons are attended by the sisters
                    of charity; the exchange, which is the oldest in Europe; the courthouse, a fine
                    building, partly on the site of the old palace of the counts of Flanders; and
                    the Hôtel de Ville, a small but handsome edifice, dating from 1377 and restored
                    in the present century, in the niches of which there were formerly statues of
                    the old counts of Flanders, which were destroyed by the French revolutionists in
                    1792. The belfry-tower in the great square, of which Longfellow sings so finely,
                    is the most beautiful structure of the kind in Europe, and its chimβ3 are the
                    best in Belgium. . It was erected at the end of the 14th century, and is still
                    used for communicating the alarm of fire by a flag or a light to all parts of
                    the city. In this same square is a house in which Charles II. resided during his
                    exile from England. Among the conventual establishments the most important are
                    the Béguinage and the English nunnery. The town is likewise well provided with
                    the means of education. There is a medical school, to which is attached a museum
                    of natural history and a botanical garden. For the higher departments of school
                    training there is an excellent athenaeum, annually subsidized by Government,
                    besides a theological seminary, a school of navigation, and an institution for
                    the deaf and dumb and blind. The academy of painting is in a very flourishing
                    condition, and offers many advantages to the student, as instruction is given
                    gratis in drawing and architecture. The public library in the townhall contains
                    upwards of 15,000 volumes, The charitable institutions of Bruges are both
                    numerous and well organized. They are all the more necessary, that the number of
                    persons in the city requiring support is unusually great. In the poorhouse alone
                    there is accommodation for nearly 600 individuals, and it is almost always
                    completely filled. The most important manufacture in Bruges is that of lace. The
                    other manufactures consist of linens, woollen and cotton goods, soap, leather,
                    tobacco, starch, pottery, and bells. There are also some small breweries and
                    distilleries, and dyeing and bleaching establishments; and ship-building is also
                    carried on. The exports from Bruges comprise the products of the rich
                    agricultural district that surrounds the town; the imports include metals,
                    dyewoods, wines, fruits, oil, cotton, and wool. Despite the number of canals,
                    the inhabitants of Bruges are very ill supplied with water for domestic
                    purposes; every house is accordingly provided with a tank or butt to receive
                    rain-water. The quantity collected in the public tanks is distributed through
                    the city in pipes. Of the canals the largest is that to Ostend, wide and deep
                    enough to allow vessels of 500 tons to pass up from the sea. The ramifications
                    of these canals intersect the city in all directions, and are crossed by upwards
                    of fifty bridges, whence the name of the town is derived. Population in 1838,
                    44,374; in 1846, 49,308; in 1851, 50,698; in 1866, 49,819.</p>
