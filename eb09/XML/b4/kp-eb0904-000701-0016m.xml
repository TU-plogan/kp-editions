                <p><label type="entry">BOLIVAR, <hi rend="smallcaps">Simon</hi></label>, the hero of
                    South American independence, was born in the city of Caracas, Venezuela, on the
                    24th July 1783. His father was Juan Vicente Bolivar y Ponte, and his mother
                    Maria Concepcion Palacios y Sojo, both descended of noble families in Venezuela.
                    After acquiring the elements of a liberal education at home, Bolivar was sent to
                    Europe to prosecute his studies, and with this view repaired to Madrid, where he
                    appears to have resided for several years. Having completed his education, he
                    spent some time in travelling, chiefly in the south of Europe, and visited the
                    French capital, where he was an eye-witness of some of the last scenes of the
                    Revolution. Returning to Madrid, he married, in 1801, the daughter of Don N.
                    Toro, uncle of the marquis of Toro in Caracas, and embarked with her for
                    America, intending, it is said, to devote himself to the improvement of his
                    large estate. But this plan was frustrated by the premature death of his young
                    wife, who fell a victim to yellow fever; and Bolivar again visited Europe, in
                    order, by change of scene, to alleviate the sorrow occasioned by this
                    bereavement.</p>
                <p>On his return home in 1809 he passed through the United States, where, for the
                    first time, he had an opportunity of observing the working of free institutions;
                    and soon after his arrival in Venezuela he appears to have identified himself
                    with the cause of independence which had already agitated the Spanish colonies
                    for some years. Being one of the promoters of the movement at Caracas in April
                    1810, he received a colonel’s commission from the revolutionary junta, and was
                    associated with Luis Lopez Mendez in a mission to the court of Great Britain.
                    Venezuela declared its independence of the mother country on July 5, 1811, and
                    in the following year the war commenced in earnest by the advance of Monteverde
                    with the Spanish troops. Bolivar was intrusted with the command of the important
                    post of Puerto Cabello, but not being supported he had to evacuate the place;
                    and owing to the inaction of Miranda the Spaniards recovered their hold over the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Like others of the revolutionists Bolivar took to flight, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0017-0008"/> and succeeded in reaching Curaçao in safety. He
                    did not, however, remain long in retirement, but in September 1812, hearing of
                    important movements in New Granada, repaired to Carthagena, where he received a
                    commission to operate against the Spanish troops on the Magdalena River. In this
                    expedition he proved eminently successful, driving the Spaniards from post to
                    post, until arriving at the confines of Venezuela he boldly determined to enter
                    that province and try conclusions with General Monteverde himself. His troops
                    did not number more than 500 men; but, in spite of many discouragements, he
                    forced his way to Merida and Truxillo, towns of some importance in the west of
                    Venezuela, and succeeded in raising the population to his support. Forming his
                    increased forces into two divisions, he committed the charge of one to his
                    colleague Rivas, and pushing on for Caracas the capital, issued his decree of
                    “war to the death.” A decisive battle ensued at Lastoguanes, where the Spanish
                    troops under Monteverde sustained a crushing defeat. Caracas was entered in
                    triumph on the 4th of August 1813, and Monteverde took refuge in Puerto Cabello.
                    General Marino effected the liberation of the eastern district of Venezuela, and
                    the patriots obtained entire possession of the country in January 1814. This
                    success was, however, of very brief duration. The royalists, effectually roused
                    by the reverses they had sustained, concentrated all their means, and a number
                    of sanguinary encounters ensued. Bolivar was eventually defeated by Boves near
                    Cura, in the plains of La Puerta, and compelled to embark for Cumana with the
                    shattered remains of his forces. Caracas was retaken by the Spaniards in July;
                    and before the end of the year 1814 the royalists were again the undisputed
                    masters of Venezuela. From Cumana Bolivar repaired to Carthagena, and thence to
                    Tunja, where the revolutionary congress of New Grenada was sitting. Here,
                    notwithstanding his misfortunes and the efforts of his personal enemies, he was
                    received and treated with great consideration. The congress appointed him to
                    conduct an expedition against Santa Fé de Bogota, where Don Cundinamarca had
                    refused to acknowledge the new coalition of the provinces. In December 1814 he
                    appeared before Bogota with a force of 2000 men, and obliged the recalcitrant
                    leaders to capitulate,—a service for which he received the thanks of congress.
                    In the meanwhile Santa Martha had unfortunately fallen into the hands of the
                    royalists, and Bolivar was ordered to the relief of the place. In this, however,
                    he was not successful, General Morillo having landed an overwhelming Spanish
                    force. Hopeless of the attempt, he resigned his commission and embarked for
                    Kingston, Jamaica, in May 1814. While residing there an attempt was made upon
                    his life by a hired assassin, who, in mistake, murdered his secretary.</p>
                <p>From Kingston Bolivar repaired to Aux Cayes in Hayti, where he was furnished with
                    a small force by President Petion. An expedition was organized, and landed on
                    the mainland in May 1816, but proved a failure. Nothing daunted, however, he
                    obtained reinforcements at Aux Cayes, and in December landed first in Margarita,
                    and then at Barcelona. Here a provisional government was formed, and troops were
                    assembled to resist Morillo, who was then advancing at the head of a strong
                    division. The hostile forces encountered each other on the 16th of February
                    1817, when a desperate conflict ensued, which lasted during that and the two
                    following days, and ended in the defeat of the royalists. Morillo retired in
                    disorder, and being met on his retreat by Paez with his <hi rend="italic"
                    >llaneros,</hi> suffered an additional and more complete overthrow. Being now
                    recognized as commander-in-chief, Bolivar proceeded in his career of victory,
                    and before the close of the year had fixed his headquarters at Angostura on the
                    Orinoco. At the opening of the congress which assembled in that city on the 15th
                    February 1819 he submitted an elaborate exposition of his views on government,
                    and concluded by surrendering his authority into the hands of congress. Being,
                    however, required to resume his power, and retain it until the independence of
                    the country had been completely established, he reorganized his troops, and set
                    out from Angostura, in order to cross the Cordilleras, effect a junction with
                    General Santander, who commanded the republican force in New Grenada, and bring
                    their united forces into action against the common enemy. This bold and original
                    design was crowned with complete success. In July 1819 he entered Tunja, after a
                    sharp action on the adjoining heights; and on the 7th of August he gained the
                    victory of Bojaca, which gave him immediate possession of Bogota and all New
                    Grenada.</p>
                <p>This campaign is unquestionably Bolivar’s most brilliant achievement, and
                    deserves much of the praise which has been lavished on it. His return to
                    Angostura was a sort of national festival. He was hailed as the deliverer and
                    father of his country, and all manner of distinctions and congratulations were
                    heaped upon him. Availing himself of the favourable moment, he obtained the
                    enactment of the fundamental law of 17th December 1819, by which the republics
                    of Venezuela and New Grenada were henceforth to be united in a single state,
                    under his presidency, by the title of the Republic of Colombia. The seat of
                    government was also transferred provisionally to Rosario de Cucuta, on the
                    frontier of the two provinces, and Bolivar again took the field. Being now at
                    the head of the most numerous and best appointed army the republicans had yet
                    assembled, he gained important advantages over the Spaniards under Morillo, and
                    on the 25th November 1820 concluded at Truxillo an armistice of six months,
                    probably in the hope that the Spaniards would come to terms, and that the
                    further effusion of blood might be spared. If such were his views, however, they
                    were disappointed. Morillo was recalled, and General Torre assumed the command.
                    The armistice was allowed to expire, and a renewal of the contest became
                    inevitable. Bolivar therefore resolved, if possible, to strike a decisive blow;
                    and this accordingly he did at Carabolo, where, encountering Torre, he so
                    completely routed the Spaniards, that the shattered remains of their army were
                    forced to take refuge in Puerto Cabello, where two years after they surrendered
                    to Paez. The battle of Carabolo may be considered as having put an end to the
                    war in Venezuela. On the 29th June 1820 Bolivar entered Caracas, and by the
                    close of the year the Spaniards were driven from every part of the province
                    except Puerto Cabello. The next step was to secure, by permanent political
                    institutions, the independence which had been so dearly purchased; and,
                    accordingly, on the 30th of August 1821, the constitution of Colombia was
                    adopted with general approbation, Bolivar himself being president, and Santander
                    vice-president.</p>
                <p>There was, however, more work for him to do. The Spaniards, though expelled from
                    Colombia, still held possession of the neighbouring provinces of Ecuador and
                    Peru; and Bolivar determined to complete the liberation of the whole country.
                    Placing himself at the head of the army, he marched on Quito in Ecuador. A
                    severe battle was fought at Pichincha, where, by the prowess of his colleague
                    Sucre, the Spaniards were routed, and Quito was entered by the republicans in
                    June 1822. Bolivar then marched upon Lima, which the royalists evacuated at his
                    approach; and entering the capital in triumph, he was invested with absolute
                    power as dictator, and authorized to call into action all the resources of the
                    country. Owing, however, to the intrigues of the republican factions in Peru he
                    was forced to withdraw to Truxillo, leaving the capital to the mercy of the
                    Spaniards under Cantcrac, by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n18/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0018-0009"/> whom it was immediately occupied. But this
                    misfortune proved only temporary. By June 1824 the liberating army was
                    completely organized; and taking the field soon after, it routed the vanguard of
                    the enemy. Improving his advantage, Bolivar pressed forward, and on the 6th of
                    .August defeated Canterac on the plains of Junin, after which he returned to
                    Lima, leaving Sucre to follow the royalists in their retreat to Upper Peru,—an
                    exploit which the latter executed with equal ability and success, gaining a
                    decisive victory at Ayacucho, and thus completing the dispersion of the Spanish
                    force. The possessions of the Spaniards in Feru were now confined to the castles
                    of Callao, which Rodil maintained for upwards of a year, in spite of all the
                    means that could be employed for their reduction. In June 1825 Bolivar visited
                    Upper Peru, which having detached itself from the government of Buenos Ayres,
                    was formed into a separate state, called Bolivia, in honour of the liberator.
                    The first congress of the new republic assembled in August 1825, when Bolivar
                    was declared perpetual protector, and requested to prepare for it a constitution
                    of government.</p>
                <p>We now come to that period in the liberator’s career when his care was directed
                    to the administration of the affairs of the freed provinces. He had been
                    successful in raising those districts to the position of independent states, and
                    now devoted himself to the framing of such laws as seemed to him most suitable
                    to the inhabitants. His endeavours to satisfy his countrymen in this respect did
                    not always meet with encouragement, and sometimes exposed him to slander. In
                    December 1824 Bolivar convoked a constituent congress for the February
                    following; but this body, taking into consideration the unsettled state of the
                    country, thought it proper to invest him with dictatorial power for another
                    year. A grant of a million dollars was offered him but declined, and the
                    congress adjourned, leaving the dictator absolute governor of Peru. His project
                    of a constitution for Bolivia was presented to the congress of that state on the
                    25 th May 1826, accompanied with an address, in which he embodied his opinions
                    respecting the form of government which he conceived most expedient for the
                    newly established republics. This code, however, did not give satisfaction. Its
                    most extraordinary feature consisted in the provision for lodging the executive
                    authority in the hands of a president for life, without responsibility and with
                    power to nominate his successor, a proposal which alarmed the friends of
                    liberty, and excited lively apprehensions amongst the republicans of Buenos
                    Ayres and Chili; whilst in Peru, Bolivar was accused of a design to unite into
                    one state Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, and to render himself perpetual dictator
                    of the confederacy.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile the affairs of Colombia had taken a turn which demanded the
                    presence of Bolivar in his own country. During his absence Santander had
                    administered the government of the state ably and uprightly, and its
                    independence had been recognized by other countries. But Paez, who commanded in
                    Venezuela, having been accused of arbitrary conduct in the enrolment of the
                    citizens of Caracas in the militia, refused obedience to the summons of the
                    senate, and placed himself in a state of open rebellion against the Government,
                    being encouraged by a disaffected party in the northern departments who desired
                    separation from the rest of the republic.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, having intrusted the government to a council nominated by himself,
                    with Santa-Cruz at its head, Bolivar set out from Lima in September 1826, and
                    hastening to Bogota, arrived there on the 14th November. He immediately assumed
                    the extraordinary powers which by the constitution the president was authorized
                    to exercise in case of rebellion. After a short stay in the capital he pressed
                    forward to stop the effusion of blood in Venezuela, where matters had gone much
                    farther than he could have contemplated. On the 31st December he reached Puerto
                    Cabello, and the following day he issued a decree offering a general amnesty. He
                    had then a friendly meeting with Paez and soon after entered Caracas, where he
                    fixed his headquarters, in order to check the northern departments, which had
                    been the principal theatre of the disturbances. In the meanwhile Bolivar and
                    Santander were re-elected ^to the respective offices of president and
                    vice-president, and bylaw they should have qualified as such in January 1827. In
                    February, however, Bolivar formally resigned the presidency of the republic, at
                    the same time expressing a determination to refute the imputations of ambition
                    which had been so freely cast upon him, by retiring into private life, and
                    spending the remainder of his days on his patrimonial estate. Santander combated
                    this proposal, urging him to resume his station as constitutional president, and
                    declaring his own conviction that the troubles and agitations of the country
                    could only be appeased by the authority and personal influence of the liberator
                    himself. This view being confirmed by a resolution of congress, although it was
                    not a unanimous one, Bolivar decided to resume his functions, and he repaired to
                    Bogota to take the oaths. Before his arrival, however, he issued simultaneously
                    three separate decrees,—one granting a general amnesty, another convoking a
                    national convention at Ocana, and a third for establishing constitutional order
                    throughout Colombia. His arrival was accelerated by the occurrence of events in
                    Peru and the southern departments, which struck at the very foundation of his
                    power. Not long after his departure from Lima, the Bolivian code had been
                    adopted as the constitution of Peru, and Bolivar had been declared president for
                    life on the 9th December 1826, the anniversary of the battle of Ayacucho. At
                    this time the Colombian auxiliary army was cantoned in Peru, and the third
                    division, stationed at Lima, consisting of veteran troops under Lara and Sands,
                    became distrustful of Bolivar’s designs on the freedom of the republie. Accord ·
                    ingly, in about six weeks after the adoption of Bolivar’s new constitution, a
                    counter-revolution in the government of Peru was effected by this body of
                    dissatisfied veterans, and the Peruvians, availing themselves of the
                    opportunity, abjured the Bolivian code, deposed the council appointed by the
                    liberator, and proceeded to organize a provisional government for themselves.
                    After this bloodless revolution the third division embarked at Callao on the 17
                    th March 1827, and landed in the southern department of Colombia in the
                    following month. Intelligence of these events reached Bolivar while in the north
                    of Colombia, and he lost no time in preparing to march against the refractory
                    troops, who formerly had placed such implicit confidence in him. But he was
                    spared the necessity of coming to blows, for the leaders, finding the government
                    in the hands of the national executive, had peaceably submitted to General
                    Ovando. In the meanwhile Bolivar had accepted the presidency, and resumed the
                    functions belonging to his official position. But although Colombia was, to all
                    external appearance, restored to tranquillity, the nation was divided into two
                    parties. Bolivar had, no doubt, regained the personal confidence of the officers
                    and soldiers of the third division; but the republican party, with Santander at
                    their head, continued to regard with undisguised apprehension his ascendency
                    over the army, suspecting him of a desire to imitate the career of Napoleon. In
                    the meanwhile all parties looked anxiously to the convention of Ocana, which was
                    to assemble in March 1828, for a decided expression of the national will. The
                    republicans hoped that the issue of its deliberations would be favourable to
                    their views; whilst the military, on the other hand, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n19/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0019-0010"/> did not conceal their conviction that a stronger
                    and more permanent form of government was essential to the public welfare. The
                    latter view seems to have prevailed. In virtue of a decree, dated Bogota, the
                    27th August 1828, Bolivar assumed the supreme power in Colombia, and continued
                    to exercise it until his death, which took place at San Pedro, near Santa
                    Martha, on the 17th December 1830.</p>
                <p>In the career of this remarkable man, which was often embittered and was perhaps
                    shortened by the suspicions and slanders of his colleagues in the work of
                    liberation, certain circumstances, apparently well established, stand out, which
                    deserve particular mention. He expended nine-tenths of a splendid patrimony in
                    the service of his country; and although he had for a considerable period
                    unlimited control over the revenues of three countries,— Colombia, Peru, and
                    Bolivia,—he died without a shilling of the public money in his possession. He
                    conquered the independence of three states, and called forth a spirit in the
                    southern portion of the New World which can never be extinguished. He purified
                    the administra tion of justice; he encouraged the arts and sciences; he fostered
                    national interests; and he induced other countries to recognize that
                    independence which was in a great measure the fruit of his own exertions.
                    Bolivar’s remains were removed in 1842 to Caracas, where a monument was erected
                    to his memory; and in 1858 the Peruvians followed the example by erecting an
                    equestrian statue of the liberator in Lima.</p>
