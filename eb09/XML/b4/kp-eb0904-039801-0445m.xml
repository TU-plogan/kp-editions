                    (1769-1849), was born at Haqueville, in Normandy. His family had for several
                    centuries held a respectable station in the province, living as farmers and
                    small landowners on the estate on which he was born, and numbering among its
                    members Nicholas Poussin. He was educated at the seminary of St Nicaise at
                    Rouen, with the intention of his entering holy orders; but his predilection for
                    the physical scieuces was so strong, and his genius for mathematics and
                    mechanics so decided, that, on the advice of the superior of· ’ the
                    establishment, he was removed to follow a more congenial career. His father then
                    destined him for the naval service, which he entered on the appointment of the
                    Marshal de Castries, the minister of marine, and made several voyages to the
                    West Indies. In this position, although only in his seventeenth year, his
                    mechanical talents developed themselves actively on many occasions, and he
                    surprised his captain by the production of a sextant of his manufacture with
                    which he took his observations. On his return to France in 1792, he found the
                    Revolution at its height, and like all who entertained royalist principles, he
                    was compelled to seek safety in emigration. He effected his flight with
                    considerable difficulty, and found refuge in the United States of America,
                    where, driven by necessity to the exercise of his talents as a means of support,
                    he followed the bent of his inclination and became a civil engineer and
                    architect. His first engagement was on the survey of a tract of land near Lake
                    Erie; he then became engaged in cutting canals, and was employed to erect an
                    arsenal and cannon foundry at New York, where he applied several new and
                    ingenious machines. His highly ornamental design for the House of Assembly at
                    Washington was rejected, as being inconsistent with the simplicity of a
                    republic; he was, however, engaged to design and superintend the construction of
                    Bowery Theatre, New York, since destroyed by fire, the roof of which was
                    peculiar and original.</p>
                <p>The idea of substituting machinery for manual labour in the making of ships’
                    blocks had long occupied his mind; and, in 1799, having matured his plans, he
                    determined to visit England. Earl St Vincent was at that time at the head of the
                    Admiralty, and after the usual delays and difficulties, which were ultimately
                    overcome chiefly through the powerful influence of his steady friend and patron
                    Earl Spencer, aided by the recommendation of BrigadierGeneral Sir Samuel
                    Bentham, who at once perceived and appreciated the merit of the machines and the
                    talent of the inventor, the system was adopted, and the machinery erected. The
                    construction of the machines was entrusted to Mr Henry Maudslay, whom Brunel had
                    selected with true discrimination, and by whom he was ably assisted. The
                    beautiful simplicity of these machines, their perfect adaptation to their
                    various purposes, and, notwithstanding the recent advances in mechanics, their
                    continuing for nearly half a century in active work, without any improvements
                    having ever been suggested, must rank them as among the most complete and
                    ingenious pieces of mechanism ever invented.</p>
                <p>The block machinery was completed in 1806, and it was estimated that the economy
                    produced by it in the first year was about £24,000, two-thirds of which sum was
                    awarded to the ingenious inventor, who was soon after engaged by the Government
                    to erect extensive saw-mills, on improved principles, at Chatham and Woolwich.
                    He there suggested modifications of the systems of stacking and seasoning
                    timber, which were afterwards carried into effect. Some time previously, he had
                    invented the ingenious little machine for winding cotton-thread into balls,
                    which, simple as it may at first sight appear, has exercised great influence on
                    the extension of the cotton trade.</p>
                <p>He found time also to invent an instrument for combining the use of several pens,
                    so as to produce simultaneously a number of copies of a manuscript; a simple and
                    portable copying-machine; and a contrivance for making the small boxes used by
                    druggists, which had been previously imported in large quantities from Holland.
                    A nail-making machine also occupied his attention; and he discovered the system
                    of giving the efflorescent appearance to tinfoil, by which it was fitted for
                    ornamental purposes. Among other more important improvements may be mentioned
                    that of cutting veneers by circular saw s of large diameter, to which is mainly
                    due the present extensive application of veneers of wood to ornamental
                    furniture. About the year 1812 he had devised a scheme for making shoes by
                    machinery; and, under the countenance of the duke of York, the shoes so
                    manufactured, in consequence of their strength, cheapness, and durability, were
                    introduced for the use of the army; but at the peace in 1815, manual labour
                    becoming cheaper, and the demand for military equipments having ceased, the
                    machines were laid aside.</p>
                <p>Steam navigation also attracted his attention, and he became deeply interested in
                    establishing the Ramsgate steam vessels, which were among the first that plied
                    successfully on the River Thames; and on board of them it is believed that the
                    double engines were first used. About this period, after much labour and
                    perseverance, he induced the Admiralty to permit the application of steam for
                    towing vessels to sea, the practicability of which he had strenuously urged. The
                    experiments were tried chiefly at his own expense; a small sum in aid had been
                    promised, but it was eventually withdrawn before the completion of the trials,
                    the Admiralty considering the attempt “too chimerical to be seriously
                    entertained.” He introduced various improvements in the steam-engine, and for
                    nearly ten years persevered in the attempt to use liquefied gases as the source
                    of motive power, in which he was ably assisted by his son. The necessary
                    experiments were most laborious, and needed all the persevering energy and
                    resources of a mind determined not to be foiled; in spite, however, of his
                    efforts, after a great sacrifice of time and money, the plan was abandoned.</p>
                <p>The whole power of his mind, however, was for many years concentrated on one
                    great object, the construction of the tunnel for communication from shore to
                    shore beneath the bed of the River Thames. It is said that the original idea
                    occurred to him, as applied to the Neva at St Petersburg, in order to avoid the
                    inconvenience arising from the floating ice,—a plan which he offered to the
                    Emperor Alexander, on the occasion of his visit to England in 1814. Undismayed
                    by previous signal failures in the attempt <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0446-0399"/> to construct a tunnel beneath the Thames, Brunel,
                    confident in his own powers, persevered, and in 1824, under the auspices of the
                    duke of Wellington, who always entertained a favourable view of the
                    practicability of the scheme, a company was formed for its execution; and after
                    numerous accidents and suspensions of the works, this great and novel
                    undertaking was successfully accomplished, and the tunnel opened to the public
                    in the year 1843.</p>
                <p>In the prosecution of the work he received great assistance from his son,
                    Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and in a scientific point of view the construction of
                    the tunnel will be regarded as displaying, at the same time, the highest
                    professional ability, an amount of energy and skill rarely exceeded, and a
                    fertility of invention and resources, under what were deemed insurmountable
                    difficulties, which will secure to the memory of Sir Isambard Brunel a high
                    position among the engineers of England.</p>
                <p>He received the order of the Légion d’Honneur in 1829, and the honour of
                    knighthood in 1841. He was a corresponding member of the French Institute, and a
                    fellow of the Royal Society. He joined the Institution of Civil Engineers in the
                    year 1823, and constantly attended the meetings, took part in the discussions,
                    and promoted the society’s interests by every means in his power.</p>
                <p>He was unaffected and simple in his habits, and possessed indomitable courage,
                    perseverance, and industry; whilst his benevolence constantly prompted him to
                    kindly and considerate actions. His labours had so seriously impaired his
                    health, that for some years after the completion of the tunnel he was unable to
                    mix in active life. He died on the 12th of December 1849, in his 81st year. (See
