                    Stadthagen in Schaumburg-Lippe, on the 27th September 1724. In his youth he was
                    harshly treated by his father; but a clergyman of the name of Hauber, pleased
                    with his talents, undertook to give him gratuitous instruction, and afterwards
                    enabled him to continue his studies at Halle. There, by application and good
                    conduct, he acquired numerous friends, and in 1748 was appointed tutor in the
                    family of the Count de Lynars, who was then going as ambassador to St
                    Petersburg. On this journey he became sensible of the defective state of
                    geographical science, and resolved to devote his life to its improvement.
                    Withdrawing as soon as possible from the count’s family, he went to reside at
                    Copenhagen, and devoted himself entirely to this new pursuit. In 1752 he
                    published a <hi rend="italic">Description of the Counties of Schleswig and
                    Holstein,</hi> a work that was much approved. In 1754 he removed to Göttingen,
                    and married Christiana Dilthey, a young lady of some temporary reputation as a
                    poetess. Here a work in which he dissented from some of the Lutheran tenets lost
                    him the appointment in 1757 to the theological chair, for which he had become a
                    candidate. Two years later he was appointed professor of philosophy; but in 1761
                    he accepted an invitation to the German congregation at St Petersburg. There he
                    organized a school, which, under his auspices, soon became one of the most
                    flourishing in the North of Europe, but a disagreement with Marshal Munich led
                    him, in spite of the empress’s offers of high advancement, to return to Germany
                    in 1765. He first went to liveat Altona; but next year he was called to
                    superintend an extensive educational establishment, known as the Greyfriars
                    Gymnasium <hi rend="italic">{Gymnasium</hi><hi rend="italic">zum Grauen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Kloster),</hi> which had been formed at Berlin by Frederick the
                    Great. Here he superintended the progress of every pupil, and inspected the
                    minutest details connected with the prosperity of the institution, besides
                    giving lectures on the history of the arts and sciences. He continued to
                    prosecute his various labours till a dropsy, under which he had long suffered,
                    terminated his life on the 28th May 1793. His writings and example gave a new
                    impulse to education throughout Prussia, and the Government was so sensible of
                    the value of his services that they allowed his extensive correspondence to pass
                    free of postage.</p>
                <p>Few authors, even in Germany, have been more prolific than Biisching. As
                    enumerated by Meusel in his <hi rend="italic">Lexicon of German Authors,</hi>
                    his works amount to more than a hundred. They may be classed under the heads of
                    Geography and History, Education, Religion, and Biography. The first class
                    comprehends those upon which his fame chieily rests; for although he did not
                    possess the geographical genius of D’Anville, he may be regarded as the creator
                    of modern Statistics. His 7n&lt;ψnu7n <hi rend="italic">opus</hi> is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Neue Erdbeschreibung,</hi><hi rend="italic">{New Description of
                    the Globe).</hi> The first four parts, which comprehend Europe, were published
                    in four volumes (1754-1761), and have been translated into many of the European
                    languages. They appeared in English with a preface by Murdoch, in six volumes
                    4to, London, 1762. In 1768 the fifth part was published, being the first volume
                    upon Asia, containing Asiatic Turkey and Arabia. It displays an immense extent
                    of research, and is generally considered as his masterpiece. Biisching was also
                    the editor of a valuable collection entitled <hi rend="italic">Magazin
                    für</hi><hi rend="italic">Historic</hi><hi rend="italic">und Geographie,</hi> 2
                    vols. 4to, 1767-93; also of <hi rend="italic">IVochentl.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nachrichten von neuen Landkarten,</hi> Berlin, 1773-87.</p>
                <p>His elementary works on education long held a distinguished place in this branch
                    of literature, but his theological writings are not much esteemed. In biography
                    he wrote a number of articles for the above mentioned <hi rend="italic"
                    >Magazin,</hi> and a valuable collection of <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zur
                    Lebensgeschichte merkioürdiger Personen,</hi> 6 vols. 1783-9, including a very
                    elaborate life of Frederick the Great.</p>
