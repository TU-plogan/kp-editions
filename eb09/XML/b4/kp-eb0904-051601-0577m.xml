                    the Danube from the influx of the Timok to its mouth, and is bounded on the
                    south by the main chain of the Balkan, which separates it from Rumelia. On the
                    east it is washed by the Black Sea, and on the west is conterminous with Servia.
                    Its area is estimated at 32,932 square miles. It may be roughly described as a
                    great table-land, sloping with more or less regularity towards the river, having
                    its surface broken with numerous offshoots and underfalls of the southern
                    mountains, and furrowed by the channels of the many streams to which those
                    heights give rise. By far the larger proportion of the area belongs to the basin
                    of the Danube, which in this part of its course receives from the right the
                    Jibritza, the Ogust, the Shit, the Isker, the Vid, the Osma, the Yantra, the
                    Lorn, and the Kosliashilar. A few streams (mostly small) find their way directly
                    to the Black Sea, the only one of importance being the Kamtchyk, which drains
                    the eastern extremity of the Balkan. In summer many of the smaller streams are
                    almost dried up; but before harvest is fairly over, the wet season frequently
                    sets in, and in spring again there is an abundant rainfall. Throughout the most
                    of the province the soil is excellent, and if it were properly cultivated would
                    yield the richest crops. As it is, the inhabitants are able not only to supply
                    their own wants, but to furnish a considerable export of agricultural produce.
                    The cereal most abundantly grown is wheat, but Indian corn is also pretty common
                    with the Mussulman farmers. Little hay is made, and turnips are quite unknown.
                    Potatoes are only cultivated by the Tatar settlers in the Dobrudsha. The peach,
                    the apricot, the grape, and many other fruits come to great perfection; and wine
                    is manufactured in considerable quantities, but in a very careless and rude
                    manner. The buffalo is the animal chiefly used in agricultural labour, though
                    horses are sufficiently common. Cows, pigs, and goats are also kept, and
                    sheep-farming is largely carried on in many parts, but the character of the
                    various stocks is very poor. The mineral wealth of the province is totally
                    neglected, and its rich supplies of timber are often heedlessly wasted. Roads
                    can hardly be said to exist; for though several have been constructed by
                    enterprizing pashas, they have soon been allowed to fall into total disrepair. A
                    single railway line stretches from Kustendji to Chernavoda on the Danube A
                    considerable amount of traffic, however, is carried on by the river, and the
                    export trade on the Black Sea is of growing importance. The province is
                    politically divided into the sandjaks of Rustchuk <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    Nissa, Widdin, Tirnova, Sofia, Varna, and Tulcha. Its principal towns are
                    Widdin, Nikopoli, Sistova, Rustchuk, Rassova, and Hirsovä, along the Danube;
                    Kustendji, Baltshik, and Varna on the coast; and Babadagh, Basarjyk, Shumna,
                    Tirnova, Lovatz, and Vratza. The population, which amounts to from two to two
                    and a half millions, is of various elements, and is estimated as follows :—</p>

                <p>The population along the coast is of a very mingled description, the genuine
                    Bulgarian looking down on the Gagaous, as he calls the mongrel race, with no
                    small contempt. The Tatars are emigrants from the Crimea, who were permitted to
                    leave the Russian empire after the last war. They are industrious and
                    prosperous, but the Circassians, who have fled from the Caucasus at the advance
                    of Russia, are for the most part very poor. The Turks, Tatars, Albanians, and
                    Circassians are Mahometans; the Roumanians, the Armenians, and most of the
                    Russians belong to the Greek Church; and the Gypsies are part Mahometan, part
                    Christian, and part Pagan.</p>
                <p>The Bulgarians were originally a people of Ugrian or Finnish
                    extraction,—according to Professor Rosier, a Samoyede race. They appear for the
                    first time in history about 120 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when a band,
                    under the leadership of a chieftain called Vound, took refuge in Armenia and
                    settled on the banks of the Araxes. They are next mentioned by Bishop Eunodius
                    as marching towards the left bank of the Danube, and in the following century
                    they became known to the Byzantine empire as a hostile power. About 660 they
                    seem to have broken up into several divisions, of which the most important
                    crossed the Danube under Asparuch (third son of Kubrat, who had delivered them
                    from the domination of the Avars), settled in Moesia, subjugated the Slavonic
                    population, and extorted tribute even from the Greek emperor. The kingdom thus
                    founded gradually extended northwards to the country of the Theiss, and south
                    over a large part of the peninsula. Its most prosperous period rvas the reign of
                    Simeon (893-927), who not only made himself formidable to the Greeks as a
                    warrior, but also took an interest in the internal progress of his country,
                    securing the establishment of Christianity, which had been introduced by Boris
                    or Bogoris about 862, and bestowing his patronage on the early efforts of native
                    literature. After his death decay began; the Russians and Petchenegs invaded the
                    country, and the Byzantine emperors took no rest till the Bulgarians, sadly
                    diminished in numbers, acknowledged the supremacy of Basilius in 1019. More than
                    a century and a half later, two brothers, Peter and Asan or Yusan, headed a
                    successful insurrection, and founded what is known as the Bulgaro-Wallachian
                    kingdom of the Asanides, which, after maintaining itself against the Byzantines
                    and the Hungarians, and even becoming master of Macedonia and Thrace, at last
                    fell under the Tatar yoke, and was finally subjugated to Turkey by the fatal
                    battle of Kossova.</p>
                <p>The Bulgarians retain but little trace of their Finnish origin; that they were
                    recognized as belonging to that race is shown by the name Unnogonduri, applied
                    to them by the Byzantines. They still have high cheek bones; their hair is light
                    and thin; their eyelids do not open wide; and the general form of the face is
                    frequently oval. Of their condition in heathen times little is known, though a
                    few important deductions, such as that they had slaves, can be drawn from the
                    questions presented by them to the Pope in 866. (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Conciliorum,</hi> v.) They were so far Slavonicized
                    by the 9th century that the church service was held in Slavonic. At present,
                    though their language is still fundamentally Slavonic, and is usually placed
                    between the Russian and the Servian, yet it is largely mingled with Turkish and
                    Persian, and has even a considerable element of Italian and Greek. The Turkish
                    influence not only appears in the vocabulary, but it is no uncommon thing,
                    especially in the more pretentious forms of speech, for Slavonic verbs to be
                    conjugated in the Turkish mode. A grammar was published in 1852 by A. and D.
                    Kyriak Canckof, and Miklosch has devoted himself to the study of the dialects.
                    Of early literary remains there is an almost total lack; but a number of popular
                    songs that seem to have been handed down, perhaps from heathen times, have been
                    collected. (See Dozon’s <hi rend="italic">Les Chants</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Populaires Bulgares,</hi> Paris, 1874.) These songs have little or no poetic
                    merit, but are full of wild cosmogonic myths. The modem literature is written in
                    a dialect which is hardly understood by the mass of the people, and its
                    existence is largely due to foreign influence. The alphabet in use is a compound
                    of letters from the secular and ecclesiastical alphabets of Russia. Though
                    nominally members of the Greek Church, the Bulgarians are in many respects as
                    pagan as they were centuries ago, and their superstitions are almost countless.
                    The clergy, appointed by the heads of the church at Constantinople, are
                    deplorably ignorant, and frequently know as little as their flocks of the
                    meaning of the prayers which they read in Greek. Their arbitrary and oppressive
                    dealings excited a strong movement of revolt about 1860, and the bishops were
                    expelled from many of the towns. A junction λvith the Roman Catholics, to whom
                    the national church of Bulgaria has frequently shown a leaning, was proposed by
                    one party, which soon found numerous supporters; but the agitation will probably
                    end in the establishment of an independent Bulgarian hierarchy.</p>
                <p>No inconsiderable number of Bulgarians are to be found beyond the province that
                    bears their name. They form a more or less important element in the whole region
                    from the Danube to the Aegean, and from the Black Sea to Eastern Albania.
                    Gochlert reckons that <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n578/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0578-0517"/> there are 4,000,000 in the Turkish empire, and
                    Professor Szabo makes their number in Servia 100,000. As early as the 14th
                    century emigration took place to the Banat, where the Bulgarians number upwards
                    of 23,000; and in Transylvania there is a colony which retains its dialect. (See
                    <hi rend="italic">Denkschriften</hi><hi rend="italic">d. Wien. Akad., Phil.-
                    hist. Cl.,</hi> 1856.) Much more important are the Bulgarian settlements in
                    Bessarabia, which in 1862 numbered 70,000 inhabitants. These began to be formed
                    as early as 1787, and received strong accessions from 1801 to 1812. The chief
                    town which owed its existence to this transmigration is Bolgrad, on Lake Yalpuk,
                    which passed with a portion of Bessarabia to Moldavia in 1851. About 1865 it had
                    9000 inhabitants.</p>
