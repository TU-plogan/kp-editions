                    (1774-1853), an eminent German geologist and geographer, was born at Stolpe in
                    Pomerania, April 25, 1774. In 1790 he studied at the mining school of Freiberg
                    under the celebrated Werner, one of his <pb break="no"

                    Alexander Von Humboldt. At the age of twenty-three he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Attempt at a Mineralogical Description of Landeck,</hi> and also
                    an <hi rend="italic">Attempt at a Geognostic Description of Silesia.</hi> He was
                    at this time a zealous upholder of the Neptunian theory of his illustrious
                    master. In 1797 he met his old school-fellow Von Humboldt at Salzburg, and with
                    him explored the geological formations of Styria and the adjoining Alps. In the
                    spring of the following year. Von Buch extended his excursions into Italy, where
                    his faith in the Neptunian theory was for the first time shaken. In his previous
                    works he had advocated the aqueous origin of basaltic and other formations; he
                    was now not less clearly convinced that these owed their existence to volcanic
                    action. In 1799 he paid his first visit to Vesuvius, which he did not again see
                    till 1805, when he was accompanied by Humboldt and Gay-Lussac. They had the good
                    fortune to witness a remarkable eruption, which supplied Buch with data for
                    refuting many erroneous ideas then entertained regarding the activity of
                    volcanoes. Three years before he had explored the south of France, and directed
                    special attention to the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne. The aspect of the Puy de
                    Dome, with its cone of trachyte and its strata of basaltic lava, induced him to
                    abandon as untenable the doctrines of Werner on the formation of these rocks.
                    The scientific results of his investigations he embodied in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Geognostical Observations during Travels through Germany and
                    Italy,</hi> Berlin, 1802-9, 2 vols. 8vo. From the south of Europe Von Buch
                    repaired to the north, and spent two years among the Scandinavian islands,
                    making many important observations on the geography of plants, on climatology,
                    and on geology. He also established the fact that the whole of Sweden is slowly
                    but continuously rising above the level of the sea from Frederickshall to Abo.
                    The details of these discoveries are given in his <hi rend="italic">Travels
                    through Norway and Lapland,</hi> Berlin, 1810. In 1815 he visited the Canary
                    Islands in company with Christian Smith, the Norwegian botanist. His
                    observations here convinced him that these and other islands of the Atlantic
                    owed their existence to volcanic action of the most intense kind, and that the
                    groups of islands in the South Sea are the remains of a pre-existing continent.
                    The physical description of the Canary Islands was published at Berlin in 1825.
                    After leaving the Canaries Von Buch proceeded to the Hebrides and the coasts of
                    Scotland and Ireland. His geological excursions even into countries already
                    repeatedly visited were continued without interruption till his 78th year. Eight
                    months before his death, he visited the mountains of Auvergne; and on returning
                    home he read a paper on the Jurassic Formation before the Academy of Berlin. The
                    circumstances of Von Buch’s life were singularly favourable to scientific
                    pursuits. He inherited from his father a fortune more than sufficient for all
                    his wants. He was never married, and was completely unembarrassed by family
                    ties. His excursions he always undertook on foot, with a staff in his hand, and
                    the large pockets of his over-coat filled with papers and geological
                    instruments. Under this guise, the passer-by would not easily have recognized
                    the man whom Humboldt pronounced the greatest geologist of his time. He died at
                    Berlin on the 4th of March 1853. In addition to the works already mentioned Von
                    Buch published others, of which we may specify the magnificent <hi rend="italic"
