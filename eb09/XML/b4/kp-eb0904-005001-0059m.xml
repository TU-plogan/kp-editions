                    and octahedral or jeweller’s borax, which has only five molecules of water in
                    its composition. The former, which is the variety commonly met with, occurs as a
                    natural product in various parts of the world. In former times crude borax was
                    procured chiefly from Thibet, whence it came by way of India under the name of
                    tincal. It also is found in other parts of Central Asia, at Halberstadt in
                    Transylvania, in Canada, aud in Peru; and in recent years an important source of
                    the mineral has been discovered near the Clear Lake in California, in a body of
                    water now called the Borax Lake. In very dry seasons the water almost entirely
                    disappears from the basin of the Borax Lake, which is situated in a region
                    containing hot springs and the remains of volcanic action. In 1863, when the
                    lake measured 4000 feet long, 1800 feet across at its widest part, and about 3
                    feet deep, the water was found to contain 2401 ’ 56 grains of solid matter per
                    gallon, of which 535Ό8 grains represented crystallized borax. The bed of the
                    lake is occupied with a deposit of borax crystals, which are obtained by sinking
                    caissons, pumping out the water, and digging up the deposit. Californian crude
                    borax is fit for use by assayers and others without undergoing any purification;
                    but that obtained from Thibet contains a greenish encrusting matter of a soapy
                    consistence which has to be separated before the material is fit for use under
                    the name of refined borax.</p>
                <p>The supply of borax is, however, more largely derived by artificial means from
                    boracic or boric acid, or from salts in which that acid occurs, than from these
                    natural sources. Boracic acid is found among the ejecta around the craters of
                    some volcanoes, and it is found in jets of vapour which stream forth from
                    fissures in the earth in regions of volcanic disturbance. The chief source of
                    boracic acid at the present day is found in the Maremma of Tuscany, an extensive
                    and desolate track of country embracing an area of about forty miles, over which
                    jets of vapour and heated gases <hi rend="italic">{soffioni)</hi> and springs of
                    boiling water spurt out from numerous chasms and fissures. The Maremma is
                    disturbed by frequent volcanic shocks; at some points the mouths of the fissures
                    open direct into the air, at others they are covered by small muddy lakes <hi
                    rend="italic">{lagoni).</hi> In addition to a small impregnation of boracic acid
                    the soffioni contain ammoniacal vapour, to fix and obtain which the gases at
                    some works are led through sulphuric acid. For obtaining the boracic acid a
                    series of basins or artificial lagoni are formed over the soffioni, so arranged
                    that water to be charged with the acid is conveyed by gravitation from the first
                    to the last of the series. Water is led into the highest and by the action of
                    the heated gases it is soon in a state of ebullition. After being so left for
                    about a day it is drawn off into the second, where it remains under like
                    circumstances for the same period, and so to the end of the series, when the
                    water should contain nearly 2 per cent, of boracic acid. The mechanical
                    impurities being allowed to subside, the liquor is then run into evaporating
                    pans, shallow lead-lined vessels, heated by the gases from the soffioni
                    themselves. The evaporating pans are worked on a continuous system, similar to
                    the lagoons; the liquor placed in the upper being concentrated down to half its
                    original bulk is run into the second, and so on till it reaches a degree of
                    concentration fit for crystallizing out the acid. In recent years artificial
                    soffioni have been formed by boring through the rock till some of the numerous
                    chasms or chambers, with which the interior is honey-combed, are reached, when
                    immediately all the phenomena of a boracic soffione are established. From some
                    of these artificial soffioni issues water of sufficient richness in acid to be
                    led there direct to the evaporating pans. Similar emanations of volcanic vapours
                    and boracic acid have been discovered in Nevada, United States. Boracic acid is
                    also obtained from boronatrocalcite (Ulexite or Hayesine), a double salt of
                    sodium and calcium, of which extensive deposits exist in the neighbourhood of
                    the nitrate of soda beds of Chili and Peru. It is very variable in constitution
                    and condition of purity. Similar deposits are found in California, Nevada, and
                    Nova Scotia, and from the West Coast of Africa is received a borate of lime
                    bearing the name of rhodizite. The boronatrocalcite, or borate of lime, as it is
                    called in commerce, is applied in its unrefined condition <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n60/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0060-0051"/> to many uses for which borax is employed. In 1855
                    Dr T. Richardson patented a process for using the picked and washed
                    boronatrocalcite as a substitute for borax in the glass manufacture and
                    preparation of pottery glazes. It is, however, chiefly employed as a source of
                    boracic acid, and there are also several methods of obtaining borax direct from
                    the compound salt.</p>
                <p>Commercial boracic acid usually contains a considerable percentage of sulphates
                    of ammonium, magnesium, and calcium besides other impurities. To prepare borax
                    from this acid, from 110 to 120 parts of crystallized sodium carbonate are
                    required for 100 parts of boracic acid. The soda is dissolved in a lead-lined
                    vessel heated with steam, to which the boracic acid is added in repeated
                    charges. The vessel is covered and the carbonate of amirtonia given off is led
                    into a solution of sulphuric acid and fixed. For the production of ordinary or
                    prismatic borax the solution is brought to a strength of 20° to 22° Baumé (1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 161 to 1*180 sp. gr.) and allowed to cool down as
                    slowly as possible, so that the crystals may assume the large size demanded in
                    commerce. Octahedral borax is deposited when a solution indicating 30° Baume
                    (sp. gr. 1 ’ 264) is slowly cooling down from 79° to 56° C. Below this point the
                    formation of ordinary borax takes place.</p>
                <p>Under the blowpipe borax parts with its water, and melts into a clear glass which
                    has the peculiar property of dissolving many metallic oxides, and thereby
                    exhibiting characteristic colours, on which account it is of great value in
                    blowpipe analysis. The same property also renders it a valuable material for
                    pottery glazes and enamels, and as it adheres closely to clean surfaces of metal
                    and prevents their oxidation under high heat, it is indispensable for use in
                    hard soldering, and is largely employed in brass manufactures. It is also one of
                    the ingredients employed in glass-making. Borax forms with oils and fats a soap
                    which has been proposed as a detergent; but experiments conducted by the late
                    Professor Thomas Anderson of Glasgow show that it has a more corrosive influence
                    on fibres than common soap. In Belgium powdered borax is used in domestic
                    washing, with the object of economizing soap. Borax is used in medicine as an
                    external application in skin diseases, and the preparation known as <hi
                    rend="italic">mel boracis</hi> is a useful gargle in ulceration of the mouth and
                    throat. In Sweden boracic acid is extensively employed for the preservation of
                    meat and milk; and while it forms an efficient antiseptic, food prepared with it
                    is said to be perfectly fit for use. A very beautiful pigment, now much used in
                    calico-printing, under the name of Guignet’s green, is a borate of chromium.</p>
