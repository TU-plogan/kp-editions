                    other imaginary islands in the Atlantic. For a long time before the discovery of
                    America, the fancies of navigators or of cosmographers had scattered over the
                    Atlantic a number of islands, either wholly imaginary, or so detached from the
                    germ of truth which had suggested their existence as to represent no fact in
                    nature. Several such islands are described in the Arabic geography of Edrisi
                    (1153-54 A.D.), and if, passing over more than four hundred years, we take up an
                    atlas of Münster or Mercator we shall find that the northern Atlantic, instead
                    of presenting a vast blank as in our most recent charts, is almost as full of
                    islands and shoals as the heaven is of stars. To our present category belongs
                    the island of St Brandon, the supposed discovery of an Irish eremite of the 6th
                    century, of whose voyage many wonders are related. Such also were <hi
                    rend="italic">Antilia</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Island of the Seven
                    Cities,</hi> connected with another legend of uncertain date, which described
                    this as the refuge of a body of Christians, who, in flight from the Saracen
                    conquerors of the Peninsula, had, under the guidance of their seven bishops,
                    committed themselves to the wide ocean; such were <hi rend="italic">May da</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Asmaide,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Isla Verde,</hi> or
                    Green Isle (which the natives of the Hebrides still think they see beneath the
                    western sun), but none more famous and recurrent than the <hi rend="italic">Isle
                    of Brazil.</hi> The name of this island connects itself with the red dye-woods
                    known by that name in the Middle Ages, a name that possibly also may have been
                    applied to other vegetable dyes, and so may descend from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insuloe Purpurarioe</hi> of Pliny. Its first appearance on a map appears to be
                    (Z. <hi rend="italic">de Brazι)</hi> in the Venetian portulano of Andrea di
                    Bianco (1436), where it is found attached to one of the larger islands of the
                    Azores. When this group became better known and was colonized, the island in
                    question got the name of Terceira. And the conservative spirit of map-makers
                    then sought a new position for that Island of Brazil which they found in the
                    charts of their predecessors, and this island grew in (imaginary) importance and
                    size. In time, better knowledge of the Atlantic showed that these must be
                    exaggerated, but belief in the island’s existence endured.</p>
                <p>The conservative spirit just referred to has indeed preserved in some shape most
                    of the names mentioned above. The name of the <hi rend="italic">Seven
                    Cities</hi> survives as applied to a volcanic district of the Island of St
                    Michael’s (Azores). <hi rend="italic">Antilia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">St
                    Brandon's Isle</hi> were conspicuous on the maps which were probably in the
                    hands of Columbus on his first western voyage. The latter name has disappeared
                    indeed, but the former survives in a plural form, as applied to the West Indies
                    <hi rend="italic">(Antilles').</hi> So also it is probable that the familiar
                    existence of “Brazil” as a geographical name led to its bestowal upon the vast
                    continental region of South America, which was found to supply dye-woods kindred
                    to those which the name properly denoted. The older memory, however, survived
                    also, and the <hi rend="italic">Island</hi> of Brazil retained its place in
                    mid-ocean, some hundred miles to the west of Ireland, both in the traditions of
                    the forecastle and in charts. In Purday’s <hi rend="italic">General Chart of the
                    Atlantic,</hi> “corrected to 1830,” we find the <hi rend="italic">May da</hi>
                    indeed noted as “very doubtful,” but <hi rend="italic">“Isle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Verte</hi><hi rend="italic">or Green Rock"</hi> (44° 48' N. lat.,
                    and 26° 10' W. long. ) with the remark, ‘ ‘ Existence lately confirmed;” and <hi
                    rend="italic">“Brazil Rock</hi> (high),” with no indication of doubt, in 51°10'
                    N. lat., 15° 50' W. long. In a chart of currents by the late Mr Findlay, dated
                    1853, these names appear again. But in his 12th edition of Purday’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoir Descriptive and Explanatory of the</hi> Λ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Ocean</hi> (1865), the
                    existence of these islands is briefly discussed and rejected by Mr Findlay, with
                    the intimation that their names would be entirely omitted in future
                    editions.</p>
                <p>Thus the official sepulture of the old tradition of the island of Brazil took
                    place only eleven years before the date of this article (1876). And now the
                    surface of the Atlantic, as represented in the latest Admiralty charts, shows
                    between St Kilda and Bermuda, between Newfoundland and the Azores, but one point
                    rising above the water, viz., the sugar loaf of <hi rend="italic">Rockall,</hi>
                    in 57° 35' 52" N. lat., 13° 42' 21" W. long. (H. Y.)</p>
