                    personal ornament, made of different materials, according to the fashion of the

                    a diminutive of <hi rend="italic">bracüe,</hi> all formed from the Latin <hi

                    Num. xxxi. 50, 2 Sam. i. 10, and which being used with reference -to men only,
                    may be taken to be the <hi rend="italic">armlet;</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic"
                        >tzamid,</hi> which is found in Gen. xxiv. 22, Num. xxxi. 50, Ezek. xvi. 11
                    ;— where these two words occur together (as in Num. xxxi, 50) the first is
                    rendered by “chain,” and the second by “bracelet;” 3. ∏1^∣B* <hi rend="italic"
                        >sheroth,</hi> which occurs only in Isa. iii. 19. The first probably meant
                    armlets worn by men; the second, bracelets worn by women and sometimes by men;
                    and the third, a peculiar bracelet of chain-work worn only by women. In 2 Sam.
                    i. 10, the first word denotes the royal ornament which the Amalekite took from
                    the arm of the dead Saul, and brought with the other regalia to David. There
                    is-little question that this was such a distinguishing band of jewelled metal as
                    we still find worn as a mark of royalty from the Tigris to the Ganges. The
                    Egyptian kings are represented with armlets, which were also worn by the
                    Egyptian women. These, however, are not jewelled, but of plain or enamelled
                    metal, as was in all likelihood the case among the Hebrews. In modern times the
                    most celebrated armlets are those which form part of the regalia of the Persian
                    kings, and which formerly belonged to the Mongol emperors of India. These
                    ornaments are of dazzling splendour, and the jewels in them are of such large
                    size and immense value that the pair are reckoned to be worth a million of our
                    money. The principal stone of the right armlet is famous in the East under the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">Deviâ-e-nur,</hi> or “Sea of light.” It weighs 186
                    carats, and is considered the diamond of finest lustre in the world. The
                    principal jewel of the left armlet, although of somewhat inferior size (146
                    carats) and value, is renowned as the <hi rend="italic">Tdg-e-mah,</hi> “Crown
                    of the moon.” The imperial armlets, generally set with jewels, may also be
                    observed in most of the portraits of the Indian emperors.</p>
                <p>Bracelets have at all times been much in use among barbaric nations, and the
                    women frequently wear several on the same arm. The finer kinds are of mother of
                    pearl, fine gold, or silver; others of less value are made of plated steel,
                    horn, brass, copper, beads, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>This species of personal ornament was exceedingly common in Europe in prehistoric
                    times. The bracelets of the Bronze Age were either of gold or bronze, silver
                    being then unknown. In shape they were oval and penannular with expanding or
                    trumpet-shaped ends, having an opening between them of about half an inch to
                    enable them to bo easily slipped over the wrist. Those of gold were generally
                    plain, hammered rods, bent to the requisite shape, but those of bronze were
                    often chased with elegant designs showing a cultivated taste. Some forms of
                    spiral armlets of bronze, peculiar to Germany and Scandinavia, covered the whole
                    fore-arm, and were doubtless intended as much for defence against a sword-stroke
                    as for ornament. The Etruscan and early Roman forms of bronze bracelet were for
                    the most part cylindrical, with overlapping ends, or spiral and serpent-shaped.
                    These were also the common forms in the Iron Age of Northern Europe, while
                    silver bracelets of great elegance, formed of plaited and intertwisted strands
                    of silver wire, and plain penannular hoops, round or lozenge-shaped in section
                    and tapering to the extremities, became common towards the close of the pagan
                    period. The late Celtic period in Britain was characterized by serpent-shaped
                    bracelets and massive armlets, with projecting ornaments of solid bronze and
                    perforations filled with enamel. In the Middle Ages bracelets were much less
                    commonly used in Europe, but the custom has continued to prevail among Eastern
                    nations to the present time, and many of the types that were common in Europe in
                    prehistoric times are still worn in Central Asia. A treatise <hi rend="italic"
                        >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Armillis Veterum,</hi> by Thomas Bartolinus, was
