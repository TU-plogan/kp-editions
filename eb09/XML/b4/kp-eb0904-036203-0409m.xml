                <p><label type="entry">BRONCHITIS</label>, inflammation of the mucous membrane of
                    the bronchial tubes. Well known as one of the most common diseases of the
                    climate of Great Britain, bronchitis exists in either an <hi rend="italic"
                    >acute</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">chronic</hi> form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acute bronchitis,</hi> like other inflammatory affections of
                    the chest, generally arises a3 the result of exposure to cold, particularly if
                    accompanied with damp, or of sudden change from a heated to a cool atmosphere.
                    The symptoms vary according to the severity of the attack, and more especially
                    according to the extent to which the inflammatory action spreads in the
                    bronchial tubes. The disease usually manifests itself at first in the form of a
                    catarrh, or common cold; but the accompanying feverishness and general
                    constitutional disturbance proclaim the attack to be something more severe, and
                    symptoms denoting the onset of bronchitis soon present themselves. A short,
                    painful, dry cough, accompanied with rapid and wheezing respiration, a feeling
                    of rawness and pain in the throat and behind the breast bone, and uf oppression
                    or tightness throughout the chest, mark the early stages of the disease. In some
                    cases, from the first, symptoms of the form of asthma known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">bronchitic</hi> are superadded, and greatly aggravate the
                    patient’s suffering. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Asthma.</hi></p>
                <p>After a few days expectoration begins to come with the cough, at first scanty and
                    viscid or frothy, but soon becoming copious and of purulent character. In
                    general, after free expectoration has been established the more urgent and
                    painful symptoms abate; and while the cough may persist for a length of time,
                    often extending to three or four weeks, in the majority of instances
                    convalescence advances, and the patient is ultimately restored to health,
                    although there is not unfrequently left a tendency to a recurrence of the
                    disease on exposure to its exciting causes.</p>
                <p>W hen the ear or the stethoscope is applied to the chest of a person suffering
                    from such an attack as that now described, there are heard in the earlier stages
                    snoring or cooing sounds, mixed up with others of wheezing or fine whistling
                    quality, accompanying respiration. These are denominated dry sounds, and they
                    are occasionally so abundant and distinct as to convey their vibrations to the
                    hand applied to the chest, as well as to be audible to a bystander at some
                    distance. As the disease progresses these sounds become to a large extent
                    replaced by others of crackling or bubbling character, which are termed moist
                    sounds or râles. Both these kinds of abnormal sounds are readily explained by a
                    reference to the pathological condition of the parts. One of the first effects
                    of inflammation upon the bronchial mucous membrane is to cause some degree of
                    swelling, which, together with the presence of a tough secretion closely
                    adhering to it, tends to diminish the calibre of the tubes. The respired air as
                    it passes over this surface gives rise to the dry or sonorous breath sounds, the
                    coarser being generated in the large, and the finer or wheezing sounds in the
                    small divisions of the bronchi. Before long, however, the discharge from the
                    bronchial mucous membrane becomes more abundant and less glutinous, and
                    accumulates in the tubes till dislodged by coughing. The respired air, as it
                    passes through this fluid, causes the moist râles above described. In most
                    instances both moist and dry sounds are heard abundantly in the same case, since
                    different portions of the bronchial tubes are affected at different times in the
                    course of the disease.</p>
                <p>Such are briefly the main characteristics presented by an ordinary attack of
                    acute bronchitis running a favourable course.</p>
                <p>The case is, however, very different when the inflammation spreads into, or when
                    it primarily affects the minute ramifications of the bronchial tubes which are
                    in immediate relation to the air-cells of the lungs, giving rise to that form of
                    the disease known as <hi rend="italic">capillary bronchitis.</hi> When this
                    takes place all the symptoms already detailed become greatly intensified, and
                    the patient’s life is placed in imminent peril in consequence of the
                    interruption to the entrance of air into the lungs, and thus to the due <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> aeration of the blood. The feverishness and
                    restlessness increase, the cough becomes incessant, the respiration extremely
                    rapid and laboured, the nostrils dilating with each effort, and evidence of
                    impending suffocation appears. The surface of the body is pale or dusky, the
                    lips are livid, while breathing becomes increasingly difficult, and is attended
                    with suffocative paroxysms which render the recumbent posture impossible. Unless
                    speedy relief is obtained by successful efforts to clear the chest by coughing
                    and expectoration, the patient’s strength gives way, somnolence and delirium set
                    in, and death ensues. All this may be brought about in the space of a few days,
                    and such cases, particularly among the very young, sometimes prove fatal within
                    forty-eight hours.</p>
                <p>During life, in addition to the auscultatory signs present in ordinary
                    bronchitis, there generally exist in this form of the disease abundant fine
                    moist râles at the bases of both lungs; and the appearance of these organs after
                    death shows the minute bronchi and many of the air-cells to be filled with
                    matter similar to that which had been expectorated, and which has thus acted as
                    a mechanical hindrance to the entrance of the respired air and caused death by
                    asphyxia.</p>
                <p>Acute bronchitis must at all times be looked upon as a severe and even serious
                    ailment, but there are certain circumstances under which its occurrence is a
                    matter of special anxiety to the physician. It is pre-eminently dangerous at the
                    extremes of life, and mortality statistics show it to be one of the most fatal
                    of the diseases of those periods, This is to be explained not only by the well
                    recognized fact that all acute diseases tell with great severity on the feeble
                    frames alike of infants and aged people, but moro <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n410/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0410-0363"/> particularly by the tendency which bronchitis
                    undoubtedly has in attacking them to assume the capillary form, and when it does
                    so to prove quickly fatal. The importance, therefore, of early attention to the
                    slightest evidence of bronchitis among the very young or the aged can scarcely
                    be overrated. *’</p>
                <p>Bronchitis is also apt to be very severe when it occurs in persons who are
                    addicted to intemperance. Again, in those who suffer from any disease affecting
                    directly or indirectly the respiratory functions, such as consumption or heart
                    disease, the supervention of an attack of acute bronchitis is an alarming
                    complication, increasing, as it necessarily does, the embarrassment of
                    breathing. The same remark is applicable to those numerous instances of its
                    occurrence in children who are or have been suffering from such diseases as have
                    always associated with them a certain degree of bronchial irritation, such as
                    measles and hooping-cough.</p>
                <p>One other source of danger of a special character in bronchitis remains to be
                    mentioned, viz., collapse of the lung. Occasionally a branch of a bronchial tube
                    becomes plugged up with secretion, so that the area of the lung to which this
                    branch conducts ceases to be inflated on inspiration. The small quantity of air
                    imprisoned in the portion of lung gradually escapes, but no fresh air enters,
                    and the part collapses and becomes of solid consistence. Increased difficulty of
                    breathing is the result, and where a large portion of lung is affected by the
                    plugging up of a large bronchus, a fatal result may rapidly follow, the danger
                    being specially great in the case of children. Fortunately, the obstruction may
                    sometimes be removed by vigorous coughing, and relief is then obtained.</p>
                <p>With respect to the treatment of acute bronchitis, in those mild cases which are
                    more of the nature of a simple catarrh, little else will be found necessary than
                    confinement in a warm room, or in bed, for a few days, and the use of light
                    diet, together with warm diluent drinks. Additional measures are, however,
                    called for when the disease is more markedly developed. Medicines to allay fever
                    and promote perspiration, such as the well-known Mindererus spirit, combined
                    with antimonial or ipecacuan wine, are highly serviceable in the earlier stages.
                    Later on, with the view of soothing the pain of the cough, and favouring
                    expectora · tion, mixtures containing squill or tolu, with the addition of some
                    opiate, such as the ordinary paregorics, may be advantageously employed. The use
                    of opium, however, in any form should not be resorted to in the case of young
                    children without medical advice, since its action on them is much more potent
                    and less under control than it is in adults. Not a few of the so-called
                    “soothing mixtures,” have been found to contain opium in quantity sufficient to
                    prove dangerous when administered to children; and, indeed, it is to be feared
                    that fatal results not unfrequently follow their incautious use in this way.</p>
                <p>From the outset of the attack the employment of warm applications to the chest in
                    the form of fomentations or poultices affords great relief. Few remedial
                    measures are of greater value than the frequent inhalation of steam. This is
                    accomplished readily enough in the case of adults by the use of an inhaler or
                    simply by breathing over an open-mouthed vessel containing boiling water. In
                    children in whom this plan cannot be carried out in the sàme manner, there is in
                    general no difficulty in surrounding them with an atmosphere of steam by placing
                    around them vessels containing hot water, the vapour from which envelopes them.
                    The relief to the cough and breathing, and the aid to expectoration afforded by
                    this simple plan, are often surprising, and the cases are rare where it cannot
                    be borne.</p>
                <p>Should the cough persist for a length of time, and the disease threaten to become
                    chronic, counter-irritant applications to the chest in front and behind, in the
                    form of stimulating liniments, or even of blisters, will be rendered
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>When the bronchitis is of the capillary form, the great object is to maintain the
                    patient’s strength, and to endeavour to secure the expulsion of the morbid
                    secretion from the fine bronchi. In addition to the remedies already alluded to,
                    stimulants are called for from the first; and should the cough be ineffectual in
                    relieving the bronchial tubes, the administration of an emetic dose of sulphate
                    of zinc or squill may produce a good effect.</p>
                <p>During the whole course of any attack of bronchitis, attention must be paid to
                    the due nourishment of the patient; and during the subsequent convalescence,
                    which, particularly in elderly persons, is apt to be slow, tonics and stimulants
                    may have to be prescribed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chronic bronchitis</hi> may arise as the result of repeated
                    attacks of the acute form, or it may exist altogether independently. It occurs
                    more frequently among persons advanced in life than among the young, although no
                    age is exempt from it.</p>
                <p>The usual history of this form of bronchitis is that of a cough recurring during
                    the colder seasons of the year, and in its earlier stages, departing entirely in
                    summer, so that it is frequently called “winter cough.” In many persons subject
                    to it, however, attacks are apt to be excited at any time by very slight causes,
                    such as changes in the weather; and in advanced cases of the disease the cough
                    is seldom altogether absent.</p>
                <p>The symptoms and auscultatory signs of chronic bronchitis are on the whole
                    similar to those pertaining to the acute form, except that the febrile
                    disturbance and pain are much less marked. The cough is usually more troublesome
                    in the morning than during the day. There is usually free and copious
                    expectoration, and occasionally this is so abundant as to constitute what is
                    termed <hi rend="italic">bronchσrrhoea.</hi></p>
                <p>Chronic bronchitis leads to alterations of structure in the affected bronchial
                    tubes, their mucous membrane becoming thickened or even ulcerated, while
                    occasionally permanent dilatation of the bronchi takes place, often accompanied
                    with profuse foetid expectoration. In long standing cases of chronic bronchitis,
                    the nutrition of the lungs becomes impaired, and dilatation of the air-tubes <hi
                    rend="italic">(emphysema)</hi> and other complications result, giving rise to
                    more or less constant breathlessness. Chronic bronchitis is liable in some
                    instances, particularly when accompanied with loss of flesh and strength, to be
                    mistaken for consumption; but the physician who carefully regards the history of
                    the case and observes the physical signs and symptoms, will in general be able
                    to distinguish the one disease from the other.</p>
                <p>Chronic bronchitis may arise secondarily to some other ailment. This is
                    especially the case in Bright’s disease of the kidneys, and in heart disease, of
                    both of which maladies it often proves a serious complication.</p>
                <p>Chronic bronchitis does not often prove directly fatal, nor is it necessarily
                    inconsistent with long life. Its chief danger lies in the tendency to
                    intercurrent acute attacks, particularly in the aged; and in this manner it very
                    frequently causes death.</p>
                <p>The treatment to be adopted in chronic bronchitis depends upon the severity of
                    the case, the age of the patient, and the presence or absence of complications.
                    Attention to the general health is a matter of prime importance in all cases of
                    the disease, more particularly among persons whose avocations entail exposure,
                    and tonics with cod-liver oil will be found highly advantageous. The use of a
                    respirator in very cold or damp weather is a valuable means of protection. In
                    those aggravated forms of chronic bronchitis, where the slightest exposure to
                    cold air brings on fresh attacks, it may become necessary, where
                    circumstances<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n411/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0411-0364"/> permit, to enjoin confinement to a warm room or
                    removal to a more genial climate during the winter months.</p>
                <p>When expectoration is attended with difficulty, such remedies as squill in
                    combination with ammonia may prove useful. When, on the other hand,
                    bronchorrhcea exists, astringents are called for. The inhalation of vapour
                    containing iodine or turpentine is often followed with marked benefit in this
                    way. Where breathlessness accompanies the disease, besides the use of ethereal
                    preparations, marked relief is often derived from large doses of iodide of
                    potassium. Counter-irritation to the chest with turpentine, mustard, or croton
                    oil is generally attended with good results. In aged and weak persons stimulants
                    are an indispensable part of the treatment. Acute exacerbations of the disease,
                    which are so apt to arise in the chronic form, must be dealt with on the
                    principles already indicated in treating of acute bronchitis. (J. o. <hi
