                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> 12' W. long., is bounded N. by Northamptonshire W. by
                    Oxfordshire, S. by Berkshire, and E. by Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, and
                    Middlesex. It is the thirty-third in size of the English counties, measuring 53
                    miles at its greatest length and 27 at its greatest breadth, and containing,
                    according to the last ordnance survey, 467,009 acres, or nearly 730 square
                    miles. The aspect of the country is agreeably diversified by the distribution of
                    forests, rivers, hills, pasture, and arable land. In the southern portion of the
                    county the forests, consisting chiefly of beeches (from the Saxon name of which
                    tree, <hi rend="italic">boc,</hi> the county is said to derive its name), were
                    at one time very extensive, but have of late years been greatly thinned; woods
                    of considerable extent are still to be found in the northern parts. The
                    principal rivers of Buckinghamshire are the Thames, which separates it from
                    Berkshire and Surrey, and receives as tributaries the Colne and the Thame; and
                    the Ouse, with its tributary the Ousel, which belongs to the north of the
                    county. The only hills .in Bucks worthy of mention are the Chilterns which cross
                    it in a north-westerly direction, and rise at two or three points to the height
                    of about 900 feet. Of the roads which pass through the county the most important
                    are that which connects London with Chester and Holyhead, by which the mails
                    were forwarded to Ireland before the introduction of railways, the great western
                    road connecting the metropolis with Bath and Bristol, and the roads to Oxford
                    and Birmingham. The only canal of any importance is the Grand Junction, from
                    which branches proceed to several of the larger towns. The London and
                    North-Western Railway passes through the north-east of the county, and the Great
                    Western through a small part of its southern extremity, while minor branches
                    belonging to both these systems afford ready communication between the more
                    important places. The principal junctions are Prince’s Risborough, Aylesbury,
                    Verney, and Bletchley.</p>
                <p>The agricultural capacities of Bucks vary considerably in different parts of its
                    extent. The vale of Aylesbury, lying between hills on either side, is one of the
                    most fertile and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n463/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0463-0416"/> valuable districts in England, and is divided in
                    nearly equal proportions between pasture and tillage. Towards the north,
                    however, the soil greatly degenerates, and sometimes does little more than pay
                    the expense of cultivation. In 1875 the proprietors holding land of less and of
                    more than one acre in extent numbered 6420 and 3288 respectively,— the largest
                    owners being Lord Carington with 14,835 acres, and Earl Brownlow, with 11,785.
                    The farms are not generally large. The largest do not exceed 500 acres, while
                    there are many of not more than 20 or 30 acres. The average size in 1871 was 70
                    acres. In 1874 there were 60,182 acres under wheat, 28,902 in barley, 23,257 in
                    oats, 16,663 in beans, and 7136 in pease; 1463 were occupied by potatoes, 19,641
                    by turnips, 29,272 were in temporary grass, and 186,941 in permanent pasture.
                    About 24,500 are covered with wood, and 1637 with orchards. Neither flax nor
                    hops are grown. The quantities of cattle reared and fed in Bucks are very
                    considerable,—the total number enumerated in the year 1874 being 37,147. The
                    number of milch cows is estimated at upwards of 27,000; and the ιarge supply of
                    dairy-produce is rapidly conveyed to London by rail, where it finds a ready
                    market. Hogs are extensively reared on many farms, and are found to be a source
                    of considerable profit to the farmer. Their numbers amounted in 1874 to upwards
                    of 40,500. In many parts of the county, especially at Aylesbury, great numbers
                    of ducks are fattened for sale in the London markets.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Buckinghamshire are neither very extensive nor very
                    important. The principal are those of lace and straw plait. The proportion of
                    persons chiefly engaged in agriculture is about 13 per cent, of the population;
                    in trade and manufactures about 18 per cent.</p>
                <p>Bucks was originally divided into eighteen hundreds; it is now divided into
                    eight, viz., Newport, Buckingham, Ashendon, Cottesloe, Aylesbury, Burnham,
                    Stoke, and Desborough <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the last three forming what
                    is well known as “The Chiltern Hundreds.” That of Aylesbury still retains its
                    ancient designation of the “three hundreds of Aylesbury.” The number of parishes
                    in the entire county is computed at 202, part of those of Ibstone, Ickford,
                    Kingsey, and Lewknor extending into Oxfordshire. The market-towns are Λmershatn,
                    Aylesbury (in all respects the most important town in the county, though
                    Buckingham is the capital), Beaconsfield, Buckingham, Chesham, Great Marlowe,
                    High Wycombe, Ivinghoe, Newport-Pagnell, Olney, Prince’s B,isborough, Stony
                    Stratford, Wendover, and Winslow. There are many other interesting, though not
                    very important, places in Buckinghamshire, of which we may mention Chalfont St
                    Giles—the residence for a time of the poet Milton, where he completed <hi

                    abode of the family of that name, and in the churchyard of which the patriot
                    (who fell at Chaigrove in 1643) is buried; Medmenham, in the old abbey of which
                    a celebrated club of “Franciscans,” of which John Wilkes, Bubb Doddington, and
                    other political notorieties of last century were members, held their convivial
                    meetings; Pitstone, in the abbey of which Queen Elizabeth used frequently to
                    reside in her younger days; Beaconsfield Manor, at one time the property of the
                    poet Waller; Stoke Poges, celebrated by Gray in his <hi rend="italic">Elegy</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Long Story;</hi> Slough, for many years the residence of
                    Sir William Herschel, and the place where his great telescope was constructed
                    and still stands; Salthill (not far from Slough), where the Eton Montem, now
                    abolished, used to be held; Olney and Weston Underwood, familiar to all the
                    readers of Cowper; Butler’s Court or Gregories, the seat of Edmund Burke;
                    Bradenham, the mansion of the elder D’Israeli; and Hughenden Manor, the
                    well-known residence of his son. The principal seats in Buckinghamshire are
                    Stowe, the property of the duke of Buckingham, and celebrated for its grounds,
                    and its collections of pictures and statues; Bulstrode, once a seat of the dukes
                    of Portland, now the property of the duke of Somerset; Wotton House, belonging
                    to the duke of Buckingham, Penn House to Earl Howe, the Abbey, High Wycombe, to
                    Lord Carington, Dropmore to the Hon. George Fortescue, Aston Clinton to Sir A.
                    Rothschild, Ditton Park to the duke of Buccleuch, Hedsor to Lord Boston,
                    Cliefden to the duke of Westminster, Latimer to Lord Chesham, Peterley House to
                    Lord Dormer. The antiquities of the county are comparatively few. It is
                    traversed by the three ancient roads known as Icknield Street, Akeman Street,
                    and Watling Street; it has remains, in some cases very slight, of the baronial
                    castles of Lavendon and Whitchurch, of the abbeys of Missenden, Notley, and
                    Burnham, and of the monastery of Mursley, and a number of interesting examples
                    of early ecclesiastical architecture, the most important being the churches of
                    Chetwode, Stewkley, and Willesdon.</p>
                <p>Bucks is in the Norfolk circuit. The quarter-sessions are held at Aylesbury; the
                    assizes used to be held alternately at that town and Buckingham, but are now
                    held only at Aylesbury. The Reform Bill of 1832 reduced the number of members
                    returned by Bucks to the House of Commons from fourteen to eleven. It now
                    returns eight, three of whom represent the county and five the parliamentary
                    boroughs. In 1871 the number of the county electors registered was 7610. The
                    result of the county elections is declared at Aylesbury. Bucks is governed by a
                    lord-lieutenant and custos, 60 deputy-lieutenants, a high sheriff, and about 200
                    magistrates. It lies in the ecclesiastical province of Canterbury, and for the
                    most part in the diocese of Oxford, and in arch-deaconry of Buckingham, which
                    comprises the deaneries of Amersham, Aylesbury, Bletchley, Buckingham, Burnham,
                    Claydon, Ivinghoe, Mursley, Newport, Waddesdon, Wendover, and Wycombe, in all
                    about 180 benefices. The total income of endowed charities in the county was
                    ascertained in 1863-4 to be £16,308, of which £3305 go to education and £3034
                    for maintenance of alms-houses. There were 11,315 paupers in 1871, of w hom 441
                    were lunatics or idiots, and the previous year the poor rates amounted to
                    £94,577.</p>
                <p>The population in 1851 was 163,554, of whom 80,990 were males and 82,564 females.
                    In 1871 it had increased to 175,879, the males being 86,059 and the females
                    89,820. The increase since 1801 was 63 per cent. The parliamentary boroughs (the
                    first of which returns two members and the others one each) are Aylesbury, with
                    28,760 inhabitants; Buckingham, 7545; Chipping Wycombe, 10,492; Great Marlowe,
                    part of which is in Berkshire, 6627. The towns of more than 2000 inhabitants,
                    not corporate towns, nor included in any parliamentary borough, are Amersham,
                    with a population of 2726; Chesham, with 6488; Newport-Pagnell, with 3824. The
                    number of inhabited houses in the county in 1871 was 37,257; uninhabited, 1667;

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Buckingham,</hi> the chief town of Buckinghamshire, a
                    parliamentary and municipal borough and market-town in the hundred of the same
                    name, 58 miles by a branch of the North-Western Railway from London, is situated
                    on the left bank of the River Ouse, which surrounds it on every side but the
                    north and is crossed by three bridges. The town consists principally of one long
                    street, straggling over a considerable extent of surface. The houses, which are
                    chiefly of brick, are neat and clean, though somewhat humble in character. The
                    only public buildings of importance are the town-hall, a brick structure dating
                    from the end of the 18th century, and the church, dedicated to St Peter and St

                    feet high, and has been restored and extended under the direction of Sir G. G.
                    Scott, who was born in the neighbourhood. There are also a jail, a union
                    workhouse, and several dissenting churches. An endowed free school for boys, who
                    were clad in green coats by the will of the founder, Gabriel Newton, is now
                    incorporated with the national school, which is intended to accommodate 300
                    pupils. The grammar-school of the town was founded by Edward VI., and occupies
                    the chapel of the guild of the Holy Trinity, founded by Archdeacon Stratton in
                    1268. The manufactures, which include bone-grinding, malt-making, and tanning,
                    are of comparatively small importance. Lace-making with bobbins still occupies a
                    small part of the female population. There are also some corn-mills in the
                    neighbourhood, and a few lime quarries. The borough of Buckingham formerly
                    returned two members to Parliament, but since 1868 it has only returned one. It
                    is governed by a mayor, four aidermen, and twelve councillors. Population of

                    town of great antiquity. It was fortified with earthen ramparts by Edward the
                    Elder in 918, and in 1010 it was captured by the Danes. It is mentioned as an
                    ancient borough in <hi rend="italic">Domesday Book,</hi> but does not seem to
                    have returned members to Parliament till the reign of Henry VIII. In the reign
                    of Edward III it was a woolstaple, but not long after its prosperity began to
                    decline. From Queen Mary it received a charter in 1554. It was the headquarters
                    of Charles I. for a few days during his war with the Parliament. In 1725 a third
                    part of the town was burnt to the ground.</p>
