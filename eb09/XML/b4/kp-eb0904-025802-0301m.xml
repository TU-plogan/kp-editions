                <p><label type="entry">BRESCIA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Bresciano</hi></label>, a
                    province of Italy, in Lombardy, bounded on the N.W. by Bergamo, N.E. by Tyrol,
                    E. by Verona, from which it is separated by the Lago di Garda, S.E. by Mantua,
                    and S.W. by Cremona. Its area is rather more than 1643 square miles. The
                    northern part, or about one-third, is occupied by a chain of mountains which
                    belong to the Rhaetian Alps; the remainder forms part of the great plain of
                    Lombardy, and shares in its general fertility. The principal rivers, all
                    tributaries or sub-tributaries of the Po, are the Oglio, the Melia, and the
                    Chiese. Corn, flax, hemp, the olive, and the vine are extensively cultivated,
                    and in some districts the traveller passes for miles through the midst of
                    orchards. The mountainous parts, and especially the valley of Trompia, yield
                    iron, copper, marble, alabaster, and granite. The manufactures consist
                    principally of silk, woollen, linen, and cotton goods, iron, steel, and copper
                    wares, glass, and paper. Among the principal townships are Rovato, Chiari,
                    Orzinuovi, Monte-Chiaro, Salo, and Ponte-vico. Population in 1871, 456,023.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brescia,</hi> the capital of the above province, is situated
                    between the Melia and the Garza, about 155 miles by rail from Turin, in 45° 32'
                    N. lat. and 10° 14' E. long. It lies at the foot of a spur of the Alps, on the
                    summit of which is a fine old castle formerly known as the Falcon of Lombardy.
                    The town is well built, has fine arcaded streets, aud compares favourably in
                    point of cleanliness with other cities in the North of Italy; but it has hardly
                    so many buildings of first-class importance. The old cathedral, a remarkable
                    specimen of the circular form, is sadly disfigured and neglected, and the new
                    cathedral by its side (1604-1825), though built of white marble, is of little
                    architectural merit, St Afra and San Francesco being more worthy of notice. The
                    Broletto, or old palace of the republic, dating originally from the 12th or 13th
                    century, is a large and interesting building; but it has suffered greatly by
                    successive alterations. The episcopal palace contains an extensive public
                    library, consisting principally of the books and manuscripts—many of great
                    antiquity and value—bequeathed to the city by Cardinal Quirini in 1750. There is
                    an exceptionally rich collection of both mediaeval and classical antiquities,
                    preserved in a beautiful Roman building, usually known as the Temple of
                    Hercules, built by Vespasian and excavated in 1822; and throughout the numerous
                    churches and mansions of the city are to be found many of the masterpieces of
                    Italian art. Among the other buildings are the Loggia or communal palace erected
                    in 1508, a theatre, a hospital, a lyceum, and various public fountains. The
                    botanical gardens are worthy of notice. Brescia is a busy town. Its arms and
                    cutlery have been famous for centuries; whole streets are occupied by
                    coppersmiths; silk, woollen, and linen goods, paper, leather, and oil are
                    manufactured; and an extensive transit-trade is carried on. The population in
                    1871 was 38,906.</p>
                <p>Brescia, the ancient <hi rend="italic">Brixia,</hi> is supposed to have been
                    founded hy the Etruscans. It was afterwards a town of the Cenomani, and,
                    finally, a Roman free town. After the fall of the empire it was several times
                    pillaged by the barbarians, especially by Attila in 452. From the Lombards,
                    under whom it was the capital of a duchy, it passed to the Franks. It was made a
                    free imperial city by Otho the Great, and shared and suffered in the contests
                    between the Guelfs and Ghibellines. It then fell into the power of the Signiors
                    of Verona, and in 1378 into the hands of the Milanese. It was taken in 1426 by
                    Carmagnola the Venetian general; besieged by the Milanese general Picinino in
                    1483, but assigned to the Venetians by Pope Martin V.; surrendered by the
                    inhabitants to the French after the battle of Agnano (1509); taken in 1512 by
                    the Venetian general, Andrea Gritti; delivered by Gaston de Foix; and besieged
                    again in 1573, 1575, and 1576. It remained under the Venetian dominion till the
                    dissolution of the republic. It was the capital of the department of Melia
                    during the existence of the Cisalpine republic and the Napoleonic kingdom of
                    Italy, and fell in 1814 under the yoke of Austria. In the revolution of 1849 the
                    inhabitants rose in arms, but were overpowered, after a destructive siege, by
                    the troops of Haynau. In the war of 1859 it again sided with the patriotic
                    party, and followed the destinies of the rest of Lombardy. Brescia has at
                    various times suffered severely from pestilence and epidemics. It was the
                    birthplace of Tartaglia the mathematician and the writer Mazzuchelli.</p>
