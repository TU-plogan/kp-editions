                    early companionship with nature greatly influenced his mind and awoke the latent
                    poetry of his genius. Delicate from birth he grew up contemplative, devotional,
                    and humorous, the pet of his family and his friends. His parents gave him an
                    education superior to their position; at fifteen, when his school education was
                    completed, his father was enabled to send Michael to Edinburgh University, which
                    he attended during the four winter sessions 1762-5. In 1765 he got employment as
                    a teacher during the summer months at Gairney Bridge, receiving about £11 a year
                    in fees. He became a divinity student of a dissenting Scotttish sect known as
                    the Burghers, and in the first summer of his divinity course accepted the charge
                    of a new school at Forrest Mill, where “he lead a melancholy kind of life.”
                    Poverty, disease, and want of companions depressed his spirits, but in that
                    solitariness he wrote “Lochleven,” a poem inspired by the memories of his
                    childhood. In consequence of advanced consumption he had to give up the school,
                    and returned to his father’s house, where he wrote his last and finest poem,
                    “Elegy written in Spring,” and died on 5th July 1767. aged twenty-one years and
                    three months. As a poet his reputation has been increased, first, through
                    sympathy for his early death, and secondly, from the alleged theft by Logan of
                    several of his poems. The Rev. John Logan, minister of Leith, a fellow-student
                    of Bruce, edited in 1770 the <hi rend="italic">Poems on several occasions, ^by
                    Michael Bruce,</hi> in which the “Ode to the Cuckoo” appeared. In the preface he
                    stated, “To make up a miscellany, some poems written by different authors are
                    inserted.” In a collection of his own poems in 1781, Logan printed the “Ode to
                    the Cuckoo” as his own; of this the friends of Bruce were aware, but did not
                    challenge it. Dr M*Kelvie, in his <hi rend="italic">Life and Works of Bruce</hi>
                    (1837), was the first to claim for him the authorship of the Ode, and of other
                    verses of which Logan had hitherto been the reputed author. This claim rests on
                    the oral tradition of his birthplace and the evidence of a few of his friends;
                    it was made nearly fifty years after Logan’s death, and no explanation can be
                    given of this great lapse of time. Of direct testimony there is none, and
                    irrelevant matter is brought in affecting Logan’s character, while Logan’s
                    authorship rests on such ground as publication under his own name, and his
                    reputation as author during his lifetime. By reiteration of Bruce’s claims in
                    many forms popular opinion has been gained for him, though Isaac D’Israeli,
                    Thomas Campbell, Robert Chambers, and David Laing have strenuously supported
                    Logan. The dispute cannot now, perhaps, be satisfactorily settled, owing to tho
                    conflict of evidence and lapse of time; but on the whole it may be doubted
                    whether M ’ Kelvie has proved ⅛s case. All Bruce’s poems breathe the thoughts of
                    a shepherd lad, as Bloomfield’s retained the fresh observations of a farmer’s
                    boy. With two exceptions they are immature and lack strength]; his imagery is in
                    great measure borrowed; his rhymes evince a paucity of poetical skill. His early
                    attempts are weak imitations of Milton, Thomson, and Young, his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n441/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0441-0394"/> favourite poets. His “Lochleven” and “Elegy
                    written in Spring” are alone worthy of preservation, and both were composed in
                    his last year. The former abounds in happy word-painting and moral reflections.
                    The tale of Levina, which forms about the half of the poem, and is by far the
                    prettiest flower in the bouquet, bears distinct marks of the same hand that
                    wrote “Runnimede.” The “Elegy” is most affecting, when read in the knowledge of
                    the circumstance of its having been written by a dying youth of twenty-one
                    :—</p>
                <p>“Led by pale ghosts I enter death’s dark gate, And bid the realms of light and
                    life adieu.”</p>
                <p>It is a death song, remarkable for exquisite beauty and chaste simplicity. Bruce
                    is not to be compared with another young Scottish poet, Robert Nicoll. His life
                    wanted the fulness and strength, his poems the wide and vivid sympathies of his
                    later compeer.</p>
