                    writers, as Homer, Sophocles, and Euripides. Perhaps the earliest notice is the
                    figurative “besom of destruction” (Isa. xiv. 23). Brushes are of two kinds,
                    simple and compound. The former consist of but one tuft, as hair pencils and
                    painters’ tools. The latter have more than one tuft. Brushes with the tufts
                    placed side by side on flat boards, as plasterers’ brushes, are called
                    stockbrushes. The single tuft brushes, or pencils for artists, are made of the
                    hair of the camel, badger, goat, and other animals for the smaller kind, and
                    pig’s bristles for the larger. The hairs for pencils are carefully arranged so
                    as to form a point in the centre, and, when tied together, are passed into the
                    wide end of the quill or metal tube and drawn out at the other end to the extent
                    required. The small ends of the quills having been previously moistened, in
                    drying contract and bind the hair. A similar effect is produced with metal tubes
                    by compression. Compound brushes are—first, set or pan-work; second, drawn-work.
                    Of the former, an example is the common house-broom, into the stock of which
                    holes are drilled of the size wanted. The necessary quantity of bristles, hair,
                    or fibre, to fill each hole is collected together, struck on the working bench
                    at the thick ends, dipped into molten cement chiefly composed of pitch, bound
                    round with thread, dipped again, and then set into a hole of the stock with a
                    peculiar twisting motion only to be acquired by practice. In drawn-brushes, of
                    which those for shoes, teeth, nails, and clothes are examples, the holes are
                    more neatly bored, and have smaller ones at the top communicating with the back
                    of the brush, through which a bight or loop of wire passes from the back of the
                    stock. Half the number of hairs or fibres needed for the tufts to fill the holes
                    are passed into the bight of the wire, which is then pulled smartly so as to
                    double the hairs and force them into the loop-hole, as far as possible. With all
                    brushes, when the holes have been properly filled, the ends of the fibres
                    outside are cut with shears, either to an even length or such form as may be
                    desired. The backs are then covered with veneer or other material to conceal the
                    wire and other crudities of the work. A process called trepanning is adopted
                    with some small brushes. The drawholes come out at some inconspicuous part of
                    the stock, and the hairs or fibres having been properly secured, the holes are
                    plugged up in order to conceal them as much as possible.</p>
                <p>The bristles used in this manufacture are imported chiefly from Russia and
                    Poland, and are sorted into black, grey, yellow, white, and lilies. They vary in
                    length, and are separated by the workman striking a quantity held in the hand
                    smartly on a bench, the thick ends downwards. He then applies them to a gauge to
                    ascertain the lengths of those that project, and, seizing them between his
                    finger and thumb, draws them out of the bundle and places them with those of
                    corresponding dimensions. They are sorted according to thickness by a process
                    called “dragging, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n451/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0451-0404"/> which consists in passing them through a kind of
                    comb, which retains those that are too stout to go between the teeth. By
                    repeating this with finer combs the bristles can be assorted to any number of
                    sizes required. Various other substances are now used in place of bristles, and
                    this was greatly stimulated by the scarcity of these during the Russian war. In
                    1808 whalebone fibres were patented in England for the purpose, and in 1810
                    twigs of broom, mallow, rushes, and other shrubs and plants. In 1842 the shafts
                    of quills prepared and split up, and in 1872 horn and similar substances were
                    used in the same way. The latter are softened by steeping them in an infusion of
                    sage leaves or plants of that class, then flattened, rolled out, and extended
                    and moulded so as to disintegrate them into threads. In 1844 a brush was
                    patented made of stiff fibre and bristles, hard in one part and soft in another,
                    so that the softer parts should follow the harder, and take up what the latter
                    left. The same inventor also made tooth-brushes on the same principle. The hairs
                    of the squirrel, horse, badger, bear, and other animals aro also used for
                    brushes, and those from the ears of cows and from the ichneumon, amongst othera,
                    for artists’ pencils. When necessary the bristles are bleached by sulphur or
                    other chemical agents. In the United States a kind of sorghum or broom-corn is
                    extensively cultivated for the manufacture of brooms, and especially by the
                    Shakers of New York State. The seed of the crop alone, it is stated, often pays
                    the expense of cultivation, being, when mixed with other corn, good food for
                    cattle aud horses.</p>
                <p>One of the most important purposes to which brushes have been applied is that of
                    sweeping chimneys. So far back as 1789 John Elin patented an arrangement of
                    brushes with this purpose in view. He was followed at intervals by others, and
                    the use of these machines having been found practicable, the Acts 3 and 4 Vict.
                    c. 85, and 27 and 28 Vict. c. 37, put an end to the cruelties previously
                    practised, prohibiting the employment of children in sweeping chimneys.</p>
                <p>Revolving brushes for cleaning rooms were patented in 1811, and 0ther3 have
                    followed. In 1825 they were constructed to take the place of teazles for raising
                    the wool or pile of woollen and other cloths, and they are now used for
                    polishing and other purposes in various manufactures. The first patent in which
                    they were applied to hair-dressing appears in 1862. The patented invention for
                    sweeping and cleaning roads by means of revolving brushes and other contrivances
                    are very numerous. The first appears in 1699. It is that of Edmund Henning for
                    <hi rend="italic">“a</hi> new engine for sweeping the streets of London, or auy
                    city or town.” No specification was enrolled, but the invention included the
                    loading and removal of the refuse “with great ease and quickness.” A long
                    iuterval elapsed before anything further was done in this direction, the next
                    patent being that of W. Ranyard, on 1st November 1825, which consisted of a
                    number of brushes mounted upon two rims or placed upon an axis, which was raised
                    on a vehicle or barrow. Boase and Smith’s followed in 1828, including scraping,
                    sweeping, and watering. From 1836 a succession of inventors follow each other
                    rapidly, amongst whom frequently appears “Joseph Whitworth.” Some of the most
                    recent patents are Greenwood’s, 17th February 1873; Robinson’s, 4th April 1874;
                    Sinclair and Clayton’s, 20th February 1875; Kitson’s, 21st April 1875. Many of
                    these inventione include the removal of the refuse, as well as scraping. Some
                    propose watering in addition; but the simplest and most easily managed is that
                    most commonly used, which scrapes or sweeps the mud and rubbish to the sides of
                    the road. A particular point in Mr Kitson’s invention seems to be to clear out
                    the dust and mud from between the joints of the paving stones.</p>
                <p>An improvement in brushmaking was patented in 1830 by Timothy Mason, which
                    consisted in cutting grooves in the stocks or bases of brushes instead of boring
                    holes, the grooves increasing in width from the outer surface. The hairs or
                    bristles are tied up into tufts or knots, dipped in cement, placed in the
                    grooves, and wedged tightly by the use of a blunt tool, which operation causes
                    the tufts to expand and hold firmly in the enlarged recess. Various contrivances
                    have been patented by which brushes might be self-supplied with water, soap,
                    paste, paint, and the like, whefi in use, by means of receptacles or pipes being
                    attached to them for the purpose.</p>
                <p>One of the greatest advances in the brushmaking of the present day is the
                    Woodbury machine, an American invention for bunching, wiring, and inserting
                    bristles in the stock. In this machine a metal comb of uniform thickness is
                    filled with bristles, holding them by the middle, so that one-half of the
                    bristles appear above the surface of the comb, the other underneath. The comb
                    thus charged moves in guideways, and discharges the bristles from each division
                    successively into a channel in which, by an ingenious contrivance, they are
                    brought gradually into a horizontal position and a proper quantity taken up to
                    form a tuft, which is moved along an incline. At the bottom of this is a hollow
                    cylinder that does not enter, but is placed firmly against the tuft hole in the
                    brush stock. A plunger now acts upon the bristles. The end of the plunger is
                    slotted crossways; one slot receives the bristles, the other a piece of wire.
                    The plunger is made to descend and double the bristles into a loop at the
                    middle. Other mechanism unwinds the binding wire from a reel, straightens the
                    wire, aud passes the proper quantity through the enlarged upper portion of the
                    slot, and at the same time cuts off the length required. The plunger now
                    descends further, receiving a rotatory motion on its vertical axis, winds the
                    wire by forcing it into the thread of a nut at the lower portion of the
                    cylinder, and fastens it round the double end of the bunch. The end of the wire
                    now acts as a tap, cutting a female screw in the end of the block, whilst the
                    upper end of the wire thread, by expanding, acts as a pawl, and prevents the
                    unscrewing of the tuft. This machine is described in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scientific American,</hi> 1872, p. 31, with illustrations.</p>
