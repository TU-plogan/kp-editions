                    the year 1221. He was at an early age destined by his mother for the church, and
                    is said to have received his cognomen of Bonaventura from St Francis of Assisi,
                    who performed on him a miraculous cure. He entered the Franciscan order in his
                    twenty-second year, and is said to have studied at Paris under Alexander of
                    Hales. This does not seem very probable, but he certainly studied under
                    Alexander’s successor, John of Rochelle, to whose chair he succeeded in 1253.
                    Three years before that period his fame had gained for him permission to read
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">Sentences,</hi> and in 1255 he received the degree of
                    doctor. So high was his reputation both for brilliancy of intellect and purity
                    of mind that, in the following year, he was elected general of his order. He at
                    once set himself to work to introduce better discipline, and by his mild
                    regulations succeeded in effecting much good. He was an advocate of asceticism,
                    and looked upon the monastic life as the surest means of grace. It is worthy of
                    notice tlιat by his orders Roger Bacon was interdicted from lecturing at Oxford,
                    and compelled to put himself under the surveillance of the order at Paris.
                    Bonaventura was instrumental in procuring the election of Gregory X., who
                    rewarded him with the titles of cardinal and bishop of Albano, and insisted on
                    his presence at the great Council of Lyons in the year 1274. At this meeting he
                    died. Bonaventura’s character seems not unworthy of the eulogistic title,
                    “Doctor Seraphicus,” bestowed on him by his contemporaries, nor of the place
                    assigned to him by Dante in his <hi rend="italic">Paradiso.</hi> He was formally
                    canonized in 1482 by Sixtus IV.</p>
                <p>His works, as arranged in the Lyons editon (7 vole., folio), consist of
                    expositions and sermons, filling the first three volumes; of a commentary on the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sentences</hi> of Lombardus, in two volumes, celebrated among
                    mediaeval theologians as incomparably the best exposition of the third part; and
                    of minor treatises filling the remaining two volumes, and including a life of St
                    Francis. The smaller works are the most important, and of them the best are the
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Itinerarium</hi><hi rend="italic">Mentis ad Deum,
                    Βreviloquium, De</hi><hi rend="italic">Reductione Artium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologiam, Soliloquium,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De
                    septem itineribus</hi><hi rend="italic">oeternitatis,</hi> in which most of what
                    is individual in his teaching is contained. In philosophy Bonaventura presents a
                    marked contrast to his great contemporaries, Thomas Aquinas and Roger Bacon.
                    While these may be taken as representing respectively physical science yet in
                    its infancy, and Aristotelian scholasticism in its most perfect form, he brings
                    before us the mystical and Flatonizing mode of speculation which had already to
                    some extent found expression in Hugo and Richard of St Victor, and in Bernard of
                    Clairvaux. To him the purely intellectual element, though never absent, is of
                    inferior interest when compared with the living power of the affections or the
                    heart. He rejects the authority of Aristotle, to whose influence he ascribes
                    much of the heretical tendency of the age, and some of whose cardinal
                    doctrines—such as the eternity of the world—he combats vigorously. But the
                    Platonism he received was Plato as understood by St Augustine, and as lie had
                    been handed down by the Alexandrian school and the authors of the mystical works
                    passing under the name of Dionysius the Areopagite. Bonaventura accepts as
                    Platonic the theory that ideas do not exist <hi rend="italic">in rerum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">natura,</hi> but as thoughts of the divine mind, according to
                    which actual things were formed; and this conception has no slight influence
                    upon his philosophy. Like all the great scholastic doctors he starts with the
                    discussion of the relations between reason and faith. All the sciences are but
                    the handmaids of theology; reason can discover some of the moral truths which
                    form the groundwork of the Christian system, but others it can only receive and
                    apprehend through divine illumination. In order to obtain this illumination the
                    soul must employ the proper means, which are prayer, the exercise of the
                    virtues, whereby it is rendered fit to accept the divine light, and meditation
                    which may rise even to ecstatic union with God. The supreme end of life is such
                    union, union in contemplation or intellect <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n40/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0040-0031"/> and in intense absorbing love; but it cannot be
                    entirely reached in this life, and remains as a hope for futurity. The mind in
                    contemplating Qod has three distinct aspects, stages, or grades,—the senses,
                    giving empirical knowledge of what is without and discerning the traces <hi
                    rend="italic">{vestigia)</hi> of the divine in the world; the reason, which
                    examines the soul itself, the image of the divine Being; and lastly, pure
                    intellect <hi rend="italic">{intelligβntia)</hi> which, in a transcendent act,
                    grasps the Being of the divine cause. To these three correspond the three kinds
                    of theology,— <hi rend="italic">theologia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >symbolica,</hi><hi rend="italic">theologia</hi><hi rend="italic">propria,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">theologia mystica.</hi> Each stage is subdivided, for in
                    contemplating the outer world we may use the senses or the imagination; <hi
                    rend="italic">we</hi> may rise to a knowledge of God <hi rend="italic">per
                    vestigia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">in vestigiis.</hi> In the first case the
                    three great properties of physical bodies—weight, number, measure,— in the
                    second the division of created things into the classes of those that have merely
                    physical existence, those that have life, and those that have thought,
                    irresistibly lead us to conclude the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Triune
                    God. So in the second stage, we may ascend to the knowledge of God, <hi
                    rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">imaginem,</hi> by reason, or <hi
                    rend="italic">in imagine,</hi> by the pure understanding <hi rend="italic"
                    >{intellectus)</hi>; in the one case the triple division—memory, understanding,
                    and will,—in the other the Christian virtues—faith, hope, and charity— leading
                    again to the conception of a Trinity of divine qualities—eternity, truth, and
                    goodness. In the last stage we have first <hi rend="italic">intelligentia,</hi>
                    pure intellect, contemplating the essential being of God, and finding itself
                    compelled by necessity of thought to hold absolute being as the first notion,
                    for non-being cannot be conceived apart from being, of which it is but the
                    privation. To this notion of absolute being, which is perfect and the greatest
                    of all, objective existence must be ascribed. In its last and highest form of
                    activity the mind rests in the contemplation of the infinite goodness of God,
                    which is apprehended by means of the highest faculty, the <hi rend="italic">apex
                    mentis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">synderesis.</hi> Thiβ spark of the divine
                    illumination is common to all forms of mysticism, but Bonaventura adds to it
                    peculiarly Christian elements. The complete yielding up of mind and heart to God
                    is unattainable without divine grace, and nothing renders us so fit to receive
                    this gift as the meditative and ascetic life of the cloister. The monastic life
                    is the best means of grace.</p>
                <p>Bonaventura, however, is not merely a meditative thinker, whose works may form
                    good manuals of devotion; he is a dogmatic theologian of high rank, and on all
                    the disputed questions of scholastic thought, such as universals, matter, the
                    principle of individualism, or the <hi rend="italic">intellectus agens,</hi> he
                    gives weighty and well-reasoned decisions. He agrees with Albert in regarding
                    theology as a practical science; its truths, according to his view, are
                    peculiarly adapted to influence the affections. He discusses very carefully the
                    nature and meaning of the divine attributes; considers universals to be the
                    ideal forms pre-existing in the divine mind according to which things were
                    shaped; holds matter to be pure potentiality which receives individual being and
                    determinateness from the formative power of God, acting according to the ideas;
                    and finally maintains that the <hi rend="italic">intellectus agens</hi> has no
                    separate existence. On these and on many other points of scholastic philosophy
                    the Seraphic Doctor exhibits a combination of subtilty and moderation which
                    makes his works peculiarly valuable.</p>
                <p>Editions of Bonaventura’s works are numerous. The most complete early edition was
                    that in 7 vols, fo., Rome, 1588-96. They nave also been published at Lyons, 7
                    vols., 1668, and at Venice, 14 vois., 1751, <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi> The best
                    edition is that by A. C. Peltier, begun in 1863. Of detached works the editions
                    and translations are very numerous. The following are perhaps the most important
