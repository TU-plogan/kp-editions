                    that yielded by cow’s milk is the most savoury, and it alone really constitutes
                    the butter of commerce. The milk of the various breeds of cattle varies widely

                    in the case of the celebrated Alderney cattle it amounts to as much as from

                <p>On a low average each pint of milk ought to yield a full half-ounce of butter.
                    The fat or butter is disseminated through freshly-drawn milk in minute, clear
                    globules, each of which is enclosed in a thin membranous sac or bag; and being
                    specifically lighter than the mass of the fluid, the globules gradually rise to
                    the surface, bringing mixed with them a proportion of milky matter, and form
                    cream. Usually the cream is skimmed off the surface of the milk for making
                    butter, but by some the churning is performed on the milk itself without waiting
                    for the separation of the cream. The operation of churning causes the rupture of
                    the oil sacs, and by the coalescence of the fat so liberated butter is formed.
                    Details regarding churning and the preparation of butter generally will be found
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Dairy.</hi></p>
                <p>Fresh or unsalted butter of good quality should present a rich straw-yellow
                    colour. At ordinary temperatures it has a firm uniform consistency, while it is
                    soft enough to cut and spread easily under the knife without breaking or
                    crumbling. It should possess a faint sweet odour, and a bland, soft, delicate
                    flavour, melting in the mouth without any indication of grittiness. Pure butter
                    is a complex chemical compound, consisting in large part of fats or glycerides
                    of the non-volatile acids, palmitic acid, and butyroleic acid, with occasionally
                    stearic acid. With these there occur small proportions of glycerides of the
                    volatile acids, butyric, capronic, caprylic, and caprinic acid, to which the
                    butter owes its distinguishing flavour and characteristics, as it has the
                    non-volatile acids in common with other fats, though in different proportions.
                    Butter when unadulterated and prepared with ordinary care should contain at
                    least 85 per cent, of pure fat, the remainder consisting of casein, water, and
                    salt. The casein is derived from milk, which is never perfectly washed out, but
                    in butter of good quality this ought not to amount to more than from 3 to 5 per
                    cent. Water may be present to the extent of from 5 to 10 per cent, without the
                    butter being subject to a charge of adulteration; and a small proportion of salt
                    is commonly worked into the butter in its preparation, but in what is sold as
                    fresh or sweet this should only be from ⅜ to 2 per cent, of the whole
                    weight.</p>
                <p>When butter is exposed to the air for some time, especially in warm weather, or
                    in hot, confined situations, it quickly becomes rancid, acquiring thereby a
                    distinct disagreeable odour and a biting taste, owing to the development of a
                    volatile fatty acid under the influence of a species of fermentation, which is
                    doubtless caused by the nitrogenous substance, casein, it contains. The more
                    completely, therefore, all milky and curdy matter is washed out of butter the
                    less will be the tendency to set up and develop fermentation. The preservation
                    or curing of butter depends for its efficacy on the employment of some agency by
                    which fermentative action may be prevented; but there are also several ways by
                    which its development may be retarded and the material kept sweet for a
                    considerable period. Rancidity may be corrected to some extent by melting the
                    affected butter and pouring it into ice-cold water. As a means also of retarding
                    rancidity, butter is in some parts of France and the East melted up and heated
                    till the water it may contain is evaporated, when the casein which rises as a
                    scum to the surface is carefully skimmed off; but butter cannot be so melted
                    without injuriously affecting its delicate flavour. By keeping fresh butter in a
                    very cool place covered with pure water renewed daily, it will remain sweet for
                    a considerable time. A still better method, recommended by Μ. Payen <hi
                        rend="italic">(Substances Alimentaires)</hi> is to use water acidulated with
                    either tartaric acid or vinegar. It is also said that sugar in the form of a
                    syrup poured over the butter is an excellent medium for retarding rancid
                    fermentation. Butter, however, which is to be kept for a considerable length of
                    time is “cured,” or preserved by incorporating with it some substance or
                    substances which act upon the nitrogenous material it contains, and thus prevent
                    fermentation; and for this purpose common salt is the agent chiefly relied on.
                    The salt used should be pure, dry, and finely powdered. About 5 per cent, of
                    salt is sufficient for the purpose of curing; and when the quantity exceeds 8
                    per cent, it ought to be regarded as an adulteration. Butter very lightly salted
                    for keeping only a short time is said to be powdered. A mixture much used for
                    curing butter in Continental dairies is thus prepared :— One part each of sugar
                    and nitre are mixed up with two parts of common salt and reduced to a very fine
                    powder. This mixture is thoroughly kneaded into the butter in the proportion of
                    about 1 oz. to every lb. After standing over for a fortnight butter so prepared
                    will be ready for use and have a soft, agreeable taste, which it will retain a
                    long time. In the preservation of all butter, the exclusion of air, as much as
                    possible, is of the utmost consequence. Jt is, therefore, packed for sale in
                    oaken kegs or glazed earthenware jars, filled quite full, and covered with a
                    clean linen cloth on which salt is sprinkled. When in use the kegs should also
                    be closely covered over, and the surface of the butter kept under brine. </p>
                <p>Butter of good quality is a most digestible form of fat, while its flavour is so
                    delicate and little pronounced that it is always acceptable to the palate. It is
                    used most extensively by all classes, not only in the direct form with bread at
                    nearly every meal, but also as entering very largely into the preparation of
                    pastry, puddings, sauces, fancy cakes, and biscuits. Taking into account the
                    daily consumption of this article, it is evident that the amount used in a year
                    by a population such as that of Great Britain must be very great, an inference
                    borne out by the fact that in 1875 the imports were 1,619,808 cwts., valued at
                    £9,050,025, and, though no means exist of accurately estimating the home
                    produce, it may safely be regarded as equal to the whole imports. The countries
                    whence butter is imported into Great Britain are chiefly Germany, Holland,
                    Denmark, and especially France. A large proportion of the French butter comes
                    from the department of Calvados—Isigny being the centre of the best
                    butter-making district. The value of the total produce of France in 1867 was
                    estimated at 250 millions of francs.</p>
                <p>Butter is a substance which affords great scope for adulteration, and its
                    composition makes accurate detection of certain foreign matters a matter of
                    considerable labour and difficulty. Other animal fats, such as lard, beef and
                    mutton dripping, and tallow, with certain vegetable fats, are the chief
                    adulterants. Such adulterations may be suspected by their characteristic smell,
                    and detected by their different melting points, by microscopical examination,
                    and by their ethereal solutions. Messrs Angell and Hehner have proposed a
                    convenient method of estimating the fusing points of fat by placing a given
                    weight of definite size on the fat, and observing the temperature at which it
                    sinks Into the substance. They find that the sinking-point for genuine butter
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n653/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0653-0592"/> is remarkably constant, and that it is
                    affected in proportion to the amount and sinking point of any adulterant fats
                    used. Their analysis of butter depends upon the much smaller proportion of
                    non-volatile, insoluble fatty acids it contains, as compared with fats used as
                    adulterants.</p>
                <p>Under the name of butterine an artificial substitute for butter has been
                    introduced in America, and imported into England from New York. It is the same
                    as the artificial butter or “margarine-mouries,” which has been for some years
                    manufactured in Paris according to a method made public by the eminent chemist
                    Μ. Mège-Mouries. Having surmised that the formation of butter contained in milk
                    was due to the absorption of fat contained in the animal tissues, Μ. Mouries was
                    led to experiment on the splitting up of animal fat. The process he ultimately
                    adopted consisted in heating finely-minced beef suet with water, carbonate of
                    potash, and fresh sheep’s stomachs cut up into small fragments. The mixture he
                    raised to a temperature of 45° 0. (113° Fahr.) The influence of the pepsine of
                    the sheep’s stomach with the heat separated the fat from the cellular tissue; he
                    removed the fatty matter, and submitted it when cool to powerful hydraulic
                    pressure, separating it into stearin and oleomargarin, which last alone he used
                    for butter-making. Of this fat about the proportions of 10 lb with 4 pints of
                    milk and 3 pints of water were placed in a churn, to which a small quantity of
                    arnotto was added for colouring, and the whole churned together. The compound so
                    obtained when well washed was in general appearance, taste, and consistency like
                    ordinary butter, and when well freed from water it was found to keep a longer
                    time. According to French official reports artificial butter goes much further
                    as food than the genuine article, and forms a perfectly wholesome dietetic
                    material. The Parisian <hi rend="italic">octroi</hi> officials have recognized
                    the efficiency of the substitute by imposing on it the same duties which are
                    chargeable on ordinary butter. The company established for the manufacture in
                    France had in 1874 seven manufactories, in which four hundred men were employed.
                    There can be no doubt that a pure, sweet fat, such as is manufactured by the
                    process of Μ. Mège-Mouries is a safer and more wholesome article than the
                    unsavoury rancid butter which is sold so freely among the poorer classes. See
