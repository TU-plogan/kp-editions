                <p><label type="entry">BREWING</label></p>
                <p>BREWING is the art of preparing an exhilarating or intoxicating beverage by means
                    of a process of fermentation. In the modern acceptation of the word, brewing is
                    the operation of preparing beer and ales from any farinaceous grain (chiefly
                    from barley), which is first malted and ground, and its fermentable substance
                    extracted by warm water. This infusion is evaporated by boiling, hops having
                    been added to preserve it. The liquor is then fermented.</p>
                <p>The art was known and practised by the Egyptians many hundred years before the
                    Christian era, and afterwards by the Greeks, Romans, and ancient Gauls, from
                    whom it has been handed down to us. All countries, whether civilized or savage,
                    have, in every age, prepared an intoxicating drink of some kind. In the second
                    book of Herodotus, written about 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> we are told
                    that the Egyptians, being without vines, made wine from corn; but as the grape
                    is mentioned so frequently in Scripture and elsewhere as being most abundant
                    there, and no record exists as to the vine having been destroyed, we must
                    conclude that the historian was only partially acquainted with the productions
                    of that most fertile country. Pliny <hi rend="italic">(Natural History,</hi>
                    xxii. 82) informs us that the Egyptians made wine from corn, and gives it the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">zythτιm,</hi> which in the Greek would mean drink from
                    barley; and Hellanicus, telling of the introduction of wine at Plinthium, a city
                    of Egypt, states: “Hence the Egyptians are thought to derive their love and use
                    of this liquor, which they thought so necessary for human bodies, that they
                    invented a wine made from barley.” The Greeks, who derived the greater part of
                    their civilization from the Egyptians, obtained from them also the knowledge of
                    artificial fermentation, the art of brewing in fact, and at a very early period.
                    We find it mentioned, for example, in the writings of Archilochus, the Parian
                    poet and satirist, who flourished about 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> that
                    the Greeks of his day were already acquainted with the art.</p>
                <p>Again, we learn from Aeschylus (470 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), from
                    Sophocles (420 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> and Theophrastus (300 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> that the Greeks employed barley wine or beer (their
                    <hi rend="italic">zythos)</hi> in their daily life as well as in their festive
                    meetings. There is, in fact, little doubt that the discovery of beer and its use
                    as an exhilarating drink were nearly as early as those of the grape itself.
                    Xenophon, in his account of the retreat of the ten thousand Greeks, written 400
                    yeare <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> mentions that the inhabitants of Armenia
                    used a fermented drink made from barley. Diodorus Siculus states that the
                    Galatians prepared a fermented beverage from barley, calling it <hi
                    rend="italic">zythos,</hi> like the Egyptians. By Sophocles and other Greek
                    writers it is styled <hi rend="italic">βpυτov.</hi> Dioscorides mentione two
                    kinds of beer, one he calls <hi rend="italic">ζvθo&lt;s</hi> and the other <hi
                    rend="italic">κονρμ.1.,</hi> but he does not describe them sufficiently to
                    enable us to distinguish them. Both, he says, were made from barley, and similar
                    liquors were made in Spain and Britain from wheat. In the time of Tacitus (whose
                    treatise on the manners and customs of the Germans was written in the 1st
                    century of the Christian era), beer was their usual beverage, and from his
                    description, imperfect as it is, there can be no doubt that they understood the
                    method of converting barley into malt. Pliny mentions its use in Spain <hi
                    rend="italic">(Nat. Hist.,</hi> xxii. 82) under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >celia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ceria,</hi> and in Gaul under that of <hi
                    rend="italic">cerevisia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cervisia;</hi> and elsewhere
                    (xiv. 29) he says—“The natives who inhabit the west of Europe have a liquor with
                    which they intoxicate themselves, made from corn and water. The manner of making
                    this liquid is somewhat different in Gaul, Spain, and other countries; and it is
                    called by different names, but its nature and properties are everywhere the
                    same. The people of Spain in particular brew this liquor so well that it will
                    keep good a long time. So exquisite is the cunning of mankind in gratifying
                    their vicious appetites, that they have thus invented a method to make water
                    itself produce intoxication.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cervisia</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> Pliny evidently
                    takes its name from Ceres, the goddess of corn. Plautue calls it <hi
                    rend="italic">Cerealis</hi><hi rend="italic">liquor,</hi> that is, liquor used
                    at the solemn festival of that goddess. The art of malting and use of beer are
                    supposed to have been introduced into Britain by the Romans. That barley was
                    known to the latter is evident from Virgil, who uses it in the plural form, <hi
                    rend="italic">hordea,</hi> as we do the word oats; and Pliny tells of the <hi
                    rend="italic">hordearii gladiatores,</hi> a kind of fencers, whose sustenance
                    was barley. Beer and vinegar were the ordinary beverages of the soldiers under
                    Julius Caesar. The latter was made very strong, and was drunk diluted with water
                    when on the march. Beer being so suitable to the climate, and so easily made by
                    an agricultural people with plenty of corn, it was gladly welcomed, and soon
                    became the national beverage. Previous to this, the usual drinks of the ancient
                    Britons were water, milk, and mead (an intoxicating drink made from honey).
                    After the expulsion of the Romans from Britain, the Saxons subdued the natives
                    and learned from them the art of brewing.</p>
                <p>Dr H. J. Mann tells us that the Kaffre races of South Africa have made for ages,
                    and still make, a fermented drink of beer from the seed of the millet <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sorghum,</hi><hi rend="italic">vulgare},</hi> which is first
                    subjected to a malting process in all essential particulars identical with our
                    own, The seed is first induced to germinate by covering it in a warm place with
                    moistened mats of grass, and the sprouting is then stopped by the application of
                    heat. After simmering for some time in hot w ater, the malted grain is set aside
                    to ferment in the sun— fragments of a dried succulent plant having been stirred
                    in to play the part of yeast and start the fermentation. The scum which rises to
                    the surface during the fermentation is skimmed away from time to time by ladles
                    made of grass stems spread out and loosely woven together at the bowl. When the
                    fermentation is complete the beer is poured through a mat strainer, shaped and
                    tasselled very much like an inverted night-cap, into the store vessel, which is
                    made of thickly and firmly woven grase. The natives of Nubia, Abyssinia, and
                    other parts of Africa also make an intoxicating drink of great power called
                    bousa, from the flour of the teff <hi rend="italic">(Poa abyssinica),</hi> and
                    from the durrha or millet <hi rend="italic">(Sorghum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vulgare),</hi> much esteemed by the natives, and perferred by many to palm or
                    date wine, the common intoxicating drink in tropical countries. According to
                    Mungo Park, the natives of Africa also make a beverage from the seed of the
                    spiked or eared soft-grass <hi rend="italic">(Holcus spicatus).</hi> The Russian
                    drink kvass or quass, a thick, sour beverage, not unlike bousa, is made of
                    barley and rye flour, mixed with water and fermented. Formerly, the spruce-fir,
                    birch, maple, and ash trees were tapped, and their juice used in England,—the
                    first two, indeed, till within the last fifty years. Koumiss, the drink of the
                    Tatar race, is the fermented milk of their mares. The Chinese beverage,
                    sam-shee, is made from rice. This is not only intoxicating, but, like absinthe,
                    peculiarly mischievous in its permanent effects. In South America a favourite
                    drink is palque, the fermented juice of the Amercian aloe <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Agave americana).</hi> Guarapo is the juice of the sugar-cane, which, when
                    fermented, forms the common drink of the negro <pb break="no"

                    honey. Where beer has once been introduced, however, it has generally become the
                    national beverage, and is now in universal use in the northern and temperate
                    parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
                <p>Beer used formerly to be made in England from wheat; but this beverage was not so
                    well flavoured as if prepared from barley-malt, nor did it keep long. It was
                    esteemed in Germany and Denmark, and was called by the Germans <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mumme,</hi> and by the Danes <hi rend="italic">mom.</hi> The German <hi
                    rend="italic">Weiss-bier</hi> is made from wheat-malt, with a small portion of
                    barleymalt added.</p>
                <p>We are informed by William of Malmesbury that, in the reign of Henry II., the
                    English were greatly addicted to drinking. The monasteries were remarkable for
                    the strength and purity of their ales, brewed from malt prepared by the monks
                    with great care and skill. The waters of Burton-on-Trent began to be famous in
                    the 13th century. The secret of their being so especially adapted for brewing
                    was first discovered by some monks, who held land in the adjacent neighbourhood
                    of Wetmore. There is a document still extant, dated 1295, in which it is stated
                    that Matilda, daughter of Nicholas de Shoben, had re-leased to the abbot and
                    convent of Burton-on-Trent certain tenements within and without the town; for
                    which re-lease they granted her, daily for life, two white loaves from the
                    monastery, two gallons of conventual beer, and one penny, besides seven gallons
                    of beer for the men. The abbots of Burton must also have made their own malt,
                    for it was a common covenant in leases of mills belonging to the abbey, that the
                    malt of the lords of the manor, both spiritual and temporal, should be ground
                    free of charge. Mary Queen of Scots, in the midst of her troubles, seems not to
                    have been altogether insensible to the attractions of English beer, for when she
                    was confined in Tutbury Castle, Walsingham her secretary asked, “At what place
                    near Tutbury beer may be provided for her majestie’s use <hi rend="italic"
                    >1</hi>” to which Sir Ralph Sadler, governor of the castle, made reply, “Beer
                    may be had at Burton, three miles off.” Plot, in his <hi rend="italic">Natural
                    History of Staffordshire,</hi> written 200 years ago, refers to the peculiar
                    properties possessed by the Burton waters, from which, he says, “by an art well
                    known in this country good ale is made, in the management of which they Eave a
                    knack of fining it in three days to that degree that it shall not only be
                    potable, but is clear and palatable as one could desire any drink of this kind
                    to be.” In 1630 Burton beer began to be known in London, being sold at “ye
                    Peacocke,” in Gray’s Inn Lane, and, according to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spectator,</hi> was in great demand amongst the visitors at Vauxhall. In 1585
                    Stow relates that there were 26 brewers in the city of London, the suburbs, and
                    Westminster,—13 being English and 13 foreigners,—who brewed 648,960 barrels of
                    beer, of which they exported 26,400 barrels to Embden, the Low Countries, and
                    Dieppe. In 1643 the first excise was imposed on beer. In William III.’s reign,
                    the brewer sold his nut-brown ale at 16s. per barrel, and his small beer from
                    the same grains for 6s. per barrel.</p>
                <p>At the present day the brewing trade has reached vast proportions in Great
                    Britain. It would appear that its extent has now attained the <hi rend="italic"
                    >maximum;</hi> the quantity produced for export is likely to decline, as most of
                    the colonies are beginning to make their own. The best colonial beer is made in
                    Tasmania, whence it is shipped in frozen blocks to Australia and India. In
                    Calcutta, on the hottest day, the residents now suck (not sip) their frozen pale
                    ale. According to the report to Messrs Bass by Professor Leone Levi, the number
                    of persons employed in and depending on the liquor trade is 1,500,000, and the
                    capital invested in it amounts to £117,000,000. There are 5000 maltsters, 34,000
                    licensed brewers, 6000 dealers in ales, and 139,000 publicans. These pay nearly
                    £8,000,000 a year for permission to make and sell the popular drink. The
                    quantity of beer brewed in 1869 was 25,542,664 barrels, of which 521,272 barrels
                    were exported; whilst in 1874 the exports were 573,957 barrels, of the declared
                    value of £2,508,883. It has been estimated that Barclay &amp; Perkins
                    (successors to Thrale, Johnson’s friend) have £1,500,000 sunk in their trade.
                    Bass, the largest brewer in the world, pays license on 1,000,000 barrels, and
                    there are eighteen other brewers who pay duty on 2C <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>The first essay known to us on the subject of brewing is by Basil Valentine.
                    Boerhaave says of this treatise that it is both accurate and elegant. In 1573
                    II. Knanst published a work in five volumes at Erfurt, with the quaint title,
                    <hi rend="italic">On the Divine Noble Gift, the Philosophical, highly Dear, and
                    Wondrous Art to Brew Beer.</hi> In the year 1585 Thaddeus Hagecius ab Hayek (a
                    Bohemian), published a treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">De Cerevisia,
                    ejusque</hi><hi rend="italic">conficiendi ratione, natura, viribus, et
                    facultatibus.</hi> This small work of fifty pages gives a very clear and
                    accurate description of the process of brewing. To Mr Combrune, a London breweι∙
                    in the earlier part of the 18th century, we are indebted for the proofs he gave
                    of the value of the thermometer in brewing. In other respects his work entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">The Theory and Practice of Brewing,</hi> is of no particular
                    value at the present day, though it was very useful at the time in advancing the
                    art, and ran through several editions. Previous to his time brewers had looked
                    upon the thermometer as a scientific toy, and “rule of thumb” was the order of
                    the day. In the year 1784 Mr Richardson of Hull brought out his <hi
                    rend="italic">Theoretic Hints on Brewing Malt Liquor,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Statistical Estimates of the Materials of Brewing, showing the use of the
                    Saccharometer.</hi> These works would be beneficial but for the absurd mystery
                    with which the author invests the whole subject. It was he who first brought
                    publicly to the notice of brewers the value of the saccharometer, an improvement
                    of his own on the hydrometer, or water guage, invented by Martin, the Fleet
                    Street mathematician. Mr Ba verstock purchased one of these in 1768, and in 1770
                    received a certificate of the value of his instrument from Mr Th rale, the
                    celebrated brewer in Southwark, who had tested it. It was not, however, till
                    1785 that Mr Ba verstock published his <hi rend="italic">Hydrometrical
                    Observations and Experiments in the Breweries;</hi> so that Mr Richardson has
                    the merit of bringing his improved hydrometer, which he christened
                    saccharometer, first to the notice of the trade. By this instrument the brewer
                    is enabled to ascertain the amount of saccharine or fermentable matter in the
                    wort, and thus to take advantage of a particularly good sample of malt, or to
                    compensate for a bad one, so as to procure an uniform strength. Malt varies in
                    quality according to season, the skill of the maltster, and other circumstances.
                    Samples of barley raised from the same seed, and grown in adjoining fields, will
                    produce malt widely different, although this is not discovered till it has been
                    in the mash tun. The quantity of malt which suffices for a particular “length”
                    to-day may fall far short of affording the same quantity of ale to morrow, and
                    <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> In either case the saccharometer is
                    essential, as it enables the brewer to make his ales one standard strength. The
                    instrument is also of great service in regulating the fermentations.</p>
                <p>Mr Richardson’s saccharometer was constructed on the principle that 36 gallons
                    (one barrel) of water weighs 360 lb, and if that quantity of water were
                    converted into wort <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n309/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0309-0266"/> and again weighed the difference would show the
                    weight of fermentable matter extracted from the malt. His instrument, therefore,
                    was graduated so as to show one degree for each pound that a barrel of wort
                    weighed more than a barrel of water. He does not, however, allow for the
                    displacement of a certain quantity of water by the saccharine matter dissolved
                    in it; consequently, his instrument is not quite correct. The saccharometer of
                    Dring and Fage and that of Long, which are both on the same principle as
                    Richardson’s, are adjusted so as to allow for this inaccuracy; for example, if a
                    gallon of sugar, weighing 16 lb, be added to 35 gallons of water (together
                    making one barrel imperial measure), their instruments show in this infusion, at
                    60° Fahr., the excess above that of distilled water, which, in this instance, is
                    6 lb gravity; thus we have a barrel of wort, 'weighing 366 lb, composed of water
                    35 gallons, and saccharine matter 16 lb. The Excise make their calculations by
                    Allan and Bate’s instruments, which are constructed on the principle of
                    indicating the specific gravity of the wort,—that of distilled water, which is
                    the standard of weight by which all substances have to be compared, being
                    reckoned 1000. It is, however, easy to change the reckoning of the one to the
                    other. Should we wish to reduce the specific gravity indicated by Allan’s or
                    Bate’s instruments, we have only to divide the specific gravity by 2’77; or if
                    we wish to convert the indication of Dring and Fage’s scale into specific
                    gravities we multiply by the same factor.</p>

                    This, in consequence of its being more hardy and ripening more rapidly, is
                    cultivated in Scotland and Ireland. The variety of the two-rowed most iu repute
                    is the Chevalier. This was introduced early in the present century by the rector
                    of Stonham, in Suffolk, after whom it was named, and was the result of careful
                    cultivation. Mr Chevalier saw some fine specimens of two-eared barley growing on
                    a manure heap, had them saved, and cultivated them for several years, selecting
                    only the soundest and largest seeds, until the Chevalier barley became famous
                    and commanded large prices. The land in Great Britain suitable to the growth of
                    the finest grain for malting is limited,—the most favourable districts being
                    Suffolk, Norfolk, and parts of Essex and Herts. It is, of course, cultivated in
                    all other counties, but not to the same extent. From the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agricultural Returns of Great Britain,</hi> presented to Parliament, we find
                    that in the year 1870, there were 2,600,000 acres under barley, which, if taken
                    together, would form a block ⅜th larger than the counties of Suffolk and
                    Norfolk. Taking the average yield at 32 bushels per acre, the total is
                    83,000,000 bushels, or more than 10,000,000 quarters. Of this, 50,000,000
                    bushels were converted into malt, and 4,000,000 used by the distillers. Farmers
                    find by experience that some land is not fit for the growth of this cereal, and
                    maltsters that if it is grown on certain soils it will not make good malt. Light
                    calcareous or friable gravelly dry soil is the best. Rich loamy soil produces an
                    excellent crop, and sandy soil, when well manured, answers; but cold clayey
                    land, even when well drained, will not produce the best malting barley It is a
                    most precarious crop, requires but little moisture, and a wet season is fatal to
                    it. When it is in full ear rain, or even heavy dew, will break the stalk, and if
                    wet continues for two or three days the ears on the ground begin to grow, get
                    stained, and become quite unfit for malting. It should remain in the stack at
                    least a month to season. If “got up” damp, it is liable to generate excessive
                    heat, in which case the growing power of the germ is destroyed, and the grain
                    rendered useless for malting purposes. Good barley should have a thin, clean,
                    wrinkled husk, closely adhering to a plump well-fed kernel, which, when broken,
                    appears white and sweet, with a germ full, and of a pale yellow colour. It is of
                    all cereals the best adapted for malting, containing as it does more starch and
                    far less gluten than other grain, and about 7 per cent, of ready-formed
                    grape-sugar. Its specific gravity is from 1’280 to 1’333, that of malt 1’200. A
                    bushel of barley weighs between 53 ft) and 58 ft», depending on climate, soil,
                    and harvest; the same quantity of bere or bigg weighs from 47 ft) to 51 ft». It
                    cannot well be too heavy, as it gives a corresponding gravity to the malt,
                    providing it be mellow, thin-skinned, and not steely. The cuticle, or husk,
                    forms nearly ⅜th of the weight of barley, and between ⅜th and ⅜th in bigg.
                    According to Einhoff, 1000 parts of barley meal contain 720 of starch, 100 of
                    water, 68 of fibrous or ligneous matter, 56 of sugar, 50 of mucilage, 36’6 of
                    gluten, 12 ’ 3 of vegetable matter, and 2 ’ 5 of phosphate of lime. Hermbstädt
                    gives the following percentages as the mean of ten analyses of barley made by

                <p>Great care must be taken when buying for malting, for sometimes .the grain is
                    doctored by kiln-bleaching or dried at too great a heat. Several samples, too,
                    may be mixed, in which case they will not grow regularly, as heavier barley
                    generally requires to be longer in steep. Corns broken by the drum of the
                    thrashing-machine being set too close spoil a sample; those cut into sections
                    will not germinate, but in warm weather putrefy, as is evident from their
                    blue-grey and mouldy appearance, and offensive smell whilst germinating. A good
                    buyer will, by the use of a skilful hand, estimate very closely the weight per
                    bushel in bulk; his eye will tell him if the grain has been cut before being
                    ripe, in which case there will be a variety in the colour of the barley-corns,
                    some being bright, and some a dead greyish yellow. In consequence of being sown
                    in spring, and not undergoing the equalizing tendency of winter, barley is of
                    all grain the most liable to ripen in a patchy manner, and not come to
                    perfection simultaneously. The buyer has also to judge if it has been heated or
                    “mow-burnt ’’ while lying in the field after being cut, or in the stack; this it
                    is apt to do in showery weather, or when the crop of clover, which is generally
                    sown with or soon after the barley, is luxuriant. In this case the grain is apt
                    to sprout, and as the process of malting is as near as can be a natural
                    vegetation, barley once sprouted is useless to the maltster.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Malting.—</hi> The word malt has been variously derived from
                    roots that have respectively the meanings of grinding, soaking, and rotting. The
                    last derivation, corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">humor ex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">hordeo corruptus</hi> of Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Germ.</hi>
                    23), is the most probable. Malting consists in steeping the grain in water to
                    supply moisture enough to cause it to germinate, and when the growth is
                    sufficiently advanced, stopping it by drying the grain on a kiln. Before
                    explaining the process of malting we must describe the construction of the seed,
                    and see the chemical changes that take place. A grain of barley is composed of
                    several parts—the inner and outer husks, the cotyledon, the corculo (which
                    includes the plumule or future stem and the rostel), the investing membrane, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n310/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0310-0267"/> and the scar or eye, through which the seed is
                    nourished during the process. The hard white part is termed, botanically,
                    albumen. This is the cotyledon, and forms the chief part of the seed, supplying
                    the germ with food during the first few days of its existence. With the germ,
                    which begins to exist within an hour of being put in steep, springs also into
                    existence the principle termed diastase. This name (from δuσττj∕u, to separate)
                    was given it by MM. Payen and Persoz, who made numerous experiments with it.</p>
                <p>According to Muspratt, diastase may be obtained by making a paste of malted grain
                    at a temperature of 76°, allowing it to stand for a few minutes, and then
                    pressing out the liquor, which is afterwards filtered and heated in a water bath
                    at 170°. At this temperature a portion of the foreign nitrogenous matter
                    coagulates, which is afterwards separated by filtration. The clear filtrate,
                    which contains tolerably pure diastase, is evaporated at a low temperature to
                    dryness. Diastase is not only soluble itself, but has the power of dissolving
                    starch, and converting it into soluble gum, to which is given the name dextrin,
                    and finally into grape sugar, so called because, on analysis, it closely
                    resembles the sugar which naturally exists in the grape. So powerful is
                    diastase, that one part will convert 2000 parts of starch into grape-sugar. This
                    operation will be noticed below under the head of mashing. It is on account of
                    this wonderful power of diastase to convert starch into saccharine matter, that
                    distillers use one part of malt in mashing to five parts of raw grain. The next
                    part of the seed that comes under notice is the corcule, which is the embryo of
                    the future plant. This germ, feeding on the sugar formed from the starch of the
                    cotyledon by the action of diastase, grows upwards and downwards,—the upward
                    growth being the plumule or “acrospire,” the downward the radicle or future
                    root. Acetic acid (vinegar), which does not exist in raw grain in a free state,
                    is now also formed; this assists the diastase in its action.</p>
                <p>The maltster’s object is to obtain as much saccharine matter as possible, with
                    the smallest loss of substance, by converting the starch of the barley into
                    sugar, and thus preparing it for the brewery, where it is changed by

                <p>The duty on malt forms an important item in the revenue, and stringent laws have
                    been made to enable the excise to levy the duty, and prevent the maltster from
                    defrauding. It may be remarked, however, that although those rules were relaxed
                    or abolished, the process of manufacture would be carried on as it is now. The
                    duty was first raised in the reign of Charles I. on the following scale :—
                    English malt, 4s. 4d.; Scotch barley-malt, 3s. 8⅜d.; Scotch bigg-malt, 3s. per
                    bushel, but 2s. of this was a war-tax, and the whole was soon repealed. In 1697
                    a tax was again imposed (to enable William III. to carry on war with France) of
                    6∣d. per bushel. The rate has been frequently changed, and has ranged between
                    7d. and 4s. 5|d. in England, and 7d. and 3s. 9|d. in Scotland. For this and much
                    other information we are indebted to a useful little work on malting published
                    by W. R. Loftus.' The present rate of duty on malt made from barley is 2s. 7d.
                    per bushel, and 5 per cent, additional, making in all 2s. 8⅜⅜d.; and on malt
                    from bere or bigg, when made for consumption in Scotland or Ireland, 2s., and 5
                    per cent, additional; when the latter is imported into England the higher duty
                    is charged. The 5 per cent, additional was imposed in 1840 on all exciseable
                    articles, except spirits.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Malting</hi> consists of four processes,—steeping, couching,
                    flooring, and kiln-drying.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Steeping</hi> is performed in a large cistern of stone, or more
                    usually brick, covered with cement, into which the barley (properly screened, to
                    remove the small useless grains) is shot from the store-chamber above. It is
                    then levelled and covered with water to the depth of 5 or 6 inches, all floating
                    kernels and refuse being skimmed off. This process is necessary for the
                    germination of the seed not only in a chemical but also in a mechanical point of
                    view. The seed is so hard and compact, and the husk so firmly bound to the
                    kernel, that it would be impossible for the tender germ to make its way through
                    it; the steeping imparts vitality to the germ, and also assists it in making its
                    way through the husk. The grain now swells about one-fifth in bulk and one-half
                    in weight .from the moisture absorbed; or more precisely, 100 S&gt; of barley
                    would weigh, after steeping, 147 B&gt;, and 100 bushels measure would increase
                    to 122. By law it has to be kept at least forty hours under water, and fifty if
                    the grain is to be sprinkled before the twelfth day. This time must depend on
                    the kind of barley used, the soil on which it was grown, the heat of the
                    weather, and the hardness or softness of the water in which it is steeped. More
                    time is required in cold than in hot weather. Scotch barley requires more time,
                    but bigg less. Fifty hours steeping will generally suffice, but sometimes
                    seventy is necessary. The rule is—if a barleycorn, held lengthwise between the
                    finger and thumb, breaks down into a pulpy, mealy state, the process is
                    complete; whereas, if the farina exudes in the form of a milky paste, it is
                    over-steeped. In warm weather the steep-water acquires an odour from matter
                    dissolved out of the barley skin; and, in consequence of a slight fermentation
                    caused by the organic matter in the water acting on the decayed grain, the water
                    becomes acescent or putrid. The steep-water should then be changed. This the
                    maltster is allowed to do once during each wetting, upon giving due notice to
                    the Excise. Whilst the barley is in steep it is guaged by the excise officers,
                    to prevent fraud, and to calculate the duty to be paid. Wide planks are placed
                    across the cistern to enable them to take the “dip,”—sufficient light, and
                    headroom of at least 48 inches, being provided. Numerous experiments show that
                    81⅜ bushels of good dry barley will, after forty-eight hours steep, swell to
                    exactly 100 bushels. An allowance is therefore made of 18∣ per cent, on the
                    grain found in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n311/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0311-0268"/> cistern or couch frame, but the duty is charged
                    on the greatest amount found, whether in the couch or on the floor or kiln. When
                    the operation of steeping is complete the water is drained off in about half an
                    hour by means of a gutter laid below the level of the cistern from end to end,
                    with a proper fall, and covered with perforated iron plates. The perforated
                    plates being movable, the gutter is easily cleaned and the plates replaced. The
                    law requires that every cistern shall be permanently constructed with the sides
                    and ends straight, and at right angles to each other, for facility of
                    measurement; the depth must not exceed 40 inches in any part; the bottom must be
                    even, with a fall of not more than half an inch per foot for drainage. No
                    cistern can be used under a penalty of £100 until a certificate in writing from
                    the supervisor has been obtained, stating that he has surveyed the utensil, and
                    that it is constructed according to the requirements of law.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Couching.—</hi> The couch-frame is formed like the cistern,
                    with the exception that the fourth side may be made of movable planks at least 2
                    inches in thickness. Before the year 1827 it was lawful to construct the
                    couch-frame entirely of movable boards; and couches made before that date may
                    still be used by obtaining permission from the Board of Inland Revenue. Into
                    this frame the grain is now thrown with wooden shovels. It must not be
                    compressed in any way, under heavy penalties, and must not exceed 30 inches in
                    depth. If the excise officer has any suspicion that the grain has been trodden
                    down, he may order it to be thrown back into the cistern and levelled. The
                    officer will then gauge it again. If he finds that the quantity has increased
                    more than 5 or 6 per cent, according to the length of time the grain has been
                    emptied from the cistern, any such increase over and above the 5 or 6 per cent,
                    will be deemed conclusive evidence that the grain has been trodden or forced
                    together. A penalty of £100 is then incurred; and alike sum for maltsters or
                    their men refusing to return the grain to the cistern. After twenty hours the
                    maltster is at liberty to move the grain onιto the floors; but, in cold weather,
                    when sufficient heat to forward germination has not generated, it is left two
                    days, and even longer; but if left too long, the grain becomes sour. After
                    sufficient time has elapsed, in order to prevent the heat rising too rapidly,
                    and to equalize it through the whole body of grain, it is thrown forward on to
                    the floors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flooring.—</hi> Here the grain must be kept level, with the
                    edges straight to make it easy for the officers to gauge, which is done several
                    times to prevent the introduction of uncharged grain. This operation of gauging
                    requires great care, as, in large houses, a mistake of the tenth of an inch
                    would make a difference of between 20 and 30 bushels to the maltster. On the
                    floors an allowance of one-half is made for the rootlets; this is generally
                    quite sufficient. Each steeping is called a <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> '
                    floor” or piece, and must be laid in succession according to age, the most
                    recent next the couch, and the oldest next the kiln. Maltsters may have six
                    floors, including grain in the couch and on the kiln, in operation at one time.
                    Germination now progresses; the plumule, or stem begins to grow under the husk
                    from the same end as the root, but instead of piercing the husk, turns round and
                    proceeds under it to the other end of the grain. This would develop into the
                    green leaf were its progress not stopped. Maltsters vary as to the length it is
                    advisable to let the acrospire attain; some like it not much more than half up
                    the back of the grain, others like it ⅞ths or even ∣ths of its length, because
                    it is practically found that a friability of the starchy matter takes place <hi
                    rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the length of the plumule. Unless the floors
                    are worked with great skill and regularity, however, some are apt to protrude
                    when carried to the latter extent. This shows an exhausted condition within.
                    Malsters who sell by <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> work the acrospire no higher
                    than is absolutely necessary; the higher it is worked the less starch and the
                    more sugar is produced, and a corresponding loss in weight ensues. The maltster
                    who sells by <hi rend="italic">measure,</hi> however, likes to have the
                    acrospire as high as he can, to increase the bulk of his malt. The writer’s
                    experience is that ales fine better, and keep better, when brewed from malt well
                    worked up. In large mash tuns, where the heat can be maintained, it is not of so
                    much importance; but in small tuns, where less than twenty quarters are mashed,
                    if the “spire” is up ⅛ths of the grain, so much the better, so long as it is
                    uniform. The temperature on the floor rises to between <hi rend="italic"
                    >50°</hi> and 60°; the fibrils of the radicle, the “chick,” as it is technically
                    called, shoot from the tip of every corn. The middle of the floor being the
                    warmest starts soonest; so, after a few hours, the grain is turned or stirred,
                    so as to bring all to a similar state of forwardness. At this point comes the
                    critical test of the maltster’s skill; no fixed rules can be laid down; he must
                    be guided by experience and circumstances. He has to consider the quality and
                    growth of the barley,—whether it came off light or heavy soil,— the kind of malt
                    intended to be made,—the temperature and peculiarities of his particular
                    malting. His principal object is to get the grain to work, and to work
                    regularly, to accomplish which, and to check the too rapid growth of the
                    rootlets, the grain must be turned several times daily, the interior being
                    always brought to the surface by the shovels of the workmen. The grain is spread
                    more thinly each time, the depth of it, originally 14 or 15 inches, being thus
                    gradually lessened to 3 or 4. This brings it to the middle of the process; it is
                    then thickened as gradually as it was diminished until it is thrown on the kiln.
                    The grain now emits an agreeable odour, something like apples; and if the hand
                    be thrust into the corn it is found wet enough to damp it; this is called
                    sweating. The “chick” develops into several short bushy rootlets. As the
                    acrospire grows the constituents undergo a great change; the gluten and mucilage
                    almost disappear; the grain becomes white, mealy, and sweet; carbonic acidis
                    produced; air is absorbed, almost as by animals in breathing; and, consequently,
                    air is necessary to the germination of the grain. It loses during this part of
                    the process from 1⅜ to 3 per cent, in weight.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that it is of importance to the maltster that the law
                    allows him to sprinkle water over the “pieces” on the floor; this may be done at
                    the expiration of ninety hours after removal from the steep, provided such grain
                    has been kept under water fifty hours. »Sprinkling is generally commenced on the
                    fifth or sixth day, notice having been given to the Excise twenty-four hours
                    before. If in steep less than fifty hours it may not be sprinkled till the
                    expiration of twelve days. Sprinkling is used most by maltsters who sell by
                    measure, and therefore want to increase the bulk of their malt; but there aro
                    seasons when it would be difficult to make good malt unless moisture were thus
                    supplied, to make up the water lost during sweating. Too much light is
                    detrimental, as appears from the fact that grain under the influence of
                    uninterrupted light is inferior, unless the sky-light be covered with a coating
                    of blue, which admits the actinic rays, and excludes the calorific and light
                    rays, which hinder germination. Shutters on the sliding principle are the best
                    for regulating both light and heat. Great care has to be taken not to damage the
                    grain by turning, especially when it is spread thin. To obviate the necessity of
                    turning as much as possible an instrument like a narrow shovel, called a plough,
                    is used, which brings the grains underneath to the surface, ^nd into contact
                    with the cold air, so keeping the germination <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n312/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0312-0269"/> regular. Grain is required by law to be kept at
                    least 168 hours on the floors, but maltsters may keep it there as much longer as
                    they like. Barley throws out five rootlets, the middle one being the strongest ·
                    and if the young floor has been neglected, this will shoot out three times the
                    length of the others and turn up at the end like an awl. When the grain has
                    germinated sufficiently, its growth is arrested by placing it on the kiln, the
                    object being to drive off superfluous moisture and insure the keeping qualities
                    of the malt.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kiln-drying.—</hi> The kiln is a chamber of which the floor
                    should be made of woven-wire or sheet-iron, or of perforated tiles. The
                    perforations are necessary to give admission to the hot air, and also to allow
                    the detached rootlets to fall through. The kiln should have a sufficient area to
                    allow the whole of one steeping to be dried at once, at a depth of 8 or 10
                    inches; by which means the malt is more regular than when dried in two or three
                    lots, as the portion left on the floor will grow, notwithstanding the maltster’s
                    efforts to prevent it. The opening at the top of the kiln is covered with a cowl
                    or cupola, which answers the double purpose of excluding rain and allowing the
                    escape of the steam. The furnaces are placed under the floor, nearly in the
                    central line, and the hot air passing through the perforations dries the malt,
                    while the steam is carried off through the vent in the roof. An iron or stone
                    plate, 4 or 5 feet square, called the “disperser,” is placed over each fire to
                    disperse the heat and prevent the malt immediately above from taking fire. The
                    heat at first should not exceed 90°; if higher it produces a hardening or
                    vitrifaction of the starchy matter or dextrin, and also heightens the colour of
                    the malt; whereas, if the malt be freed from moisture at a low temperature it
                    may afterwards be exposed to a high heat without gaining colour. The moisture
                    being disposed of, the heat may be gradually raised to from 125° to 135° for
                    India pale ale malt, and to 170° or 180° for ordinary pale malt,—the difference
                    in the kinds of malt being the amount of heat to which they are subjected on the
                    kiln. During the process the fires should never be allowed to go. out, as the
                    smell of a green fire imparts an unpleasant flavour. During the last few hours
                    in particular there should be a bright, clear fire for finishing off the malt,
                    otherwise the beer will not get bright. It will thus be seen that the process of
                    kiln-drying is very important. Dr Ure’s remarks on it are pregnant with meaning.
                    He says, “The operation of kiln-drying is not confined to the mere expulsion of
                    the moisture from the germinated seeds, but it serves to convert into sugar a
                    portion of the starch which remains unchanged, and that in a two-fold way. This
                    is, first, by the action of the gluten upon the fecula at an elevated
                    temperature, as also by the species of roasting which the starch undergoes, and
                    which renders it of a gummy nature. If we dry one portion of the malt in a
                    naturally dry atmosphere, and another on a moderately warm kiln, the former will
                    yield less saccharine matter than the latter. Moreover, the kiln-dried malt has
                    a peculiar agreeable and faintly burnt taste,—probably from a small portion of
                    the empyreumatic oil formed in the husk, which not only imparts its flavour to
                    the beer, but also contributes to its preservation.” Kiln-drying takes from one
                    to four days, according to the depth of malt and amount of heat used. The fire
                    being kept always burning, great care is needed to prevent its breaking out in
                    the night it is therefore made up the last thing and then “banked up,” that is,
                    covered with a quantity of the ashes which fall through the bars. For ordinary
                    pale malt, about three hours before it is thrown off the kiln the heat is raised
                    from 150° to 180 , and during this process it requires turning two or three
                    times, and is thrown off the kiln in a hot state. The rootlets are readily
                    detached from the malt by the turning on the kiln, and the treading of the men
                    in their list slippers; they are finally separated by screening, and are the
                    best criterion of the colour of the malt, showing at once the amount of heat
                    used. These malt “combs” or “cummings,” as they are called, are valuable food
                    for cattle in winter; and the fine ones which fall through the kilnfloor on the
                    disperser, mixed with the dust from the fire, are said to be almost equal to
                    Peruvian guano as a top dressing for turnips.</p>
                <p>Malt continues to swell, by absorbing moisture from the atmosphere, for nearly
                    three months, the time varying according to the dampness of the air. Malt in
                    store is said to be mellowing. The increase by measure of malt over dry barley,
                    called the “outcast,” is from 3 to 8 per cent.; in bigg the increase scarcely
                    amounts to 1 per cent. During the process of malting barley loses one-fifth of
                    its weight; in other words, 100 tt&gt; of barley converted into pale malt weighs
                    on an average 80 ft&gt;; but as barley when kiln-dried loses 12 per cent, of
                    moisture, the actual loss is reckoned at only 8 per cent. The late Professor
                    Thomson thus accounted for it :—</p>

                <p>There are three kinds of kiln-dried malt—pale, amber, and brown, and one of
                    roasted, called black or patent malt. We have already seen how pale East India
                    malt is made; also that the ordinary pale malt is dried off at a higher
                    temperature by 30° or 40 <hi rend="superscript"> υ</hi>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Amber malt,</hi> when ground, is of a rich amber colour, hence
                    its name. This is dried off at a heat of 180°. The fuel used during drying is
                    different. For pale malt, coke or anthracite coal is used, but the colour and
                    flavour of amber malt are produced by burning oak or other hard-wood
                    faggots,—the flavour being caused by the pyroligneous acid thrown off during
                    burning. High-coloured malts have advantages over pale; more dextrin is produced
                    and more albuminous matter is rendered insoluble; it is, therefore, easier to
                    brew good beer from them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Brown or porter malt.is</hi> dried in yet another way. The
                    floors of malt-kilns used for drying it must be made of thin sheet-iron or stout
                    wire, as the heat must be raised in a few minutes from 100° to a heat nearly
                    approaching combustion, and lowered as rapidly. The process requires great
                    attention, or the malt would take fire. The grain is spread thin, not exceeding
                    1⅜ inches in depth.; and the whole process is completed in less than two hours.
                    The fuel used consists of faggots of beech, elm, or oak; at first the fire is
                    kept down by being sprinkled with water, but the last half-hour it is allowed to
                    increase, and an intense heat is obtained. This kind of malt weighs about 32 lb
                    per bushel. It is sometimes called “blown malt,” from its distended appearance.
                    By this process the gum, sugar, and starch are converted into a kind of caramel,
                    which gives the flavour so much prized in porter. It makes the malt, however,
                    deficient in extractive matter, to the extent of from 20 to 30 per cent.</p>

                    removed to the roasting premises, where it is treated like coffee, being roasted
                    over a fire in cylinders of perforated iron. The law requires that 95 per cent,
                    of this malt shall have the “spire” extend to one-half the length of the grain
                    in order to prevent the introduction of raw grain. It is generally made from
                    injured or inferior malt, as the high temperature in drying quite restores the
                    appearance. There is, of course, no saccharine extract from it, that having been
                    converted into caramel or burnt-sugar; it is only wanted to supply colour and
                    flavour. Good malt of this kind should have each grain distinct, of its own
                    original size and shape, not adhering to each other; and when it is bitten the
                    inside should be of a rich chocolate colour.</p>
                <p>Pale malt differs in appearance from barley; the grains are plump and generally
                    free from wrinkles, and paler than barley. Instead of the tightly-closed end,
                    the opening through which the rootlets have passed is visible at the base of
                    each grain; when broken the starch should be loose, friable, and cretaceous, and
                    should leave a white mark as of chalk when drawn along a black surface. It
                    should be crisp to the teeth, and have a sweet and empyreumatic flavour, free
                    from the least mould or mustiness of smell or thste. Malt should weigh from 39
                    lb to 43 ft) per bushel. There should be no vitrified appearance when broken;
                    that would be due to an excess of heat at the beginning of the drying process,
                    or to the barley having been grown in too rich a soil, or to mixed seed being
                    used which did not work regularly. A good test is to take 100 seeds and throw
                    them into water, stirring them well up; good malt, being specifically lighter
                    than water, should float on the surface; if more than 5 per cent, sink it is bad
                    malt. Another test is to take 100 grains of malt and carefully examine the
                    regularity of their acrospire, which should extend -∣ths of the length of the
                    grain for large and ∣ths for small brewers. If more than 5 per cent, have
                    projected it shows a waste of material, whereas if more than 5 per cent, have
                    the acrospire less than half way up, it is a sign of insufficient
                    germination.</p>
                <p>Dr Ure’s analysis goes to show the amount of solid extract obtainable by the
                    brewer. He takes 100 grains of malt by weight, which are powdered and dried
                    half-an-hour by the heat from boiling water; they are then weighed, and the loss
                    shows the quantity of moisture in the malt. This powder is then mixed with cold
                    water, and the vessel containing it is heated in the steam-bath half an hour,
                    the contents being occasionally stirred. The husk and insoluble matters'are then
                    drained off, washed with boiled water, and then dried and weighed,—their weight
                    giving the insoluble matter in the malt, and the residue the soluble extract
                    available to the brewer. Dr Ure found in several experiments the average in 100
                    parts by weight, to be—</p>

                <p>According to this, if we assume that a quarter of malt weighs 324 ft), the total
                    soluble extract will be 216 ’ 4 δ&gt; avoirdupois; but as the gum and sugar in
                    assuming the fluid form combine with the elements of water, if the extract were
                    dried it would weigh 23 ft); and being reduced to the basis of the barrel of 36
                    gallons would become, in the language of brewers, 87 ft) extract per barrel,
                    which means that, if the wort from a quarter of malt were evaporated down to the
                    bulk of a barrel of 36 gallons, it would weigh 87 ft) more than a barrel of pure
                    water. Practice shows these experiments to be correct, the extract per quarter
                    varying, according to the sample of malt, from 80 ft) to 90 lb.</p>
                <p>Malt is made duty-free for distillery purposes and exportation; in both cases the
                    maltster has to enter into a bond with two sureties for £1000 that the malt goes
                    to its declared destination. It may also be made free of duty for cattle
                    feeding, an Act giving great facilities being passed in 1864; it was, however,
                    found to be useless, except in small quantities, as a condiment, and the
                    practice of giving it is entirely discontinued. In 1870 there was not a single
                    bushel made, as there was no demand for it. In the case of malt damaged by fire
                    or water, an allowance equal to the whole of the duty, jf totally destroyed, or
                    part if the damaged malt be sold on salvage, is granted by 7 and 8 Geo. IV. c.
                    52, § 76. The duty on malt is payable at the end of every six weeks, but upon
                    entering into a bond with sureties for payment, a maltster is allowed six weeks’
                    credit. Also by 26 Vict. c. 6, § 1, he may defer payment of half the duty on
                    malt made between 1st January and 1st April, and the whole of the duty on malt
                    made between the latter date and 16th May, for three months, on giving notice of
                    his intention to the proper collector before 1st April, paying interest at the
                    rate of 3∣ per cent, per annum for the accommodation, and giving bond for
                    security.</p>
                <p>By 7 and 8 Geo. IV. c. 52, § 46, it is provided that, if any workman, maliciously
                    or otherwise, commits an act by which his employers are liable to a penalty, he
                    shall be imprisoned with hard labour for not less than three or more than twelve
                    months. The master is liable for these <pb break="no"

                    prosecute his servant within a month of the offence, and show the Commissioners
                    a certificate of such conviction. Some maltsters have a notice put up in their
                    maltings to the effect that their men will be prosecuted if they commit the
                    offences mentioned in the Act.</p>
                <p>In America there are no internal taxes on materials used in brewing as such, but
                    there is an import duty on hops and barley,—five cents per lb on the former, and
                    15 cents on the latter per bushel. The barley mostly used comes from Canada, the
                    import duty being equal to about Is. 4d. on an American barrel of beer. The duty
                    is levied in the form of a stamp-tax on the beer fermented, completed, and in
                    barrel, at the rate of $1 per barrel of 31 gallons, and $2 per barrel of not
                    less than 63 gallons. No restrictions are imposed as to the materials of which
                    it shall be made.</p>
                <p>In Bavaria the duty is raised on malt, but not assessed till the malt is brought
                    to the mill to be crushed. It is made without licence or permission, and may be
                    sold without restriction; but traffic in ground malt is strictly forbidden. The
                    case is the same whether the malt is used by brewers or distillers. The
                    consumption of beer and spirits is untaxcd, except through the impost on malt.
                    The means adopted for preventing fraud consist exclusively in the control
                    exercised in the public mills by the Government inspectors. Private mills for
                    crushing malt are only allowed when the proprietors have their mills furnished
                    with the regulation self-acting measuring apparatus, together with the
                    Government automatical counter. This apparatus is sealed officially, and thus it
                    is impossible for an ounce of malt to be crushed which has not first been
                    measured and checked. Besides these means for preventing fraud, there exists a
                    regulation that no malt, whether tax-free or not, may be brought to any mill, or
                    be found there, for which a certificate (polette) has not been given specifying
                    the date, the quality, and the mill.</p>
                <p>Americans are now making beer largely from maize meal and maize malt. The
                    experience the writer has had of the use of the latter leads him to doubt its
                    economy; the extract is small, and the fine flavour of the ale impaired.
                    However, a small quantity can be used with advantage where the fermentations are
                    sluggish or inactive,—maize being the most powerful stimulant of this process
                    that we possess. Barley has always been considered, and with good reason, a
                    better, and in favourable seasons a cheaper, grain than any other for malting.
                    The reasons for this are, first, that whilst the husk permits the steep-water to
                    pass through to the starch it effectually precludes the escape of the starch;
                    secondly, the acrospire grows under the husk in barley, and so is protected from
                    injury during malting, whereas in wheat, maize, &amp;c., the acrospire forces
                    its way out with and at the same end as the rootlets, and therefore runs the
                    risk of being damaged by turning on the floors; these damaged grains become
                    mouldy, and mould being propagated by means of spores, one mouldy grain may send
                    out thousands of these spores among the good grain, and infect the previously
                    healthy ones; and thirdly, barley contains a large ready-made proportion of
                    grape-sugar and starch. It is, therefore, only in bad barley seasons that there
                    will be much demand for malt made from other grain. The average price of barley
                    from 1872 to 1875 has been 43s., and in 1874the average was as high as 49s. This
                    high price, which means a material increase in the cost of manufacture, has
                    naturally made a great inquiry for a cheaper sugar-forming product; and there is
                    no doubt that if the duty on malt were either taken off or laid on the
                    manufactured article, beer, large quantities of other grain dried on a kiln at
                    from 230 to 240° would be used in bad barley seasons. In Germany the grain is
                    steeped before kiln-drying for three or four hours, to remove from the husk the
                    unpleasant flavour it sometimes imparts to ales; the materials used to a
                    considerable extent there are wheat, oats, rice, maize, and even potato starch.
                    Beer made from rice is of a very clear pale colour, of an extremely pleasant,
                    mild taste, foaming strongly, and yet retaining its carbonic acid. Dr Graham, in
                    his instructive lectures on the chemistry of brewing, at the Society of Arts in
                    1874, explained how raw grain might be used to obtain a beer either alcoholic in
                    its nature, as brewed in England, or dextrinous, like the Bavarian beer. Mr John
                    Prior, of the firm of Truman and Hanbury, in his examination before a committee
                    of the House of Commons, says, “If the malt Acts were not in the way, numerous
                    substitutes for malt might be employed,” and that, amongst these, mangel-wurzel
                    might be used to any extent; and he goes on to say, “I have tasted as good beer
                    brewed from that alone as any home-brewed beer I have ever tasted in my
                    life.”</p>
                <p>The only substitute for malt allowed in Great Britain is sugar. Of this, in its
                    different forms, there was used in the year ending September 30, 1874—</p>

                <p>being an increase over 1873 of 204,528 cwt. Sugar may be used in brewing to the
                    extent of one-third,—two cwt. being equal to a quarter of malt; the duty is Ils.
                    6d. per cwt. It is either boiled with the wort, or dissolved in the underback.
                    Ordinary cane-sugar contains a large amount of dangerous putrefying albuminous
                    matter. It may also be said to cause two distinct fermentations, having to bo
                    converted, by the action of the ferment, into glucose before it is broken up
                    into alcohol; it is, therefore, only good for ales of quick consumption. For
                    store ales it is as well to destroy one of these fermentations, and at the same
                    time convert the cane into grape-sugar or glucose. This is dono by treating it
                    with dilute sulphuric acid, the acid being afterwards got rid of by means of
                    chalk or lime, which combines with and carries it down. This is effected very
                    rapidly if the temperature be increased by pressure to 250° or 300°, 1 lb of
                    acid mixed with 600 lb of water converting 100 tt&gt; of starch or cane-sugar
                    into glucose in three hours. This action of acids upon cane-sugar has formed the
                    subject of a patent (Garton’s), which is being worked on a large scale at
                    Southampton, and the product is sold under the name of saccharine; it has found
                    great favour with brewers, as it gives a rounder flavour, and more permanent
                    character, to the beers than when brewed from malt alone, and at the same time
                    masks the acidity where any exists, better than starch or cane-sugar. Saccharine
                    has been carefully analysed, and the analysis shows the whole of the raw sugar
                    to have been converted into glucose with a certain percentage of water. The best
                    mode of distinguishing grape from cane-sugar is by adding to the solution to be
                    tested, in a flask, a few drops of an alkaline solution of tartrate of copper,
                    and then gently boiling it. If any grape-sugar is present a bright red
                    metallic-looking precipitate of suboxide of copper is shortly thrown down; if no
                    grape-sugar is present the solution remains clear, with a slight blue tinge,
                    from the addition of the copper solution.</p>
                <p>It does not appear that the best judge can, from the taste alone, distinguish
                    between a beer made from malt and one brewed from a mixture of malt and sugar.
                    This is not surprising, when it is borne in mind that brewing from malt consists

                    hop known to commerce. The plant is mentioned by Pliny under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">lupus</hi><hi rend="italic">salictarius</hi> (A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> xxi. 50). It was
                    cultivated in the 9th century, for we find that in 822 the millers of Corbey
                    were freed by the abbot from all labours relating to hops; and hop-gardens are
                    mentioned by Ludovicus Germanicus, a few years later. Hops were introduced into
                    England from Flanders about the time of Henry IV. There is a curious edict of
                    Henry VIII., forbidding the mixture of either hops or sulphur with beer; but
                    little attention seems to have been paid to it, for in 1552 hopplantations were
                    formed. In 1649 the city of London petitioned Parliament against “hoppes” being
                    used, urging that “this wicked weed would spoil the drink, and endanger the
                    lives of the people.” It came into common use in Queen Elizabeth’s reign.</p>
                <p>The hop-clusters are ovoid cones, consisting of scales which are the enlarged
                    persistent bracts enclosing the fruit. They are covered with a tenacious yellow,
                    waxy substance, like powder, called lupulin, and technically “condition.” Under
                    the microscope this is seen to consist of minute semi-transparent granules,
                    round in shape; it is the most valuable part of the hop, containing most of its
                    active properties. The amount of powder compared with the total weight of the
                    hop varies from 10 to 15 or even 20 per cent. Amongst the leaves and powder of
                    the hop, we find essential oils, resin with associated bitter principles, and
                    tannin. When distilled with water, the powder gives 2 per cent, of its weight in
                    essential oils (there is none in the leaves); one of these distils at 212°
                    Fahr., but the other requires a much higher temperature for its volatilization.
                    Other products are formed from the lupulin—among them valerianic acid, which is
                    the disagreeable characteristic of old hops. The essential oils not only give
                    the aroma, but are of importance, as through their combination the resins and
                    bitter substances become soluble in water. The resin constitutes 50 per cent, of
                    the powder, and is soluble in alcohol. The importance of tannin consists in its
                    power to precipitate albuminous matter; of tannin there is only about 2 per
                    cent. It has been suggested to increase this by using the tannic acid of
                    commerce as a partial substitute for hops; and experiments have been made in
                    Dresden by Dr Fleck for this purpose. This must, however, be used with caution,
                    as an excess of it would be prejudicial to a successful clarification of the
                    beer.</p>
                <p>The most delicate hops are Goldings, grown in East Kent, —Farnham and Worcester
                    districts being next best, while good, strong, serviceable hops are grown in the
                    Weald of Kent, Sussex, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> Large quantities are
                    imported from Germany, Belgium, America, &lt;kc., the best being Bohemian, grown
                    near Saaz, which are very excellent in delicacy of flavour and aroma; Bavarians
                    grown in the district round Spalt are valuable for their cleansing and
                    beer-keeping qualities.</p>
                <p>The acreage under hops in England is 65,000,—40,000 being in Kent. This is an
                    increase of more than 15,000 acres since the commutation of the duty in 1862. In
                    that year the duty was taken off hops, and a charge made on brewers of Is. per
                    quarter, being at the rate of 3d. per barrel, on the supposition that four
                    barrels of beer were drawn from every quarter mashed. The old duty was 2d. per
                    lb and 5 per cent, additional. A hop-garden costs from £70 to £100 to start, and
                    from £27 to £30 to farm per annum. A rich, deep soil, rather inclined to
                    moisture, is, on the whole, the best adapted for the crop; but any soil (stiff
                    clay only excepted) will suit, when properly prepared. It should be enriched
                    with the kind of manure best suited to the land the hops are to be grown on;
                    stable and cowhouse dung, old rags, shoddy, guano, sprats, and other decomposed
                    matter are used freely; while on some land peat and lime are required. The land
                    is first rendered fine and mellow by being ploughed and harrowed several times;
                    then, in the spring, a large hole is made and filled with rich mellow earth;
                    into this “sets” or small pieces of the roots of the kind of hop intended to be
                    grown are planted with the buds uppermost and the earth pressed close about
                    them. These sets take three years to come to perfection. Two or three sets to a
                    pole, three poles to a hill, 1050 hills to an acre, is the usual calculation.
                    The hills should be 6 or 8 feet apart, the latter being best on rich land, as
                    there the bine runs the most. The poles are from 12 to 18 feet high, according
                    1o the adaptability of the ground for vigorous growth, with the ends that go
                    into the earth charred to preserve then. In America the hop is trained on wires;
                    this has also been introduced into England,— Mr Farmer, of Worcester, having
                    taken out a patent. It is very successful, but the first cost, £75 per acre, has
                    prevented its being used extensively. The hop crop is a most precarious one, and
                    may be said to vary from nothing up to a ton or even 25 cwt. per acre, and in
                    price from £3 to £25 per cwt. In proof of this, at the annual Worcester Fair in
                    1874, only 74 pockets were on sale, whereas the year before 1000 pockets were in
                    the market, and 2000 more were offered for sale by sample.</p>
                <p>The plant is very dependent on the season, and has many enemies in the insect
                    world, in particular, the fly or aphis, which infests the crop early in its
                    growth, feeding upon its juices and leaves, giving the latter the appearance of
                    having been riddled with swan shot. The flies come originally from the sloe
                    bushes, and are produced from eggs deposited in the previous autumn. These, as
                    well as fleas, red spiders, lice, &amp;c., may be destroyed by syringing the
                    plants well with soft soap and water. The mould first betrays itself in yellow
                    and drooping leaves, finally in the hop itself, eating it up with mildew,—the
                    presence of a few half-eaten leaves spoiling a sample. The blight coats the
                    leaves with a thick sooty substance; and when this appears the hop dwindles
                    away. The fire-blast, as its name implies, sears and scorches the foliage, and
                    withers it up. All these may be seen working mischief at once in the same hop
                    garden.</p>
                <p>The catkins of the hop ripen early in September; they are picked from the bine by
                    thousands of people from London, &amp;c., whose welfare and accommodation have
                    been much neglected; but great changes in this respect are made by sanitary
                    regulations which come into force this season (1875). Besides these strangers,
                    every man, woman, and child of the resident population is made available for the
                    season, which generally lasts three weeks. The pay is about 2d. per bushel; and
                    in a good season a family can make 2s. 6d. a day per head.</p>
                <p>After picking, the hops are dried on a kiln (oast-house, as its called),—the heat
                    never being allowed to rise above 90°, lest the aroma and volatile oil should be
                    thrown off. A small portion of sulphur is sometimes added to the fire, the
                    appearance of the sample being improved by the sulphurous acid thus formed. This
                    has been generally con · sidered by brewers injurious to the hop, and also to
                    fermentation; but a commission appointed by the Bavarian Government in 1855 (the
                    late Professor Liebig being one of its members), after two vears of experiments,
                    arrived at <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n316/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0316-0273"/> the conclusion that the use of sulphur was
                    beneficial to the hop, and not injurious to fermentation. It is frequently used
                    while the plant is growing to cure the various diseases to which the hop, like
                    the vine, is liable. The last process before the hops are brought to market is
                    “bagging.” This used to be done by “footing,” that is, letting the empty bag
                    drop through a hole in the floor, and having the hops stamped down by one man,
                    whilst two others filled; after which they were pressed by hydraulic power.
                    Under a new process the whole operation is effected by machinery in about eight
                    minutes. Hop-growers, as a rule, have no stores or convenience for warehousing
                    hops for more than a month or two; the consequence is the whole growth, whether
                    large or small, gets into the hands of a few great hop merchants, who command
                    the market.</p>
                <p>The best hops have a yellow, golden colour, and an agreeable smell; when rubbed
                    between the hands they leave a yellow, odoriferous, sticky powder on them,
                    without any broken parts of the leaves, and yield to boiling alcohol from 12 to
                    15 per cent, of soluble yellow matter. A very pale green colour indicates that
                    the hops have been gathered before they are fit; whilst a deep brown shade would
                    show they were allowed to hang too long before being gathered, or that they have
                    been over dried on the oast-house floor. A fair test in choosing hops for India
                    pale ale is to make a strong decoction of them with boiling water, putting it
                    into a white bottle, corked and exposed to the sun; if in twenty-four hours the
                    colour has become dark they are not fit for the purpose.</p>
                <p>During the year 1852 only 34,622 lb of foreign hops were imported; in 1853 this
                    increased to 4,739,307 lb, and in 1871 to 24,685,808. Before the hop-duty was
                    taken off there was a great deal of betting on the crop, which was computed as
                    equal to so much duty; and the appearance in the Borough of a hop leaf covered
                    with fly from one of the most favoured districts used to cause much
                    consternation. Since the repeal of the duty brewers have been allowed to use any
                    bitter instead of hop, provided such bitter does not give a factitious strength
                    to beer, and thus become a substitute for malt. Many preparations are, iu
                    consequence, offered for sale as partial substitutes for hops; but in these none
                    of the noxious, forbidden articles, such as <hi rend="italic">Cocculus
                    indicus,</hi> &lt;fcc., &lt;kc., are found, for we learn from the laboratory
                    returns of the Inland Revenue that, in the year 1872, only six samples of beer
                    tested were found to be adulterated. Considering the enormous extent of our
                    brewing industry (it is calculated that 900,000,000 gallons of beer are brewed
                    annually), such testimony to the purity of the beer is highly creditable to
                    those engaged in the trade. From the same source, we learn that in every
                    instance where an adulterant of a dangerous nature was used, the offending
                    parties have been those who brewed and retailed their own beer on a very small
                    scale.</p>
                <p>Age alters and deteriorates the character of hops in a marked and distinct
                    degree, much more so than in most aromatic substances; indeed, it changes them
                    to such an extent that, at the end of two years (when they are called “old
                    olds”), they retain little but the bitter, the aroma being gone.</p>

                <p>Hops are grown with success in Tasmania, upwards of 450 acres being under
                    cultivation. The Australian market, it is supposed, will be eventually supplied
                    from thence. At present between 600 and 700 tons of hops are exported from
                    England yearly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water.—</hi> Pure water, protoxide of hydrogen, is obtainable
                    only by art; it is therefore impossible, even were it desirable, to use that in
                    brewing. But good water is an indispensable element in the manufacture of good
                    beer. It should be hard and free from organic matter; this last point cannot be
                    urged too strongly, as this alone frequently causes failure in brewing
                    operations. From Cohn’s investigations we find that the germs of putrefaction
                    are so small that no filter of charcoal or other material removes them. It is
                    also doubtful if ordinary boiling destroys these organisms. Pasteur asserts they
                    are not killed below a temperature of 100° C. ( = 212° Fahr.); and Lex found
                    them alive after heating to 260° Fahr. Water charged with them is a decided loss
                    to the brewer, as the organic matter is decomposed during brewing and carries
                    off some portion of the strength of the worts, besides making the beer liable to
                    spoil. Soft water, or water that has flowed through moorland, and is free from
                    saline matter, is bad for the brewer’s purpose. When this has to be used for
                    want of a better it should be impregnated at second hand with chloride of sodium
                    (common salt) and gypsum (sulphate of lime). To allow for the deficiency of salt
                    in some water the Excise allow brewers to add sufficient salt to make up, with
                    that naturally in the water, 50 grains per imperial gallon. Soft water gives
                    greater extracts, as it dissolves the albuminous matter in the malt more
                    effectually than hard. With the use of very soft water as much as 100 ft&gt; of
                    extract per quarter has been obtained; but here the goodness of the extract was
                    the chief proof of the badness of the water; for it is dangerous to have too
                    much albuminous matter in solution, except in the case of porter or ale that is
                    quickly consumed, albuminous bodies being such powerful agents of change. Hence
                    the Burton brewers, whose beers have to stand a long time, and in all climates,
                    are perfectly right in praising their water, which contains a large proportion
                    of these mineral salts. The supposed superiority of the Burton ales is due to
                    the water, which is supplied, not from the River Trent, but from wells 20 to 120
                    feet deep. These wells are supplied from springs rising in the Outwood hills
                    that form the western side of the valley. The Bprings take up lime in their
                    passage through the gypseous deposits contained in the keuper marls of the
                    district. The presence of sulphates and carbonates of lime and the absence of

                    into beer. While brewing cannot be considered a difficult or a mysterious
                    art,—good materials, a good method, and strict attention being the secrets of
                    success—there is no process in which rules are of less avail. To obtain complete
                    success, it is necessary that the brewer shall have formed an opinion of his
                    materials from personal observation, and that he should be thoroughly acquainted
                    with the brewery in which they are to be used. It is not too much to say, that
                    the same heats and quantities cannot properly be used in any two breweries.
                    Bearing this difficulty in mind, we shall endeavour to point out where
                    instructions may be safely followed, and where the circumstances of locality,
                    &amp;c., will subject them to certain modifications which cannot be strictly
                    defined in an article like the present.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Grinding.—</hi> This is a very important operation; for, if
                    imperfectly performed, some of the “goodness,” or <hi rend="superscript">
                    tt</hi> extract” as it is called, will be left in the grains after mashing, thus
                    entailing a heavy pecuniary loss on the brewer. The malt is crushed rather than
                    ground between plain metal rollers; this is enforced by law, for the purpose of
                    facilitating the examination of the grain as to whether it has been malted or
                    not. Previous to the passing of the Act fraudulent brewers mixed raw grain with
                    their malt, grinding it all up fine, to prevent identification. Each corn should
                    be well broken, that the mashing water may have free access to every particle;
                    on the other hand, if the malt be ground too fine, it is liable to “set,” that
                    is, form a paste in the mash tun. When this happens it will be difficult to draw
                    the wort off, and when off it will contain so much of the coarser portion of the
                    grain that the flavour and keeping qualities of the beer will be impaired. If
                    possible the crushed malt should stand about twenty-four hours before being
                    mashed, care being taken to protect it from air or damp,—the object being to
                    allow the heat generated by passing through the rollers to escape.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mashing</hi> is the process of infusion, or mixing the malt
                    with water at such a temperature as shall not only extract the saccharine matter
                    existing in the malt, but shall also change the still unconverted starch into
                    grape-sugar. This is accomplished by the principle called diastase, the power of
                    which we have shown under the head of malting. Many mashing-machines have been
                    invented, and many are in use. In some the malt and the water are simply brought
                    into conjunction, and then mix themselves as they fall into the. mash-tun;
                    others, driven by steam, perform the operation of mixing more leisurely, and, in
                    some cases, more effectually. The old-fashioned method of mashing is by means of
                    iron rakes. These rakes are fixed on arms extending from the centre of the tun,
                    and are so constructed that when set in motion, no portion of the mash escapes
                    them. When rakes are <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> used a portion of the
                    mashing water is first run into the tun, and part of the malt; the machinery is
                    then started, and, whilst the rakes revolve round the tun, the remainder of the
                    malt and water are added. The heat of the mashing water is a very important
                    point; the particular temperature must depend upon the quantity and quality of
                    the malt, and the situation of and amount of radiation from the mash-tun. Not
                    less than two or more than three barrels of water should be run on to every
                    quarter of malt, and the heat of the water should be such, that, when all has
                    run on, that is, when the malt has combined with the water, the temperature of
                    the mash shall not be lower than 148° or higher than 152°. In some breweries
                    this result will be obtained by mashing at 168°; in others it will be necessary
                    to go as high as 180°. Neither of these heats will do any harm so long as the
                    heat of the mash does not exceed 152°. Most brewers and chemists think that, to
                    ensure the best results, it is necessary for the mash to stand at least two
                    hours. It would appear, however, that this belief has no solid foundation.
                    Recent observations have convinced the present writer that an extract as good,
                    and perhaps sounder, is drawn from a five minutes’ mash as from one that has
                    stood two hours,—a fact which any brewer can test for himself. The wort should
                    be drawn off by means of several pipes running from different parts of the
                    mash-tun. It must be run off slowly at first, or the malt in the tun (“goods,”
                    as it is now called) will be drawn down so tightly that it will be difficult for
                    the sparging water to run through it. It is a good plan to probe the mash now
                    and then with a thin stick; if the “goods” feel tight, and difficult to
                    penetrate, the wort is being run off too quickly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sparging.—</hi> When about half the wort has run off the mash,
                    the operation of sparging should be commenced,— the object of that process being
                    to wash out the goodness left in the malt after mashing. The sparging-machine is
                    made and fixed as follows :—A bar of iron having an upright pin in the centre is
                    fixed across the mash-tun; on this pin is placed a copper bowl or pan; into this
                    pan arc screwed two or three arms, extending to the sides of the tun. These arms
                    are about an inch and a half in diameter, and are perforated their whole length
                    with small holes on their reverse side. The hot water being conveyed into the
                    pan fills the arms, and, running out through the perforated holes, causes the
                    arms to revolve round the tun. By this means an equal and continuous shower of
                    hot water is rained upon every portion of the goods. The heat of the sparging
                    water, like that of the mashing liquor, must be modified by circumstances. In
                    brews of less than 10 quarters, 200° will be found to be a good heat; where
                    larger quantities are mashed 185° may be recommended as a safe temperature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boiling.</hi> —When the wort runs off the mash no time should
                    be lost in getting it into the copper or boiling back. In many modern breweries
                    the mash-tun is placed immediately over the copper, so that the wort runs direct
                    from the former utensil into the latter. Some coppers are built with an ordinary
                    furnace, others are furnished with a coil; in the latter case the worts are
                    boiled by steam passing through the coil from the boiler. Many brewers prefer to
                    boil by steam, as it is a cleaner method, and they are able to regulate the
                    operation to a nicety. Where the steam coil is used the boiling back is
                    generally made of wood. While the wort is running or being pumped into the
                    copper, the hops must be added. Here, again, no positive instructions as to
                    quantity can be given. On this point the brewer must be guided by his customers’
                    tastes, the season of the year, the length of time the beer has to be kept, and
                    the quality of the hop used. For strong store ales, from 10 ft) to 13 ft) of
                    good hops to every quarter of malt is not too much; whilst for ordinary beers,
                    to be drunk within two months, from 6 lb to 9 lb per quarter should suffice.
                    India pale ale and bitter beer require from 18 ft) to 25 ft) per quarter.
                    Various kinds of English and foreign hops can be used in the same brewing with
                    advantage; the proportions of each kind must be left to the judgment of the
                    operator. Of course, the ranker Bavarian and American hops must not be so freely
                    used as the more delicate English growths. There is a wide difference of opinion
                    as to the length of time beer should be boiled. For beers of quick draught, an
                    hour and a half <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n318/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0318-0275"/> is L·ng enough; stcck ales should have half an
                    hour or an hour extra. The finest pale ale is never boiled longer than one hour.
                    Where it is necessary to have two boilings in one brewing, the second copper
                    should boil rather longer than the first. The boiling during the first twenty
                    minutes should be brisk, in order to break the wort.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cooling.—</hi> When the wort has boiled the necessary time, it
                    is turned into the hop-back to settle. The hop-back is a utensil made of wood or
                    iron, and fitted with a false bottom of perforated plates; these plates retain
                    the hops in the back, whilst the wort is drawn off into the coolers. The wort
                    should be allowed fifteen or twenty minutes to settle in the back, and when run
                    on to the coolers should be thoroughly bright. In many breweries coolers are not
                    used, the wort running direct from the hop-back through the refrigerator into
                    the fermenting tun. When practicable this is an excellent plan, for worts often
                    take harm whilst lying exposed on the coolers. In every brewery of any note the
                    worts are cooled artificially by means of a refrigerator. Of these there are
                    several kinds, but all are constructed upon the same principle, which is that of
                    allowing a thin stream of wort to trickle over pipes containing a running stream
                    of water. The water is either run direct from the mains or is pumped by an
                    engine from a well. In every instance it is necessary that the water shall be
                    several degrees colder than the heat the wort is to be “pitched” at, as brewers
                    call it, in other words, the heat at which the wort is let down into the
                    fermenting tun. This “pitching heat” varies very much. Beers pitched at high
                    heats, say from 62° to 66°, come soonest into condition, but do not keep so
                    well. Under ordinary circumstances 60° appears to be the best heat at which to
                    start fermentation, or, in the case of strong ale, 58°.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fermentation.—</hi> The fermenting tun may be round or square,
                    open or closed, and made of wood or stone. Stone squares are universal in the
                    northern counties of England, but are rarely met with in the southern and
                    midland counties. When beer is fermented in a stone or slate square, it should
                    never be pitched at a lower heat than 66° or 68°; for these utensils are very
                    cold, and therefore liable to check or stop the fermentation. Every fermenting
                    tun should be fitted with an attemperator. The attemperator consists of.a series
                    of pipes fixed within the tun, and having its inlet and outlet on the outside.
                    It should be possible to run hot or cold water through these pipes at any hour,
                    so that the temperature of the gyle can be raised or lowered at pleasure. The
                    work performed by that natural process which we call fermentation is the
                    conversion of saccharine matter into alcohol. It plays a most important part in
                    the brewer’s art, and deserve3 his most careful attention. In order to obtain a
                    quick and regular fermentation, the brewer employs yeast, or barm, as it is
                    called in some parts of the country. Great care must be taken that the yeast
                    used shall be perfectly fresh and healthy, for it must never be forgotten, that
                    it is impossible to obtain a good fermentation from bad yeast. Yeast that comes
                    from porter should never be used in pale or delicately flavoured ales, as it is
                    apt to impart a burnt taste and high colour. The quantity of yeast required
                    depends upon the strength of the wort and the quality of the water. Strong worts
                    require more yeast than weak ones; and the same rule applies to hard waters as
                    compared with soft. Worts of about 20 lb gravity should do well with 1 lb of
                    yeast per barrel, whilst stronger worts require twice that quantity. As we have
                    said, 60° seems to be the best heat at which to pitch wort, unless it is of a
                    high gravity, or the fermenting tun be built in a very warm place, in which case
                    the temperature of 58° will not be too low.</p>
                <p>The appearance of a gyle of beer during the earlier stages of a good fermentation
                    is very beautiful. At first the whole surface is covered with a thick white
                    foam, which, within a few hours, curls itself into every imaginable shape and
                    form. This increases in height, until it presents the appearance of a number of
                    jagged rocks of snowy whiteness. With these the artistic beauties of the
                    fermenta tion' disappear, although the fine thick head of yeast which follows
                    delights the eye of the practised brewer, for it tells him that his fermentation
                    is drawing towards a successful end. But the progress of the fermentation must
                    not be judged by appearances alone. Samples should be taken from the tun at
                    least twice a day, and weighed with the saccharometer. By this means the brewer
                    tells at what speed the sugar is being converted into alcohol; and when he
                    considers the process has gone far enough, he stops it by taking away the yeast,
                    which operation is termed cleansing. At the end of the first twenty-four hours,
                    the gyle should attenuate 1 lb in every three or four hours, whilst the
                    temperature should rise from l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> to 2° during the
                    same space of time. The fermentation may proceed quicker than this without any
                    harm ensuing; but if it does not reach the <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> speed
                    of 1 lb in four hours, it may be said to be sluggish, and requires assisting.
                    This is done by “rousing” the gyle every two hours with a utensil made for the
                    purpose. Wort fermented in stone or slate squares must be roused every hour and
                    a half, without exception. If unchecked the temperature of the gyle will rise to
                    76° or even 80°. Any heat above 72° is likely to affect the beer injuriously,
                    for at that temperature the acetous fermentation commences. At the same time,
                    beers for quick consumption may be allowed to rise a few degrees higher, and
                    will perhaps be improved by the increase of temperature. The attemperator must
                    be used to prevent the gyle reaching too high a heat.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cleansing</hi> is the act of removing the yeast from the beer,
                    in order to stop the fermentation. There are three modes of cleansing—lsi, by
                    simply skimming the yeast off as it rises to the surface; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Id,</hi> by running the beer into casks, and then allowing the yeast to work
                    out through the bung holes; and 3&lt;Z, on what is called the Union, or Burton
                    system, which is the second plan with some improvements. When beer is cleansed
                    in the second or third mode, it is necessary to keep the casks or Unions full to
                    the bung. They must, therefore, be refilled every two hours, either by hand or
                    by a self-acting apparatus invented for the purpose. Brewers differ as to the
                    time when the operation of cleansing should commence; and, indeed, it is
                    difficult to fix any limit, as much depends upon the character of the ale and
                    the appearance of the fermentation. In the writer’s opinion strong ales, worked
                    in casks or on the Burton system, should be cleansed when they have attenuated
                    down to 12 or 14 lb; weaker beers and pale ales should be allowed to go quite 2
                    lb lower before being cleansed. Stout and porter should be cleansed rather
                    earlier than any kind of ale, in order that they may drink full in the month.
                    When all the yeast has worked out of the beer, it is ready for the last
                    process.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Racking and Storing.—</hi> Ales intended for quick consumption
                    should be racked so soon as clean, or they will be found flat and out of
                    condition. A few of the finest hops should be put into the cask; and in the case
                    of pale ale the quantity should not be less than 1 tt&gt; to the barrel. The
                    finest strong and India pale ale should be stored between two and three months
                    before being tapped, and even at that age, must be considered young. Ales
                    intended to be stored some months should have a porous vent peg placed in the
                    shive to keep the ale from fretting, and save the head of the cask from being
                    blown out. (s. <hi rend="smallcaps">a. w.)</hi><pb break="no"
