                    province is a sandy plain interspersed with numerous fertile districts and
                    considerable stretches of woodland. Its barrenness was formerly much
                    exaggerated, and it was popularly described as the sandbox of the Holy <pb

                    tributaries of its two principal rivers, the Elbe and the Oder, and is besides
                    remarkable for the number of its lakes, of which no fewer than 600 or 700 great
                    or small are enumerated. The mineral products comprise coal, limestone, gypsum,
                    alum, and potter’s earth; barley and rye are tho usual cereals; fruits and
                    vegetables are abundant; and considerable quantities of hemp, flax, hops, and
                    tobacco are raised. The breeding of sheep receives great attention, and the
                    province furnishes a greater export of wool than any other in the kingdom. Bees
                    are kept in considerable numbers, especially in the neighbourhood of Sorau. The
                    climate is cold and raw in winter, excessively hot in summer, and there are
                    frequently violent storms of wind. The manufacturing industry of the province is
                    both varied and extensive, but is for the most part concentrated in the
                    principal cities. The most important branches are the spinning and weaving of
                    wool and cotton, the manufacture of paper, and the distillation of brandy.
                    Educational institutions are very numerous, not only in the capital, but
                    throughout the province. There are in all 135 towns in the province, the most
                    important being—</p>

                    of West Havelland, in the government of Potsdam, and province of Brandenburg. It
                    is situated on the River Havel, and on the Magdeburg and Berlin Railway, 37
                    miles W.S.W. of Berlin. The town is enclosed by walls, and is divided into three
                    parts by the river,—the old town on the right and the new town on the left bank,
                    while on an island between them is the “cathedral town,” also called, from its
                    position, “Venice.” Many of the houses are built on piles, through which the
                    water of the river flows. The cathedral, an ancient structure of the 14th
                    century, the old church of St Katharine, erected in 1410, and the council-house,
                    deserve notice for their antiquity and as works of art. There are also a castle,
                    a gymnasium, a riding academy, a public library, a theatre, and several
                    hospitals. In the market-place stands a <hi rend="italic">Rolandssaüle,</hi> a
                    colossal figure 18 feet in height, hewn out of a single block of stone; and a
                    little to the N. of the town is the Marienberg, on which the heathen temple of
                    Triglaff and afterwards the church of St Mary’s were built. The town has a very
                    considerable trade, with manufactures’ of woollens, silks, linens, hosiery, and
                    paper, as well as breweries, tanneries, and boat-building. Population in 1871,
                    25,822.</p>
                <p>Brandenburg, originally <hi rend="italic">Brennabonch,</hi> was founded by some
                    Slavonian tribes, from whom it was captured in 928 by the emperor Henry I., who
                    surrounded it with strong fortifications. A bishopric was founded there in 949,
                    subject to Mayence, and subsequently (968) to Magdeburg; but the heathen Wends
                    succeeded in getting possession of the town, and were only expelled by Albert
                    the Bear in 1161.</p>
