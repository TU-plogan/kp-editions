                <p><label type="entry">BRIGHT’S DISEASE</label>, a term in medicine applied to a
                    clas3 of diseases of the kidneys which have as their most prominent symptom the
                    presence of albumen in the urine, and frequently also the co-existence of
                    dropsy. These associated symptoms in connection with kidney disease were first
                    described in 1827 by Dr Richard Bright. Since that period the subject has been
                    investigated by many able physicians, and it is now well established that the
                    symptoms above named, instead of being as was formerly supposed the result of
                    one form of disease of the kidneys, may be dependent on various morbid
                    conditions of those organs. Hence the term Bright’s disease, which is retained
                    in medical nomenclature in honour of Dr Bright, must be understood as having a
                    generic application.</p>
                <p>Two varieties of Bright’s disease are described, the <hi rend="italic">acute</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">chronic,—</hi> the former representing the
                    inflammatory and the latter the degenerative form of kidney disease.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acute Bright's Disease</hi> (synonyms— <hi rend="italic">acute
                    desquamative nephritis, acute albuminuria,</hi> Ac.) commonly arises from
                    exposure to cold, from intemperance, or as a complication of certain acute
                    diseases, such as .erysipelas, diphtheria, and especially scarlet fever, of
                    which it is one of the most frequent and serious consequences. In this form of
                    the disease the kidneys become congested, their blood-vessels being gorged with
                    blood, while the tubules are distended and obstructed by accumulated epithelium,
                    as also by effused blood and the products of inflammation, all which are shed
                    off and appear in the urine on microscopic examination as <hi rend="italic"
                    >casts of</hi> the uriniferous tubes.</p>
                <p>The symptoms to which the condition gives rise are usually of a severe character.
                    Pain in the back, vomiting, and febrile disturbance commonly usher in the
                    attack. Dropsy, varying in degree from slight puffiness of the face to an
                    accumulation of fluid sufficient to distend the whole body, and to occasion
                    serious embarrassment to respiration, is a very common accompaniment. The urine
                    is reduced in quantity, is of dark, smoky, or bloody colour, and exhibits to
                    chemical reaction the presence of a large amount of albumen, while, under the
                    microscope, blood corpuscles and casts, as above mentioned, are found in
                    abundance.</p>
                <p>This state of acute inflammation may by its severity destroy life, or, short of
                    this, may by continuance result in the establishment of one of the chronic forms
                    of Bright’s disease. On the other hand an arrest of the inflammatory action
                    frequently occurs, and this is marked by the increased amount of the urine, and
                    the gradual disappearance of its albumen and other abnormal constituents; as
                    also by the subsidence of the dropsy and the rapid recovery of strength.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">chronic Bright’s Disease</hi> there are several forms, named
                    according to the structural changes undergone by the kidneys. The most frequent
                    of these is the <hi rend="italic">large white kidney,</hi> which is the chronic
                    form of the desquamative nephritis above mentioned.</p>
                <p>Another form of chronic Bright’s disease is the <hi rend="italic">waxy</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">amyloid kidney,</hi> due to the degenerative change which
                    affects first the blood-vessels and subsequently also the tubular structures of
                    the organ. This condition is usually found associated with some chronic ailment
                    of an exhausting character, such as disease of bones and other scrofulous
                    affections, or with a generally enfeebled state of health. It is marked by the
                    passage of large quantities of albuminous urine, and is frequently accompanied
                    with general dropsy, as also with diarrhoea and consequent loss of strength. A
                    third form of chronic Bright’s disease is the <hi rend="italic">contracted
                    kidney,</hi> depending on the condition known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >cirrhosis,</hi> in which the kidneys become reduced in bulk, but dense in
                    texture, from an abnormal development of their connective tissue and relative
                    atrophy of their true structure. This form of the disease, which is commonly,
                    though not exclusively connected with a gouty constitution, is apt to escape
                    detection in its earlier stages from the more obscure character of the symptoms,
                    there being less albuminuria and less dropsy than in the other varieties. Its
                    later progress, however, enables it to be readily recognized. Dimness of vision,
                    due to a morbid condition of the retina, and also hypertrophy of the heart
                    leading to fatal apoplexy, are frequent accompaniments of this form of the
                    disease.</p>
                <p>A fourth variety of chronic Bright’s disease is described by authors on the
                    subject, viz., <hi rend="italic">fatty degeneration of the kidneys,</hi>
                    occasionally occurring in old age and in connection with a similar degeneration
                    of other organs.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n393/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0393-0346"/>
                <p>The kidneys being among the most important excretory organs of the body, it
                    follows that when their function is interrupted, as it is alike in acute and
                    chronic Bright’s disease, serious results are apt to arise from the retention in
                    the economy of those effete matters which it is the office of the kidneys to
                    eliminate. The blood being thus contaminated, and at the same time impoverished
                    by the draining away of its albumen from the kidneys, is rendered unfit to carry
                    on the processes of healthy nutrition; and, as a consequence, various secondary
                    diseases are liable to be induced. Inflammatory affections within the chest are
                    of frequent occurrence, but the most dangerous of all the complications of
                    Bright’s disease are the nervous symptoms which may arise at any stage, and
                    which are ascribed to the effects of uraemic poisoning.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of acute Bright’s disease, good results are often obtained from
                    local depletion, from warm baths, and from the careful employment of diuretics
                    and purgatives. Chronic Bright’s disease is much less amenable to treatment, but
                    by efforts to maintain the strength and improve the quality of the blood by
                    strong nourishment, and at the same time by guarding against the risks of
                    complications, b'fe may often be prolonged in comparative comfort, and even a
                    certain measure of improvement be experienced.</p>
