                    was then churchwarden, is variously represented as a substantial farmer (owning
                    a small freehold, and leasing from Sir William Russel a considerable farm valued
                    at £300 a year), and as “a man of but slender fortune,” who was barely able to
                    educate his son at a free school. The author of <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>
                    was apparently educated at the college (or cathedral) school, Worcester, and the
                    house in which he was born was pulled down (being considered incapable of
                    repair) about 1873. Hardly any other particulars of his youth are recorded, and
                    his later education (if he received any) is equally uncertain. He has been
                    loosely asserted (as is the case with many other distinguished persons of his
                    century) to have studied at both Cambridge and Oxford, but the balance of
                    testimony seems to be against his having belonged to either university. The time
                    between the completion of his education <hi rend="italic">{circa</hi> 1630) and
                    the Restoration, a period of fully thirty years, appears to have been spent by
                    him in three different households, with Mr Jefferies of Earl’s Croome in
                    Worcestershire, with the countess of Kent at Wrest in Bedfordshire, and with Sir
                    Samuel Luke at Woodend or Copie Hoo in the same county. He served Mr Jefferies
                    in the capacity of justice’s clerk, and is supposed to have thus laid the
                    foundation of his remarkable knowledge of law and law terms. He also employed
                    himself at Earl’s Croome in general study, and particularly in painting, which
                    he is said to have thought of adopting as a profession. It is probable, however,
                    that art has not lost by his change of mind, for, according to one of his
                    editors, in 1774 his pictures “served to stop windows and save the tax; indeed
                    they were not fit for much else.” At Wrest, where he is said to have been
                    gentleman to the countess, he pursued his studies in painting, drawing, and
                    music; probably, also, in other directions, for Wrest contained a good library.
                    Here he met and worked for Selden. But his third sojourn, that at Copie Hoo, was
                    not only apparently the longest, but also much the most important in its effects
                    on his career and works.</p>
                <p>We are nowhere informed, nor is it at all clear, in what capacity Butler served
                    Sir Samuel Luke, or how one who was not only in temper and sympathies, but also
                    from early associations, a decided royalist, came to reside in the house of a
                    noted Puritan and Parliament man. In the family of this “valiant Mamaluke,” who,
                    whether he was or was not the original of <hi rend="italic">Hudibras,</hi> was
                    certainly a rigid Presbyterian, “a colonel in the army of the Parliament,
                    scoutmaster-general for Bedfordshire and governor of Newport Pagnell,” Butler
                    must have had the most abundant opportunities of studying from the life those
                    who were to be the victims of his great future satire. But we know not how long
                    he held his situation (whatever it was) under the knight of Copie, and we hear
                    nothing positive of him till the Restoration, immediately after which he was
                    appointed secretary to Lord Carbery (then President of Wales) and steward of
                    Ludlow Castle. Contradictory documents exist respecting his tenure of the latter
                    office, one speaking of him as “late steward” in January 1662, the other (a
                    protection against arrest) addressed to him as steward in September 1667. About
                    this time he married a Mrs Herbert, according to Aubrey a widow with a good
                    jointure, on whose means he lived comfortably. Aubrey knew him well and could
                    hardly be wrong on such a point, especially as his testimony as to Butler’s
                    living in comparative comfort is confirmed by another authority to be afterwards
                    mentioned. It should, however, be observed that other accounts state that Mrs
                    Herbert’s fortune was lost through bad securities. Late in 1662 the first part
                    of <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi> was published. On the 26th of December I’epys
                    bought it, and though neither then nor afterwards could he see the wit of it, he
                    repeatedly testifies to its extraordinary popularity. This popularity is most
                    clearly proved by the issue of a pirated edition within a month, and by the
                    appearance of a spurious second part within the year. This latter compliment
                    (which it will be remembered was also paid to Butler’s spiritual ancestor
                    Cervantes) determined the poet to bring out the second part, which was licensed
                    on November 7, 1663, and which if possible exceeded the first in popularity.
                    From this time till 1678, the date of the publication of the third part, we hear
                    nothing certain and hardly anything at all of Butler. He appears at some period
                    to have visited France. He is said to have received a gift of £300 from Charles
                    IL, and to have been secretary to Buckingham when the latter was Chancellor of
                    the University of Cambridge. Most of his biographers, in their eagerness to
                    prove the ill-treatment which Butler is supposed to have received, disbelieve
                    both these stories, perhaps without sufficient reason. It must be allowed that
                    it is scarcely a valid argument that Butler, if he had been secretary to
                    Buckingham, would not have spoken so severely of that nobleman in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Characters {Remains,</hi> 1754), when it is remembered that he
                    satirized Sir Samuel Luke, to whom he held nearly the same relation, with
                    certainly equal virulence. Two years after the publication of the third part he
                    died (September 25, 1680), and was buried by his friend Mr William Longueville
                    (a bencher of the Middle Temple) in the churchyard of St Paul’s, Covent Garden.
                    He was, we are told, “of a leonine-coloured hair, sanguine, choleric,
                    middle-sized, strong.” Portraits exist at Oxford and elsewhere which represent
                    him as somewhat hard-featured. Two personal anecdotes, and perhap3 two only, are
                    recorded of him. One is the well-known story which tells how Wycherly laboured
                    hard to secure for the neglected poet the patronage of Buckingham, how an
                    interview was at last arranged, from which the duke was, alas! called off by the
                    passage of “a brace of ladies,” and how the opportunity was lost. The other
                    bears suspicious marks of having been made up as setting for a witticism of Lord
                    Dorset’s. Dorset, it seems, was anxious to know the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hudibras,</hi> and prevailed on a common friend to bring him to a tavern. At
                    the first bottle Butler was quiet and reserved, at the second full of wit and
                    spirits, at the third dull and stupid,—upon which Dorset’s comment was that
                    Butler was “like a nine-pin, little at both ends, but great in the middle.” Of
                    these stories it may be said, as of most such, that they may be true and cannot
                    be proved to be false.</p>
                <p>Of the neglect of Butler by the Court something must be said. It must be
                    remembered that the complaints on the subject supposed to have been uttered by
                    the poet all occur in the spurious posthumous works, that men of letters have
                    been at all times but too prone to complain of lack of patronage (a fact which
                    makes it probable that Dryden, Otway, Oldham, &amp;c., in alluding to Butler,
                    spoke as the proverb of that day went, “one word for him and two for
                    themselves”), that the actual service rendered by Butler was rendered when the
                    day was already won, and that the pathetic stories of the poet starving and
                    dying in want are contradicted by the best authority—Mr C. Longueville (son of
                    the poet’s friend)—who asserted that Butler, though often disappointed, was
                    never reduced to anything like want or beggary, and did not die in any person’s
                    debt. But the most significant story on the subject is Aubrey’s, that “he n‰ight
                    have had preferments at first, but would not accept any but very good, and so
                    got none.”</p>
                <p>Three monuments have been at different times and places erected to the poet’s
                    memory,—the first in 1721 by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n650/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0650-0589"/> Alderman Barber in Westminster Abbey. This was
                    the occasion of some rather misplaced wit from Pope and others. In 1786 a tablet
                    was placed in St Paul’s, Covent Garden, by some inhabitants of that parish. This
                    was destroyed in 1845. Some thirty or forty years ago another was set up at
                    Strensham by a Mr Taylor of that place. Perhaps the happiest epitaph on him is
                    one by Dennis, which (borrowing, indeed, its most striking expression from
                    Cowley) sets forth that Butler “was a whole species of poets in one.”</p>
                <p>Butler’s published works during his life consisted of the three parts of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hudibras</hi> (the second and third were republished together in
                    1674, with notes by the author); of an <hi rend="italic">Ode on Duval</hi> (the
                    famous highwayman); and of two pamphlets attributed to Prynne. In 1715 three
                    volumes, entitled <hi rend="italic">Posthumous</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Worts</hi><hi rend="italic">of Mr S. Butler,</hi> were published with great
                    success. Their contents, however, are all spurious except one or two short
                    pieces. The poet’s papers remained in the hands of his friend Mr Longueville,
                    and were not published till 1759, when Mr Thyer, librarian at Manchester, edited
                    two volumes of verse and prose under the title of <hi rend="italic">Genuine
                    Remains.</hi> The most remarkable of the prose writings are characters of the
                    kind popular in the 17th century, and partaking largely of the faults usual in
                    such pieces. To this some additional fragments were added in 1822; a fragment of
                    a tragedy on Nero is also spoken of. In 1726 Hogarth executed some illustrations
                    to <hi rend="italic">Uudibras,</hi> which are among his earliest but not,
                    perhaps, happiest productions. In 1744 Dr Zachary Grey published an edition of
                    <hi rend="italic">Hudibras,</hi> which has been repeatedly reprinted, and has
                    formed (with that of Nash in 1793) the basis of all subsequent editions. It
                    contains an enormous mass of notes, displaying little critical or literary
                    power, but abounding in curious information. A worthy edition is still to seek;
                    but that of the late Mr B. Bell is convenient, and supplies much information,
                    which is generally accurate. Mr Bohn’s (of <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi> only)
                    is also useful. Butler’s lesser works would of themselves fairly sustain, though
                    perhaps they would hardly create, a great reputation. Abundance of happy
                    thought, of ingenious expression, and of vigorous verse, may be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Miscellaneous Thoughts,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ode on
                    Duval,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> on the Royal Society <hi

                    >Critics.</hi> But the splendour of <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi> has somewhat
                    paled their fire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi> itself, though probably quoted as often as ever,
                    has perhaps dropped into the class of books which are more quoted than talked
                    of, and more talked of than read. In reading it, it is of the utmost importance
                    to comprehend clearly and to bear constantly in mind the purpose of the author
                    in composing it. This purpose is evidently not artistic but polemic, to show in
                    the most unmistakable characters the vileness and folly of the. anti royalist
                    party. Anything like a regular plot—the absence of which has often been deplored
                    or excused—would have been for this end not merely a superfluity but a mistake,
                    as likely to divert the attention and perhaps even enlist some sympathy for the
                    heroes. Anything like regular character-drawing would have been equally
                    unnecessary and dangerous—for to represent anything but monsters, some
                    alleviating strokes must have been introduced. The problem, therefore, was to
                    produce characters just sufficiently unlike lay-figures to excite and maintain a
                    moderate interest, and to set them in motion by dint of a few incidents not
                    absolutely unconnected,—meanwhile to subject the principles and manners of which
                    these characters were the incarnation to ceaseless satire and raillery. The
                    triumphant solution of the problem is undeniable, when it has once been
                    enunciated and understood. Upon a canvas thus prepared and outlined, Butler has
                    embroidered a collection of flowers of wit, which only the utmost fertility of
                    imagination could devise, and the utmost patience of industry elaborate. In the
                    union of these two qualities he is certainly without a parallel, and their
                    combination has produced a work which is unique. The poem is of considerable
                    length, extending to more than ten thousand verses, yet Hazlitt hardly
                    exaggerates when he says that “half the lines are got by heart;” indeed a
                    diligent student of later English literature lias read great part of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hudibras</hi> though he may never have opened its pages. The
                    tableaux or situations, though few and simple in construction, are ludicrous
                    enough. The knight and squire setting forth on their journey; the routing of the
                    bear-baiters; the disastrous renewal of the contest; Hudibras and Ralph in the
                    stocks; the lady’s release and conditional acceptance of the unlucky knight; the
                    latter’s deliberations on the means of. eluding his vow; the Skimmington; the
                    visit to Sidrophel, the astrologer; the attempt to cajole the lady, with its
                    woeful consequences; the consultation with the lawyer, and the immortal pair of
                    letters to which this gives rise complete the argument of the whole poem. But
                    the story is as nothing; throughout we have little really kept before us but the
                    sordid vices of the sectaries, their hypocrisy, their churlish ungraciousness,
                    their greed of money and authority, their fast and loose morality, their
                    inordinate pride. The extraordinary felicity of the means taken to place all
                    these things in the most ridiculous light has never been questioned. The doggrel
                    metre, never heavy or coarse, but framed so as to be the very voice of mocking
                    laughter, the astounding similes and disparates, the rhymes which seem to
                    chuckle and to sneer of themselves, the wonderful learning with which the abuse
                    of learning is rebuked, the subtlety with which subtle casuistry is set at
                    nought can never be missed. Keys like those of L’Estrange are therefore of
                    little use. It signifies nothing whether Hudibras was Sir Samuel Luke of
                    Bedfordshire or Sir Henry Rosewell of Devonshire, still less whether Ralph’s
                    name in the flesh w as Robinson or Pendle, least of all that Orsin was perhaps
                    Mr Gosling, or Trulla possibly Miss Spencer. Butler was probably as little
                    indebted to mere copying for his characters as for his ideas and style. These
                    latter are in the highest degree original. The first notion of the book, and
                    only the first notion, Butler undoubtedly received from <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Quixote.</hi> His obligations to the <hi rend="italic">Satyre</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ménippee</hi> have been noticed by Voltaire, and though English
                    writers have sometimes ignored or questioned them, are not to be doubted by any
                    student of the two books. The art (perhaps the most terrible of all the weapons
                    of satire) cf making characters without any great violation of probability
                    represent themselves in the most atrocious and despicable light was never
                    perhaps possessed in perfection except by Pithou and his colleagues and by
                    Butler. Against these great merits some defects must certainly be set. As a
                    whole, the poem is no doubt tedious, if only on account of the very blaze of
                    wit, which at length almost wearies us by its ceaseless demands on our
                    attention. It should, however, be remembered that it was originally issued in
                    parts, and therefore (it may be supposed) intended to be read in parts, for
                    there can be little doubt that the second part was written before the first w as
                    published. A more real defect, but one which Butler shares with all his
                    contemporaries from Jonson downwards, is the tendency to delineate humours
                    instead of characters, and to draw from the outside rather than from within.
                    This also may be partially palliated by some remarks made above.</p>
