                        Guglielmo</hi></label>, Italian historian, was born in 1766 at San Giorgio,
                    in Piedmont. He studied medicine at the university of Turin, and obtained his
                    doctor’s degree when about twenty years of age. Having rendered himself
                    obnoxious to the Government during the political commotions that followed the
                    French Revolution, he was imprisoned for nearly two years; and on his release in
                    1794 he withdrew to France, only to return to his native country as a physician
                    in the French army, whose progress he followed as far as Venice. Here he joined
                    the expedition to Corfu, from which he did not get back to Italy till 1798. From
                    that year, when he was appointed by Joubert a member of the provisional
                    government at Piedmont, till the fall of the Napoleonic system in 1814, he
                    continued to have considerable political influence; and though towards the close
                    of that period he acted with an independence that proved offensive to Napoleon
                    himself, and on the restoration of the Bourbons adapted his conduct to the
                    circumstances of the time, he was still in sufficient favour with the
                    Bonapartist party to receive from them, during their brief resumption of
                    authority in 1815, the appointment (soon afterwards resigned) of rector of the
                    university at Roυ,en. Ami0 all the vicissitudes of his early manhood Botta had
                    never allowed his pen to be long idle, and in the political quiet that followed
                    1816 he naturally devoted himself more exclusively to literature. By 1824 he had
                    completed a history of Italy from 1789 to 1814 (4 vols.), on which his fame
                    principally rests, for <pb break="no"

                    which he was afterwards encouraged to undertake, is a careful and laborious
                    work, he had not the erudition necessary for the satisfactory restoration of the
                    past. Though living in Paris he was in both these works the ardent exponent of
                    that recoil against everything French which took place throughout Europe. A
                    careful exclusion of all Gallicisms is one of the marked features of his style,
                    which is not unfrequently impassioned and eloquent, though at the same time
                    cumbrous and founded upon antiquated models. Botta died at Paris in August 1837,
                    in comparative poverty, butin the enjoyment of an extensive and well-earned
                    reputation. His son, Paul Émile Botta (1805- 1870), was a distinguished
                    traveller and Assyrian archaeologist. His excavations at Khorsabad (1843) were
                    among the first efforts in the line of investigation afterwards pursued by Mr
                    Layard.</p>
