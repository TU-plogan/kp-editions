                <p><label type="entry">BOYER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexis</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished French surgeon, was born on the 1st of March 1757, at Uzerches in
                    Limousin. His father was in the humble station of a tailor, and the son received
                    the elements of a medical education in the shop of a barber-surgeon in a
                    provincial town. His evident talent induced his friends to procure his removal
                    to Paris, where he had the good fortune to attract the notice of his two
                    distinguished masters, Louis and Dessault; and his unwearied perseverance, his
                    anatomical skill, and finally his dexterity as an operator, became so
                    conspicuous, that at the age of thirty-seven he obtained the appointment of
                    second surgeon to the Hôtel Dieu of Faris, and was elected professor of
                    operative surgery in the École de Santé. This latter appointment he soon
                    exchanged for the chair of clinical surgery,—a department in which his manual
                    dexterity and his admirable lectures on surgical subjects gained him the highest
                    reputation, and introduced him to extensive practice. Perhaps no French surgeon
                    of his time thought or wrote with greater clearness and good sense than Boyer;
                    and while his natural modesty made him distrustful of innovation, and somewhat
                    tenacious of established modes of treatment, he was as judicious in his
                    diagnosis, as cool and skilful in manipulating, as he was cautious in forming
                    his judgment on individual cases. In 1805 Napoleon nominated him imperial family
                    surgeon, and, after the brilliant campaigns of 1806-7, conferred on him the
                    legion of honour, with the title of Baron of the Empire, and a salary of 25,000
                    francs. On the fall of Napoleon the merits of Boyer secured him the favour of
                    the succeeding sovereigns of France, and he was consultingsurgeon to Louis
                    XVIII., Charles X., and Louis Philippe.</p>

                <p>In 1835 he succeeded Deschan1p3 as surgeon-in-chief to the Hôpital de la Charité,
                    and was chosen a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of the Institute of
                    France. From the period of his wife’s death, which he took much to heart, his
                    health declined, and lie died November 23, 1833, at the age of seventy-six.</p>
