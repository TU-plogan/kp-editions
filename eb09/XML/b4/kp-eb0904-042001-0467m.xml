                    Tiverton, and at Winchester, and in 1801 was elected by examination a scholar of
                    Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1805 he proceeded to the degree of B. A., and
                    in 1808 he was elected a fellow of his college. From early boyhood he had
                    exhibited a strong taste for natural science; his innate bias was at this time
                    stimulated by the lectures of Dr Kidd on mineralogy and chemistry, and his
                    attention was thus more especially drawn to the then infant science of geology.
                    He now devoted himself systematically to an examination of the geological
                    structure of Great Britain, making many excursions on horseback, and
                    investigating both the order of superposition of the strata and the characters
                    of the organic remains which they contained. In 1813, on the resignation of Dr
                    Kidd, he was appointed reader in mineralogy in Oxford; and the interest excited
                    by his lectures was so great that in 1819 a readership in geology was founded
                    and especially endowed by the Treasury, Dr Bucklaud being the first holder of
                    the new appointment. In 1818 Dr Buckland was elected a fellow of the Royal
                    Society, and in 1824 he was chosen president of the Geological Society of
                    London, of which he had long been a fellow. In 1825. he resigned his fellowship
                    at Corpus, and was presented by his college to the living of Stoke Charity, near
                    Whitchurch, Hants, and in the same year he was appointed by Lord Liverpool to a
                    canonry of the cathedral of Christ Church, Oxford. In the same year, also, he
                    married Mary, the eldest daughter of Mr Benjamin Morland of Sheepstead House,
                    near Abingdon, Berks, by whose high intellectual abilities and excellent
                    judgment he was materially assisted in his literary labours. During the
                    succeeding twenty years he laboured diligently in various departments of his
                    favourite science, visiting many interesting localities, both at home and
                    abroad, accumulating extensive collections, and communicating numerous memoirs
                    to learned societies. In 1845 he was apppointed by Sir Robert Peel to the vacant
                    deanery of Westminster, and was soon after inducted to the living of Islip, near
                    Oxford, a preferment attached to the deanery. In 1849 his health began to give
                    way under the increasing pressure of his multifarious duties; and the latter
                    years of his life were overshadowed by a long and serious illness, arising from
                    disease of the base of the skull, which compelled him to live in retirement, to
                    the deep regret of a wide circle of friends and acquaintances. He died 24th
                    August 1856, at the advanced age of seventy-three, and he was buried in a spot
                    which he had himself chosen in Islip churchyard. Dr Buckland was a man
                    many-sided in his abilities, and of a singularly wide range of attainments.
                    Apart from his published works and memoirs in connection with the special
                    department of geology, he accomplished in other directions much that entitles
                    him to remembrance. Few men, indeed, ever more laboriously and consistently
                    devoted a long life to the advancement of the cause of truth and to the benefit
                    of their fellow-men. In addition to the work entailed upon him by the positions
                    which he at different times held in the Church of England, he entered with great
                    enthusiasm into many practical questions connected with agricultural and
                    sanitary science, and various social and even medical problems. As a teacher he
                    possessed powers of the highest order; and the university of Oxford is enriched
                    by the large and valuable private collections, illustrative of geology and
                    mineralogy, which he amassed in the course of his active lite, and which are now
                    known as the “Buckland Museum.” It is, how ever, upon his published scientific
                    works that Dr Buckland’s great reputation is mainly based. His first great w ork
                    was the well known <hi rend="italic">Reliquioe Diluvianoe,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >or Observations on the Organic Remains attesting the Action of a Universal
                    Deluge,</hi> published in 1823, in which he supplemented his former observations
                    on the remains of extinct animals discovered in the cavern of Kirkdale in
                    Yorkshire, and expounded his views as to the bearing of these and similar cases
                    on the Biblical account of the Deluge. Thirteen years after the publication of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Reliquia,,</hi> Dr Buckland was called upon, in accordance
                    with the will of the earl cf Bridgewater, to write one of that remarkable series
                    of works, known as the <hi rend="italic">Bridgewater Treatises.</hi> The design
                    of these treatises was to exhibit the “power, wisdom, and goodness of God, as
                    manifested in the creation,” and none of them was of greater value, as evinced
                    by its vitality, than that on geology and mineralogy. Originally published in
                    1836, it has gone through four editions, and though not a “manual” of geological
                    science, it still possesses a high value as a rich storehouse of geological and
                    palaeontological facts bearing upon the particular argument which it was
                    designed to illustrate, ,-j</p>
