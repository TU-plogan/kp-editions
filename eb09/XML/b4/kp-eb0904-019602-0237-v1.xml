                    learned ecclesiastic, who was chief justiciary in the reign of Henry III. He is
                    supposed to have been born at Bretton-Clovelly in Devonshire. He studied at
                    Oxford, where he took the degree of doctor of laws, and is believed to have
                    delivered lectures in that university. He was appointed a justice itinerant for
                    the counties of Nottingham and Derby in 1245, and his name appears as a
                    justiciary or judge of the Aula Regis on the Fine Rolls in 1249 and in each of
                    the next seventeen years, written indifferently Bratton and Bretton, which
                    circumstance has led Selden and others to attribute to him the authorship of the
                    earliest treatise on the law of England in the French tongue, known as Bretone
                    or Bretoun. In 1254 the king assigned to him by letters patent, in which he was
                    designated “dilectus clericus noster,” the use of a house in London belonging to
                    William late earl of Derby during the minority of the heir, and in 1263 he was
                    collated to the archdeaconry of Barnstaple. This office, however, he resigned in
                    the following year; and in 1265 he was appointed chief justiciary, and held that
                    office until the end of 1267, when all notice of him ceases. He w ’ rote <pb

                    he was appointed chief justiciary, as it contains references to changes in the
                    law made shortly before that time, but takes no notice of the statute of
                    Marlborough passed in 52 Henry III. A Latin abridgment of Bracton’s work was
                    written by Gilbert de Thornton, who was appointed Chief-Justice of the King’s
                    Bench in the 17th year of the reign of Edward I., of which Selden possessed a
                    copy, but no copy of it is at present known to exist. There are numerous MSS.
                    extant of Bracton’s work, but only two editions of it have been printed, the
                    first in folio in 1569, the second in quarto in 1640. The text of these editions
                    is identical, as well as the paging.</p>
