                    archbishop regarding certain points in theology compelled him to leave Rouen. He
                    went to Rome, but did not long remain there; and on his return to France he
                    retired to the college of the Jesuits at Paris, where he spent the rest of his
                    life, studying and writing, and fulfilling with much success his duties as a
                    college lecturer. He seems indeed to have been an admirable teacher, having, as
                    his works show, a great power of lucid and precise exposition. Buffers object in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Traité des vérités premières,</hi> his best known
                    philosophical work, is to discover the ultimate principles upon which all
                    knowledge is based, to lay down “propositions so clear and obvious that they can
                    neither be proved nor refuted by other propositions of greater perspicuity.” The
                    basis of all human knowledge and the foundation of every other truth he finds in
                    the sense we have of our own existence and of what we feel within ourselves. He
                    thus takes as the foundation of his philosophy substantially the same ground as
                    Descartes, <hi rend="italic">cogito</hi><hi rend="italic">ergo sum;</hi> but the
                    superstructure is reared on very different principles. Descartes tried to reach
                    a knowledge of the not-self by an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> or
                    metaphysical proof of the divine existence. Buffer rejects this sort of evidence
                    as useless. I want, he in effect says, to obtain a certain knowledge of what is
                    distinct from myself, and this I can never do by mere metaphysical
                    demonstration, which only gives me the hypothetical certainty of ideas logically
                    connected together; in order to know what exists distinct from myself I must
                    have recourse to “common sense.” Common sense he defines to be “that disposition
                    which nature has placed in all or most men, in order to enable them, when they
                    have arrived at the age and use of reason, to form a common and uniform judgment
                    with respect to objects different from the internal sentiment of their own
                    perception, which judgment is not the consequence of any anterior principle.”
                    The truths which this “disposition of nature” obliges us to accept can neither
                    be proved nor disproved; they are admitted in all countries and at all times;
                    and they are practically followed by all men, even by those who reject them
                    speculatively. But Buffer does not claim for the truths of common sense the same
                    absolute certainty as characterizes either the knowledge we have of our own
                    existence or the logical deductions we make from our thoughts; they possess
                    merely the highest probability, and the man who rejects them is, as he pointedly
                    puts it, to be considered a fool, but he is not in so doing guilty of a
                    contradiction. The greater part of the <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi> is devoted
                    to an enumeration and examination of those truths. They are such as the
                    following :—“There are other beings and other men in the world besides myself;”
                    “All men have not combined to deceive me.” But axioms like <hi rend="italic"
                    >“2</hi> + 2 = 4,” or “the whole is greater than a part” are mere logical
                    connections of ideas, not truths of common sense. Buffer’s aversion to
                    scholastic refinements and unmeaning definitions has not unfrequently given to
                    his writings an appearance of shallowness and want of metaphysical insight; but
                    his merit as one of the earliest to recognize the psychological as distinguished
                    from the metaphysical side of Descartes’s principle, and to use it, with no
                    inconsiderable skill, as the basis of an analysis of the human mind, similar to
                    that enjoined by Locke, will always be acknowledged. In this he has anticipated
                    the spirit and method as well as many of the results of Reid and the Scotch
                    school. The TVaiié appeared in 1717, and was followed in 1724 by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eléments de Métaphysique.</hi> Buffer also wrote a “French Grammar
                    on a new plan,” and a number of historical essays. Most of his works appeared in
                    a collected form iu 1732, and an English translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité</hi> was published in 1780.</p>
