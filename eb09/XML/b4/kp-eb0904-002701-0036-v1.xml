                        Vicomte de,</hi> philosopher and politician, was born at Monna, near
                    Milhaud, in Rouergue, France, on the 2d October 1754. He served for some years
                    in the king’s musketeers, and after his marriage was made mayor of his native
                    place. Dissatisfied with the revolutionary principles then being acted upon, he
                    emigrated in 1791, and joined the army of the Prince of Condé. Soon afterwards
                    he settled, with his family, at Heidelberg, where he wrote his first important
                    work, <hi rend="italic">Théorie du pouvoir</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >politique</hi><hi rend="italic">et religieux dans la Société civile,</hi> 3
                    vols., 1790, in which his conservatism and reactionary views are fully expounded
                    and illustrated. In this work, too, he predicted the certain return of the
                    Bourbons to France. The book was condemned by the Directory, and in Franco very
                    few copies escaped detection. Naturally, on his return to his native country, Μ.
                    de Bonald found himself an object of suspicion, and was obliged to live in
                    retirement. He still continued to publish works of the same tendencies,— his <hi

                        rend="italic">Vordre</hi><hi rend="italic">social</hi> appearing in 1800,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Législation primitive</hi> in 1802, and the treatise <hi

                    after. In 1806 he was associated with Chateaubriand and Fiévée in the conduct of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mercure de France;</hi> and two years later, after great
                    persuasion, he allowed himself to be appointed councillor of the Imperial
                    University, which he had often attacked. After the Restoration he was made
                    member of the Council of Public Instruction, and from 1815 to 1822 he sat in the
                    chamber as deputy. His speeches and votes were invariably on the extreme
                    Conservative side; he even advocated a literary censorship. In 1822 he was made
                    minister of state, and presided over the commission in whose hands the
                    censorship rested. In the following year he was raised to the rank of peer, a
                    dignity which he lost through refusing to take the oath in 1830. From 1816
                    onwards he had been a member of the Academy. He took no part in public affairs
                    after 1830, but retired to his country-seat at Monna, where he died on the 23d
                    November 1840.</p>
                <p>Bonald was one of the most able and vigorous writers of the theocratic or
                    reactionary school, which comprehended among its numbers such men as De Maistre,
                    De Lamennais, Ballanche, and D’Eckstein. The great bulk of his writings belong
                    to the department of social or political philosophy; but all the results at
                    which he arrives are deductions from a few principles. The one truth which to
                    him seemed, in fact, all-comprehensive was the divine origin of language. In his
                    own somewhat enigmatic expression, <hi rend="italic">L’homme pense sa</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">parole</hi><hi rend="italic">avant de parler sa pensée,</hi>
                    words and thoughts are inextricably linked together; the first language
                    contained the essence of all truth. From this premise he draws his proof for the
                    existence of God, and for the divine origin and consequent supreme authority of
                    the Holy Scriptures. The infallibility of the church as the exponent of
                    spiritual truth readily follows. While this thought lies at the root of all his
                    speculations there is a formula of constant and significant application. All
                    relations are by him reduced to the triad of cause, means, and effect, which he
                    sees constantly repeated throughout all nature. Thus, in the universe there are
                    the first cause as mover, movement as the means, and bodies as the result; in
                    the state we have power as the cause, ministers as the means, and subjects as
                    the effects; in the family we have the same relation exemplified by father,
                    mother, and children. It is also to be remarked that these three terms bear
                    specific relations to one another, the first is to the second as the second is
                    to the third. Thus, in the great triad of the religious world,—God, the
                    Mediator, and Man,—God is to the GodMan as the God-Man is to Man. It will be
                    readily apparent how Bonald was able from these principles to construct a
                    complete system of political absolutism, for the sufficiency of which only two
                    things were wanted,—well-grounded premises instead of baseless hypotheses, and
                    the harmony of the scheme with the wills of those who were to be subjected to
                    it. Bonald’s style is remarkably fine; ornate, but pure and vigorous. Many
                    fruitful thoughts are scattered among his works, which have been popular with a
                    certain party; but his system scarcely deserves the name of a philosophy.</p>
                <p>Besides the above-mentioned works, Bonald published <hi rend="italic">Recherches
