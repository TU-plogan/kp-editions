                    the chief seat of the Government of the Deccan provinces of the Mughul empire
                    till Shâh Jahân removed the capital to Aurangâbâd, in 1635. Burhânpur was
                    plundered in 1685 by the Marhattâs, and repeated battles were fought in its
                    neighbourhood in the struggle betweeen that race and the Musalmâns for the
                    supremacy of India. In 1739 the Mahometans finally yielded to the demand of the
                    Marhattâs for a fourth of the revenue, and in 1760 the Nizâm of the Deccan ceded
                    Burhânpur to the Peshwâ, who in 1778 transferred it to Sindhiâ. In the Marhattâ
                    war the army under General Wellesley, afterwards the duke of Wellington, took
                    Burhânpur (1803), but the treaty of the following year restored it to Sindhiâ.
                    It remained a portion of Sindhiâ’s dominions till 1860-61, when, in consequence
                    of certain territorial arrangements, the town and surrounding estates were ceded
                    to the British Government. Under the Mughuls the city covered an area of about 5
                    square miles, and was about 10⅜ miles in circumference. In the “Ain-f-Akbari” it
                    is described as a “large city, with many gardens, inhabited by all nations, and
                    abounding with handicraftsmen.” Sir Thomas Roe, who visited it in 1614, found
                    that the houses in the town were “only mud cottages, except the prince’s house,
                    the chan’s, and some few others.” In 1865-66 the city contained 8000 houses,
                    with a population of 34,137, which had decreased to 29,303 in 1872. Burhânpur is
                    celebrated for its muslins, flowered silks, and brocades, which, according to
                    Tavernier, who visited it in 1668, were exported in great quantities to Persia,
                    Egypt, Turkey, Russia, and Poland. The gold and silver wires used in the
                    manufacture of these fabrics are drawn with considerable care and skill; and in
                    order to secure the purity of the metals employed for their composition, the
                    wire-drawing under the native rule was done under Government inspection. The
                    town of Burhânpur and its manufactures have <pb break="no"

                    interest in the town are a palace, built by Akbar, called the Lâl Kilâ or the
                    Red Fort, and the Jum&lt;4 Masjid built by Aurungzebe. A considerable number of
                    Borâs, a class of commercial Mahometans, reside here. Municipal income of the
                    town in 1872, £3514, 10s.; expenditure, £2321, 12s.</p>
