                    true feeling for art. After attending some private schools, he was sent at the
                    age of fourteen to Paris, to study mathematics, and to recover his knowledge of
                    French. From November 1820 to August 1822 he studied at the Collège Henri
                    Quatre; and in holiday intervals he used to visit the engineering works going on
                    in Paris, and send his father drawings and descriptions of them. In 1823 he
                    entered his father’s office as assistant-engineer, just at the time when the
                    project of the Thames Tunnel began to occupy the attention of Sir Isambard; and
                    from 1825, when the work was begun, till 1828, when it was stopped by an
                    irruption of the river, he displayed a singular energy, inventiveness, and power
                    of application in that struggle of science against natural obstacles on a vast
                    scale. He had even then the power, which distinguished him in later years, of
                    doing almost without sleep for many nights when work was pressing. During the
                    later part of the contest which ended by a second irruption in January 1828, he
                    was both nominal and actual resident engineer of the Thames Tunnel. Left for
                    nearly two years without regular professional occupation, Brunel employed
                    himself in scientific researches, enjoying intercourse with Babbage, Faraday,
                    and other friends. In November 1829 he sent in designs and plans for the
                    projected Suspension Bridge over the Avon at Clifton. In consequence of
                    objections raised by Telford, the referee of the bridge committee, Brunel’s
                    plans were rejected. But on a second competition, early in 1831, he sent in a
                    new design, and this was accepted. Brunel was appointed engineer to the
                    trustees, and the works were begun in 1836. Delay had been caused by want of
                    funds, and from the same cause the works were afterwards suspended for some
                    years, and were not completed during Brunel’s lifetime. In March 1833, Brunel,
                    at the age of twenty-seven, attained one of the highest professional positions
                    by his appointment as engineer of the newly-projected Great Western Railway. For
                    several years his energies were taxed to the utmost by the conflict with
                    obstructive landowners and short-sighted critics; but he showed himself equal to
                    the occasion, not only as a professional man, but as a persuasive negotiator.
                    For solidity of construction and for skill and beauty of design the Great
                    Western Railway, though one of the first made in England, holds a very high
                    place. Among the triumphs of the engineer are the Hanwell Viaduct, the
                    Maidenhead Bridge, and the Box Tunnel, at the time the longest in the world;
                    and, on extensions of the line, the great bridges at Chepstow and Saltash. The
                    noλv notorious “battle of the gauges” took its rise from Brunel’s introduction
                    of the broad gauge on this line. In 1846 he resigned his office as engineer of
                    the Great Western Railway. In 1844 he had recommended the adoption of the
                    Atmospheric System on the South Devon Railway, but after a year’s trial tlιis
                    system was abandoned. The last and greatest of Brunel’s railway works was the
                    Royal Albert Bridge of the Cornwall Railway, crossing the River Tamar' at
                    Saltash. This work, sanctioned by parliament in 1845, was constructed between
                    1853 and 1859. In addition to the arduous labours of railway engineering, Mr
                    Brunel had taken a leading part in the systematic development of ocean steam
                    navigation. As early as October 1835 he had suggested, to the amusement of the
                    directory of the Great Western Railway, that they should “make it longer, and
                    have a steamboat to go from Bristol to New York, and call it the Great Western.”
                    The project was taken up, and the “Great Western” steamship was designed by
                    Brunel, and built at Bristol under his superintendence. It was much longer than
                    any steamer of the day, and was the first steamship built to make regular
                    voyages across the Atlantic. While the vessel was building a controversy was
                    raised about the practicability of Brunei’s scheme, Dr Lardner assarting
                    dogmatically that the voyage could net be made, and backing his assertion with
                    an array of figures. His view was widely accepted, but the work went on, and the
                    voyage was accomplished in 1838. A greater work was at once undertaken, and the
                    “Great Britain” was built. This was the first large iron steamship, the largest
                    ship afloat at that time, and the first large ship in which the screw-propeller
                    was used. She made her first voyage from Liverpool to New York in August and
                    September 1845; but in the following year was carelessly run upon the rocks in
                    Dundrum Bay on the coast of Ireland. After lying there nearly a year without
                    material damage she was got off and was employed in the Australian trade. Brunel
                    soon after began to meditate a vaster project still, the construction of a
                    vessel large enough to carry all the coal required for a long voyage out, and if
                    coal could not be had at the out port, then to carry enough also for the return
                    voyage. It seemed to him, further, that a great increase of size would give many
                    advantages for navigation. During his connection as engineer with the Australian
                    Mail Company he worked out into a practical shape his conception of a “great
                    ship ;” and in 1852 his scheme was laid before the Directors of the Eastern
                    Steam Navigation Company. It was adopted, the projector was appointed their
                    engineer, and after much time occupied about contracts and specifications, the
                    work was begun in December 1853. Immense difficulties in the progress of
                    construction caused delays from time to time. The operations of launching was
                    several times attempted in vain; but at length the gigantic vessel, the now
                    familiar “Great Eastern,” was got afloat (31st January 1858). Much remained to
                    be done to complete the ship; and her engineer, overworked and worn out with the
                    worry of the launching processes, broke down and did not live to see her sail on
                    her first voyage. In addition to the great works already described, Brunel was
                    employed in the construction of many docks and piers. The first of these was the
                    Monkwearmouth Docks, for which he made the designs in 1831. The construction,
                    after a new design, was begun in 1834. He was afterwards engaged in works of the
                    same kind at Bristol, Plymouth, Briton Ferry, and Brentford, and on a pier at
                    Milford Haven. He was a zealous promoter of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and
                    was a member of the committee on the section of machinery and of the building
                    committee. He paid much attention to the subject of improvement of large guns,
                    and designed a floating gun-carriage for the attack on Cronstadt in the Russian
                    war (1854); he also designed and superintended the construction of the hospital
                    buildings at Renkioi, on the Dardanelles (1855). The genius, energy, and
                    industry of Brunel in his profession were not more remarkable than the high
                    moral tone which characterized his whole life, and the fascinating qualities
                    which gave him immense personal influence, and made him the delight of the
                    social circle. With single-hearted truthfulness he devoted himself to his chosen
                    work; he was singularly free from professional jealousy, and was always ready to
                    commend and help others. With robust health, which he enjoyed through many
                    years, he had the two invaluable qualities of good spirits and good temper. In
                    his relations with his subordinates he was considerate and kindly, at the same
                    time that he demanded faithful service according to a high standard. He cared
                    nothing for popularity. He enjoyed <pb break="no"

                    enthusiastic lover of the fine arts. In the course of his busy life he several
                    times went to Italy and Switzerland; and in 1847 he bought a small estate in
                    Devonshire, to make his home there. The pressure of business, however, did not
                    allow him to spend much of his time in the country. In 1830 Brunel was elected
                    F.R.S., and he was afterwards a member of many other scientific societies. In
                    1857 the honorary degree of D.C.L. was conferred on him by the university of
                    Oxford. In July 1836 he married; he left two sons and a daughter surviving him.
                    For the sake of his health he spent the winter of 1858-59 in Egypt, returning to
                    England in May. He was on board his “great ship” on the 5th September 1859, and
                    the same day was attacked with paralysis. The ship sailed on her first voyage on
                    the 7th, and her great projector passed away on the 15th of the month. His
                    remains were interred in Kensal Green Cemetery. In 1870 appeared <hi
