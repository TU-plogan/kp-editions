                    rend="smallcaps">August</hi> (1748-1794), a celebrated German poet, was born on
                    the 1st of January 1748 at Wolmerswende, a village in the principality of
                    Halberstadt, where his father was Lutheran minister. In his childhood he showed
                    little inclination to study; the Bible was the only book which had any
                    attraction for him, and his first attempts in versification were imitations of
                    the Psalms. It is to this first direction of his studies that we are to
                    attribute the Biblical phrases, and the allusions to Christianity, which we find
                    even in his amatory poetry. He was fond of solitude, and indulged in all the
                    romantic sentiments which deserts and the gloom of forests inspire. From the
                    school of Aschersleben, where his maternal grandfather resided, and which he
                    quitted in consequence of receiving a severe chastisement for composing an
                    epigram, he was sent to the institution at Halle. But at neither of these places
                    did he make much progress, having a taste only for the lessons in prosody and
                    versification. In 1764 Bürger, who was intended for the clerical office, began
                    to attend the course of lectures given by the professors of the university.
                    Klotz, a learned classical scholar, admitted him into the select number of the
                    young men whose talents he took a pleasure in cultivating; but this society
                    appears not to have produced the same favourable effect on the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0594-0533"/> moral character of Bürger as on his genius. His
                    conduct prejudiced his grandfather Bauer against him; and it was with difficulty
                    that he obtained from him some further assistance, with permission, in the year
                    1768, to repair to Göttingen to prosecute the study of the law. This change did
                    not make him more regular in his studies; his morals became corrupted; and his
                    grandfather withdrew his protection. Bürger contracted debts; and his situation
                    would have become altogether desperate had not some friends interfered to assist
                    him. An association, memorable in the annals of German literature, and into
                    which Bürger was now admitted, had just been formed at Göttingen; it reckoned
                    among its members Boje, Biester, Sprengel, Hölty, Müller, Voss, the two Counts
                    Stolberg, C. F. Cramer, and Leisewitz. All of these were persons versed in Greek
                    and Roman literature, and at the same time they all idolized Shakespeare.
                    Bürger, in a great measure, owed his style to the enthusiasm which he showed, in
                    common with his literary friends, for our great dramatist. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reliques</hi><hi rend="italic">of Ancient English Poetry,</hi> published about
                    this time by Dr Percy, gave an additional impulse to the direction which his
                    mind had taken, and suggested to him some of his most admired productions. Of
                    all his friends, Boje was the one who exercised the greatest influence over him
                    in the choice and treatment of his subjects; and it is to his severe
                    observations that the poetical stanza of Bürger owes a great part of that
                    elegance and roundness which characterize it. To the same friend he was indebted
                    also for some improvement in his circumstances. On the recommendation of Boje he
                    was appointed to the collectorship of Altengleichen, in the principality of
                    Calenberg. The following winter, some fragments of a ghost story, which he heard
                    a peasant girl singing by moonlight, caught his imagination, and suggested his
                    celebrated ballad of <hi rend="italic">Leonora.</hi> This remarkable production
                    at once established his reputation as a poet. About this time he married a
                    Hanoverian lady, named Leonhart; but this union proved only a source of
                    bitterness, as an unhappy attachment to her younger sister soon after sprung up
                    in his heart. The loss of a sum of money, of which his grandfather had made him
                    a present, was the first commencement of his embarrassments; the taking of a
                    large farm, which he did not know how to manage, increased them. The dismissal
                    from his place, in 1784, in consequence of suspicions (probably ill-founded)
                    raised against the fidelity of his accounts, gave the finishing stroke to his
                    misfortunes. He had a little before lost his wife, whose death was hastened by
                    the culpable passion which Bürger cherished in his heart. Left with two
                    children, and reduced to the inconsiderable emoluments of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Almanack of the Muses,</hi> which he had edited since 1779, he removed to
                    Göttingen with a view to giving private lessons there, and in the hope of
                    obtaining a professor’s chair in the department of belles-lettres. Five years
                    later the title was conferred on him, but without a salary; and this was the
                    only public recompense obtained during his whole life by a man who was one of
                    the favourite authors of his nation, and who, while yet young, had achieved the
                    highest reputation. Scarcely were the ashes of his wife cold when he espoused
                    her sister, whose name his poems have made but too famous. She died in childbed
                    in the beginning of 1786. From that moment his own life only lingered on; and
                    the fire of his genius seemed extinguished with the passion which had so long
                    nourished it. He had scarcely strength enough, in the intervals of his
                    dejection, to fi nish his <hi rend="italic">Song of Songs,</hi> a sort «f
                    dithyrambic or nuptial hymn, intended to celebrate his second marriage, and
                    which is a strange mixture of frantic passion, religious devotion, and the most
                    bombastic expression. It was the last production of Bürger.</p>
                <p>Having studied the philosophy of Kant, he had an idea of deriving some aαvantage
                    from it at Göttingen, where it had not yet been taught. He undertook to explain
                    it in a course of lectures, which were attended by a great number of students .
                    The satisfaction which the university expressed to him for two cantatas which he
                    composed in 1787, on the occasion of the fifty years’ jubilee of this
                    illustrious institution, and his appointment to the situation of professor
                    extraordinary, reanimated his spirits. Fortune appearing to smile on him once
                    more, he formed the design of marrying again. During one of the moments when he
                    was most occupied with this idea he received a letter from Stuttgart, in which a
                    young woman, whose style indicated a cultivated mind, and her sentiments an
                    elevated and feeling heart, after describing to him with enthusiasm the
                    impression which his poetry had made upon her, offered him her hand and heart.
                    The information which he received respecting the character, the fortune, and
                    personal accomplishments of his correspondent having excited his curiosity, he
                    took a journey to Stuttgard, and brought back with him a wife who embittered and
                    dishonoured the rest of his days. In less than three years he saw himself under
                    the necessity of obtaining a divorce from her; and the ruin of his health
                    aggravated the absolute disorder of his finances. Confined to a small chamber,
                    the favourite poet of Germany wasted the remainder of his strength in
                    translations for foreign booksellers; but sickness and grief soon deprived him
                    even of this resource, and he must have died in a state of the most abject
                    poverty if the Government of Hanover had not relieved his necessities. He died
                    June 8, 1794, in the forty-seventh year of his age.</p>
                <p>Bürger is only remarkable as a lyric poet <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> after
                    having tried all the different species of this class of compositions, he has
                    succeeded eminently only in the song and the ballad. We shall perhaps
                    characterize his genius sufficiently by saying that his imagination is more
                    fresh than rich,—that he has more sensibility than elevation, more naïveté and
                    good nature than delicacy or taste. His style is striking from its clearness and
                    its energy, and an elegance which is rather the result of labour than of natural
                    grace; he possesses, in short, all the qualities which please the multitude.
                    Allowing the title of poet only to those whose writings were calculated to
                    become popular, he early habituated himself to reject whatever appeared to him
                    not sufficiently intelligible and interesting to all classes of readers. He is
                    always clear and forcible; and if at certain times there appears a want of
                    selection and care in the details, yet the sentiments are uniformly noble, and
                    the moral purpose of the majority of his pieces is irreproachable. Of the first
                    three editions of Bürger’s works, published at Göttingen, two appeared in 1778
                    and 1789, in 3 vols. 8vo; and the third, after his death, was published by his
                    friend Ch. Reinhard, in 4 vols., 1796. Later editions of his poems are very
                    numerous.</p>
