                    for his piety, whose instructions in divinity seem to have been somewhat
                    distasteful, if we are to accept the pupil’s account of the dreary studies he
                    was compelled to engage in. At an early age he was sent to Eton, where he
                    appears to have been a school-fellow, though hardly a rival, of Walpole, and
                    then proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford. The life he led at the university was
                    typical of his later career. His brilliant talents and unusually retentive
                    memory enabled him to amass an immense amount of information—more, indeed, than
                    he was given credit for; while at the same time he began to <pb break="no"

                    dissipation and licentiousness. He was the Rochester of the period, with more
                    than Rochester’s abilities. He sought and gained the fame of a modern Alcibiades
                    or Petronius. Amidst all his excesses, however, he maintained a real interest in
                    literature. He was intimate with Dryden, and prefixed a laudatory poem to the
                    first edition of the translation of VirgiL The verses did not hold out high
                    promise of poetic power; and his later efforts in the same direction did little
                    for his literary reputation His most considerable production, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almahide, an Ode,</hi> is a miserable tawdry affair; the light ode to the
                    equally light <hi rend="italic">Clara</hi> is very much better, and has some
                    vivacity and sparkle. He seems to have been conscious of his want of poetic
                    genius, for his verse remains are not numerous.</p>
                <p>For two years, from 1698 to 1700, he resided on the Continent, and during that
                    time acquired the thorough mastery of the French language which was afterwards
                    of so much service to him. On his return his friends, in the hope of withdrawing
                    him to some extent from his loose mode of life, negotiated a marriage with the
                    wealthy daughter of Sir Henry Winchescomb, a baronet of Berkshire. Marriage,
                    however, effected little or no change in St Johu, and, though his wife never
                    formally separated from him, and always retained a true affection for her
                    husband, their married life was unhappy and divided. In February of the year
                    following he entered Parliament as member for Wootton-Basset</p>
                <p>The Tory party, from a combination of circumstances, were then all-powerful in
                    the House of Commons. The Partition Treaty, a measure for which, indeed, little
                    can be said, had not met with popular favour, while William’s large grants to
                    foreigners, together with the general coldness and repulsiveness of his manners,
                    had rendered him most unpopular. A perfect storm of discontent had arisen, and
                    the Tories were nearly bewildered with the power which had been suddenly placed
                    in their hands. Harley, perhaps, at that time, from his moderation, the most
                    influential man of the party, led the House as speaker. St John enrolled himself
                    among the Tories with the utmost enthusiasm, and from the first displayed such
                    brilliant powers as placed him at once in the front rank, and gave him an almost
                    unique position. His youth and high birth, his handsome and commanding presence,
                    and his agreeable address, no doubt contributed largely to his rapid elevation;
                    but what above all secured for him an unequalled success was his wonderful
                    eloquence. The powers he unexpectedly evinced as an orator and debater were
                    unrivalled then, and, if we are to take contemporary reports as our authority,
                    had never been equalled, and have seldom, if ever, been surpassed. Not a
                    fragment of his many speeches has come down to us; but from the criticisms of
                    those who heard him speak, and from his published writings, some idea of their
                    general quality may be gathered. The most prominent characteristics seem to have
                    been copiousness and readiness, extreme fluency, and spontaneity, combined with
                    a brilliant felicity of phrase, the right expression seeming to spring up
                    naturally along with the thought to be expressed. His sentences are mostly
                    massive aud balanced, yet never heavy; flowing, but rarely redundant. He is,
                    perhaps, the first British statesman whose parliamentary oratory has been really
                    a power; and with such splendid qualifications it was little wonder that he
                    readily became the protagonist of the Tory party. He was their mouthpiece; he
                    gave expression to their half-articulate wishes, hounded them on in their insane
                    attacks on the great Whig leaders, and barbed their invectives with his own
                    trenchant wit. But, as he has himself admitted, it would be difficult to
                    discover what object the Tories really had in view. Their only desire seems to
                    have been to revenge themselves upon their political opponencs and indirectly to
                    assail the king. A definite policy they had not either at that time or
                    throughout the succeeding reign. The Whigs had so far a basis of operations;
                    they held by the Protestant succession, and were in favour of a war with France.
                    The Tories, who, if thoroughgoing, were really Jacobites, were averse to the
                    French war, because it indirectly weakened their party, and they did not favour
                    the succession. But consistent adherence to principle is a thing one looks for
                    in vain among the majority of statesmen in the reign of Anne. There never was a
                    time in British history when the movements of politicians were regulated by such
                    petty causes, and when great talents had to be turned to such paltry purposes.
                    Politics became but a grand game, in which success meant office, power, wealth,
                    and dignity; and to secure such success few hesitated at the most dishonourable
                    means. Treason was a thing of common occurrence, and many names among the
                    highest in English history are tarnished by acts of grossest treachery.
                    Bolingbroke participates to the full in the spirit of his time. Never throughout
                    his whole career can one observe the operation of a consistent policy, or trace
                    the action of any motive higher than personal ambition. Mentally and morally he
                    was well qualified to take a prominent place in the political struggle of the
                    time.</p>
                <p>The rush of popular favour to the Tory party was checked by Louis’s
                    acknowledgment of the Pretender as legitimate king of England. There was no
                    opposition made to the proposed war, which was not interrupted by the death of
                    William and the accession of Anne. Godolphin and Marlborough, both moderate
                    Tories, were strongly in favour of the war, and consequently found themselves
                    gradually drawn into harmony with the Whigs rather than with the extreme members
                    of their own party. Several of the latter were removed from the cabinet, and
                    among the new officials were Harley, and, curiously enough, St John, the former
                    being made Secretary of State, the latter Secretary at War. It has been doubted
                    to what influence St John owed this singular promotion. Harley’s power was
                    hardly great enough to effect it, and it is more than probable that it was in
                    great part, if not entirely, the work of Marlborough, who had a very
                    considerable affection and respect for St John; and who doubtless desired a
                    friend of his to fill the office with which he had so many transactions. As
                    secretary St John discharged his duties with great efficiency, and manifested
                    the most enthusiastic admiration for Marlborough’s military genius and success.
                    Meantime Harley had been tampering with the secret springs which moved so much
                    of the political machinery. His relative Mrs Masham was supplanting the
                    imperious duchess of Marlborough, and through her influence the queen was <hi
                    rend="subscript">;</hi>. becoming convinced that the interests of the nation
                    should be confided to Harley and the Tories. She was ready to dismiss Godolphin
                    at the first opportunity, but the Whigs were as yet too strong, and Harley’s
                    schemes having been discovered, he was in 1708 compelled to resign. St John, who
                    can hardly be thought tohavehad no cognizance of what was afoot, resigned along
                    with him, and spent two years in philosophical retirement, studying diligently
                    and living loosely as before. During these years a gradual undercurrent of
                    feeling swelled up against the Whig party. The war was distasteful, and its
                    prolongation was looked upon as altogether the work of Marlborough. Above all,
                    the queen was thoroughly alienated from her old friend and under the influence
                    of Mrs Masham. Yet the strength of the Whig party might have enabled them to
                    carry through their policy successfully had not an act of suicidal imprudence
                    completely ruined them. The prosecution of Sacheverell was the signal for a
                    perfect storm of insanely loyal feeling throughout the country. A Tory ministry
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n15/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0015-0006"/> would evidently meet with popular approval, and
                    Anne had therefore no hesitation in dismissing Godolphin and the Whigs. Harley
                    became Chancellor of the Exchequer and virtually premier, St John was made
                    Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>The political problem, how, under all contingencies, to retain power, was
                    somewhat complicated. The queen’s health made the succession the main question.
                    Now, the accession of the Elector meant the restoration of the Whigs to power It
                    was hardly possible for the Tory leaders to oust the Whig party from the graces
                    of the House of Hanover, with whom their policy was so knit up. Prudence,
                    therefore, as well as principle, made them lean towards the exiled House of
                    Stuart, and for a time extreme Tory was synonymous with Jacobite. But the hopes
                    of James to a great extent depended on the assistance of France, and
                    consequently peace with France became their primary object To attain it they
                    were urged also by the loudly expressed wishes of a large section of the people,
                    and by their hatred of the Whigs, with whom the war was identified. Active steps
                    in the matter were taken mainly by St John, and in the beginning of 1712 he had
                    at last brought affairs to such a pass that the duke of Ormond, who had
                    superseded Marlborough, received secret orders not to attack the French, while
                    private intimation of this order was sent to the French Government. Arrangements
                    were then made with the French minister De Torcy, whereby the fundamental
                    articles of the league with the allies were broken, Britain engaging to enter
                    into a separate peace with France, receiving certain special advantages, and
                    quietly abandoning some of the allies, as the Catalans. Nothing can possibly
                    extenuate the baseness of these proceedings, and our judgment of them cannot be
                    altered by our opinion as to the advisability of the peace. The Whig party were
                    wholly unable to throw any obstacles in the way; their majority in the House of
                    Lords had been swamped by the creation of twelve new peers; and Walpole had been
                    impeached on a petty charge and committed to the Tower. Finally, St John, now
                    Viscount Bolingbroke, visited Paris to push on negotiations so that peace might
                    be announced to next Parliament It has been said, though he himself denied it,
                    that during this visit he had interviews with the Pretender In April 1713&gt;the
                    famous treaty of Utrecht was signed, and the Parliament of that year had the
                    articles read to them. This, however, had not the effect anticipated by
                    Bolingbroke There was a lurking feeling of discontent with regard to it, and the
                    commercial articles, bearing on trade with France, excited great indignation
                    among the mercantile classes.</p>
                <p>Bolingbroke and the Tories seemed, however, to be at the zenith of their power;
                    but the foundations of that power were unstable, and there waa dissension among
                    the leaders. Harley had become earl of Oxford, and Bolingbroke was indignant at
                    receiving only the rank of viscount His anger was increased on failing to
                    receive the garter vacant by the death of Godolphin. The disputes between the
                    former allies became oper and violent. By unscrupulous bribery Bolingbroke
                    managed to secure the interest of Mrs Masham, and through her wrought upon the
                    queen. In the Parliament of 1714 he dealt the deathblow to Oxford’s power, by
                    compelling him to vote upon the Schism Bill; and finally, on the 27th July,
                    after a stormy discussion, which greatly excited the queen, Oxford was
                    dismissed. Bolingbroke, however, had but a brief taste of power, for on the 30th
                    the queen was seized with apoplexy. At the council held upon the emergency the
                    dukes of Argyle and Somerset boldly presented themselves, and proposed and
                    carried a resolution that the duke of Shrewsbury should be recommended as Lord
                    Treasurer. Bolingbroko was obliged to yield. Anne was able to give assent; the
                    Whig party had already made all their arrangements, and immediately on the
                    queen’s death (August 1) the Elector was proclaimed king, and special messengers
                    were despatched to bring him over. Bolingbroke and his friends seemed
                    bewildered; they were, indeed, thoroughly taken by surprise, and their
                    half-formed schemes disconcerted. Atterbury alone urged Bolingbroke boldly to
                    proclaim James, but either the courage of the latter failed, or, as is more
                    probable, his intentions were not sufficiently definite. It is not an
                    unreasonable supposition that, had a fair time been granted to him, he would
                    have endeavoured to make favour with the House of Hanover. Any such hope was
                    then out of the question; the duties of his office were transferred temporarily
                    to Addison, and within the month in which the queen died he was formally
                    dismissed. It was soon known that the new Parliament, who were mainly Whigs,
                    intende«? to impeach Oxford and Bolingbroke for their share in the ιecent peace.
                    From what we now know of the actual accusation, it is plain that it did not
                    amount to high treason. Had there been nothing further it would have been the
                    best plan to have stayed and faced the trial. This, accordingly, was done by
                    Oxford; but Bolingbroke, after showing himself ostentatiously in public, fled
                    over to France in disguise, even before the impeachment had been made in the
                    House. In the letter he left behind him for Lord Lansdowne he gives as his
                    excuse that he had certain and repeated informations from some who were in the
                    secret of affairs that a resolution was taken to pursue him to the scaffold. In
                    the famous letter to Sir Wm. Windham he takes somewhat different ground, and
                    accounts for his flight from his intense dislike of Oxford, and his resolution
                    not to be associated with him in any way. It was not till the 10th June that he
                    was formally impeached; on 6th August he was attainted and summoned to appear
                    before the 10th September. On the 16th September, he not having made his
                    appearance, his name was struck off the list of peers, and sentence of
                    banishment was passed. Long before this, however, Bolingbroke had thrown in his
                    lot with the Pretender. He had secret interviews with the duke of Berwick
                    immediately after his arrival in Paris, while professing the most loyal
                    sentiments to Lord Stair, the British ambassador, and in the month of July he
                    was formally installed as Secretary of State to the prince. Whatever plans he
                    might have hoped to carry through in this capacity were thoroughly thwarted by
                    the numberless irregular agents and advisers who swarmed about the petty court,
                    and by the impracticable disposition of the prince himself. The expedition to
                    Scotland, undertaken against Bolingbroke’s advice, proved a complete failure;
                    and in February 1716 he was dismissed with scant ceremony from the prince’s
                    service, while a formal impeachment was drawn up, accusing him of dilatoriness
                    and want of energy. Rumour was busy with his name, and every species of
                    treachery was imputed to him. The celebrated letter to Sir Wm. Windham, in many
                    respects the best of his writings, was drawn up in the following year, and
                    contains an elaborate sketch of the events of his political career and a
                    justification of his proceedings. The letter may have been circulated to a
                    slight extent in print or in manuscript, but it was undoubtedly not made public
                    till 1753, two years after Bolingbroke’s death. It is a skilful piece of work,
                    written with great apparent candour, but inconsistent with known facts, and
                    throwing no satisfactory light on the complicated transactions in which the
                    writer had been involved.</p>

                    unavailing, and from this time onwards to his death he led a life of enforced

                    though he incessantly hovered round the outskirts, he was unable to effect an
                    entrance. He plunged deeply into philosophical <pb break="no"

                    believe that he had thoroughly and voluntarily resigned himself to a life of
                    studious retirement. He took up his abode at La Source, and in 1720, two years
                    after the death of his first wife, married the Marquise de Villette, for whom he
                    seems to have had a sincere affection. In 1723, by bribing the duchess of
                    Kendal, a removal of part of his sentence was attained; he was permitted to
                    return to England, and, by a special bill, passed two years later, was allowed
                    to enjoy his first wife’s property. He bought a magnificent estate at Dawley;
                    and, while keeping up the appearance of single-minded devotion to study, plunged
                    eagerly into as much of political intrigue as was open to him. He had tried in
                    vain to conciliate Walpole, and seems to have seen that during that minister’s
                    tenure of power he could never recover his position. He accordingly united
                    himself to the dissatisfied section of the Whigs led by Pulteney, and tried to
                    organize out of them and the remnant of the Tories an opposition to Walpole. His
                    aid was lent not only in preparing speeches for Windham, Pulteney, and others,
                    who for a time were little more than his mouthpieces, but in written attacks
                    upon the minister. His papers in the <hi rend="italic">Craftsman,</hi> which
                    gave that journal a circulation exceeding even that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spectator,</hi> are masterpieces of vigorous English. In their collected form
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on Parties</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oldcastle's Remarks on History,</hi> they are valuable contributions to our
                    knowledge of the political movements of the period. At one time, indeed, it
                    seemed that the opposition would succeed in driving Walpole from the field. The
                    outcry against his Excise Bill was strong, and his majority in the House was
                    seriously diminished, but he was too firmly rooted to be easily moved; and in
                    1735 he retaliated on Bolingbroke by a significant and threatening speech. So
                    evident was it that he had obtained an insight into intrigues which could not
                    stand investigation, that Bolingbroke took alarm and a second time fled to
                    France. Other motives, such as pecuniary embarrassments, may have contributed to
                    force him to this step, and there can be little doubt that his reputation was of
                    a nature seriously to damage any party with whom he united. He found that
                    Pulteney was anxious to get rid of him, and felt with some bitterness that, like
                    an old actor, he must retire from the political stage before being hissed off.
                    After this second retreat he settled at Chanteloup, in Touraine, whence he paid
                    two or three visits to England. Finally, in 1743, after the death of his father,
                    he took up his residence at Battersea, and, finding the new statesmen little
                    disposed to hearken even to his counsels, endeavoured to devote himself entirely
                    to philosophy. He died at Battersea on the 12th December 1751.</p>
                <p>Of Bolingbroke as an author but little can be said. The question asked a very few
                    years after his death, “Who now reads Bolingbroke Î” may be put with tenfold
                    significance now. The influence of his writings on English literature has been
                    quite inappreciable, and probably the works of few men of such ability have been
                    so little read. Yet this neglect is in some respects undeserved. His writings
                    may be regarded in two aspects,—as specimens of English prose, and as positive
                    contributions to history,' politics, and philosophy. In the latter aspect their
                    worth is indeed small. His historical treatises, while containing much that is
                    of interest and importance, are over-weighted by the constant reference to the
                    peace of Utrecht, the defence of which is almost their sole object. It would be
                    difficult to extract from the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on Parties,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Idea of a P'atriot King,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letters on Patriotism</hi> anything like a consistent philosophy of government.
                    No one has expounded better than Bolingbroke the fundamental principles of Whig
                    policy, and yet his ideal of a king is a sovereign who, from various qualities,
                    is able to retain nearly absolute power, and to govern without the intervention
                    of party spirit. In philosophy he occupies but a subordinate place in the long
                    line of English writers who drew their inspiration from Locke, and who gave the
                    key-note to the religious enlightenment of the 18th century. He is a deist, and
                    from the basis of the sensational theory of knowledge attacks revealed religion
                    with force quite inferior to Toland or TindaL Bolingbroke's philosophical works
                    are indeed insufferably wearisome, and it is only iu them that his style ever
                    flags and grows cumbersome, for his other writings are in many respects the
                    perfection of English prose style, and can stand comparison even with the
                    finished compositions of Addison. For ease, grace, and oratorical vehemence and
                    energy, the <hi rend="italic">Letter to Sir Wm. Windham</hi> and the dedication
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on Parties</hi> are nearly unsurpassed.
                    Bolingbroke clearly was at his best when roused by strong feeling, and his most
                    vigorous passages are those which would naturally have been spoken. That none of
                    his parliamentary orations have come down to us is matter of deepest regret,
                    even though our estimate of them be lower than Pitt’s.</p>
