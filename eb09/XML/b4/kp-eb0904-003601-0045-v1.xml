                            de</hi></label>, a celebrated French adventurer, known also as Achιnet
                    Pasha, was the descendant of au old family of Limousin. He was born on the 14th
                    July 1675 at Coussac, and at the age of thirteen joined the Royal Marine Corps.
                    After three years he entered the Guards, whence he was transferred to the
                    infantry regiment of Latour He served in the Italian campaigns under Catinat,
                    Villeroi, and Vendome, and in the Netherlands under Luxembourg, giving proofs of
                    iudomitable courage and great military ability. His insolent bearing towards
                    Chamillard, minister of war, was made matter for a court-martial. He was
                    condemned to death, but haviug foreseen this sentence, he saved himself by
                    flight to Germany. Through the influence of Prince Eugene he obtained a command
                    in the Austrian army, and fought with great bravery and distinction against
                    France, and afterwards against Turkey. He was severely wounded at Peterwardein,
                    and after his recovery paid a visit to Paris. The proceedings against him in
                    France had been allowed to drop, and he married a daughter of Marshal de Biron,
                    whom, however, he deserted after a week or two. He returned again to the
                    Austrian army, and fought with distinction at Belgrade. He might now have risen
                    to the highest rank, had he not made himself disagreeable to Prince Eugene, who
                    sent him as master of the ordnance to the Low Countries There his ungovernable
                    temper led him into a quarrel with the Marquis de Prié, governor of the
                    Netherlands, who answered his challenge by placing him in confinement. A
                    court-martial was again held upon him, and he was condemned to death; but the
                    emperor commuted the sentence to one year’s imprisonment and banishment from the
                    imperial domains. Bonueval, soon after his release, offered his services to the
                    Turkish Government, professed the Mahometan faith, and took the name of Achmet.
                    He was made a pasha of three tails, and appointed to the command of the
                    artillery. He rendered valuable sevices to the sultan in his war with Russia,
                    and with the famous Kouli Khan. As a reward he received the governorship of
                    Chios, but soon fell under the suspicion of the Porte, and was banished for a
                    time to the shores of the Black Sea. He was meditating a return to Europe and
                    Christianity when he died at Constantinople, 27th March 1747. The <hi
