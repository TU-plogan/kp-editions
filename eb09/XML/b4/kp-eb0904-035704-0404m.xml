                    1722. He was educated at Ballytore, in Ireland, studied medicine at Edinburgh,
                    and finally graduated at Leyden in 1745. In 1751 he was admitted a licentiate of
                    the Royal College of Physicians at London, of which he afterwards became a
                    fellow. In 1758 he was appointed physician to the army, in which capacity he
                    served in Germany during the greater part of the Seven Years’ War, and in the
                    course of it was chosen physician to the hospitals for British forces. The
                    results of his observation's during this period were published in 1764, under

                    appeared in 1749, and his <hi rend="italic">Oratio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >IIarveiana in</hi> 1760. Shortly after this he was appointed by the duke of
                    Richmond physician-general to the royal regiment of artillery and corps of
                    engineers, an appointment that gave him constant access to the laboratory of
                    Woolwich, and it was by his advice that a professorship of chemistry was added
                    to the establishment of the college. In his latter years he withdrew altogether
                    into private life. The circle of his friends included some of the most
                    distinguished literary men of the age. His intimacy with Burke had commenced at
                    school, and soon ripened into the warmest friendship. He was also warmly
                    attached to Dr Johnson, to whom he offered an annuity of £100 during the
                    remainder of his life to enable him to visit the Continent for the recovery of
                    his health; and when this offer was declined, he pressed him to reside in his
                    house, as more suited to his health than that in which he then lived. He
                    attended the great moralist on his deathbed. The same generous disposition was
                    manifested in his conduct to Burke, to whom he presented £1000, a sum he had
                    intended to leave him by will. Dr Brocklesby died suddenly 11th December 1797.
                    He left his entire fortune, with the exception of a few legacies, to his two
                    nephews, Dr Thomas Young and Mr Beeby.</p>
