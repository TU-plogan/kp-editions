                <p><label type="entry">BROWN, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, the founder of
                    the Brunonian theory of physic, was born in 1735 at Lintlaws or at Preston,
                    Berwickshire. He was originally destined for the employment of a weaver, but the
                    boy’s talents attracted the attention of his schoolmaster, through whose
                    endeavours his parents were encouraged to allow him to begin study for the
                    church. At the age of twenty he came to Edinburgh and entered the classes at the
                    university, supporting himself by private tuition. In 1759 he seems to have
                    discontinued his theological studies, and to have begun the study of medicine.
                    He soon attracted the notice of Dr Cullen, who engaged him as private tutor to
                    his family, and treated him in some respects as an assistant professor. Brown,
                    however, thought that Cullen did not advance his candidature for a vacant chair,
                    and the friendship between the two was soon completely broken. In 1780 appeared
                    the <hi rend="italic">Elementa</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicinoe,</hi> expounding
                    the new, or as it was then called the Brunonian, theory of medicine. The
                    fundamental idea of this theory was the division of diseases into two classes,
                    sthenic and asthenic, the one caused by excess, the other by deficiency of
                    excitement, and the consequent method of treatment by debilitating or
                    stimulating medicines. That Brown’s ideas should have excited the discussion
                    they did seems now incredible. Shortly after the publication he obtained the
                    degree of M.D. at St Andrews, and in 1786 he set out for London in the hope of
                    bettering his fortunes. He died of apoplexy in October 1788. A <hi rend="italic"

                    with notice of his life by his son, W. C. Brown, appeared in 1804.</p>
