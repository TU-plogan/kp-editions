                    invasion of Julius Caesar, 55 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Caesar is the first
                    Roman writer who mentions Britain; before him we have only a few short notices
                    in Greek writers, who appear to have known but little about the country. The
                    earliest notice of Britain is in Herodotus (450 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi>
                    who mentions the <hi rend="italic">Tin Islands,</hi> only to confess his
                    ignorance about them. By the Tin Islands are probably to be understood only the
                    Scilly Isles and Cornwall, which are said to have been known to Phoenician
                    traders some centuries before the Christian era.</p>
                <p>More important is a passage in Aristotle, who, writing a century later than
                    Herodotus, is the earliest writer who mentions the British Isles by name. The
                    passage is in the <hi rend="italic">De Mundo,</hi> c. 3,—“Beyond the pillars of
                    Hercules (Straits of Gibraltar) the ocean flows round the earth, and in it are
                    two very large islands called British (∕3pεταιακα'ι λεγόμεναι), Albion and
                    lerne, lying beyond the Keltoi.” The application of the name Britannia, to
                    denote the larger island, is first found in Caesar.</p>
                <p>The etymology of the name Britannia is uncertain. Of the numerous derivations
                    which have been proposed the most generally adopted is that which connects the
                    word with a root <hi rend="italic">brith</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(variegatus),</hi> in supposed allusion to the British practice of staining the
                    body with woad; but this is not to be considered as perfectly satisfactory.</p>
                <p>The earliest inhabitants of Britain concerning whom we have any certain knowledge
                    are the Celts, who formed the vanguard in the great westward migration of the
                    Indo-European or Aryan nations; but it seems certain, from the evidence of
                    remains found in the country, that the Celts were preceded in their occupation
                    of it by a non-Aryan race.</p>
                <p>The Celtic family is divided into two branches—the Gaelic and the Cymric. To the
                    former belong the Irish and the Highlanders of Scotland, to the latter the Welsh
                    and the inhabitants of Britanny, and to these may be added the ancient Gauls,
                    the remains of whose language seem to prove without doubt that they belonged to
                    the Cymric and not to the Gaelic branch.</p>
                <p>Of the Celtic inhabitants of Britain nothing is known before the time of Caesar,
                    whose account of them is the earliest which w e possess. Somewhat abridged it is
                    as follows:—</p>
                <p>“The interior of Britain is inhabited by a race said to be aboriginal, the coast
                    by invaders from Belgium, who having come over for the sake of spoil have
                    settled in the country. For money they use either copper or pieces of iron of a
                    certain weight. Tin is found in the interior of the country; iron on the coasts,
                    but the quantity is small; copper is imported. The timber is of the same kinds
                    as in Gaul, except the beech and the fir. The climate is more temperate than in
                    Gaul, the cold being less severe.”</p>
                <p>After a short geographical description of the island, Caesar proceeds to speak of
                    the inhabitants—</p>
                <p>“By far the most civilized are the inhabitants of Cantium (Kent); they do not
                    differ much in their customs from the Gauls. Tho inhabitants of the interior do
                    not for the most part sow com, but live on milk and flesh, and clothe themselves
                    with skins. All the Britons stain themselves with woad, which produces a blue
                    colour, and gives them a more formidable appearance in battle. They wear their
                    hair long, and shave every part of the body except the head and the upper lip.
                    Ten or twelve have wives in common. (Caes., <hi rend="italic">B. G.</hi> V.
                    12-14).</p>
                <p>Nothing is here said as to the religion of the Britons; and we are obliged to
                    turn for information on this head to Caesar’s account of Druidism in Gaul. We
                    are justified in so doing by Caesar’s statement that the religious system of the
                    Gauls was devised in Britain, and that it was still the custom for those who
                    wished to become thoroughly versed in it to go thither for the sake of
                    instruction, Having said that besides the common people, who are of no account
                    and are little better than slaves, there are in Gaul two orders,— the Druids and
                    the Knights,—Caesar goes on to give an account of the former—</p>
                <p>“The Druids are engaged in matters of religion, and have the care of public and
                    private sacrifices. They are the arbiters in almost all disputes, public and
                    private, and assign rewards and punishments. λVhoever refuses to abide by their
                    decision is excluded from the sacrifices, and thereby put outside the pale of
                    the law.</p>
                <p>“The Druids are exempt from military service, and from the payment of taxes.
                    Their chief doctrine is that souls do not perish with their bodies, but are
                    transferred after death to other bodies.”— <hi rend="italic">(B. G.,</hi> vi.
                    13-14.)</p>
                <p>These are the leading points of Caesar’s short account of the Druids, which is
                    the earliest we possess, and is the main foundation on which has been raised the
                    elaborate Druidic system of later writers.</p>
                <p>Politically, Britain consisted of a number of independent tribes united in a
                    federation of the loosest kind, in which the lead was taken by the tribe which
                    happened at any time to be the most powerful.</p>
                <p>The Britons appear to have kept up a tolerably close intercourse with the
                    Continent. They are first mentioned by Caesar as sending aid to the Veneti (a
                    Gaulish tribe whose name is preserved in that of the present town of Vannes), in
                    their revolt against the Roman power. This was in 56 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.;</hi> and in the following year Caesar resolved on an invasion of Britain,
                    partly influenced, no doubt, by the desire of taking vengeance for the help
                    afforded by the Britons to his enemies the Veneti. C. Volusenus having been
                    previously sent to examine the British coast, Caesar himself set sail from
                    Portus Itius (probably Wissant, between Boulogne and Calais) on the night of the
                    26th of August 55 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> taking with him two legions.
                    The opposite coast was reached early on the morning of the following day, and
                    after a sharp struggle a landing was effected apparently somewhere near Deal.
                    Slight resistance was now offered by the Britons, to whom peace was granted on
                    easy terms, and the Romans hastened back to Gaul.</p>
                <p>Early in the following summer Caesar again started from Portus Itius, this time
                    with a force of five legions and a corresponding body of 2000 cavalry, and
                    landed on the coast of Britain at the same place as in the previous year.
                    Leaving a small force to protect the ships he advanced twelve miles inland to
                    the River Stour before meeting with the enemy. Cassivellaunus, chief of the
                    country to the north of the Thames, had been chosen by the Britons as their
                    general-in-chief, and under his command they for a time presented a fierce
                    resistance to the invaders, but they were unable to withstand the steady onset
                    of the Romans, and Caesar soon reached and took by storm Cassivellaunus’s
                    capital. The site of this city is now unknown, but it has been <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n400/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0400-0353"/> conjectured with some probability to have been
                    Verulamium (St Albans). Cassivellaunus now sued for peace, and after receiving
                    hostages and fixing the amount of the tribute Caesar left the country before the
                    end of the summer. No garrison was left behind to secure the Roman conquests,
                    which were thus practically relinquished. For nearly a hundred years after this
                    date the history of Britain is almost a blank. The Emperor Claudius, on his
                    accession to the empire in 41 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> determined to
                    carry out Augustus’s intention of exacting the* British tribute; accordingly (43
                    A.D.) Aulus Plautius was sent to Britain with a force of four legions, and
                    having landed without opposition, he advanced to the northern side of the
                    Thames, and there awaited the emperor’s arrival. Plautius was soon joined by
                    Claudius, who at once led his army against the Britons, over whom he gained a
                    complete victory, immediately after which he returned to Rome, leaving Plautius
                    to secure his conquests.</p>
                <p>The war was now carried on in the west between the Roman general Vespasian, who
                    afterwards became emperor, and the Silurian chief Caractacus (Caradoc). After a
                    struggle of nine years Caractacus at length, in 51 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> met with a decisive defeat at the hands of P. Ostorius Scapula.
                    Having fled for refuge to Cartismandua, queen of the Brigantes (a tribe
                    occupying the district between the Tyne and the Humber), he was betrayed by her
                    to the Romans, by whom he was taken to be led in triumph through the streets of
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>Ten years after this Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, a tribe occupying the present
                    counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, took advantage of the absence in Mona
                    (Anglesey) of the Roman prefect, Suetonius Paullinus, to excite her people to
                    revolt. The Roman colony of Camulodunum (Colchester) was taken and sacked, and
                    the rebellion soon seemed seriously to threaten the Roman power. Suetonius,
                    however, hastened up from the west, and in a single battle, fought near London,
                    inflicted a decisive defeat on the Britons, following up his victory by a
                    massacre in which 80,000 Britons are said to have perished. Boadicea poisoned
                    herself to avoid falling into the hands of the Romans. The spirit of
                    insurrection was now completely crushed; a milder policy was adopted by the
                    successors of Suetonius, and Roman civilization began rapidly to spread over the
                    country.</p>
                <p>The next event of importance is the arrival of Agricola as governor of Britain in
                    year 78. Agricola’s first task was to complete the subjection of the Ordovices
                    (North Wales), and this having been speedily accomplished, he adopted, with
                    great success, a policy of conciliation. He encouraged education and building,
                    and succeeded in introducing Roman dress and manners among the Britons. This,
                    says Tacitus, they in their ignorance called civilization, though it was but a
                    part of their slavery. In 79 Agricola attacked the Brigantes, and reduced the
                    country betwen the Humber and the Tyne. During five years he continued to
                    advance further north, and in 84 he defeated a Caledonian chieftain, named
                    Galgacus, in a great battle, the site of which it is impossible to fix, but it
                    was probably not far from the eastern coast of Scotland at some place north of
                    the Tay. Agricola was now recalled to Rome, and no attempt was made to maintain
                    the conquests north of the line of forts which he had built between the Forth
                    and the Clyde.</p>
                <p>The remainder of the period of the Roman occupation is for the most part
                    uneventful. In 120 the Emperor Hadrian visited the country, and built a rampart
                    between the Tyne and the Solway Frith, in order to check the inroads of the
                    northern tribes. In 139 a wall, called the wall of Antonine, in honour of the
                    emperor Antoninus Pius, was built by the prefect Lollius Urbicus along the line
                    of Agricola’s forts between the Forth and the Clyde. In 207 the Emperor Severus
                    came to Britain in order to lead in person an expedition against the Caledonian
                    tribes. He advanced far into Caledonia, driving the enemy before him but never
                    meeting them in a pitched battle. No substantial advantage was gained in this
                    desultory war, which cost the lives of 50,000 Roman soldiers. Severus built a
                    new wall along the line of Hadrian’s rampart, and died at York in 211.</p>
                <p>The Roman empire was now in a state of decay, and its weakness offered great
                    temptations to distant officials to seize the supreme power for themselves.
                    About 287 the title of emperor was assumed by a man of low birth named
                    Carausius, a native of Menapia (the district between the Scheldt and the Meuse),
                    who had been appointed to the command of the fleet stationed in the English
                    Channel for the purpose of protecting the coasts of Britain and Gaul from the
                    Frisian pirates, and whose conduct in that position had been such as to draw
                    from the emperor Maximian an order for his death. After a successful reign of
                    seven years, in the course of which his independence was acknowledged by
                    Maximian, Carausius was assassinated by his chief officer Allectus, who in his
                    turn usurped the imperial title during three years, at the end of which Britain
                    was regained for Rome by Constantius Chlorus (296). Constantius afterwards led
                    an expedition into Caledonia, and died at York in 306.</p>
                <p>Soon after this date the Picts and Scots begin to be heard of as invading the
                    Roman province from the north. The Scots, who occupied the western part of
                    Caledonia, belonged to the Gaelic branch of the Celtic family, and had crossed
                    over from Ireland, bringing with them the name which was afterwards bestowed on
                    their new home. The question as to the origin and the language cf the Picts is
                    one which has been long under discussion, and still seems far from a definitive
                    settlement. The Picts are now, however, generally admitted to have been a Celtic
                    race, and the evidence of language, as far as can be judged from the very few
                    Pictish words, chiefly proper names, which have been preserved to us, seems to
                    indicate the Cymric rather than the Gaelic as the branch to which they belonged.
                    (For further information on this point see Garnett, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philological Essays,</hi> and Skene, <hi rend="italic">The Four Ancient Books
                    of Wales.</hi> Garnett holds the view that the Picts were a Cymric race; Skene
                    believes them to have belonged to the Gaelic branch of the Celtic family.)</p>
                <p>In 367 the Picts and Scots overran the whole country as far south as London.
                    Theodosius, father of the emperor of that name, was sent against them, and in
                    two campaigns he succeeded in driving them back beyond the wall of Antonine. The
                    district thus regained between the walls of Hadrian and of Antonine was named
                    Valentia, in honour of the reigning emperor Valenti ni an. This, however, was
                    only a momentary check, and the new province was soon lost.</p>
                <p>In 383 the title of emperor was assumed by Maximus, a native of Spain, who had
                    served under Theodosius in the Pictish wars. Maximus took a large army of Romans
                    and Britons into Gaul and was recognized by Theodosius and Valentinian as sole
                    emperor over Britain, Gaul, and Spain. Five years later he invaded Italy, but
                    was taken and beheaded at Aquileia in 388. The army never returned to Britain,
                    which was thus left weaker than ever. In 396 a single legion was sent by
                    Stilicho, and the Picts were once more driven back. In 407 three successive
                    emperors—Marcus, Gratian, and Constantine—were set up in Britain, the last of
                    whom followed the example set by Maximus, and carried the army into Gaul,
                    leaving Britain again helpless against the northern invaders. In 410 the Roman
                    occupation of Britain was formally terminated by a letter addressed by the
                    emperor Honorius to the cities <pb break="no"

                    henceforth be their own defenders.</p>
                <p>Britain first became a Roman province in the reign of the emperor Claudius, 43
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> It was governed by a single prefect until the
                    reign of Severus, who divided the province into two parts, called Britannia
                    Superior and Britannia Inferior, each governed by a prefect. In the division of
                    the empire into four prefectures in the reign of Diocletian, Britain formed part
                    of the prefecture of Gaul, and was governed by an officer called the <hi

                    country was subdivided into four provinces, each governed by a prefect:—</p>

                <p>Our knowledge of the events of the two centuries succeeding the close of the
                    Roman occupation of Britain is rendered most uncertain by the absence of
                    contemporary records. The accounts given by later writers, British and Saxon,
                    cannot be relied upon for more than the barest outline, which may be accepted in
                    so far as it is found to be consistent with the visible results of the events of
                    this period.</p>
                <p>The paternal character of the Roman rule had left the Britons at its withdrawal
                    enervated and helpless, and utterly unable to cope with the Picts, who now began
                    to press heavily on them. Having in vain appealed for help to the Romans, the
                    Britons applied to the Teutonic rovers who had since the later years of the
                    Roman period been in the habit of plundering the eastern coast. Accordingly, the
                    three tribes of Angles, Jutes, and Saxons came over, and with their assistance
                    the Picts were driven back into their own territories. The Saxons, however,
                    still continued to arrive in large numbers, and soon finding the occasion of a
                    quarrel, they combined with the Picts against the Britons, and proceeded to
                    overrun the country, driving the Britons before them into the west. The first
                    Teutonic kingdom in Britain was that of Kent, founded in 449; and at the end of
                    two centuries we find the Saxons in firm possession of the greater part of the
                    country, and the Celtic tribes occupying only the extreme west. Of Arthur, the
                    hero of the Welsh account of this period, it is impossible to speak with any
                    certainty Although he is unknown to the Saxon chronicle, it seems unnecessary to
                    deny his existence, and it is certain that no part of the south-western district
                    of England, which is generally supposed to have been the scene of his exploits,
                    was conquered by the Saxons until after the time of his alleged victories. An
                    attempt has lately been made (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Arthur)</hi> to show that
                    the scene of Arthur’s victories is to be laid in the south of Scotland, and not
                    in the west of England. The question is one which hardly seems capable of a
                    satisfactory settlement. For the subsequent history see <hi rend="smallcaps"
