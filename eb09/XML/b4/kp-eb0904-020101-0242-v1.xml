                <p><label type="entry">BRAHMANISM</label> is a term commonly used to denote a system
                    of religious institutions originated and elaborated by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Brahmans,</hi> the sacerdotal and, from an early period, the dominant caste
                    of the Hindu community. In like manner, as the language of the Aryan Hindus has
                    undergone continual processes of modification and dialectic division, so their
                    religious belief has passed through various stages of development broadly
                    distinguished from one another by certain prominent features. The earliest
                    phases of religious thought in India of which a clear idea can now be formed are
                    exhibited in a body of writings, looked upon by later generations in the light
                    of sacred writ, under the collective name of <hi rend="italic">Veda</hi>
                    (“knowledge”) <hi rend="italic">or&amp;ruti</hi> (“revelation”). The Hindu
                    scriptures consist of four separatè collections, or <hi rend="italic"

                        >Atharυan</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Atharvaveda.</hi> Each of these four
                    text-books has attached to it a body of prose writings, called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Brähmanas,</hi> which presuppose the Sanhitäs, purporting as they do to
                    explain chiefly the ceremonial application of the texts and the origin and
                    import of the sacrificial rites for which these were supposed to have been
                    composed. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Brähmanas</hi> proper, these theological
                    works, and in a few isolated cases some of the Sänhitäs, include two kinds of
                    appendages, the <hi rend="italic">Aranyakas</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Upanishads,</hi> both of which, and especially the latter, by their
                    language and contents, generally betray a more modern origin than the works to
                    which they are annexed. The subject of the former class of these treatises is on
                    the whole similar to that of the <hi rend="italic">Brähmanas,</hi> which they
                    supplement, giving at the same time somewhat more prominence to the mystical
                    sense of the rites of worship. The <hi rend="italic">Upanishads,</hi> on the
                    other hand, are taken up to a great extent with speculations on the problems of
                    the universe and the religious aims of man,—subjects often touched upon in the
                    earlier v/ritings, but here dealt with in a more mature and systematic way. Two
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Sanhitäs,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Säman</hi> and the
                        <hi rend="italic">Yajush,</hi> owing their existence to purely ritual
                    purposes, and being, besides, the one almost entirely, the other partly,
                    composed of verses taken from the <hi rend="italic">Rigveda</hi> are only of
                    secondary importance for our present inquiry. The hymns of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rigυeda</hi> constitute the <pb break="no"

                    settlers in India which have been handed down to posterity. They are certainly
                    not all equally old; on the contrary they evidently represent the literary
                    activity of many generations of bards, though their relative age cannot as yet
                    be determined with anything like certainty. The tenth and last book of the
                    collection, however, at any rate has all the characteristics of a later
                    appendage, and in language and spirit many of its hymns approach very nearly to
                    the level of the contents of the <hi rend="italic">Atharvan.</hi> Of the latter
                    collection about one-sixth is found also in the <hi rend="italic">Rigveda,</hi>
                    and especially in the tenth book; the larger portion peculiar to it, though
                    including no doubt some older pieces, appears to owe its origin to an age not
                    long anterior to the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Brâhmanas.</hi></p>
                <p>The state of religious thought among the ancient bards, as reflected in the hymns
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Rigveda,</hi> is that of a worship of the grand and
                    striking phenomena of nature regarded in the light of personal conscious beings,
                    endowed with a power beyond the control of man, though not insensible to his
                    praises and actions. It is a nature-worship purer than that met with in any
                    other polytheistic form of belief w e are acquainted with,—a mythology still
                    comparatively little affected by those systematizing tendencies which, in a less
                    simple and primitive state of thought, lead to the construction of a
                    well-ordered pantheon and a regular organization of divine government. To the
                    mind of the early Vedic worshipper the various departments of the surrounding
                    nature are not as yet clearly defined, and the functions which he assigns to
                    their divine representatives continually flow into one another. Nor has he yet
                    learned to care to determine the relative worth and position of the objects of
                    his adoration; but the temporary influence of the phenomenon to which he
                    addresses his praises bears too strongly upon his mind to allow him for the time
                    to consider the claims of rival powers to which at other times he is wont to
                    look up with equal feelings of awe and reverence. It is this immediateness of
                    impulse under which the human mind in its infancy strives to give utterance to
                    its emotions that imparts to many of its outpourings the ring of monotheistic
                    fervour.</p>
                <p>The generic name given to these impersonations, viz., <hi rend="italic">deva
                        (“</hi> the shining ones ”), points to the conclusion, sufficiently
                    justified by the nature of the more prominent objects of Vedic adoration as well
                    as by common natural occurrences, that it was the beautiful phenomena of light
                    which first and most powerfully swayed the Aryan mind. In the primitive worship
                    of the manifold phenomena of nature it is not, of course, so much their physical
                    aspect that impresses the human heart as the moral and intellectual forces w <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> hich are supposed to move and animate them. The
                    attributes and relations of some of the Vedic deities, in accordance with the
                    nature of the objects they represent, partake in a high degree of this spiritual
                    element; but it is not improbable that in an earlier phase of Aryan worship the
                    religious conceptions were pervaded by it to a still greater and more general
                    extent, and that the Vedic belief, though retaining many of the primitive
                    features, has on the whole assumed a more sensuous and anthropomorphic
                    character. This latter element is especially predominant in the attributes and
                    imagery applied by the Vedic poets to <hi rend="italic">Indra,</hi> the god of
                    the atmospheric region, the favourite figure in their pantheon. While the
                    representatives of the prominent departments of nature appear to the Vedic bard
                    as consisting in a state of independence of . one another, their relation to the
                    mortal worshipper being the chief subject of his anxiety, a simple method of
                    classification was already resorted to at an early time, consisting in a triple
                    division of the deities into gods residing in the sky, in the air, and on earth.
                    It is not, however, until a later stage,—the first clear indication being
                    conveyed in a passage of the tenth book of the <hi rend="italic">Rigveda,</hi>
                    that this attempt at a polytheistic system is followed up by the promotion of
                    one particular god to the dignity of chief guardian for each of these three
                    regions. On the other hand, a tendency is clearly traceable in some of the hymns
                    towards identifying gods whose functions present a certain degree of similarity
                    of nature; these attempts would seem to show a certain advance of religious
                    reflection, the first steps from polytheism towards a comprehension of the unity
                    of divine essence. Another feature of the old Vedic worship tended to a similar
                    result. The great problems of the origin and existence of man and universe had
                    early begun to engage the Hindü mind; and in celebrating the praises of the gods
                    the poet was frequently led by his religious, and not wholly disinterested, zeal
                    to attribute to them cosmical functions of the very highest order. At a later
                    stage of thought, chiefly exhibited in the tenth book of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rigveda</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Atharvaveda,</hi> inquiring sages
                    could not but perceive the inconsistency of such concessions of a supremacy
                    among the divine rulers, and tried to solve the problem by conceptions of an
                    independent power, endowed with all the attributes of a supreme deity, the
                    creator of the universe, including the gods of the pantheon. The names under
                    which this monotheistic idea is put forth are mostly of an attributive
                    character, and indeed some of them, such as <hi rend="italic">Prajäpati</hi>
                    (“lord of creatures ”), <hi rend="italic">Visυakarman (“</hi> all-doer ”), occur
                    in the earlier hymns as mere epithets of particular gods. But to other minds
                    this theory of a personal creator left many difficulties unsolved. They saw, as
                    the poets of old had seen, that everything around them, that man himself, was
                    directed by some inward agent; and it needed but one step to perceive the
                    essential sameness of these spiritual units, and to recognize their being but so
                    many individual manifestations of one universal principle. Thus a pantheistic
                    conception was arrived at, put forth under various names, such as <hi
                        rend="italic">Purυsha</hi> (“soul”), <hi rend="italic">Käma</hi> (“desire”),
                        <hi rend="italic">Brahman</hi> (neutr.; nom. sing, <hi rend="italic">brahma)
                        (</hi> “devotion, prayer”). Metaphysical and theosophic speculations were
                    thus fast undermining the simple belief in the old gods, until, at the time of
                    the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Brâhmanas</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Upanishads,</hi> we find them in complete possession of the minds of the
                    theologians. Whilst the theories crudely suggested in the later hymns are now
                    further matured and elaborated, the tendency towards catholicity of formula
                    favours the combination of the conflicting monotheistic and pantheistic
                    conceptions; this compromise, which makes <hi rend="italic">Präjapati,</hi> the
                    personal creator of the world, the manifestation of the impersonal <hi
                        rend="italic">Brcιhma,</hi> the universal self-existent soul, leads to the
                    composite pantheistic system which forms the characteristic dogma of the
                    Brähmanical period.</p>
                <p>The spirit of Vedic worship is pervaded by a strong belief in the efficacy of
                    invocation and sacrificial offering. The earnest and well-expressed prayer
                    cannot fail to draw the divine power to the worshipper and make it yield to his
                    supplication; and offerings, so far from being mere acts of devotion which give
                    pleasure to the god, represent the very food and drink which render him vigorous
                    and capable of battling with the enemies of his mortal friend. This intrinsic
                    power of invocation found an early expression in the term <hi rend="italic"
                        >brdhma</hi> (neuter)(“religious devotion, prayer, hymn”); and its
                    independent existence as an active moral principle in shaping the destinies of
                    man became recognized in the Vedic pantheon in the conception of a god, <hi
                        rend="italic">Brihaspati</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Brahmanaspati</hi> (“lord
                    of prayer ”), the guardian of the pious worshipper. This feature in the Hindu
                    belief could scarcely fail early to engender and foster in the minds of the
                    people feelings of esteem and reverence towards those who possessed the inspired
                    gift of poetical expression, as <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n244/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0244-0203"/> well as those who had acquired an intimate
                    knowledge of the various forms of ritual worship. The common term used in the
                    Veda for the officiating priest is <hi rend="italic">brahman</hi> (masc.; nom.
                    sing, <hi rend="italic">brahma),</hi> originally denoting, it would seem, “one
                    who prays, a worshipper/’ or “the composer or reciter of a hymn <hi
                        rend="italic">(brdhman,</hi> n.)” In some passages the word also signifies a
                    special class of priests who officiated as superintendents during sacrificial
                    ceremonies, the complicated naturo of which required the co-operation of several
                    priests. It is probable that in most cases the function of the poet or composer
                    of hymns was combined with that of a minister of worship. In the Vedic hymns two
                    classes of society, the royal (or military) and the priestly classes, were
                    evidently recognized as being raised above the level of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vis',</hi> or bulk of the Aryan community. These social grades seem to have
                    been in existence even before the separation of the two Asiatic branches of the
                    Indo-European race, the Aryans of Iran and India. It is true that, although the
                        <hi rend="italic">Athrava,</hi><hi rend="italic">Rathaëstâo,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Vattrya</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Zend Avesta</hi>
                    correspond in position and occupation to the <hi rend="italic">Brähman,
                        Räjan,</hi> and Fïs' of the Veda, there is no similarity of names between
                    them; but this fact only shows that the common vocabulary had not yet definitely
                    fixed on any specific names for these classes. Even in the Veda their
                    nomenclature is by no means limited to a single designation for each of them.
                    Moreover, <hi rend="italic">Atharvan</hi> occurs not infrequently in the hymns
                    as the personification of the priestly profession, as the proto-priest who is
                    supposed to have obtained fire from heaven and to have instituted the rite of
                    sacrifice; and although <hi rend="italic">ratheshtha (j</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> standing on a car”) is not actually found
                    in connection with the <hi rend="italic">Räjan</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kshatriya,</hi> its synonym <hi rend="italic">rathin</hi> is in later
                    literature a not unusual epithet of men of the military caste. At the time of
                    the hymns, aud even during the common IndoPersian period, the sacrificial
                    ceremonial had already become sufficiently complicated to call for the creation
                    of a certain number of distinct priestly offices with special duties attached to
                    them. While this shows clearly that the position and occupation of the priest
                    were those of a profession, the fact that the terms <hi rend="italic"
                        >brähmana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">brahmaputra,</hi> both denoting “the
                    son of a brahman,” are used in certain hymns as synonyms of Brahman, seems to
                    justify the assumption that the profession had already, to a certain degree,
                    become hereditary at the time when these hymns were composed. There is, however,
                    with the exception of a solitary passage in a hymn of the last book, no trace to
                    be found in the <hi rend="italic">Rigυeda</hi> of that rigid division into four
                    castes separated from one another by unsurmountable barriers, which in later
                    times constitutes the distinctive feature of Hindü society The idea of caste is
                    expressed by the Sanskrit term <hi rend="italic">varna,</hi> originally denoting
                    “colour,” thereby implying differences of complexion between the several
                    classes. The word occurs in the Veda in the latter sense, but it is used there
                    to mark the distinction, not between the three classes of the Aryan community,
                    but between them on the one hand and a dark-coloured hostile people on the
                    other. The latter, called Däsas or Däsyus, consisted, no doubt, of the
                    indigenous tribes, with whom the Aryans had to carry on a continual struggle for
                    the possession of the land. The partial subjection of these comparatively
                    uncivilized tribes, as the rule of the superior race was gradually spreading
                    eastward, and their submission to a state of serfdom under the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">èüdras,</hi> added to the Aryan community an element, totally
                    separated from it by colour, by habits, by language, and by occupation.
                    Moreover, the religious belief of these tribes being entirely different from
                    that of the conquering people, the pious Aryas, and especially the class
                    habitually engaged in acts of worship, could hardly fail to apprehend
                    considerable danger to the purity of their own faith from too close and intimate
                    a contact between the two races. What more natural, therefore, than that
                    measures should have been early devised to limit the intercourse between them
                    within as narrow bounds as possible. In course of time the difference of
                    vocation, and the greater or less exposure to the scorching influence of the
                    tropical sky, added, no doubt, to a certain admixture of Sfidra blood,
                    especially in the case of the common people, seem to have produced also in the
                    Aryan population different shades of complexion, which greatly favoured a
                    tendency to rigid class-restrictions originally awakened and continually fed by
                    the lot of the servile race. Meanwhile the power of the sacerdotal order having
                    been gradually enlarged in proportion to the development of the minutiae of
                    sacrificial ceremonial and the increase of sacred lore, they began to lay claim
                    to supreme authority in regulating and controlling the religious and social life
                    of the people. The author of the so-called <hi rend="italic">Purusha-sükta,</hi>
                    or hymn to Purusha, above referred to, represents the four castes— the <hi
                        rend="italic">Brähmanas,</hi><hi rend="italic">Kshatriyas,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Vaiéyars,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Südras</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">—</hi> as having severally sprung from the mouth, the arms,
                    the thighs, and the feet of Purusha, a primary being, here assumed to be the
                    source of the universe. It is very doubtful, however, whether at the time when
                    this hymn was composed the relative position of the two upper castes could
                    already have been settled in so decided a way as this theory might lead us to
                    suppose. There is, on the contrary, reason to believe that some time had yet to
                    elapse, marked by fierce and bloody struggles for supremacy, of which only
                    imperfect ideas can be formed from the legendary and biassed accounts of later
                    generations, before the Kshatriyas finally submitted to the full measure of
                    priestly pretension.</p>
                <p>The definitive establishment of theBrähmanical hierarchy marks the beginning of
                    the Brähmanical period properly so called. Though the origin and gradual rise of
                    some of the leading institutions of this era can, as has been shown, be traced
                    in the earlier writings, the chain of their development presents a break at this
                    juncture which no satisfactory materials enable us to fill up. A considerable
                    portion of the literature of this time has apparently been lost; and several
                    important works, the original composition of which has probably to be assigned
                    to the early days of Brahmanism, such as the institutes of Manu and the two
                    great epics, the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rämäyana,</hi> in the form in which they have been handed down to us, show
                    manifest traces cf a more modern redaction. Yet it is sufficiently clear from
                    internal evidence that Manu’s Code of Laws, though it is merely a metrical <hi
                        rend="italic">rifacimento</hi> of older materials, reproduces on the whole
                    pretty faithfully the state of Hindu society depicted in the sources from which
                    it was compiled. The final overthrow of the Kshatriya power was followed by a
                    period of jealous legislation on the part of the Brahmans. For the time their
                    chief aim was to improve their newly gained vantage-ground by surrounding
                    everything oonnected with their order with a halo of sanctity calculated to
                    impress the lay community with feelings of awe. In the Brähmanas and even in the
                    Purusha Hymn, and the Atharvan, divine origin had already been ascribed to the
                    Vedic Sanhitäs, especially to the three older collections. The same privilege
                    was now successfully claimed for the later Vedic literature, so imbued with
                    Brâhmanic aspirations and pretensions; and the authority implied in the
                    designation of <hi rend="italic">Sruti</hi> or revelation removed henceforth the
                    whole body of sacred w ritings from the sphere of doubt and criticism. This
                    concession necessarily involved an acknowledgement of the new social order as a
                    divine institution. Its stability was, however, rendered still more secure by
                    the elaboration of a system of conventional precepts, partly forming the basis
                    of Manu’s Code, which clearly defined the relative position and the duties of
                    the several castes, and determined the penalties to be inflicted on any
                    transgressions of the limits assigned <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n245/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0245-0204"/> to each of them. These laws are conceived
                    with no humane or sentimental scruples on the part of their authors. On the
                    contrary, the offences committed by Brahmans against other castes are treated
                    with remarkable clemency, whilst the punishments inflicted for trespasses on the
                    rights of higher classes are the more severe and inhuman the lower the offender
                    stands in the social scale. The three first castes, however unequal to each
                    other in privilege and social standing, are yet united by a common bond of
                    sacramental rites <hi rend="italic">(sanskäras),</hi> traditionally connected
                    from ancient times with certain incidents and stages in the life of the Aryan
                    Hindü, as conception, birth, name-giving, the first taking out of the child to
                    see the sun, the first feeding with boiled rice, the rites of tonsure and hair
                    cutting, the youth’s investiture with the sacrificial thread, and his return
                    home on completing his studies, marriage, funeral, &lt;fcc. The modes of
                    observing these family rites are laid down in a class of writings called <hi
                        rend="italic">Grihya-sûtras,</hi> or domestic rules. The most important of
                    these observances is the <hi rend="italic">upanayana,</hi> or rite of conducting
                    the boy to a spiritual teacher. Connected with this act is the investiture with
                    the sacred cord, ordinarily worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm,
                    and varying in material according to the class of the wearer. This ceremony
                    being the preliminary act to the youth’s initiation into the study of the Veda,
                    the management of the consecrated fire and the knowledge of the rites of
                    purification, including the <hi rend="italic">savitri,</hi> a solemn invocation
                    to <hi rend="italic">savitri,</hi> the sun, which has to be repeated every
                    morning and evening before the rise and after the setting of that luminary,
                    issupposed to constitute the second or spiritual birth of the Arya. It is from
                    their participation in this rite that the three upper classes are called the
                    twice-born. The ceremony is enjoined to take place some time between the eighth
                    and sixteenth year of age in the case of a Brahman, between the eleventh and
                    twenty-second year of a Kshatriya, and between the twelfth and twenty-fourth
                    year of a Vaisya. He who has not been invested with the mark of his class within
                    this time is for ever excluded from uttering the sacred <hi rend="italic"
                        >savitri</hi> and becomes an outcast, unless he is absolved from his sin by
                    a council of Brahmans, and after due performance of a purificatory rite resumes
                    the badge of his caste. With one not duly initiated no righteous man is allowed
                    to associate or to enter into connections of affinity. The duty of the Sûdra is
                    to serve the twice-born classes, and above all the Brahmans. He is excluded from
                    all sacred knowledge, and if he performs sacrificial ceremonies he must do so
                    without using holy mantras. No Brahman must recite a Vedic text where a man of
                    the servile caste might overhear him, nor must he even teach him the laws of
                    expiating sin. The occupations of the Vaisya are those connected with trade, the
                    cultivation of the land and the breeding of cattle; while those of a Kshatriya
                    consist in ruling and defending the people, administering justice, and the
                    duties of military profession generally. Both share with the Brahman the
                    privilege of reading the Veda, but only so far as it is taught and explained to
                    them by their spiritual preceptor. To the Brahman belongs the right of teaching
                    and expounding the sacred texts, and also that of interpreting and determining
                    the law and the rules of caste. Only in exceptional cases, when no teacher of
                    the sacerdotal class is within reach, the twice-born youth, rather than forego
                    spiritual instruction altogether, may reside in the house of a non-Brähmanical
                    preceptor; but it is specially enjoined that a pupil, who seeks the path to
                    heaven, should not fail, as soon as circumstances permit, to resort to a Brahman
                    well versed in the Vedas and their appendages.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the barriers placed between the four castes, the practice of
                    intermarrying appears to have been too prevalent in early times to have admitted
                    of measures of so stringent a nature as to wholly repress it. To marry a woman
                    of a higher caste, and especially of a caste not immediately above one’s own,
                    is, however, decidedly prohibited, the offspring resulting from such a union
                    being excluded from the performance of the sräddha or obsequies to the
                    ancestors, and thereby rendered incapable of inheriting any portion of the
                    parents’ property. On the other hand, men are at liberty, according to the rules
                    of Manu, to marry a girl of any or each of the castes below their own, provided
                    they have besides a wife belonging to their own class, for only such a one
                    should perform the duties of personal attendance and religious observance
                    devolving upon a married woman. As regards the children born from unequal
                    marriages of this description, they have the rights and duties of the
                    twice-born, if their mother belong to a twice-born caste, otherwise they, like
                    the offspring of the former class of intermarriages, share the lot of the
                    éûdras, and are excluded from the investiture and the savitri. For this last
                    reason the marriage of a twice born man with a Öüdra woman is altogether
                    discountenanced by some of the later law books. At the time of the code of Manu
                    the intermixture of the classes had already produced a considerable number of
                    intermediate or mixed castes, which were carefully catalogued, and each of which
                    had a specific occupation assigned to it as its hereditary profession. The
                    self-exaltation of the first class was not, it would seem, altogether due to
                    priestly arrogance and ambition; but, like a prominent feature of the post-Vedic
                    belief, the transmigration of souls, it was, if not the necessary, yet at least
                    a natural consequence of the pantheistic doctrine. To the Brähmanical speculator
                    who saw in the numberless individual existences of animate nature but so many
                    manifestations of the one eternal soul, to union with which they were all bound
                    to tend as their final goal of supreme bliss, the greater or less imperfection
                    of the material forms in which they were embodied naturally presented a
                    continuous scale of spiritual units from the lowest degradation up to the
                    absolute purity and perfection of the supreme spirit. To prevent one’s sinking
                    yet lower, and by degrees to raise one’s self in this universal gradation, or,
                    if possible, to attain the ultimate goal immediately from any state of corporeal
                    existence, there was but one way,—subjection of the senses, purity of life, and
                    knowledge of the deity. “He” (thus ends the code of Manu) “who in his own soul
                    perceives the supreme soul in all beings and acquires equanimity toward them
                    all, attains the highest state of bliss.” Was it not natural then that the men
                    who, if true to their sacred duties, were habitually engaged in what was most
                    conducive to these spiritual attainments, that the Brahmanical class early
                    learnt to look upon themselves, even as a matter of faith, as being foremost
                    among the human species in this universal race for final beatitude? The life
                    marked out for them by that stern theory of class duties which they themselves
                    had worked out, and which, no doubt, must have been practised in early times at
                    least in some degree, was by no means one of ease and amenity. It was, on the
                    contrary, singularly calculated to promote that complete mortification of the
                    instincts of animal nature which they considered as indispensable to the final
                    deliverance from the revolution of bodily and personal existence.</p>
                <p>The pious Brahman, longing to attain the <hi rend="italic">summum,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">bonum</hi> on the dissolution of his frail body, was enjoined
                    to pass through a succession of four orders or stages of life, viz., those of
                        <hi rend="italic">brahmachärin,</hi> or religious student; <hi rend="italic"
                        >grihastha</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">grihamedhiιι),</hi> or householder;
                        <hi rend="italic">vananväsin</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">vanaprastha'),</hi>
                    or anchorite; and <hi rend="italic">sannyâsin</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                        >bhikshu),</hi> or religious mendicant. Theoretically this course of life
                    was open and even recommended to every twice-born man, his distinctive
                    classoccupations being in that case restricted to the second station, or that of
                    married life. Practically, however, those <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n246/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0246-0205"/> belonging to the Kshatriya and Vaiéya castes
                    were, no doubt, contented, with few exceptions, to go through a term of
                    studentship in order to obtain a certain amount of religious instruction before
                    entering into the married state, and plying their professional duties. In the
                    case of the sacerdotal class, the practice probably was all but universal in
                    early times; but gradually a more and more limited proportion seem to have
                    carried their religious zeal to the length of self-mortification involved in the
                    two final stages. On the youth having been invested with the sign of his caste,
                    he wa3 to reside for some time in the house of some religious teacher, well read
                    in the Veda, to be instructed in the knowledge of the scriptures and the
                    scientific treatises attached to them, in the social duties of his caste, and in
                    the complicated system of purificatory and sacrificial rites. According to the
                    number of Vedas he intended to study, the duration of this period of instruction
                    was to be, probably in the case of Brâhmanical students chiefly, of from twelve
                    to forty-eight years; during which time the virtues of modesty, duty,
                    temperance, and self-control were to be firmly implanted in the youth’s mind by
                    his unremitting observance of the most minute rules of conduct. During all this
                    time the Brâhman student had to subsist entirely on food obtained by begging
                    from house to house; and his behaviour towards the preceptor and his family was
                    to be that prompted by respectful attachment and implicit obedience. In the case
                    of girls no investiture takes place, but for them the nuptial ceremony is
                    considered as an equivalent for that rite. On quitting the teacher’s abode, the
                    young man returns to his family and takes a wife. To die without leaving
                    legitimate offspring, and especially a son, to perform the periodical rite of
                    obsequies, consisting of offerings of water and cakes, to himself and his
                    ancestors, is considered a great misfortune by the orthodox Hindu. There are
                    three sacred “debts” which a man has to discharge in life, viz., that which is
                    due to the gods, and of which he acquits himself by daily worship and
                    sacrificial rites; that due to the <hi rend="italic">rishis,</hi> or ancient
                    sages and inspired seers of the Vedic texts, discharged by the daily study of
                    the scripture; and the “final debt” which he owes to his <hi rend="italic"
                        >manes,</hi> and of which he relieves himself by leaving a son. To these
                    three some authorities add a fourth, viz., the debt owing to humankind, which
                    demande his continually practising kindness and hospitality. Hence the necessity
                    of the man’s entering into the married state. When the bridegroom leads the
                    bride from her father’s house to his own home, the fire which has been used for
                    the marriage ceremony accompanies the couple to serve them as their <hi
                        rend="italic">gärhapatya,</hi> or domestic fire. It has to be kept up
                    perpetually, day and night, either by themselves or their children, or, if the
                    man be a teacher, by his pupils. If it should at any time become extinguished by
                    neglect or otherwise, the guilt incurred thereby must be atoned for by an act of
                    expiation. The domestic fire serves the family for preparing their food, for
                    making the five necessary daily and other occasional offerings, and for
                    performing the sacramental rites above alluded to. No food should ever be eaten
                    that has not been duly consecrated by a portion of it being offered to the gods,
                    the beings, and the <hi rend="italic">manes.</hi> These three daily offerings
                    are also called by the collective name of <hi rend="italic">va⅛vadeva,</hi> or
                    sacrifice to all the deities. The remaining two are the offering to Brahma, <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the daily lecture of the scriptures, accompanied by
                    certain rites, and that to men, consisting in the entertainment of guests. The
                    domestic observances, many of which must be considered as ancient Aryan family
                    customs, surrounded by the Hindus with a certain amount of adventitious
                    ceremonial, were generally performed by the householder himself, with the
                    assistance of his wife. There is, however, another class of sacrificial
                    ceremonies of a more pretentious and expensive kind, called <hi rend="italic"
                        >6rauta</hi> rites, or rites based on <hi rend="italic">éruti,</hi> or
                    revelation, the performance of which, though not indispensable, were yet
                    considered obligatory under certain circumstances. They formed a very powerful
                    weapon in the hands of the priesthood, and were one of the chief sources of
                    their subsistence. Owing to the complicated nature of these sacrifices, and the
                    great amount of ritualistic formulas and texts muttered or recited during their
                    performance, they required the employment of a number of professional Brahmans,
                    frequently as many as sixteen, who had to be well rewarded for their services.
                    However great the religious merit accruing from these sacrificial rites, they
                    were obviously a kind of luxury which only rich people could afford to indulge
                    in. They constituted, as it were, a tax, voluntary perhaps, yet none the less
                    compulsory, levied by the priesthood on the wealthy laity. It is true that the
                    priest who refuses to accept any reward for officiating at a sacrifice is highly
                    eulogized by the Brâhmanical writers; but such cases of disinterested zeal seem
                    to have occurred but rarely. The manuals of Vaidik ritual generally enumerate
                    three classes of <hi rend="italic">érauta</hi> rites, viz., <hi rend="italic"
                        >ishtis,</hi> or oblations of milk, curds, clarified butter <hi
                        rend="italic">(ghee),</hi> rice, grain, &lt;fcc., animal offerings, and
                    libations of <hi rend="italic">soma.</hi> The soma, an intoxicating drink
                    prepared from the juice of the <hi rend="italic">Asclepias</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >acida</hi> (a kind of milk-weed, sometimes called the moon-plant), must
                    have played an important part in the ancient worship, at least as early as the
                    Indo-Persian period. It is continually alluded to both in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Zend A vesta</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Rigυeda.</hi> In the latter
                    work the hymns of a whole book, besides others, are addressed to it, either in
                    the shape of a mighty god, or in its original form, as a kind of ambrosia
                    endowed with wonderfully exhilarating powers. In post-Vedic mythology <hi
                        rend="italic">Soma</hi> has become identified with the lunar deity, to whom
                    it seems to have had some relation from the beginning. Among the Vaidik rites
                    the soma-sacrifices are the most solemn and complicated, and those to which the
                    greatest efficacy is ascribed in remitting sin, conferring offspring and even
                    immortality. They require the attendance of sixteen priests, and are divided
                    into three groups, according as the actual pressing and offering of the soma
                    occupies only one day, or between one and twelve, or more than twelve days. The
                    performance of all s'rauta sacrifices requires two other fires besides that used
                    for domestic rites. The act of first placing the fires in their respective
                    receptacles, after due consecration of the ground, constitutes the essential
                    part of the first <hi rend="italic">ishti,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                        >agnyâdhâna,</hi> which the householder should have performed byfour
                    Brahmans immediately after his wedding. To the same class of sacrificial
                    ceremonies belong those performed on the days of the new and full moon, the
                    oblation at the commencement of the three seasons, the offering of first-fruits
                    and other periodical rites. Besides these regular sacrifices, the érauta
                    ceremonial includes a number of most solemn rites which, on account of the
                    objects for which they are instituted and the enormous expenditure they involve,
                    could only be performed on rare occasions and by powerful princes. Of these the
                    most important are the <hi rend="italic">râjasûya,</hi> or inauguration ceremony
                    of a monarch laying claim to supreme rule, and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >asvamedha,</hi> or horse sacrifice, a rite of great antiquity, enjoined by
                    the Brâhmanical ritual to kings desirous of attaining universal sovereignty. The
                    efficacy ascribed to this ceremony in later times was so great that the
                    performance of a hundred such sacrifices was considered to deprive Indra of his
                    position as chief of the immortals.</p>
                <p>When the householder is advanced in years, “when he perceives his skin become
                    wrinkled and his hair grey, when he sees the son of his son,” the time is said
                    to have come for him to enter the third stage of life. He should now disengage
                    himself from all family ties,—except that his wife may accompany him, if she
                    chooses,—and repair <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0247-0206"/> to a lonely wood, taking with him his sacred
                    fires and the implements required for the daily and periodical offerings. Clad
                    in a deer’s skin, in a single piece of cloth, or in a bark garment, with his
                    hair and nails uncut, the hermit is to subsist exclusively on food growing wild
                    in the forest, such as roots, fruit, green herbs, and wild rice and grain. He
                    must not accept gifts from any one, except of what may be absolutely necessary
                    to maintain him; but with his own little hoard he should, on the contrary,
                    honour, to the best of his ability, those who visit his hermitage. His time must
                    be spent in reading the metaphysical treatises of the Veda, in making oblations,
                    and in undergoing various kinds of privation and austerities, with a view to
                    mortifying his passions and producing in his mind an entire indifference to
                    worldly objects. Having by these means succeeded in overcoming all sensual
                    affections and desires, and in acquiring perfect equanimity towards everything
                    around him, the hermit has fitted himself for the final and most exalted order,
                    that of devotee or religious mendicant. As such he has no further need of either
                    mortifications or religious observances; but “with the sacrificial fires
                    reposited in his mind,’’ he may devote the remainder of his days to meditating
                    on the divinity. Taking up his abode at the foot of a tree in total solitude,
                    “with no companion but his own soul,” clad in a coarse garment, he should
                    carefully avoid injuring any creature or giving offence to any human being that
                    may happen to come near him. Once a day, in the evening, “when the charcoal fire
                    is extinguished and the smoke no longer issues from the fireplaces, when the
                    pestle is at rest, when the people have taken their meals and the dishes are
                    removed,” he should go near the habitations of men, in order to beg what little
                    food may suffice to sustain his feeble frame. Ever pure of mind he should thus
                    bide his time, “as a servant expects his wages,” wishing neither for death nor
                    for life, until at last his soul is freed from its fetters and absorbed in the
                    eternal spirit, the impersonal self-existent Brahmă.</p>
                <p>The neuter term <hi rend="italic">bráhmă</hi> is met with in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Rigveda</hi> both in the abstract sense of “devotion,
                    worship,” and in the concrete one of “prayer, hymn.” Closely connected with it
                    is found the masculine term <hi rend="italic">brahma, “a</hi> worshipper, a
                    priest.” The popular belief in the efficacy of invocation constituted a
                    prominent feature of the Vedic symbolism, which the traditional and professional
                    activity of the poet and minister of worship did, no doubt, much to keep up and
                    foster. In the theosophical speculations of the later Vedic poets this mystic
                    power of devotion found its fullest expression.in the recognition of the <hi
                        rend="italic">bráhmă</hi> as the highest cosmical principle, and its
                    identification with the pantheistic conception of an all pervading self-existent
                    essence, the primary source of the universe. Whether this identification was
                    originally due to some extent to the influence of class-interest possibly aided
                    by the coincidence of name, or whether it was solely the product of a
                    highly-wrought religious imagination, it is difficult to decide. Certain it is,
                    however, that the term <hi rend="italic">bráhmă</hi> began to be used about the
                    same time as the abstract designation of priestly function and the Brāhmanical
                    order in general, in the same way as the word <hi rend="italic">kshatra</hi>
                    came to denote the aggregate of functions and individuals of the military
                    class</p>
                <p>The tendency towards a comprehension of the unity of divine essence had resulted
                    in some minds, as has been remarked before, in a kind of monotheistic notion of
                    the origin of the universe. In the literature of the Brāhmana period we meet
                    with this conception as a common element of speculation; and so far from its
                    being considered incompatible with the existence of a universal spirit, <hi
                        rend="italic">Prajãpati,</hi> the personal creator of the world, is
                    generally allowed a prominent place in the pantheistic theories. Yet the state
                    of theological speculation, reflected in these writings, is one of transition.
                    The general drift of thought is essentially pantheistic, but it is far from
                    being reduced to a regular system, and the ancient form of belief still enters
                    largely into it. The attributes of Prajãpati, in the same way, have in them
                    elements of a purely polytheistic nature, and some of the attempts at
                    reconciling this new-fangled deity with the traditional belief are somewhat
                    awkward. An ancient classification of the gods represented them as being
                    thirty-three in number, eleven in each of the three worlds or regions of nature.
                    These regions being associated each with the name of one principal deity, this
                    division gave rise at a later time to the notion of a kind of triple divine
                    government, consisting of <hi rend="italic">Agni</hi> (fire), <hi rend="italic"
                        >Indra</hi> (sky) or <hi rend="italic">Vayu</hi> (wind), and <hi
                        rend="italic">Surya</hi> (sun), as presiding respectively over the gods on
                    earth, in the atmosphere, and in the sky. Of this Vedic triad mention is
                    frequently made in the Brāhmana writings. On the other hand the term <hi
                        rend="italic">prajãpati</hi> (lord of creatures), which in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Rigveda</hi> occurs as an epithet of the sun, is also once in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Atharvaveda</hi> applied jointly to Indra and Agni. In the
                    Brāhmanas Prajãpati is several times mentioned as the thirty-fourth god; whilst
                    in one passage he is called the fourth god, and made to rule over the three
                    worlds. More frequently, however, the writings of this period represent him as
                    the maker of the world and the father or creator of the gods. It is clear from
                    this discordance of opinion on so important a point of doctrine, that at this
                    time no authoritative system of belief had been agreed upon by the theologians.
                    Yet there are unmistakable signs of a strong tendency towards constructing one,
                    and it is possible that in yielding to it the Brāhmans may have been partly
                    prompted by political considerations. The definite settlement of the caste
                    system and the Brāhmanical supremacy must probably be assigned to somewhere
                    about the close of the Brāhmana period. Division in their own ranks was hardly
                    favourable to the aspirations of the priests at such a time; and the want of a
                    distinct formula of belief adapted to the general drift of theological
                    speculation, to which they could all rally, was probably felt the more acutely,
                    the more determined a resistance the military class was likely to oppose to
                    their claims. Side by side with the conception of the Bráhmă, the universal
                    spiritual principle, with which speculative thought had already become deeply
                    imbued, the notion of a supreme personal being, the author of the material
                    creation, had come to be considered by many as a necessary complement of the
                    pantheistic doctrine. But, owing perhaps to his polytheistic associations and
                    the attributive nature of his name, the person of Prajãpati seems to have been
                    thought but insufficiently adapted to represent this abstract idea. The
                    expedient resorted to for solving the difficulty was as ingenious as it was
                    characteristic of the Brāhmanical aspirations. In the same way as the abstract
                    denomination of sacerdotalism, the neuter <hi rend="italic">bráhmă,</hi> had
                    come to express the divine essence, so the old designation of the individual
                    priest, the masculine term <hi rend="italic">brahmă,</hi> was raised to denote
                    the supreme personal deity which was to take the place and attributes of the
                    Prajãpati of the Brāhmanas and Upanishads. By this means the very name of the
                    god expressed the essential oneness of his nature with that of the divine spirit
                    as whose manifestation he was to be considered. Even in the later Vedic writings
                    Brahmă is but rarely mentioned; and in some of these passages he is expressly
                    identified with Prajãpati. It is in the institutes of Manu, where, as we have
                    seen, the system of castes is propounded in its complete development, that his
                    definite place is assigned to him in the cosmogony. According to this work, the
                    universe, before undiscerned, was made discernible in the beginning by the sole,
                    self-existent spirit <hi rend="italic">(brahma).</hi> He, then, having willed to
                    produce from his own substance various creatures, created the <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0248-0207"/> waters by meditation, and having placed in
                    them a productive seed which developed into a golden egg, he was born in that
                    egg as the male Brahma, the forefather (and creator) of all beings. The theory
                    of Brahma being born from a golden egg is a mere adaptation of the Vedic
                    conception of <hi rend="italic">Hiranyagarbha</hi> (“gold-embryo ”), who is
                    represented as the supreme god in a hymn of the tenth book of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Rigveda.</hi></p>
                <p>However the new dogma may have answered the purposes of speculative minds, it was
                    not one in which the people generally were likely to have been much concerned;
                    an abstract, colourless deity like Brahma could awake no sympathies in the
                    hearts of those accustomed to worship gods of flesh and blood. Indeed, ever
                    since the primitive symbolical worship of nature had undergone a process of
                    disintegration under the influence of metaphysical speculation, the real belief
                    of the great body of the people had probably become more and more distinct from
                    that of the priesthood. In different localities the principal share of their
                    affection may have been bestowed on one or another of the old gods who was
                    thereby raised to the dignity of chief deity; or new forms and objects of belief
                    may have sprung up with the intellectual growth of the people. In some cases
                    even the worship of the indigenous population may not have remained without
                    exercising some influence in modifying the belief of the Aryan race. In this way
                    a number of local deities would grow up, more or less distinct in name and
                    characteristics from the gods of the Vedic pantheon. There is, indeed,
                    sufficient evidence to show that, at a time when, after centuries of theological
                    speculations, some little insight into the life and thought of the people is
                    afforded by the literature handed down to us, such a diversity of worship did
                    exist. Under these circumstances the policy which seems to have suggested itself
                    to the priesthood, anxious to retain a firm hold on the minds of the people, was
                    to recognize and incorporate into their system some of the most prominent
                    objects of popular devotion, and thereby to establish a kind of catholic creed
                    for the whole community subject to the Brähmanical law. At the time of the
                    original composition of the great epics two such deities, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Siva</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mahddeυa</hi> (“the great god ”) and <hi
                        rend="italic">Vishnu,</hi> seem to have been already admitted into the
                    Brähmanical system, where they have ever since retained their place; and from
                    the manner in which they are represented in those works, it would, indeed,
                    appear that both, and especially the former, 6njoyed an extensive worship. As
                    several synonyms are attributed to each of them, it is not improbable that in
                    some of these we have to recognize special names under which the people in
                    different localities worshipped these gods, or deities of a similar nature
                    which, by the agency of popular poetry, or in some other way, came to be
                    combined with them. The places assigned to them in the pantheistic system were
                    co-ordinate with that of Brahma; the three deities, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Brahma,</hi><hi rend="italic">Vishnu,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Siva</hi>
                    were to represent a triple impersonation of the divinity, as manifesting itself
                    respectively in the creation, preservation, and destruction of the universe.
                    Siva does not occur in the Vedic hymns as the name of a god, but only as an
                    adjective in the sense of “kind, auspicious.” One of his synonyms, however, is
                    the name of a Vedic deity, the attributes and nature of which show a good deal
                    of similarity to the post-Vedic god. This is <hi rend="italic">Rudra,</hi> the
                    god of the roaring storm, usually portrayed, in accordance with the element he
                    represents, as a fierce, destructive deity, “terrible as a wild beast,” whose
                    fearful arrows cause death and disease to men and cattle. He is also called <hi
                        rend="italic">kapardin (“</hi> wearing his hair spirally braided like a
                    shell ”), a word which in later times became one of the synonyms of Siva. The
                        <hi rend="italic">Atharvaveda</hi> mentions several other names of the same
                    god, some of which appear even placed together, as in one passage <hi
                        rend="italic">Bhava, Sarva, Rτιdra,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Paéupati.</hi> Possibly some of them were the names under which one and the
                    same deity was already worshipped in different parts of Northern India. This was
                    certainly the case in later times, since it is expressly stated in one of the
                    later works of the Brähmana period, that 6arva was used by the Eastern people
                    and Bhava by a Western tribe. It is also worthy of note that in this work (the
                        <hi rend="italic">Satapatha-brähmana),</hi> composed at a time when the
                    Vedic triad of Agni, Indra-Väyu, and Surya was still recognized, attempts are
                    made to identify this god of many names with Agni; and that in one passage in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi> it is stated that the Brahmans said that
                    Agni was éiva. Although this identification can scarcely be correct, it seems to
                    point to the fact that, in adapting their speculations to the actual state of
                    popular worship, the Brahmans kept the older triad distinctly in view, and by
                    means of it endeavoured to bring their new structure into harmony with the
                    ancient Vedic belief. It is in his character as destroyer that Siva holds his
                    place in the triad, and that he must, no doubt, be identified with the Vedic
                    Rudra. Another very important function appears, however, to have been early
                    assigned to him, on which much more stress is laid in his modern worship—that of
                    destroyer being more especially exhibited in his consort—viz., the character of
                    a generative power, symbolized in the phallic emblem <hi rend="italic"
                        >(lingo)</hi> and in the sacred bull <hi rend="italic">(Nandi),</hi> the
                    favourite attendant of the god. This feature being entirely alien from the
                    nature of the Vedic god, it has been conjectured with some plausibility, that
                    the Z⅛yα-worship was originally prevalent among the non-Aryan population, and
                    was thence introduced into the worship of Öiva. On the other hand, there can, we
                    think, be little doubt that Siva, in his generative faculty, is the
                    representative of another Vedic god whose nature and attributes go far to
                    account for this particular feature of the modern deity, viz., <hi rend="italic"
                        >Püshan.</hi> This god, originally, no doubt, a solar deity, is frequently
                    invoked, as the lord of nourishment, to bestow food, wealth, and other
                    blessings. He is once, jointly with Soma, called the progenitor of heaven and
                    earth, and is connected with the marriage ceremony, where he is asked to lead
                    the bride to the bridegroom and make her prosperous <hi rend="italic"
                        >(lSivatama).</hi> Moreover, he has the epithet <hi rend="italic"
                        >kapardin</hi> (spirally braided), as have Rudra and the later Siva, and is
                    called <hi rend="italic">Pasupa,</hi> or guardian of cattle, whence the latter
                    derives his name <hi rend="italic">Pasvpati.</hi> But he is also a strong,
                    powerful, and even fierce and destructive god, who, with his goad or golden
                    spear, smites the foes of his worshipper, and thus in this respect offers at
                    least some points of similarity to Rudra, which may hare favoured the fusion of
                    the two gods. <hi rend="italic">Vishnu</hi> occupies already a place in the
                    Vedic mythology, though by no means one of such prominence as would entitle him
                    to that degree of exaltation implied in his character as one of the three
                    hypostases of the divinity. Moreover, although in his general nature, as a
                    benevolent, genial being, the Vedic god corresponds on the whole to the later
                    Vishnu, the preserver of the world, the latter exhibits many important features
                    for which w e look in vain in .his prototype, and which were most likely the
                    results of sectarian worship or of an amalgamation with local deities. In one or
                    two of them, such as his names Väsudeva and Vaikuntha, an attempt may again be
                    traced to identify Vishnu with Indra, who, as wm have seen, was one of the Vedic
                    triad of gods. The characteristic feature of the elder Vishnu is his measuring
                    the world with his three strides, which are explained as denoting either the
                    three stations of the sun at the time of rising, culminating, and setting, or
                    the triple manifestation of the luminous element, as the fire on earth, the
                    lightning in the atmosphere, and the sun in the <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0249-0208"/> heavens. The modern god is represented as
                    undergoing, for the benefit of mankind, a number of <hi rend="italic"
                        >avatäras</hi> or incarnations, ten of which are especially dwelt upon by
                    the fervid imagination of his followers. The exact time at which these several
                    episodes were incorporated into the cult of Vishnu cannot at present be
                    ascertained. As they are for the most part conceived in a decidedly Brâhmanical
                    spirit,—the special object for which Vishnu assumes a human form being generally
                    to deliver the people from the oppression of some wicked tyrannous prince,—it is
                    probable that they were mostly introduced at a time when there was still some
                    danger of the Kshatriyas defying the Brâhmanical rule. Of somewhat different
                    origin were, perhaps, two of Vishnu’s most popular and important incarnations,
                    viz., those in which he manifests himself in the persons of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Krishna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Räma,</hi> two heroes whose exploits are
                    celebrated in the Mahabharata and Bämäyana. It is possible that these warriors
                    and their legendary achievements had been favourite subjects of heroic poetry
                    for some time previous to the overthrow of the Kshatriyas, and that, being
                    already regarded by the latter as representatives of Vishnu, they were
                    afterwards recognized as such by the Brahmans, and thus gave rise to the system
                    of Avatäras.</p>
                <p>The male nature of the triad was supposed to require to be supplemented by each
                    of the three gods being associated with a female energy <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Sakti).</hi> Thus <hi rend="italic">Väch</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sarasvati,</hi> the goddess of speech and learning, came to be regarded as
                    the <hi rend="italic">4akti,</hi> or consort of Brahma; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sri</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lakshmi, “</hi> beauty, fortune,” as that of
                    Vishnu; and <hi rend="italic">Umä</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Parvati,</hi> the
                    daughter of <hi rend="italic">Himavat,</hi> the god of the Himalaya mountain, as
                    that of Öiva. On the other hand, it is not improbable that <hi rend="italic"
                        >Parvati,—</hi> who has a variety of other names, such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kâli</hi> (“the black one”), <hi rend="italic">Durgä</hi> (“the
                    inaccessible, terrible one”), <hi rend="italic">Mahä-devi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(“</hi> the great goddess”),—enjoyed already a somewhat extensive worship
                    of her own, and that there may thus have been good reason for assigning to her a
                    prominent place in the Brâhmanical system. In later times a special sect, that
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Säktas,</hi> or followers of any one of the <hi
                        rend="italic">iaktis,</hi> was principally devoted to her service; and up to
                    our own days an almost national festival, the <hi rend="italic">Durgäpüjä</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Dasarä,</hi> accompanied by sanguinary sacrifices, is
                    annually, in September or October, celebrated in her honour in Northern and
                    Western India.</p>
                <p>A compromise was thus effected between the esoteric doctrine of the metaphysician
                    and some of the most prevalent forms of popular worship, resulting in what was
                    henceforth to constitute the orthodox system of belief of the Brâhmanical
                    community. Yet the Vedic pantheon could not be altogether discarded, forming
                    part and parcel, as it did, of that sacred revelation (∕πtfi), which it had been
                    taught was the divine source of all religious and social law (⅛^mrz7z,
                    “tradition ”), and being, moreover, the foundation of the sacrificial ceremonial
                    on which the priestly authority so largely depended. The existence of the old
                    gods is therefore likewise recognized, but recognized in a very different way
                    from that of the triple divinity. For while the triad represents the immediate
                    manifestation of the eternal, infinite soul—while it constitutes, in fact, the
                    Brahma itself in its active relation to mundane and seemingly material
                    occurrences, the gods arc of this world, are individual spirits or portions of
                    the Brahma like men and other creatures, only higher in degree. To them an
                    intermediate sphere, the heaven of Indra (the <hi rend="italic">svarloka</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">svargd),</hi> is assigned to which man may raise himself
                    by fulfilling the holy ordinances; but they are subject to the same laws of
                    being; they, like men, are liable to be born again in some lower state, and
                    therefore, like them, yearn for emancipation from the necessity of future
                    individual existence. It is a sacred duty of man to worship these superior
                    beings by invocations and sacrificial observances, as it is to honour the <hi
                        rend="italic">pitris,</hi> the spirits of the departed ancestors. The dead,
                    on being judged by <hi rend="italic">Varna,</hi> the Pluto of Hindu mythology,
                    are supposed to be either passing through a term of enjoyment in a region midway
                    between the earth and the heaven of the gods, or undergoing their measure of
                    punishment in the nether world, situated somewhere in the southern region,
                    before they return to the earth to animate new bodies. In Vedic mythology Yama
                    was considered to have been the first mortal who died, and “espied the way to”
                    the celestial abodes, and in virtue of precedence to have become the ruler of
                    the departed; in some passages, however, he is already regarded as the god of
                    death. Although the pantheistic system allowed only a subordinate rank to the
                    old gods, and the actual religious belief of the people was probably but little
                    affected by their existence, they continued to occupy an important place in the
                    affections of the poet, and were still represented as exercising considerable
                    influence on the destinies of man. The most prominent of them were regarded as
                    the appointed <hi rend="italic">Lokapälas,</hi> or guardians of the world; and
                    as such they were made to preside over the four cardinal and (according to some
                    authorities) the intermediate points of the compass. Thus <hi rend="italic"
                        >Indra,</hi> the chief of the gods, was regarded as the regent of the East;
                        <hi rend="italic">Agni,</hi> the fire <hi rend="italic">(ignis),</hi> was in
                    the same way associated with the south-east; <hi rend="italic">Varna</hi> with
                    the south; <hi rend="italic">Sürya,</hi> the sun(Ήλιος), with the south-west <hi
                        rend="italic">; Varuna,</hi> originally the representative of the
                    all-embracing heaven (Ουρανός) or atmosphere, now the god of the ocean, with the
                    west <hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Väyu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(or</hi><hi rend="italic">Pavana)</hi> the wind, with the north-west; <hi
                        rend="italic">Kubera,</hi> the god of wealth, with the north; and <hi
                        rend="italic">Soma</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Chandra)</hi> with the
                    north-east. In the institutes of Manu the <hi rend="italic">Lokapälas</hi> are
                    represented as standing in close relation to the ruling king, who is said to be
                    composed of particles of these his tutelary deities. The retinue of Indra
                    consists chiefly of the <hi rend="italic">Gandharvas</hi> (etym. connected with
                        <hi rend="italic">κlvτavpo&lt;s),</hi> a class of genii, considered in the
                    epics as the celestial musicians; and their wives, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Apsaras,</hi> lovely nymphs, who are frequently employed by the gods to
                    make the pious devotee desist from carrying his austere practices to an extent
                    that might render him dangerous to their power. <hi rend="italic">Narada,</hi>
                    an ancient sage, is considered as the messenger between the gods and men, and as
                    having sprung from the forehead of Brahmâ. The interesting office of the God of
                    love is held by <hi rend="italic">Kämadeva,</hi> also called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ananga,</hi> the bodyless, because, as the myth relates, having once tried
                    by the power of his mischievous arrow to make Siva fall in love with Pârvatï,
                    whilst he was engaged in devotional practices, the urchin was reduced to ashes
                    by a glance of the angry god. Two other mythological figures of some importance
                    are considered as sons of Siva and Pârvatï, viz., <hi rend="italic"
                        >Karttikeya</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Skanda,</hi> the leader of the
                    heavenly armies, who was supposed to have been fostered by the six <hi

                <p>Orthodox Brâhmanical scholasticism makes the attainment of final emancipation <hi

                    divine essence. This knowledge can only be obtained by complete abstraction of
                    the mind from external objects and intense meditation on the divinity, which
                    again presupposes the total extinction of all sensual instincts by means of
                    austere practices <hi rend="italic">(tapas),</hi> The chosen few who succeed in
                    gaining complete mastery over their senses and a full knowledge of the divine

                    the body. Those devotees, on the other hand, who have still a residuum, however
                    slight, of ignorance and worldliness left in them at the time of their death,
                    pass to the world of Brahmâ, where their souls, invested with subtile corporeal
                    frames, await their reunion with the <pb break="no"

                    the foundation of the Brâhmanical belief found its earliest systematic
                    exposition in the <hi rend="italic">Mïmânsâ</hi> philosophy, Inasmuch as its
                    tenets were supposed to be in perfect harmony with the sacred scriptures, the

                    of philosophy. It divided itself into two parts or branches, viz., the <hi

                    speculative portions, the Upanishads. But other <hi rend="italic">dar</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">fanas,</hi> or philosophical systems, were started, which,
                    though admitted into the pale of orthodoxy, were yet considered as not
                    altogether compatible with a belief in the revealed character of the scriptures.
                    These were the <hi rend="italic">Sânkhya</hi> school, founded by <hi
                        rend="italic">Kapila,</hi> with its more modern branch, the theistic <hi
                        rend="italic">Yoga</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Patanjali;</hi> and the
                    dialectic <hi rend="italic">Nyâya</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Gotama,</hi> with
                    the atomistic <hi rend="italic">Vaiseshika</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kanada.</hi> The time at which these several schools originated is still
                    very uncertain; but it is highly probable that at least the two <hi
                        rend="italic">Mïmânsâs</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Sânkhya</hi> preceded
                    Buddhism. The Vedanta seemed to be unable satisfactorily to account for the
                    origin of matter, the existence of which its followers in later times found
                    themselves compelled altogether to deny, and to declare to be a mere illusion
                        <hi rend="italic">(mâyâ)</hi> produced by imperfect knowledge of the soul.
                        <hi rend="italic">Kapila</hi> cut the knot by proclaiming the eternal
                    existence of a material principle, unconscious, but endowed with volition in
                    regard to its own development; from it all matter had emanated, and into it it
                    would ultimately resolve itself. He called it <hi rend="italic">Pradhâna,</hi> {
                        <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> principal” thing) or <hi rend="italic"
                        >müla-Prakriti</hi><hi rend="italic">(“</hi> original nature ”). By the side
                    of this plastic element he recognizes the existence of a primary spiritual
                    essence <hi rend="italic">(ätman,</hi> “soul,” or <hi rend="italic">purusha,
                        “</hi> person ”), which is not one but manifold, and has from all beginning
                    entered into matter. It is in itself unintelligent; but being in the first place
                    indued with a subtile body termed the “great one” <hi rend="italic"
                        >(mahat),</hi> which consists of intelligence <hi rend="italic"
                        >(buddhi),</hi> and is the first emanation of plastic nature, it thereby
                    receives the faculty of knowing. A being composed only of these elements is the
                    Sânkhya deity which is thus partly material, its subtile body <hi rend="italic"
                        >(buddhi)</hi> being the secondary source of all further developments. The
                    immediate production of the intellectual principle is the <hi rend="italic"
                        >ahankâra</hi><hi rend="italic">(“</hi> I-making,” <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> egotism, selfconsciousness), which, combined with the spiritual
                    element, constitutes the intelligent, self-conscious, individual soul. In this
                    way Kapila derives all that exists from twenty-five principles (including the
                    two primary essences), perfect knowledge of which qualifies the soul for
                    emancipation from its connection with matter, the source of all pain. By
                    predicating volition of the spiritual principle and withholding it from matter,
                    the eternal existence of which he likewise recognized, Patanjali became the
                    founder of the theistic <hi rend="italic">(ses'vara)</hi> Sânkhya <hi
                        rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the system <hi rend="italic">with</hi> a god, <hi
                        rend="italic">Svara)</hi>; whereas Kapila’s doctrine was termed <hi
                        rend="italic">nirïSvara.</hi> atheistical. The <hi rend="italic">Nyâya,</hi>
                    including the <hi rend="italic">VaiSeshika,</hi> on the other hand, represents
                    the universe as having emanated from nine primary substances, five of them—viz.,
                    earth, water, light, air, and mind <hi rend="italic">(manas∖—</hi> existing
                    eternally in the form of atoms; three (ether, time, and place) being one and
                    infinite; and soul <hi rend="italic">(âiman)</hi> being either one and infinite
                    as the supreme spirit, the omniscient Lord <hi rend="italic">(jSvard),</hi> or
                    manifold in the shape of the vital spirit of animate beings (JΣm&lt;mαπ).</p>
                <p>The teachings of these piasters, especially those of Kapila, were thus decidedly
                    antagonistic to the doctrine of an omnipotent creator of the world on which the
                    Brâhmanical system was based. So far, however, from acknowledging their
                    heterodoxy, they never failed to fall back on the Veda, as the revealed source
                    of religious belief, to establish the truth of their theories; and so much had
                    liberty of speculative thought become a matter of tradition and necessity, that
                    no attempt seems ever to have been made by the leading theological party to put
                    down such heretical doctrines, so long as the sacred character of the privileges
                    of their caste was not openly called in question. Yet internal dissensions on
                    such cardinal points of belief could not but weaken the authority of the
                    hierarchical body; and as they spread beyond the narrow bounds of Brâhmanical
                    schools, it wanted but a man of moral and intellectual powers, and untrammelled
                    with class prejudices, to render them fatal to priestly pretensions. Such a man
                    arose in the person of a <hi rend="italic">Sâkya,</hi> prince of <hi
                        rend="italic">Kapilavastu, Gautama,</hi> the founder of Buddhism (about the
                    5th or 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> Had it only been for the
                    philosophical tenets of Buddha, they need scarcely have caused, and probably did
                    not cause, any great uneasiness to the orthodox theologians. He did, indeed, go
                    one step beyond Kapila, by altogether denying the existence of the soul as a
                    substance, and admitting only certain intellectual faculties as attributes of
                    the body, perishable with it. Yet the conception which Buddha substituted for
                    the trans-migratory soul,—viz., that of <hi rend="italic">karma</hi> (“deed”),
                    as the sum total of the individual’s good and bad actions, being the
                    determinative element of the form of his future existence, might have been
                    treated like any other speculative theory, but for the practical conclusions he
                    drew from it. Buddha recognized the institution of caste, and accounted for the
                    social inequalities attending on it as being the effects of <hi rend="italic"
                        >karma</hi> in former existences. On the other hand he altogether denied the
                    revealed character of the Veda and the efficacy of the Brâhmanical ceremonies
                    deduced from it, and rejected the claims of the sacerdotal class to be the
                    repositaries and divinely appointed teachers of sacred knowledge. That Buddha
                    never questioned the truth of the Brâhmanical theory of transmigration shows
                    that this early product of speculative thought had become firmly rooted in the
                    Hindu mind as a point of belief amounting to a moral conviction. To the Hindu
                    philosopher this doctrine seemed to account satisfactorily for the apparent
                    essential similarity of the vital element in all animate beings, no less than
                    for what elsewhere has led honest and logical thinkers to the stern dogma of
                    predestination. The belief in eternal bliss or punishment, as the just
                    recompense of man’s actions during this brief term of human life, which their
                    less reflective forefathers had at one time held, appeared to them to involve a
                    moral impossibility. The equality <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> of all men,
                    which Buddha preached with regard to the final goal, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >nirvâna,</hi> or extinction of <hi rend="italic">karma</hi> and thereby of
                    all future existence and pain, and that goal to be reached, not by the
                    performance of penance and sacrificial worship, but by practising virtue, could
                    not fail to be acceptable to many people. It would be out of place here to dwell
                    on the rapid progress and internal development of the new doctrine. Suffice it
                    to say that, owing no doubt greatly to the sympathizing patronage of ruling
                    princes, Buddhism appears to have been the state religion in most parts of India
                    during the early centuries of our era. To what extent it became the actual creed
                    of the body of» the people it will probably be impossible ever to ascertain. One
                    of the chief effects it produced on the worship of the old gods was the rapid
                    decline of the authority of the orthodox Brâhmanical dogma, and a considerable
                    development of sectarianism. Among the great variety of deities of the pantheon,
                        <hi rend="italic">Siva, Vishnu,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pürvatï</hi> have
                    since claimed <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n251/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0251-0210"/> by far the largest share of adoration, and it
                    is in special accounts of the <hi rend="italic">8aiva, Vaishnava,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Sâkta</hi> sects rather than in an exposition of the
                    Brähmanical belief, that the religious history of India from about the beginning
                    of our era can be dealt with satisfactorily. At that time the worship of Vishnu
                    in his most popular avatar, in the person of <hi rend="italic">Krishna,</hi>
                    appears to have received much countenance at the hands of the priests, with a
                    view of counteracting the growing influence of Buddhism. The sectarian spirit
                    gave gradually rise to a special class of works, the modern <hi rend="italic"
                        >Puränas</hi> composed for the express purpose of promoting the worship of
                    some particular deity. In the 8th or 9th century <hi rend="italic"
                        >&amp;ankara-ächärya,</hi> a Malabar Brahman of the Saiva sect and Vedanta
                    school of philosophy, made an attempt, by engaging in controversy with the
                    leaders of various sects, to restore the Brähmanical system of belief to its
                    former imposing position. His example and teachings seem to have ^inspired the
                    Brähmanical community with a good deal of religious zeal, and even fanaticism,
                    and thus to have greatly contributed to the final overthrow of the Buddhists. In
                    the 7th century the authority of <hi rend="italic">Säkya-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >muni’s</hi> doctrine was already on the wane, as is evident from Hiouen
                    Thsang’s complaints of the number of ruined temples and deserted monasteries,
                    and the great proportion of heretics. At the time of Sankara its decline must
                    have been still more advanced, and a few more centuries probably sufficed to
                    make the last living remains of the Buddhist faith disappear from the continent
                    of India; except, indeed, in Nepal, where it prevails to this day. There also
                    still exists in India a very important sect which seems to have early branched
                    off from the Buddhist doctrine, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Jains.</hi>
                    Although, in the long run, Buddhism has been unable to maintain the ground it
                    had won from the Brahmans, the humanizing spirit of its doctrines has left a
                    deep impress on the Hindü mind. One of the practical and least salutary effects
                    it has produced is the adoption of monastic institutions by most of the
                    Brähmanical sects. The <hi rend="italic">maths</hi> or convents, in which a
                    considerable portion of the clergy of the various religious bodies reside
                    together, are presided over by <hi rend="italic">mahdnts</hi> or superiors, and
                    are scattered all over India. 6ankara founded several establishments of, this
                    kind in various parts, especially one still existing at Sringeri, on the Western
                    Ghats. In spite of its levelling tendencies, Buddhism seems never to have
                    succeeded in checking the further development of the caste system. At the time
                    of Sankara seventy-two mixed classes, or eighteen subdivisions of each of the
                    four original castes, are said to have existed, and ever since they have become
                    more and more numerous. Indeed, there can be no doubt that Hindüs do not feel,
                    and perhaps never felt, their class restrictions as being in any way burdensome,
                    or still less a disgrace to them, and that even the lowest man looks upon his
                    caste as a privilege as high as that of the Brähman. In the opinion of the
                    Brahmans only one original caste is now extant, viz., their own, all the others
                    having resulted from successive intermixtures.</p>
                <p>Mr Sherring, in his <hi rend="italic">Hindu Tribes and Castes,</hi> makes the
                    following remarks on the Brähmanical caste at the present day :—“The Brahman
                    occupies the highest rank among Hindus for at least three reasons. The first is
                    his assumed sanctity. By the people generally he is regarded as a pure,
                    stainless, twice-born being, divine as well as human, worthy of unbounded
                    admiration and worship. He is the priest of the Hindu religion, directing the
                    ceremonies performed at the temples, sacred wells, sacred tanks, sacred rivers,
                    and at all hallowed places throughout the land. He is present to sanction, and
                    give effect to, the great social festivals of his countrymen held at marriages,
                    at births of sons, and at deaths. He casts the horoscope, tells the lucky days,
                    gives spiritual counsel, whispers <hi rend="italic">mantras</hi> or mysterious
                    words, executes magical incantations and charms, and is at once household god,
                    family priest, and general preceptor and guide in behalf of the many millions of
                    Hindus residing in the vast country lying between the Himalayas and Cape
                    Comorin. The second reason of the Brahman’s superiority is that, for many ages,
                    perhaps from the outset of his career, when with other Aryans he first entered
                    the plains of India, he has been intellectually in advance of the rest of the
                    Hindu race. . . . The third reason is a consequent of the second. The Brahman is
                    not only a thinking, but also a reading man. He possesses and, perhaps, reads
                    the holy canon—Vedas, Shastras, and Puränas. He has been the author of Hindu
                    literature. . . . Light of complexion, his forehead ample, his countenance of
                    striking significance, his lips thin, and mouth expressive, his eyes quick and
                    sharp, his fingers long, his carriage noble and almost sublime, the true
                    Brahman, uncontaminated by European influence and manners, with his intense
                    self-consciousness, with the proud conviction of superiority depicted in every
                    muscle of his face, and manifest in every movement of his body, is a wonderful
                    specimen of humanity walking on God’s earth. Yet the Brahman has lived his day.
                    His prestige is rapidly on the decline, and is only maintained at its ancient
                    pitch in remote villages and in the fastnesses of superstition in great cities.
                    Here, as of old, it envelopes him like a glory. But the further he moves from
                    such places, the more dim becomes the glory until it fades away altogether.
                    Education and other influences are treating the Brahman roughly. Y et the fault
                    is his own. He has had a better start by reason of his great natural endowments
                    than any Hindu of the other castes below him; but he has neglected his
                    opportunities. I fear he has been too proud, too self-satisfied to avail himself
                    of them.”</p>
                <p>On the modern observance of religious duties Professor Wilson remarks :—“Now it
                    is true that in the present constitution of Indian society the distribution of
                    the periods of life, beyond that of the student, is never regarded except by a
                    few, who prefer a life of lazy mendicity, or by some half-crazed enthusiast, who
                    thinks it possible to realize the letter of the law. The great body of the
                    people, Brahmans included, pursue their worldly avocations as long as their
                    faculties permit, spend the decline of life in the bosom of their families, and
                    die peaceably and decently at home. But although the practice is discontinued,
                    the doctrine remains and influences opinion; and devotional ceremonies,
                    pilgrimage, penance, and abstract contemplation have an undue preponderance in
                    the estimation of the people, even the best informed among them, over active
                    duties and the precepts of morality. As to the common people they have a still
                    lower scale, and they find a ready substitute for the inconveniences of all
                    moral restraint in the fervour of that faith which they place in Vishnu, and the
                    unwearied perseverance with which they train a parrot or a starling to repeat
                    his names, to articulate Krishna-Rädhä, or Sitä-Räm.”</p>
                <p>The study of the ancient literature of the Hindüs has taught us that some
                    practices which have hitherto, or until recently, prevailed in India, and which
                    have contributed so much to bringing Hindü morals into disrepute, are but
                    comparatively modern innovations. Thus, the rite of <hi rend="italic"
                        >suttee</hi> (properly <hi rend="italic">sati, i.e.,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     superscript"> it</hi> the faithful wife ”),
                    or voluntary immolation of widows, which was abolished some thirty years ago
                    with considerable difficulty, seems to have sprung up originally as a local
                    habit among the Kshatriyas, and, on becoming more and more prevalent, to have at
                    length received Brähmanical sanction. The alleged conformity of the rite to the
                    Hindu scriptures has been shown to have rested chiefly on a misquotation, if not
                    an intentional garbling, of a certain passage of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >lligveda,</hi> which, so far from authorizing the concremation of the
                    widow, bids her <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n252/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0252-0211"/> return from the funeral pile to her home and
                    resume her worldly duties.</p>
                <p>Cases of infanticide are still, unfortunately, too common in many parts of India,
                    especially among the Rajputs. To the honour of the priests be it said, however,
                    that they have never sanctioned this abominable practice. Its origin has, it
                    appears, to be sought in the enormoue extravagance of wedding feasts, and a
                    mistaken notion of parents being disgraced by their daughters remaining
                    husbandless. Hence also the practice of early marriages, which is the more
                    mischievous, as Hindu law does not allow widows to remarry.</p>
                <p>The cow has been held in high honour in India from early times. This religious
                    feeling was not, however, carried formerly to the extreme to which it is carried
                    now-a-days, when the slaughtering and eating the flesh of kine is considered as
                    one of the most heinous crimes. It has, on the contrary, been shown conclusively
                    by a Hindü scholar, that beef formed in former times a staple article of food in
                    India, and that in showing hospitality to an honoured guest it played as
                    prominent a part “as did the killing of the fatted calf among the Jews.”</p>
