                    astronomers, he began to look upon astronomy as something divine; and having
                    purchased the <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides</hi> of Stadius, he gained some
                    knowledge of the theory of the planets. In 1562 he was sent by his uncle to
                    Leipsic to study law; but astronomy wholly engrossed his thoughts, and he
                    employed all his pocket-money in purchasing books on that science. Having
                    procured a small celestial globe, he used to wait till his tutor went to bed, in
                    order to examine the constellations and learn their names; and when the sky was
                    clear, he spent whole nights in viewing the stars. He returned to Denmark in
                    1565, but soon left for Wittenberg, whence he was driven by the plague to
                    Rostock. There in the following year his choleric disposition involved him in a
                    duel with a Danish nobleman, in which he had the misfortune to lose part of his
                    nose; but this defect he so skilfully supplied by means of gold, silver, and
                    wax, that it w as scarcely perceptible. In 1569 he took up his residence at
                    Augsburg and remained there two years, busily engaged in astronomical and
                    chemical researches. In 1571 he returned to Denmark, and was favoured by his
                    maternal uncle Steno Belle with a convenient place at his castle of Herritzvad
                    near Knudstorp for making his observations, and building a laboratory. But his
                    marrying a peasant girl occasioned a violent quarrel between him and his
                    relatives, and the king was obliged to interpose in order to reconcile them. In
                    1574, by royal command, he read some lectures at Copenhagen; and the year
                    following he began his travels through Germany, and proceeded as far as Venice.
                    He then resolved to remove his family, and settle at Basel; but Frederick IL,
                    unwilling that Denmark should lose the honour of his residence, bestowed upon
                    him for life the Island of Huen in the Sound, for the erection of an observatory
                    and laboratory, and conferred on him a fee in Norway, a pension of two thousand
                    crowns out of the treasury, and the canonry of Roschild, which brought him a
                    thousand more. The first stone of the observatory was laid on the 8th of August
                    1576. James VI. of Scotland, afterwards James I. of England, on his visit to
                    Denmark to marry the Princess Anne, went to see Tycho Brahe in his retirement at
                    Uranienburg, made him several presents, and wrote some verses in his praise.
                    Soon after the death of King Frederick, the astronomer was deprived of his
                    pension, fee, and canonry. Finding himself unable to defray the expenses of his
                    observatory he went to Copenhagen, whither he carried some of his instruments,
                    and continued his astronomical observations in that city, till, by the order of
                    Christian IV., he was obliged to discontinue them. He then removed his family to
                    Rostock, and afterwards to Holstein in order to solicit Henry Ranzau to
                    introduce him to the emperor; and accordingly he was received by Rudolph II. at
                    Prague with the most gratifying marks of respect. That prince gave him a
                    magnificent house till he could procure for him one better fitted for
                    astronomical observations, assigned him a pension of three thousand crowns, and
                    promised, upon the first opportunity, a fee for him and his descendants. But he
                    did not long enjoy his good fortune; for, on the 24th of October 1601, he died
                    of a strangury, in the 55th year of his age. He was interred in a magnificent
                    manner in the principal church at Prague, where a noble monument was erected to
                    his memory. Shortly before his death he had been joined by Kepler, who owes his
                    fame to the lessons of careful observation and cautious inference impressed on
                    him by Tycho.</p>
