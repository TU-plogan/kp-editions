                    >bouton,</hi> a small piece of metal or other material used to connect different
                    parts of a garment together by means of a button-hole, and also used for
                    ornamentation. These apparently insignificant articles have produced a great
                    alteration in our style of dress, for without them it would have been impossible
                    to have reduced the flowing robes of our forefathers into our present simple
                    costume. By this process we have lost the picturesque, as far as our garments
                    are concerned, but have gained in compactness and utility. Indeed, the
                    occupations of the present age could not be carried on in the togas and dresses
                    of ancient times. The button manufacture did not assume any special form until
                    towards the close of the reign of Elizabeth. In paintings, commencing with the
                    14th century, studs or buttons appear as ornaments on the dresses of both sexes;
                    but they were ornaments merely, being drawn without button-holes, and placed
                    where they could serve no practical purpose. They are in general represented as
                    of gold or ivory. At the commencement of the 17th century the trade had greatly
                    increased, but the making of buttons by the needle seems to have been the
                    principal method.</p>
                <p>Matthew Boulton, who became the senior partner in the afterwards celebrated firm
                    of Boulton and Watt, as early as 1745, introduced great improvements in the
                    manufacture of buttons, particularly inlaid and steel. When the Soho Works were
                    established near Birmingham, one of the departments was occupied in making steel
                    buttons with facets, that produced a hundred and forty guineas the gross. Gilt
                    buttons came into fashion shortly after the accession of George III. A large
                    shipping trade in buttons was then carried on with the Continent and America,
                    and the workmen’s wages at Birmingham averaged from <hi rend="italic">£2</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">£4 per</hi> week. John Taylor, originally a cabinetmaker,
                    appears to have had a principal hand in promoting improvements in this industry
                    at that time, as far as gilt, plated, and lacquered buttons are concerned. The
                    value of those turned out weekly in his establishment is said to have been about
                    £800. Ralph Heaton improved the making of shanks, a separate branch, shortly
                    before the commencement of the present century.</p>
                <p>The metal button trade was in a very flourishing condition, when, indirectly,
                    Lord Nelson may be said to have been the means of overthrowing it. The late B.
                    Sanders was in easy circumstances in Denmark when he was ruined by the
                    bombardment of Copenhagen under our great naval commander. Sanders then came to
                    Birmingham to seek such competence as energy and perseverance could afford. He
                    started in the button manufacture, at first in a small way, introducing a
                    covered button made of cloth or lasting, with an iron shank. His son, of the
                    same name, invented a flexible shank button, that is, one with a tuft of canvas
                    protruding from the back instead of a shank, through which the needle could pass
                    in any direction. It was patented in 1825 and had an enormous sale. The Sanders
                    took out another patent for a similar button covered with silk. A fancy silk
                    button with a central ornament was patented by William Elliott in 1837, which
                    had a great run, so much so that sixty looms were employed in London in making
                    the special material required; and Elliott secured a fortune, although his
                    patent was contested and many imitations were started. But all these kinds of
                    buttons were found to wear on the edges, to remedy which John Chatwin patented a
                    corded edge button. It is said that horn buttons were used as early as 1801, but
                    we find from old Birmingham directories that there were horn-button makers as
                    far back as 1777. At the former period the commonest qualities were 5jd. per
                    gross. Hutton in his <hi rend="italic">History of Birmingham</hi> refers to “our
                    grandmothers” wearing horn buttons nearly the size of a crown piece. The hoof or
                    horn button is cut into form and dyed and pressed into beautiful designs. This
                    great improvement, however, appears to have been effected by Μ. Emile Bassot of
                    Paris, who introduced important changes resulting in material progress. The
                    manufacture is still prosecuted in England, but it is of secondary
                    importance.</p>
                <p>The materials of which buttons are made are as various as their forms. Gold,
                    silver, and other metals, glass, porcelain, horn, bone, india-rubber,
                    mother-of-pearl, and other nacreous productions of shell-fish,<note

                    various parts of the world, and vary considerably in price. The white-edged
                    Macassar are the best; the yellow-edged Manilla the next. Those from the Persian
                    Gulf and Red Sea vary much in value, which depends upon the purposes to which
                    they can be applied. Those from the Pacific are beautiful, but, being generally
                    dark in colour, their value is much affected by the turns of fashion. The
                    “Panama shells” are the least valuable, and are generally only used for inferior
                    sorts of buttons.</p></note> various woods, vegetable ivory, &amp;c.,<note

                    brocade, twist, velvet, silk, mohair, &amp;c. The Birmingham <hi rend="italic"
                    >Directory ior</hi> 1784 mentions paper buttons; and, according to the same
                    authority, a button was produced by “an artist of eminence,” which was inlaid
                    with divers other metals; it was first attempted about sixty years Γ previously;
                    and then, “though in no respect so complete as at present, met with great and
                    merited encouragement.” Buttons have been often expensively jewelled, and the
                    gold and silver are plain or ornamented, sometimes resembling drops in
                    filigree-work. There was one in use in England about the middle of the last
                    century <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n670/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0670-0599"/> formed of polished brass and ruled with such fine
                    lines that light was reflected in prismatic colours. Some buttons have fetched
                    enormous prices, even when made of what is now a common material.
                    Mother-of-pearl buttons have been sold at a guinea each. In 1790 Henry Clay of
                    Birmingham patented a method of manufacturing buttons of slate or slit stone;
                    and, in 1800, Joseph Barnett introduced a button with two shanks or other
                    fastenings on one button.</p>
                <p>Such was the origin of the button industry in England, and other nations have not
                    been behind. The <hi rend="italic">Scientific American</hi> gives the following
                    account of its commencement in the United States:—</p>
                <p>“The first manufacturer of buttons in this country was Samuel Williston. While he
                    was dragging along as a country storekeeper,—his eyes having failed him while
                    studying for the ministry,—his wife bethought her that she could cover by hand
                    the wooden buttons of the time, and thus earn an honest penny. From this the
                    couple advanced in their ambition until they had perfected machinery for
                    covering buttons, the first employed in this country. From this sprang an
                    immense factory, and then others, until Samuel Williston made half the buttons
                    of the world. His factories are still running at Easthampton, coining wealth for
                    the proprietors. .... He is now (1871) between seventy and eighty years of age,
                    is worth five or six millions, and has given four hundred thousand dollars to
                    Easthampton for a seminary and for churches; two hundred thousand dollars to
                    South Hadley Female seminary; and two hundred thousand dollars to Amherst
                    College, besides lesser gifts.”</p>
                <p>The factories of Samuel Williston &lt;fc Co., above referred to, at Easthampton,
                    Massachusetts, were established about the year 1848, and give employment to
                    about 250 operatives. The annual cost of the materials used is estimated at
                    $75,000, and the value of the produce exceeds $200,000. The button manufacture
                    is also carried on extensively in New York and Philadelphia, and at Waterbury
                    (Conn.). Buttons are also imported extensively. There are five importers in New
                    York (1876). Joel Hayden of Haydenville began to make flexible buttons in the
                    States in the year 1834.</p>
                <p>Other countries have not been backward in this branch of industry. Bohemia,
                    particularly at Prague and the neighbouring towns, is the great seat of the
                    glass button manufacture, and great numbers are made in France. The porcelain
                    button manufacture has been taken possession of by France, Minton and Co., the
                    celebrated Staffordshire firm, who worked the invention of R. Prosser of
                    Birmingham, having been driven out of the field by the good work, attended by
                    greater cheapness, of the foreign makers. There is one factory at Milan, and
                    great numbers of the cheaper kinds of buttons are made in the Rhenish provinces
                    of Prussia. Vienna has suppressed the competition of English makers in some
                    kinds of pearl buttons. Its operations in this branch are of a most extensive
                    character, quite rivalling those of Birmingham.</p>
                <p>“Button making,” says the Birmingham <hi rend="italic">Directory</hi> for 1777,
                    “was originally a very tedious and expensive process. The button consisted of
                    one solid piece of metal; and the ornaments upon the face of it were the work of
                    an engraver. To obviate this, the press, stamp, and engine for turning the
                    moulds were invented. This led to other improvements, the bones and hoofs of
                    animals were introduced into the manufacture; by these various means the prices
                    of buttons were reduced.”</p>
                <p>In the manufacture of covered buttons the sheet-iron is first scaled by the use
                    of acids, and then cut into proper shape and size by a machine. The neck or
                    collet of the button is japanned after having been stamped and cut. The hollow
                    between the neck and shell is filled in with brown paper or button board. When
                    the parts are put together they are pressed, which brings them into shape and
                    consolidates them.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible in the space that could be devoted to the subject here, to
                    describe in detail the various modes in which the numerous forms of buttons are
                    manufactured,—especially as it would require elaborate illustration. We must,
                    therefore, confine ourselves to noticing some of the special and more recent
                    patents, referring the reader to works where he can obtain such further
                    information as he may require. In 1840 Joseph Parkes took out a patent for
                    improvements in the manufacture of covered buttons made by dies and pressure, by
                    the application of horn as a covering material. Harris’s patent for improvements
                    in horn buttons and their dies was obtained in April 1841. This invention
                    related to applying flexible shanks to horn buttons, a mode of ornamentation by
                    inlaying the front surfaces, and also gilding or silvering their surfaces, and
                    to a mode of constructing dies so as to facilitate the process of engraving, the
                    die being also so formed that the horn or hoof employed could not be expressed
                    outside the circumference of the button. Hugh Willoch’s patent, dated 5th May
                    1874, related to a button with a removable head to enable the shank to pass
                    through the button hole. The head is hollow and is partly filled with
                    caoutchouc. It is perforated to admit the shank top, a short transverse bar
                    which, on being turned one-fourth round, falls into an internal groove in the
                    material of the button head, and is retained in that position by the elasticity
                    of the india-rubber. Empson and Palmer’s patent, dated 4th July 1874, refers to
                    improvements in linen buttons, and is also applicable to buttons covered with
                    other fabrics. They are composed of a front and back shell, with a bar formed
                    across the face of a raised concentric circle from the back shell (which is all
                    the metal that need be visible in the finished button), the shells permitting
                    ample room for the covering fabrics to be gathered in and held between them.
                    They are considered to resist the injury common to linen buttons during the
                    processes of washing, mangling, and ironing. Tylor’s patent, of 13th July 1874,
                    relates to polishing ivory, bone, and similar buttons in a revolving drum with
                    revolving brushes inside. Harrison’s invention (8th September 1874) consists in
                    arranging the piercing tools, so that the thread holes for the buttons are made
                    in the pierced metal in front of the shaping and cutting-out tools, and the
                    metal around the groups of piercings is shaped or “domed,” and cut out. The
                    result is that at each descent of the compound tool three or more groups of the
                    thread holes are pierced in the sheet metal, and three or more finished buttons
                    are made. The piercings in the sheet metal made by the last descent of the
                    compound tool form the thread holes of the buttons made by the next descent of
                    the said compound tool. When the threadholes of the button are made in a central
                    depression, a shaping tool for making the said depression is placed between each
                    piercing tool and cutting-out tool. This invention is also applicable to the
                    manufacture of washers, rings, links for chains, and ’ other like articles from
                    sheetmetal. The patent of G. F. Champorez of Berlin, Prussia, relates to
                    improvements in the manufacture of steel or iron and steel dies, and to certain
                    contrivances for producing the same, the said dies being in depression or
                    relief, without recourse to the hitherto universally employed engraving tool.
                    Cole’s patent (10th February 1875) relates to a composition for dress-fastenings
                    generally, consisting of black composition of equal parts by weight of gas tar
                    or tar varnish, whiting or chalk or clay, and lamp black or vegetable black. For
                    a coloured composition transparent varnish, or the waste refuse of it, is
                    substituted for gas tar or tar varnish, and a powdered pigment of the required
                    colour is added. The materials should be thoroughly mixed and converted into a
                    plastic, pasty mass, which is consolidated and hardened by rolling and drying.

                <p>Messrs Green, Cadbury, &amp; Richards, Birmingham, manufacture a linen button
                    called “The very Button <hi rend="superscript"> υ</hi> (Shakespeare), in
                    addition to others of innumerable kinds, and studs for shirts, collars, and
                    wristbands, not only of plain materials but of gold and silver and jewelled.
                    They employ about 400 hands, and turn out weekly from 10,000 to 15,000 gross (12
                    dozen to the gross) of their linen buttons. The proprietors of this
                    establishment take great interest in the welfare of their workpeople, and few of
                    the adults have been in their employment less than from eight to eighteen years.
                    There is a sick club in connection with the works, and a library containing at
                    present about 1000 volumes. Fines are inflicted for certain irregularities;
                    these, however, are not appropriated by the firm, but are expended, half in the
                    purchase of books, and half as a contribution to the sick club.</p>
