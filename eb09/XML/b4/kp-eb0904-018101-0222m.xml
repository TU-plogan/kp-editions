                <p><label type="entry">BOWRING, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John</hi></label>, an
                    eminent English linguist, translator, political economist, and miscellaneous
                    writer, was born at Exeter, October 17, 1792. He was a descendant of an old
                    Puritan family; and he became in early life an ardent disciple in the school of
                    utilitarianism and philosophical radicalism, whose prophet was Jeremy Bentham.
                    He did not, however, share his master’s contempt for poetry and the belles
                    lettres, but was a diligent student of literature and foreign languages,
                    especially those of Eastern Europe. His attainments as a linguist were of
                    remarkable extent. He stated that he knew two hundred languages and could speak
                    one hundred. This, of course, does not mean more than that he had some slight
                    acquaintance with them; but it is certain that he had a pretty good knowledge of
                    forty, and these were languages of various classes. This gives him a place, with
                    Mezzofanti and Von Gabelentz, among the greatest linguists of the world. The
                    first fruits of his study of foreign literature appeared in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Specimens of the Russian Poets,</hi> published in two volumes in 1821-23. These
                    were speedily followed by <hi rend="italic">Batavian Anthology</hi> (1824), <hi
                    rend="italic">Ancient Poetry and Romances of Spain</hi> (1824), <hi
                    rend="italic">Specimens of the Polish Poets,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Servian
                    Popular Poetry,</hi> both in 1827. During this period he began to contribute to
                    the newly-founded <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review, of</hi> which he was
                    appointed editor in 1825. By his contributions to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Review</hi> he obtained considerable reputation as political economist and
                    parliamentary reformer. He advocated in its pages the cause of free trade long
                    before it was popularized by the eloquence of Richard Cobden and John Bright. He
                    pleaded earnestly in behalf of parliamentary reform, Catholic emancipation, and
                    popular education. In 1828 he visited Holland, and during his stay there the
                    university of Groningen conferred on him the degree of doctor of laws. In the
                    following year he was in Denmark, occupying himself with preparations for the
                    publication of a collection of Scandinavian poetry. Bowring, who had been the
                    trusted friend of Bentham during his life, was appointed his literary executor,
                    and was charged with the task of preparing a collected edition of his works.
                    This appeared in eleven volumes in the years 1838 aud 1839. Meanwhile Bowring
                    had entered Parliament in 1835 as member for Kilmarnock; and in the following
                    year he was appointed head of a Government commission to be sent to France to
                    inquire into the actual state of commerce between the two countries. He was
                    engaged in similar investigations in Switzerland, Italy, Syria, and some of the
                    German States. The results of these missions appeared in a series of reports
                    laid before the House of Commons. After a retirement of four years he sat in
                    Parliament from 1841 till 1849 as member for Bolton. During this busy period he
                    found leisure for literature, and published in 1843 a translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Manuscript of the Queen's Court,</hi> a collection of old Bohemian
                    lyrics, &amp;c. In 1849 he was appointed British consul at Hong-Kong, and
                    superintendent of trade iu China, a post which ho held for four years. After his
                    return he distinguished himself as an advocate of the decimal system, and
                    published a work entitled, <hi rend="italic">The Decimal System in Numbers,
                    Coins, and Accounts</hi> (1854). The introduction of the florin as a preparatory
                    step was chiefly due to his efforts. Knighted in 1854, he was again sent the
                    same year to Hong-kong as governor, invested with the supreme military and naval
                    power. It was during his governorship that a dispute broke out with the Chinese;
                    and the irritation caused by his “spirited” or high-handed policy led to the
                    second war with China. In 1855 he visited Siam, and negotiated with the king a
                    treaty of commerce. After the usual five years of service he retired and
                    received a pension. His last employment by the English Government was as a
                    commissioner to Italy in 1861, to report on our commercial relations with the
                    new kingdom. Sir John Bowring subsequently accepted the appointment of minister
                    plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary from the Hawaiian Government to the
                    courts of Europe, and in this capacity negotiated treaties with Belgium,
                    Holland, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. In addition to the works already named
                    he published— <hi rend="italic">Poetry of the Magyars</hi> (1830); <hi
                    rend="italic">Cheskian Anthology</hi> (1832); <hi rend="italic">The Kingdom and
                    People of Siam</hi> (1859); a translation of <hi rend="italic">Peter
                    Schlemihl;</hi> translations from the Hungarian poet·, Alexander Petöfi (1866);
                    and various pamphlets. He was elected F.R.S. and F.R.G.S., and received the
                    decorations of several foreign orders of knighthood. Bowring was twice married;
                    his second wife survived him, with several sons, who have attained distinction
                    in various fields. He died at Claremont, near Exeter, November 23, 1872.</p>
