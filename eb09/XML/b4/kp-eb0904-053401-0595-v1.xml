                        Thomas</hi></label> (1756-1837), bishop of Salisbury, was born at Odiham, in
                    Hampshire. He was educated at Winchester, and in 1775 he removed to Oxford,
                    where he gained a scholarship at Corpus Christi College. Before graduating, he
                    edited a reprint of Burton’s <hi rend="italic">Pentalogia.</hi> In 1781 he
                    brought out an edition of Dawes’s <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Critica,</hi> with numerous annotations, a work so favourably
                    received on the Continent that it was reprinted <hi rend="italic">verbatim,</hi>
                    at Leipsic in 1800. In 1783 he became a fellow of his college, and two years
                    later undertook a journey to Holland, where he prosecuted his researches for
                    some time. On his return he was appointed chaplain to Shute Barrington, bishop
                    of Salisbury, through whose influence he obtained a prebendal stall in the
                    cathedral of that town. In 1789 he published his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Considerations on the Abolition of Slavery,</hi> in which he advocated the
                    principle of gradual emancipation. From Salisbury he removed to Durham, where he
                    effected much good among the poorer classes, by publishing and distributing
                    suitable religious works. In 1803 he was promoted by his old schoolfellow
                    Addington, then prime minister, to the vacant see of St David’s, which he held
                    for twenty years, and where he gave evidence of his philanthropic disposition by
                    establishing the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, and founding
                    the College of Lampeter, which he liberally endowed. In 1820 he was appointed
                    first president of the Royal Society of Literature recently founded; and three
                    years later he was promoted to the see of Salisbury, over which he presided for
                    twelve years, prosecuting his benevolent designs with unwearied industry. One of
                    the most important of the many services which he rendered to the church, was the
                    establishment of a Church Union Society for the assistance of infirm and
                    distressed clergymen, to which he bequeathed £3000. In the midst of his useful
