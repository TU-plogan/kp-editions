                    Society of London, was the seventh son and fourteenth child of Richard Boyle,
                    earl of Cork, and was born at Lismore Castle in the province of Munster,
                    Ireland, January 25, 1627. In his earliest years he learnt to speak Latin and
                    French, and he was only eight years old when he was sent to Eton, his father’s
                    friend, Sir Henry Wotton, being then provost of the college. Here he studied
                    about three years, and was next placed as private pupil with the rector of
                    Stalbridge in Dorsetshire, where his father had just taken up his residence. In
                    1638 after a visit to London he travelled in France accompanied by a French
                    tutor, and studied above a year at Geneva. In the autumn of 1641 he visited
                    Switzerland and Italy, spending the winter of 1641-42 at ’Florence. Here he
                    studied the works of Galileo, who died near Florence the same winter. On
                    reaching Englaud in 1644 he learnt the death of his father, who had left to him
                    the manor of Stalbridge and estates in Ireland. It was in the following year
                    that be became a member of a society of scientific men, who in consequence of
                    the political agitation of the times used to hold their meetings with as much
                    privacy as possible, first in London and afterwards at Oxford; this became
                    subsequently famous as the Royal Society. In 1646 he settled at Stalbridge, and
                    from that time his whole life was devoted to study, scientific research and
                    experiments, and authorship. After making several visits to his estates in
                    Ireland he took up his abode at Oxford in 1654, and there enjoyed the society of
                    many learned men. He resided at Oxford for fourteen years; and it was during
                    this period that he made important improvements in the air-pump, and by a long
                    series of experiments with it made various discoveries on the properties of air,
                    the propagation of sound, &lt;fcc., which are recorded in his voluminous
                    writings. Boyle was at the same time an ardent student of theology, and numbered
                    among his friends the eminent Orientalists Pococke, Hyde, and Clarke, and Dr
                    Thomas Barlow, Bodleian librarian and bishop of Lincoln. At the Restoration he
                    was favourably received at court, and was advised to enter the church; but this
                    he declined to do, alleging that it was not his vocation, and that he believed
                    his writings on religious subjects would have greater weight coming from a
                    layman than from a paid minister of the church. His anxiety to promote the
                    spread of Christianity appeared in various munificent acts. He bore the expense
                    of preparing a Malay translation of the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles,
                    and of an Irish version of the Bible. He contributed largely to the cost of the
                    Welsh Bible and of a Turkish New Testament, and gave a large sum to the
                    translator of the work of Grotius <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Veritate</hi> into Arabic. He supported liberally the projects for spreading
                    the Gospel in India and in America, and gave away annually a large sum for
                    charitable purposes. He made his first appearance as author in 1660, by the
                    publication at Oxford of a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">New Experiments,
                    Physico-Mechaniccd,</hi><hi rend="italic">touching the Spring of Air and its
                    Effects,</hi> and of a devotional work entitled <hi rend="italic">Seraphic Love,
                    or some Motives and Incentives to the Love of God.</hi></p>
                <p>When the Royal Society was incorporated (1663) Boyle was named a member of the
                    council. He communicated many important memoirs to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> and, in 1680, was elected president of the
                    society, but from a scruple about oaths he declined this honour. Boyle was at
                    one time deeply interested in alchemy, and carried on experiments on the
                    transmutation of metals, in which Newton also took much interest. It was through
                    his efforts that the statute of Henry IV. cap. 4, against the multiplying of
                    gold and silver was repealed in 1689. After leaving Oxford in 1668 he settled in
                    London; and here he spent the rest of his days, residing in the house of his
                    sister Lady Ranelagh. He was never married. In person he was tall, slender, and
                    of a pale countenance. His constitution was far from robust, and throughout his
                    life he suffered from feeble health and low spirits. While his scientific
                    discoveries procured him wide and lasting renown, his private character and
                    virtues, the charm of his social manners, his wit and conversation, endeared him
                    to a large number of personal friends. As a man of science he was ranked by his
                    contemporaries among the greatest; and although some abatement of this very high
                    estimate has since been admitted, he still holds a place of distinction as the
                    first great investigator who carried out in his labours the principles of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Novum</hi><hi rend="italic">Organum.</hi> So earnest was his
                    devotion to Bacon that for many years he could not be persuaded to read the
                    works of Descartes, lest he should be tempted out of his chosen path. His
                    strength lay in the patient research and observation of facts. He did not
                    display that power of divination of their meaning and of detection of their
                    relations which is the characteristic of genius. His desire was to contribute by
                    his researches, in the true spirit of the Baconian philosophy, to the service of
                    man’s life; and in this he had a large measure of success. The same practical
                    aim is apparent in his theological writings. He was no controversialist, and
                    does not appear to have taken much, if any interest in the great political and
                    religious movements of his day. About 1690 his health began seriously to fail,
                    and he was obliged gradually to withdraw from his public engagements. He
                    discontinued the communication of memoirs of new discoveries to the Royal
                    Society, resigned the post which he had long held of governor of the corporation
                    for propagating the Gospel in New England, and announced by public advertisement
                    his intention no longer to receive visits. The “retired leisure” which he thus
                    secured was devoted to important chemical investigations, the account of which
                    he left “as a kind of hermetic legacy to the studious disciples of that art.”
                    His health became worse in 1691. On the 23d of December of this year his sister,
                    Lady Ranelagh, with whom he had lived for more than twenty years, died; and a
                    week later, December 30, Boyle died himself. His remains were interred in the
                    churchyard of St Martin’s in the Fields, and his funeral sermon was preached by
                    his friend Dr Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Reformation.</hi> By his will he founded and endowed the “Boyle
                    Lectures,” the purpose of which is the demonstration of the truth of the
                    Christian religion against atheists, theists, pagans, Jews, and Mahometans.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to do more than enumerate the more important publications of
                    this laborious investigator. His first work has already been mentioned. It was
                    followed, in 1662, by <hi rend="italic">The Sceptical Chemist,</hi> subsequently
                    reprinted with additions. His <hi rend="italic">Considerations touching the
                    Usefulness of Experimental Natural Philosophy</hi> appeared in 1663, and was
                    followed by a second part in 1671. His <hi rend="italic">Experiments and
                    Considerations upon colours, with Observations on a Diamond that Shines in the
                    Dark,</hi> also appeared in 1663—a treatise which broke ground on a theme
                    afterwards more profoundly treated by Newton.</p>

                <p>His next scientific work was entitled, <hi rend="italic">New Experiments and
                    Observations upon Cold</hi> (1665). This was followed by the <hi rend="italic"

                    gave rise to much discussion, its statements being founded on experiment; <hi

                    >Medicinal Experiments.</hi> An incomplete edition of Boyle’s works appeared at
                    Geneva some years before his death. A useful classified abridgment was published
                    by Dr Peter Shaw, editor of an abridgment of Bacon’s Philosophical Works. The
                    first complete edition was that of Dr Birch, which appeared, with a Life of the
                    author, in 5 vols, folio, in 1744. Another complete edition was issued in 6
                    vols. 4to, in 1772. A portrait of Boyle, by Kerse-boom, which is in the
                    possession of the Royal Society, formed part of the National Portrait Exhibition
                    at South Kensington in 1866. Boyle bequeathed his natural history collections to
                    the Royal Society.</p>
