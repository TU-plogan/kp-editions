                    genus <hi rend="italic">Buxus,</hi> the principal species being the well-known
                    tree or shrub, <hi rend="italic">B. sempervirens,</hi> the common box. in
                    general use for borders of garden walks, ornamental parterres, &amp;c. The other
                    source of the ordinary boxwood of commerce is <hi rend="italic">B.
                        balearica,</hi> which yields the variety known as Turkey boxwood. The common
                    box is grown throughout Great Britain, in the southern part of the European
                    continent generally, and it appears to extend through Persia into India, where
                    it is found growing on the slopes of the Western Himalayas. Only a very small
                    proportion of the wood suitable for industrial uses is now obtained in Great
                    Britain. The box is a very slow growing plant, adding not more than 1 ⅛ or 2
                    inches to its diameter in twenty years, and on an average attaining only a
                    height of 16 feet, with a mean diameter of 10∣ inches. The leaves of this
                    species are small, oval, leathery in texture, and of a deep glossy green colour.
                        <hi rend="italic">B. balearica</hi> is a tree of considerable size,
                    attaining to a height of 80 feet, with leaves three times larger than those of
                    the common box. It is a native of the islands of the Mediterranean, and grows in
                    Turkey, Asia Minor, and around the shores of the Black Sea, and is supposed to
                    be the chief source of the boxwood which comes into European commerce by way of
                    Constantinople. The wood of both species possesses a delicate yellow colour; it
                    is very dense iu structure and has a fine uniform grain, which gives it unique
                    value for the purposes of the wood-engraver. In addition to the ever-increasing
                    demand for the wood by engravers, a very large amount is used in the manufacture
                    of measuring rules, various mathematical instruments, flutes and other musical
                    instruments, as well as for turning into many minor articles, and for inlaying,

                    carvings. The use of boxwood for turnery and musical instruments is mentioned by
                    Pliny, Virgil, and Ovid. The quantity of the wood which passes out from
                    Constantinople yearly is estimated at from 5000 to 7000 tons, with about 1500
                    tons more of inferior and small pieces. While the consumption is continually
                    increasing the present sources of supply are rapidly becoming exhausted, the
                    forests near the sea are denuded of their best trees, and access to the wood
                    growing in the interior of the countries around the Black Sea is difficult owing
                    to the want of means of internal communication. The consequent increase of the
                    cost of boxwood has led to frequent attempts to discover other woods which might
                    take its place for the purposes of tho wood engraver; but none of the numerous
                    substitutes proposed have hitherto been found to possess the necessary
                    combination of properties.</p>
