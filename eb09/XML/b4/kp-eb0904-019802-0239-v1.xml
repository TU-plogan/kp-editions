                <p><label type="entry">BRADLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr James</hi></label>, one
                    of'the most eminent British astronomers, was born at Sherborne in
                    Gloucestershire in March 1692. He entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1710, and
                    graduated as B. A. in 1714 and as Μ. A in 1717. At the house of his uncle, the
                    Rev. James Pound, himself known as an acute observer, he had found instruments
                    and means for carrying on a regular series of astronomical observations. He
                    became a member of the Royal Society in 1718, and though he took orders in the
                    following year, and was presented to the vicarage of Bridstow, he did not give
                    up his scientific pursuits. He also obtained a small sinecure living in Wales,
                    but in 1721, on his appointment to the Savilian professorship of astronomy at
                    Oxford, he resigned all his ecclesiastical preferments. In 1727 he communicated
                    to the Royal Society his great paper on aberration, a remarkable combination of
                    exact observation and profound induction. Some years afterwards Bradley began
                    his lectures at the Oxford Museum, and in 1742 he was appointed to succeed
                    Harley as astronomer royal. In 1747 his minute observations led him to the
                    second of his great discoveries, the nutation of the earth’s axis. The remainder
                    of Bradley’s life was devoted to the Greenwich Observatory. In 1748 he succeeded
                    in getting a small grant for instruments from the public funds, and in 1752 lie
                    was rewarded with a pension of £250. He continued his labours till 1761, when
                    his health began to give way. He then retired into the country and died at
                    Chaiford, Gloucestershire, in July 1762. The immense mass of useful observations
                    left by him at Greenwich was singularly neglected by English astronomers; but
                    since Bessel presented them in systematic form to the world (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Bessel,</hi> vol. iii. p. 616) their true value has been
                    recognized. For an account of Bradley’s scientific discoveries see <hi
