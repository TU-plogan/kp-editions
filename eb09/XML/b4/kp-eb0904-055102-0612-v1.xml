                <p><label type="entry">BURMAH</label>. The Burman empire, or Independent Burmah, is
                    situated in the S.E. of Asia, in the region beyond the mountains which form the
                    eastern frontier of Bengal. It was formerly of very considerable extent, but its
                    limits have been greatly contracted by British conquest. On the W. where it is
                    conterminous with the British territories in India, the Burman empire is bounded
                    by the province of Arakan, surrendered to the British in 1826, the petty states
                    of Tipperah and Munnepore, and the province of Assam, from which it is separated
                    by lofty ridges of mountains; on the S. by the British province of Pegu,
                    acquired in 1853; on the N. by Assam and Tibet; and on the E. by China and the
                    Shan states. Its limits extend from 19° 30' to 28° 15' N. lat., and from 93° 2'
                    to 100° 40' E. long., comprising a territory measuring 540 miles in length from
                    north to south, and 420 in breadth, with an area of 190,520 English square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>That portion of Asia in which the Burman empire is situated slopes from the
                    central mountains towards the south; and the Burmese territory is watered by
                    four great streams, namely, the Irawadi and the Kyen-dwen, which unite their
                    courses at 21° 50' N. lat., the Sittang or Pounloung, and the Salwin. The first
                    two rivers have their sources somewhere in the northern chain of mountains in
                    the interior, one head stream of the Irawadi probably coming from Tibet; the
                    Salwin further to the east in Tibet; and the Sittang, which is the smallest of
                    the four, in the hills to the S.E. of Mandalay; they all run in a southerly
                    course to the Indian Ocean. The Irawadi aud the Salwin are large rivers, which
                    in the lower part of their course overflow the flat country on their banks
                    during the season of the rains, and in the upper force their way through
                    magnificent defiles. The former is navigable a considerable distance above
                    Bhamo; but the latter is practically useless as a means of communication, owing
                    to the frequent obstacles in its channel. The Burmese empire with its present
                    limits contains no maritime districts, and only isolated tracts of alluvial
                    plain; it is in the main an upland territory, bounded at its southern extremity
                    by a frontier line at the distance of about 200 miles from the mouths of the
                    Irawadi, in 19° 30' N. lat. From this point the country begins to rise, and
                    thence for about 300 miles farther it contains much rolling country intersected
                    by occasional hill ranges; beyond this it is wild aud mountainous.</p>
                <p>Though inferior in point of fertility to the low-lying tracts of British Burmah,
                    the upland country is far from being unproductive. The chief crops are rice (of
                    which the Burmese count 102 different sorts), maize, millet, wheat, various
                    pulses, tobacco, cotton, and indigo. The sugarcane appears to have been long
                    known to the Burmese; but, though the climate and soil are extremely favourable,
                    it is not generally cultivated. A cheap and coarse sugar is obtained from the
                    juice of the Palmyra palm, which abounds in the tract south of the capital. The
                    cocoa and areca palms are not common. The tea-plant, which is indigenous, is
                    cultivated in the hills by some of the mountain tribes at the distance of about
                    five days’ journey, and by others in still greater perfection at the distance of
                    about ten days’ journey, from the capital. It seems, however, to be another
                    plant, probably the <hi rend="italic">Eloeodendron</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >persicum</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> f</hi> which furnishes the
                    principal ingredient iu the hlapét, or pickled tea, that forms one of the
                    favourite condiments of Burmah. Cotton is grown in every part of the kingdom and
                    its dependencies, but chiefly in the dry lands and climate of the τιpper
                    provinces. Indigo is indigenous, and is universally cultivated, but in a very
                    rude manner; it is still <pb break="no"

                    for exportation.</p>
                <p>The most common fruits in Burmah are the mango, the orange, the citron, the pine,
                    the custard apple, the jack, the papaya, and the plantain. The yam and the sweet
                    potato are grown, but not extensively; the common potato is unknown. Onions are
                    produced; and capsicum, which, after salt, is the most ordinary condiment used
                    by the Burmese, is cultivated everywhere.</p>
                <p>The forests of Burmah abound in fine trees. Among these the teak holds a
                    conspicuous place; some of the finest teak forests were lost to the Burmese,
                    however, with Pegu. Almost every description of timber known in India is
                    produced in the Burmese forests, from which also an abundant supply is obtained
                    of the varnish employed by the Shans and the Burmese in their manufacture of
                    lacquered ware. Sticklac of an excellent quality is obtained in the woods.<note

                <p>Burmah is rich in minerals, and produces gold, silver, copper, tiu, lead,
                    antimony, bismuth, amber, coal, petroleum, nitre, natron, salt, limestone, and
                    marble, the jade or yu of the Chinese, sapphires, and other precious stones.
                    Gold is found in the sands of different rivers, and also towards the Shan
                    territory on the eastern frontier; but the demand is very much greater than the
                    native supply. Silver is got also near the Chinese frontier. The mountainous
                    districts of the Shan territory contain almost all the other metals; but they
                    are not worked, and the copper and tin, which are seen in the capital, are
                    imported from China. Iron is found in several places, and is wrought especially
                    at Poukpa, near a mountain of that name to the eastward of the old capital
                    Pagân, and also at Maedoo, north-west of the capital; but, owing to ignorance
                    and the want of proper methods, about 30 or 40 per cent, of the metal is lost in
                    the process. Large deposits of rich magnetic oxide, as yet untouched, exist in
                    the ridges east of the capital near the banks of the navigable river Myit-Ngé,
                    and the same district contains lime in great abundance and of remarkable
                    whiteness; while statuary marble, equal to the best Italian specimens, is found
                    about 15 miles north of the capital and east of the Ira wadi. Mines of amber are
                    wrought, among other places, at Hookhong or Payendwen, near the sources of the
                    Kyen-dwen, and their produce must be abundant if one may judge from the price of
                    the article at the capital. Nitre, natron, and salt are found in various
                    quarters. Sulphur also occurs in some places, as in the district of Silleh-Myo
                    and in the neighbourhood of the petroleum wells; but the quantity is
                    comparatively small, and a supply has to be obtained from China. Coal has been
                    discovered in patches, but not in any quantity worth working. Petroleum, which
                    is used by all ranks among the Burmese for burning in lamps, and also for
                    smearing wood as a preservative against insects, is found near the village of
                    Ye-nang-gyoung, on the banks of the Irawadi. Here are upwards of one hundred
                    pits or wells, with a general depth of from 210 to 240 feet; though some of them
                    are deeper, and reach to the depth of 300 feet. The shaft is of a square form,
                    from 3 to 4 feet across, and lined with horizontal balks. The liquid appears to
                    boil up from the bottom like au abundant spring, and is extracted in buckets,
                    and sent to all quarters of the country. The annual yield is calculated at
                    11,690 tons. A good deal is now imported into England.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The precious stones which are produced in the Burmese territories are chiefly the
                    sapphire and the ruby. They are found about 60 or 70 miles in a north-east
                    direction from the capital, over an area of about 100 square miles, by sinking
                    pits in the gem beds. The varieties of the saoDhire found there are the <hi

                    of chrysoberyl and spinelie. The Crown lays claim to the produce of these
                    rivers; and all the stones that exceed the value of £10 are sent to the
                        treasury.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    stranger is ever permitted to approach the spots where these precious stones are
                    found. The yu or jade mines are situated in the Mogoung district, about 25 miles
                    south-west of Meinkhoom. During certain seasons no fewer than 1000 men—Shans,
                    Chinese, Panthays, and Kakhyens—are engaged in the excavation of the stone,
                    which is found in the form of rounded boulders, sometimes of considerable size.

                <p>The country of the Burmese, abounding in forests, affords extensive shelter to

                    lakes abound with fish, from which the inhabitants prepare their favourite
                    condiment of ngapee. A detailed description of several of the species will be

                    often of very large size, are kept in great numbers, not only for the sake of
                    the eggs or the flesh, but also to afford amusement of a barbarous kind. Aquatic
                    birds of various kinds are very numerous, such as geese, darters <hi

                <p>The domestic animals are the ox, the buffalo, and the horse. Oxen are used for
                    draught in the υpper country, and buffaloes in the southern parts. They are of a
                    good description, and, ranging in the luxuriant pastures of the plains, they
                    commonly appear in high order. The buffalo is confined to agricultural labour,
                    and the ox alone is used as a beast of burden or of draught. The Burman horses,
                    which are rarely more than thirteen hands high, are never used but for riding.
                    Elephants are kept for the pleasure of the king, and the taming of those that
                    are newly caught is one of the favourite spectacles of the people. A white
                    elephant (apparently an albino), when found, is greatly prized, and is kept at
                    court as a sacred appendage of royalty. The dog is neglected, and is seen
                    prowling about the streets, a prey to famine and disease. Cats are numerous; and
                    about the capital a few goats and sheep, of a puny race, are kept more for
                    curiosity than for use. A few asses are also seen, which are brought from China.

                    with black, coarse, lank, and abundant hair, and a little more beard than is
                    possessed by the Siamese. The name they give their own race is Mrau-mà (as
                    written), generally pronounced Ba-nιa, and from this the various forms of
                    “Burmah” appear to have been taken. Besides the Burmese proper, there are
                    numerous tribes of Paloungs, Toungthoos, Karens, and others toward the east,
                    many of them in a state of semi-independence; and all round the northern
                    frontier and along the ranges that traverse the upper regions, vast hordes of
                    Kakhyens or Singphos maintain a rough, cateran life, and come down to levy black
                    mail on the more peaceful inhabitants. The Shans constitute a great number of
                    small principalities along the whole eastern border, subject some to Burmah,
                    some to China, some to Siam, and in some cases owning a double allegiance,
                    according to their position. The Shans everywhere profess Buddhism, and have
                    some kind of literature and the traces of culture. To their race the Siamese
                    themselves belong. The Kakhyens are square-faced, strong-jawed, and obliqueeyed.
                    They are still in a low’ state of civilization, are destitute of letters, aud
                    continue in paganism. Their chiefs are supported by offerings in kind,—
                    receiving, for example, a leg of every animal that is killed. One kind of
                    industry—the manufacture of toddy and arrack—is extensively carried on, and the
                    whole population are regular consumers of the produce.<note anchored="true"

                    are scattered throughout the empire; but they are not of much individual
                    importance. The population of the country has been variously estimated and
                    grossly exaggerated by the ignorance of Europeans, who have raised it to
                    17,000,000, 19,000,000, and even 33,000,000. Mr Craufurd, on the best data that

                    total population of 3,090,000, and Colonel Yule estimated, in 1855, that, within
                    the area between the British frontier and 24° N. lat., it probably did not
                    exceed 1,200,000, while within the whole empire at its widest limits there were
                    not more than 3,000,000. Count Bethlen states, in 1874, that he obtained
                    statistics of tho houses in Burmah from a Burmese official, which made the
                    number 700,000, without including those among the Shans to the east of the
                    Salwin; so that if we allow five inhabitants to each we have 3,500,000 for a
                    total population, and if we include the Shans probably 4,000,000.</p>
                <p>The Burmese government is a pure despotism, the kiug dispensing torture,
                    imprisonment, or death, according to his sovereign discretion. The chief object
                    of government seems to be the personal honour and aggrandizement of the monarch;
                    and the only restraint on the exercise of his prerogative is the fear of an
                    insurrection. He is assisted in his administration by a public and a privy
                    council, known respectively as the Hlot-dau and the Byadeit; all questions,
                    before they are submitted to the public advisers of his majesty, are debated in
                    the privy council, which consists generally of four Atwen-woons to whom are
                    attached deputies, secretaries and other officers (Tsaré dau-gyis, great royal
                    writers ;” Than-dau-zens, “receivers of the royal voice ”), who carry messages,
                    and report from time to time the proceedings of the council to the king. The
                    Hlot-dau also usually consists of four ministers or Woongyis, and is presided
                    over by the crown-prince (Einshé-men, or lord of the eastern house). The
                    paymaster-general is an officer of high importance; and the other officers of
                    distinction are the king’s armour-bearer and the master of the elephants, but
                    the latter have no share in the administration of public affairs. The king may
                    order any of those great officers to be punished at his pleasure; and a minister
                    may, by his order, be seized by the public executioner, and laid at the side of
                    the road for hours under the burning sun w’ith a weight upon his breast; and
                    after undergoing this disgraceful punishment, may continue to discharge his high
                    function as before. The country at large is ruled by provincial governors, and
                    is divided into provinces (or Myos), townships, districts, and villages. The
                    civil, military, judicial, and fiscal administration of the province is vested
                    in the governor, or Myo-woon, who exercises the power of life and death, though
                    in all civil cases an appeal lies from his sentence to the chief council at the
                    capital. In all the townships and villages there are judges with a subordinate
                    jurisdiction. But from a mere detail of the provincial administration and
                    judicial institutions of the Burmese, their extreme inefficiency can scarcely be
                    known. No Burmese officer ever receives a fixed salary. The higher class is paid
                    by an assignment either of land or of the labour and industry of a given portion
                    of the inhabitants, and the inferior magistrates by fees, perquisites, and other
                    emoluments; and hence extortion and bribery prevail amongst all the
                    functionaries of the Burmese Government. Justice is openly exposed for sale; and
                    the exercise of the judicial functions is so lucrative, that the two executive
                    councils have by their encroachments deprived the regular judge of the greater
                    part of his employment.</p>
                <p>The Burmese laws are mainly contained in the <hi rend="italic">Dliam-masat,</hi>
                    a code ascribed to Manu, but quite different from the Manu’s Code of the
                    Brahmans. It is said to have been introduced into Burmah from Ceylon by
                    Buddaghosha, the traditional apostle of the Indo-Chinese nations.<note

                            made into English by Richardson.</p></note> The criminal code is
                    barbarous and severe, aud the punishments are shocking to humanity. Gang
                    robbery, desertion from the king’s service, robbing of temples, and sedition or
                    treason, are considered the most heinous crimes, and are cruelly punished, the
                    criminal being in some cases embowelled, or thrown to wild beasts. Decapitation
                    is the general mode of execution, but crucifixion and fracture of the limbs are
                    also practised, and women are usually put to death by the stroke of a bludgeon
                    across the throat. For minor offences, fines, whipping, and imprisonments are
                    the punishments adjudged. In important cases torture is applied both to
                    principals and witnesses; and the jailers often torture their prisoners in order
                    to extort money from them. The English and American prisoners duriug the war of
                    1824 were frequently tortured, aud had to pay fines to the jailer in order to
                    procure milder treatment. Trial by ordeal is sometimes resorted to, as well as
                    other superstitious modes of procedure. The administration of justice, however
                    vexatious and expensive, is far from efficient; and the police is as bad as can
                    possibly be conceived.</p>
                <p>There are no hereditary honours under the Burmese Government. All the public
                    functionaries may be dismissed from their offices, and deprived of their rank at
                    the caprice of the sovereign; while any subject, with the exception of a slave
                    or outcast, may aspire to the first offices in the state, to which, in reality,
                    persons of very mean origin do frequently attain. The great officers of
                    Government hold the first rank after the king and the princes of the blood, and
                    are distinguished by a chain or badge, which is the order of nobility, and of
                    which there are different degrees, distinguished by the number of strings or
                    small chains which compose the ornament. Three of open chain-work mark the
                    lowest rank; three of neatly-twisted wire the next; there are then six, nine,
                    twelve, and finally twenty-four, which the king alone is entitled to wear. But

                    ear-rings, cap of ceremony, horse-furniture, the material of his drinking-cup,
                    if it be of gold or any other metal, the colour and quality of his umbrella (an
                    article in general use, and one of the principal insignia of rank), whether it
                    be of brown varnished paper, red, green, gilded, or plain white, the royal
                    colour— all indicate the rank of the person; if any of the lower orders usurp
                    the insignia of a higher class, he may be slain with impunity by the first
                    person who meets him; and so exclusive is the aristocratical spirit of the
                    higher orders, that such a usurpation would be sure of punishment.</p>
                <p>When a merchant acquires property he is registered by a royal edict under the
                    name of Thuthé or “rich man,” which gives him a title to the protection of the
                    court, while it exposes him also to regular extortion. The priesthood form a
                    separate order, who are interdicted from all other employment, and are supported
                    by voluntary contributions. They are distinguished by the yellow colours in
                    their dress, which it would be reckoned sacrilege in any other person to wear.
                    Aformal complaint was made, during the conferences with the British previous to
                    the peace, because some of their camp followers were seen dressed in yellow
                    clothes. There is also an order of nuns and priestesses, who make a vow of
                    chastity, but may at any time quit their order.</p>
                <p>The free labouring population consist of proprietors or common labourers; and
                    they are all considered the slaves of the king, who may at all times call for
                    their services as soldiers, artizans, or common labourers. Hence a Burman, being
                    the property of the king, can never quit the country without his especial
                    permission, which is only granted for a limited time, and never to women on any
                    pretence. The British and others who had children by Burmese women during a
                    residence in the country experienced the greatest difficulty, even with the aid
                    of heavy douceurs, in taking them along with them. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dhammasat</hi> numbers seven classes of slaves, of which the most important
                    are prisoners of war, and those who have mortgaged their services for a debt.
                    The class of outcasts consists of the slaves of the pagodas, the burners of the
                    dead, the jailers and executioners (who are generally condemned criminals), and
                    the lepers and other incurables, who are held in great abhorrence, and treated
                    with singular caprice and cruelty. They are condemned to dwell alone, and in a
                    state of disgrace; and any man who is infected with leprosy, however high his
                    rank, is forced, by continual bribes to the officers of justice, to purchase an
                    exemption from the penalties which attach to him. Prostitutes are also
                    considered as outcasts. The women in Burmah are not shut up as in many other
                    parts of the East, and excluded from the sight of men; on the contrary, they are
                    suffered to appear openly in society, and have free access in their own name to
                    the courts of law, where, if ill-treatment is proved, divorce is readily
                    obtained. In many other respects, however, they are exposed to the most
                    degrading treatment. They are sold for a time to strangers; and the practice is
                    not considered shameful, nor the female in any respect dishonoured. They are
                    seldom unfaithful to their new master; and many of them have proved essentially
                    useful to strangers in the Burmese dominions, being generally of industrious and
                    domestic habite, and not addicted to vice.</p>
                <p>The taxes from which the public revenue arises are in general rude and
                    ill-contrived expedients for extortion, and are vexatious to the people at the
                    same time that they are little productive to the state. The most important is
                    the house or family tax, which is said to be assessed by a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Domesday Book,</hi> compiled by order of Mentaragyi in 1783. The amount
                    varies greatly in different years, and to a remarkable extent in different
                    districts. Next in order is the tax on agriculture, which is also very
                    irregularly imposed. A large part of the cultivated land of the kingdom is
                    assigned to favourites of the court or to public functionaries in lieu of
                    stipends or salaries, or is appropriated to the expenses of public
                    establishments, such as war-boats, elephants, &amp;c.; and this assignment
                    conveys a right to tax the inhabitants according to the discretion of the
                    assignee. The court favourites who receive these grants generally appoint agents
                    to manage their estates; they pay a certain tax or quit-rent to the crown, and
                    their agents extort from the cultivators as much more as they can by every mode
                    of oppression, often by torture. Besides this stated tax, extraordinary
                    contributions are levied by the council of the state directly from the lords and
                    nobles to whom the lands are assigned, who in their turn levy it from the
                    cultivators, and generally make it a pretence for plunder and extortion. Taxes
                    are also laid on fruit-trees, on the sugar palm, on the tobacco-land on the teak
                    forests, on the petroleum springs, on mines of gold and precious stones, on the
                    fishery of ponds, lakes, rivers, and salt-water creeks, on the manufacture of
                    salt, on the eggs of the green turtle, and on esculent swallows’ nests. As the
                    consumption of wines, spirits, opium, and other intoxicating drugs is forbidden
                    by law, they cannot, of course, be subject to any tax.</p>
                <p>In many of the useful arts the Burmese have not made any great advances, while in
                    others they are possessed of no small amount of proficiency. The architecture of
                    religious edifices erected in the Middle Ages is of striking and effective
                    character, though only of brick. The general style bears evidence of an Indian
                    origin; but numerous local modifications have been introduced. Perhaps the
                    feature of most interest is the use of the pointed arch as well as the flat and
                    the circular, and that at a time long anterior to its employment in India.
                    Modern buildings are chiefly of wood; palaces and monasteries, carved with
                    extraordinary richness of detail, and often gilt all over, present an aspect of
                    barbaric splendour. The dagobas, or solid domes, which form at once the objects
                    and the localities of Buddhist worship, are almost the only brick structures now
                    erected; and these are often gilt all over. In carving the Burmese artisans
                    display unusual skill and inventiveness, and give full scope to the working of a
                    luxuriant and whimsical fancy. As in our mediaeval woodwork, sometimes there is
                    often displayed a large amount of satirical and facetious caricature. The
                    application of gilding is carried to an extravagant extent; as much as £40,000
                    is said to have been expended on this article for a single temple. The finest
                    architectural monuments are to be found in the deserted city of Pagân; and many
                    of the most magnificent are greatly shattered by earthquakes.<note

                            reader ought to consult Captain Yule’s chapter on Pagan.</p></note> The
                    number of religious buildings, small and great, throughout the country is
                    enormous; at every turn the traveller finds pagodas or kyoungs (monasteries), or
                    lesser shrines, or zayats (resting-places for travellers founded by the
                    Buddhists in order to acquire religious merit). The ordinary buildings are of a
                    very slight construction, and the architect is prevented from giving them any
                    great height by the whimsical prejudice of the people against any one walking
                    over their heads. The whole process of the cotton manufacture is performed by
                    women, who use a rude but efficient species of loom, and produce an excellent
                    cloth, though they are much inferior in dexterity to the Indian artisans. Silk
                    cloths are manufactured at different places from Chinese silk. The favourite
                    patterns are zigzag longitudinal stripes of different colours, and the
                    brilliance of the contrasts is frequently gorgeous in its results. The dyeing of
                    the yellow robes of the priests is effected by means of the leaves of the
                    jacktree.</p>

                <p>The common, coarse, unglazed earthenware is of an excellent quality; and a better
                    description of pottery is also made. The art of making porcelain, however, is
                    entirely unknown, and this ware is imported from China. Iron ore, as already
                    mentioned, is smelted; but the Burmans cannot manufacture steel, which is
                    brought from Bengal. Bell-founding has been carried to considerable perfection;
                    and the craftsmen take pride in the magnitude of some of their productions.
                    Perhaps the largest specimen is that in the neighbourhood of Amarapura, which
                    measures 16 feet across the lip and weighs about 80 tons. Coarse articles of
                    cutlery, including swords, spears, knives, also muskets and matchlocks,
                    scissors, and carpenters’ tools, are manufactured in the capital, and gold and
                    silver ornaments are produced in every considerable place in the country.
                    Embossed work in drinking cups and the like is executed with great richness of
                    effect. North of the capital, and east of the Irawadi, as before stated, is an
                    entire hill of pure white marble, and there are sculptured marble images of
                    Gautama or Buddha. The marble is of the finest quality; and the workmen give it
                    an exquisite polish by means of a paste of pulverized fossil wood. The chief
                    seat of the manufacture of lacquered wares is at Nyoun-goo, near the ancient
                    city of Pagân. Since Burmah was deprived of its harbours and maritime districts,
                    its foreign commerce has been extremely limited. The trade of the country
                    centres chiefly in the capital. The imports are rice, pickled and dried fish,
                    and foreign commodities obtained from Bengal, the Asiatic Archipelago, and
                    Europe. Petroleum, saltpetre, lime, paper, lacquer-ware, cotton and silk
                    fabrics, iron, cutlery, some brass ware, terra japonica, sugar, and tamarinds
                    are given in exchange. One of the most important branches of the trade of the
                    country was formerly that maintained with the Chinese province of Yunnan; but it
                    has been for a considerable period in abeyance owing to the disturbed state of
                    the frontier counties. The principal marts of this trade, which was carried on
                    at annual fairs, were Madé, near the capital, and Bhamo. The Chinese caravan,
                    setting out from the western province of Yunnan at the close of the periodical
                    rains, generally reached Burmah in the beginning of December, after a journey of
                    six weeks over difficult and mountainous roads. The principal fair was held at
                    Bhamo, comparatively few traders arriving at the capital. The articles imported
                    from China were raw silk, wrought copper, orpiment or yellow arsenic from the
                    mines in Yunnan (of a very fine quality, which found its way into Western Asia,
                    and into Europe through Calcutta), quicksilver, vermilion, iron pans,
                    brass-wire, tin, lead, alum, silver, gold and gold-leaf, earthenware, paints,
                    carpets, rhubarb, tea, honey, velvets and other wrought silks, spirits, musk,
                    verdigris, dry fruits, paper, fans, umbrellas, shoes, and wearing apparel. The
                    metals were chiefly produced in the province of Yunnan. The articles sent to
                    China consisted of raw cotton, by far the most considerable article of export;
                    feathers, chiefly of the blue jay, for ornamenting the dresses of ceremony of
                    the Chinese mandarins; esculent swallows’ nests, ivory, rhinoceros’ and deers’
                    horns; sapphires, used for buttons to the caps of the Chinese officers of rank,
                    jade, and amber, with a small quantity of British woollens. The trade of the
                    northern part of Burmah proper is chiefly carried on at large fairs held in
                    connection with religious festivals. One of the most important articles, in

                <p>The currency used by the Burmese is of the rudest description. For the smaller
                    payments lead is employed; and for the larger payments silver almost
                    exclusively. This is not coined into pieces of any known weight and fineness;
                    and in every payment of any consequence the metal must be weighed and is
                    generally assayed, for which a premium is paid to the bankers or money-changers
                    of <hi rend="italic">2⅛</hi> per cent, besides 1 per cent, which they say is
                    lost in the operation. There are three or four different alloys of silver in
                    common use as money; the best is Bau, which is almost pure; next is Dain, with
                    about 6 ’ 4 per cent, of copper; and so on through several grades. An attempt
                    was made by King Mentaragyi to introduce a coinage; but his plans failed because
                    he fixed the current value of his money considerably above the real value of the
                    silver. The high rate of interest for money—which is 25 per cent., and 60 per
                    cent, when no security is given—is another proof of the low state of commerce
                    among the Burmese. The seeds of the <hi rend="italic">Abrus precatorius</hi>
                    (Khyin Rhwe), a little red and black pea, serve as the smallest weight; they
                    ordinarily weigh about a grain, but vary from one to two. Two of them make a
                    rhwe-kyi, four rhwe-kyis a great pae, four great paes a mat, four mats a kyap,
                    and 100 kyaps a piktha (peissa) or viss, which is equal to 3 ’ 6516 ft&gt;
                    avoirdupois. The Burmese year is divided into three seasons and twelve months,
                    beginning with what corresponds to our April, and every third year a month is
                    intercalated. Every pakka or half-month consists of 15 days (ret) of 60 narih
                    each. The ret is divided into the nay or period from sunrise to sunset, and the
                    gnyin or period from sunset to sunrise,— the 60 narih being assigned in
                    different proportions to the two periods in each of the twelve months, the first
                    month having 30 in each period, and the second 30 in the daytime and 28 in the
                    night, and so on. The Burmese have borrowed their astronomy and astrology, as
                    well as this division of the day, from the Hindus. They are ignorant of oceanic
                    navigation; and in their voyages to Calcutta, during the fine season, they creep
                    along the coast, never losing sight of it.</p>
                <p>The Burmese proper use a monosyllabic language, spoken with distinctive tones,
                    like the Chinese and several other Indo-Chinese tongues. Its vocabulary shows
                    distinct relation to Chinese on one side and to Tibetan on another. In contrast
                    with Siamese it is a very soft and flexible language, and its monosyllabic
                    character is somewhat modified in pronunciation. It has no distinctly sibilant
                    sound, the only letter approximate to “s” having a resemblance rather to the
                    English “th.” It is a literary language, and has been under cultivation for
                    perhaps six or seven centuries. It is written with an alphabet of Indian origin,
                    which probably came in with Buddhism; and most of the letters are of a more or
                    less circular form. The Pali remaining the dialect of sacred literature, the
                    Burmese has been almost confined to secular uses. It has developed a poetic
                    diction of such complete individuality that it is unintelligible without special
                    study. Another peculiar dialect, largely mingled with Pali elements, is spoken
                    at court, and also requires separate study, as it substitutes a vocabulary of
                    elaborate artificiality subordinate to the etiquette of the courtiers. The word
                    for “to go,” for example, is different according as it is said that the king
                    goes, or the prince goes, or the priest goes. Of the literary forms in which the
                    Burmese express themselves, the favourite one is the drama, which appears under
                    the various forms of masquerades, puppet shows, ballet-opera, and farces, as
                    well as in the more dignified character of the regular tragedy. The moral
                    character of the plays is often of the lowest kind, the utmost licence both of
                    speech and action being allowed on the stage. The scenery is of a very simple
                    and purely suggestive kind, a single branch of a tree standing for a forest, and
                    frequently the filling up of the dialogue is largely left to the ingenuity of
                    the actors, little more than hints of the plot being con <pb break="no"

                    interest in the dramatic exhibitions is intense, and, as in Siam, the same piece
                    often drags its slow length along for days together. Specimens of the plots will
                    be found in the appendixes to Yule’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative,</hi>

                    early centuries of the Christian era, but their historical value is of a very
                    dubious kind. Libraries are common throughout the country, principally in the
                    monasteries. Though a certain kind of paper is manufactured from bamboo pulp,
                    the usual material of the books is the palm leaf, while for ordinary notebook
                    purposes a kind of black tablet, called a <hi rend="italic">parabeik,</hi> and a
                    steatite pencil are employed. A dictionary of Burmese was published by Judson at
                    Maulmeinin 1852; Schleiermacher made the language the object of a remarkable
                    study in his <hi rend="italic">Influence of Writing upon Language,</hi> 1835;
                    and Bastian has contributed an essay on the literature to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Zeitschrift der Deutschen</hi><hi rend="italic">Morgenl. Gesellschaft,</hi>
                    1863, and has also published an interesting sketch of the peculiarities of the
                    language in his <hi rend="italic">Sprachvergleichende Studien,</hi> Leipsic,
                    1870.</p>
                <p>The Burmese are votaries of Buddha, and the rites, doctrines, and priesthood are
                    in their main features the same as in other countries where Buddhism prevails.
                    Every Burman must, at some period or other of his life, spend some time in a
                    monastery; and it is no uncommon thing for a man to retire for a longer or
                    shorter period from the bustle of life without any intention of permanently
                    adopting the yellow robe which is the distinctive mark of the regular monk. Dr
                    Bastian has supplied a great many interesting details on the religious beliefs
                    and ceremonies of the people, but they are as yet unfortunately scattered
                    through the pages of his <hi rend="italic">Travels.</hi> Neither Christianity
                    nor Mahometanism has made much progress, though a certain number of Mahometans
                    have existed, especially at the capital, for a long time, and have mosques
                    there. Foreigners enjoy religious toleration, but the Burmese rulers view any
                    attempt to convert the natives to the Christian or any other foreign faith as an
                    interference with their allegiance. An American mission was settled in the
                    country in 1815, under the conduct of Dr Judson before mentioned, who brought to
                    this perilous service zeal and discretion; but it entirely failed of success,
                    not from any bigotry on the part of the natives, but from the opposition of men
                    in power. On the war breaking out with the British the missionaries were
                    imprisoned, and narrowly escaped with their lives, and on their release they
                    retired to prosecute their labours in the British province of Martaban. There
                    are now in the capital representatives of both English and French missionary
                    agencies.</p>
                <p>Education throughout the Burman empire is still in the ecclesiastical stage, but
                    the educational statistics compare favourably with those of many portions of
                    Europe. The first book, according to Dr Bastian, which is put into the hands of
                    the boys in the monastery schools is the <hi rend="italic">Sin-pungyi,</hi> or
                    Great Basket of Learning, in which the meaning of the Burmese letters is
                    explained. After this they learn the injunctions of religion in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Mengalasut,</hi> and next the prayers of Gautama in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Pharitgyi,</hi> which is written in Pali, so that their study
                    consists in mechanically committing it to memory. They then proceed to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Djats</hi> (stories or legends) in which the Burmese words are
                    mingled with Pali expressions and contractions; later on they pass to the study
                    of <hi rend="italic">Saddo</hi> or grammar, and finally to that of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Yok</hi> or general cyclopaedia. For those who enter the
                    monastic profession there remain the Pali texts. The historical books are then
                    read, as well as the <hi rend="italic">Pu-és</hi> or dramatic productions.
                    Fluency of speech and great skill in. carrying on an argument according to their
                    own system of dialectics are the common possessions of the educated Burmese, and
                    an unshaken conviction in the truth of their religion is almost universal.</p>
                <p>It is probable that Burmah is the <hi rend="italic">Chryse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Regio</hi> of Ptolemy, a name parallel in meaning to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sonaparanta,</hi> the classic Pali title assigned to the country round the
                    capital in Burmese documents. The royal history traces the lineage of the kings
                    to the ancient Buddhist monarchs of India. This no doubt is fabulous, but it is
                    hard to say how early communication with Gangetic India began. From the 11th to
                    the 13 th century the old Burman empire was at the height of its power, and to
                    this period belong the splendid remains of architecture at Pagân. The city and
                    the dynasty were destroyed by a Chinese (or rather Mongol) invasion (1284 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> in the reign of Kublai Khan. After that the
                    empire fell to a low ebb, and Central Burmah was often subject to Shan
                    dynasties. In the early part of the 16th century the Burmese princes of Toungoo,
                    in the north-east of Pegu, began to rise to power, and established a dynasty
                    which at one time held possession of Pegu, Ava, and Arakân. They made their
                    capital at Pegu, and to this dynasty belong the gorgeous descriptions of some of
                    the travellers of the 16th century. Their wars exhausted the country, and before
                    the end of the century it was in the greatest decay. A new dynasty arose in Ava,
                    which subdued Pegu, and maintained their supremacy throughout the 17th and
                    during the first forty years of the 18th century. The Peguans or Taleins then
                    revolted, and having taken the capital Ava, and made the king prisoner, reduced
                    the whole country to submission. Alompra, left by the conqueror in charge of the
                    village of Monchaboo, planned the deliverance of his country. He attacked the
                    Peguans at first with small detachments; but when his forces increased, he
                    suddenly advanced, and took possession of the capital in the autumn of 1753. In
                    1754 the Peguans sent an armament of war-boats against Ava, but they were
                    totally defeated by Alompra; while in the districts of Prome, Donabew, Loonzay,
                    &amp;c., the Burmans revolted, and expelled all the Pegu garrisons in their
                    towns. In 1754 Prυme was besieged by the king of Pegu, who was again defeated by
                    Alompra, and the war was transferred from the upper provinces to the mouths of
                    the navigable rivers, and the numerous creeks and canals which intersect the
                    lower country. In 1755 Apporaza, the king of Pegu’s brother, was equally
                    unsuccessful, after which the Peguans were driven from Bassein and the adjacent
                    country, and were forced to withdraw to the fortress of Syriam, distant twelve
                    miles from Rangoon. Here they enjoyed a brief repose, Alompra being called away
                    to quell an insurrection of his own subjects, and to repel an invasion of the
                    Siamese; but returning victorious, he laid siege to the fortress of Syriam and
                    took it by surprise. In these wars the French sided with the Peguans, the
                    English with the Burmans. Dupleix, the governor of Pondicherry, had sent two
                    ships to the aid of the former; but the master of the first was decoyed up the
                    river by Alompra, where he was massacred along with his whole crew. The other
                    escaped to Pondicherry. Alompra was now master of all the navigable rivers; and
                    the Peguans, shut out from foreign aid, were finally subdued. In 1757 the
                    conqueror laid siege to the city of Pegu, which capitulated, on condition that
                    their own king should govern the country, but that he should do homage for his
                    kingdom, and should also surrender his daughter to the victorious monarch.
                    Alompra never contemplated the fulfilment of the condition; and having obtained
                    posesssion of the town, abandoned it to the fury of his soldiers. In the
                    following year the Peguans vainly endeavoured to throw off the yoke. Alompra
                    afterwards reduced the town and district of Tavoy, and finally undertook the
                    conquest of <pb break="no"

                    Tenasserim, both which towns were taken; and he was besieging the capital of
                    Siam when he was taken ill. He immediately ordered his army to retreat, in hopes
                    of reaching his capital alive; but he expired on the way, in 1760, in the
                    fiftieth year of his age, after he had reigned eight years. In the previous year
                    he had massacred the English of the establishment of Negrais, whom he suspected
                    of assisting the Peguans. He was succeeded by his oldest son Noungdaugyi, whose
                    reign was disturbed by the rebellion of his brother Tshen-byo-yen or Shembuan,
                    and afterwards by one of his father’s generals. He died in little more than
                    three years, leaving one son in his infancy; and on his decease the throne was
                    seized by his brother Tshen-byo-yen. The new king was intent, like his
                    predecessors, on the conquest of the adjacent states, and accordingly made war
                    in 1765 on the Munnipore kingdom, and also on the Siamese, with partial success.
                    In the following year he defeated the Siamese, and, after a long blockade,
                    obtained possession of their capital. But while the Burmans were extending their
                    conquests in this quarter, they were invaded by a Chinese army of 50,000 men
                    from the province of Yunnan. This army was hemmed in by the skill of the
                    Burmans; and, bçing reduced by the want of provisions, it was afterwards
                    attacked and totally destroyed, with the exception of 2500 men, who were sent in
                    fetters to work in the Burmese capital at their several trades. In the meantime
                    the Siamese revolted, and while the Burman army was marching against them, the
                    Peguan soldiers who had been incorporated in it rose against their companions,
                    and commencing an indiscriminate massacre, pursued the Buπnan army to the gates
                    of Rangoon, which they besieged, but were unable to capture. In 1774
                    Tshen-byo-yen was engaged in reducing the marauding tribes. He took the district
                    and fort of Martaban from the revolted Peguans; and in the following year he
                    sailed down the Irawadi with an army of 50,000 men, and, arriving at Rangoon,
                    put to death the aged monarch of Pegu, along with many of his nobles, who had
                    shared with him in the offence of rebellion. He died in 1776, after a reign of
                    twelve years, during which he had extended the Burmese dominions on every side.
                    He was succeeded by his son, a youth of eighteen, called Tsengoo-men (Chenguza
                    of Symes), who proved himself a bloodthirsty despot, and was put to death by his
                    uncle, Bhodau-phra or Mentaragyi, in 1781, who ascended the vacant throne. In
                    1783 the new king effected the conquest of Arakân. In the same year he removed

                            history. In the earlier periods, it is probable that the chronicles have
                            made it seem more frequent than it is, by running the history of minor
                            contemporaneous kingdoms into that of one great monarchy. But in more
                            recent times the capital has been shifted from Prome to Pagan, from
                            Pagan to Panya, from Pan ya to Ava, and from Ava to Amarapura; and since
                            the present monarch was visited by the English embassy of 1855, he has
                            caused Amarapura to be abandoned, and has built a new city at Mandalay,
                            which is at present the chief city in the empire.</p></note> which, with
                    brief interruptions, had been the capital for four centuries, to the new city of
                    Amarapura, “the City of the Immortals.”</p>
                <p>The Siamese who had revolted in 1771 were never afterwards subdued by the
                    Burmans; but the latter retained their dominion over the sea-coast as far as
                    Mergui. In the year 1785 they attacked the island of Junkseylon with a fleet of
                    boats and an army, but were ultimately driven back with loss; and a second
                    attempt by the Burman monarch, who in 1786 invaded Siam with an army of 30,000
                    men, was attended with no better success. In 1793 peace was concluded between
                    these two powers, the Siamese yielding to the Burmans the entire possession of
                    the coast of Tenasserim on the Indian Ocean, and the two important seaports of
                    Mergui and Tavoy.</p>
                <p>In 1795 the Burmese were involved in a dispute with the British in India, in
                    consequence of their troops, to the amount of 5000 men, entering the district of
                    Chittagong in pursuit of three robbers who had fled from justice across the
                    frontier. Explanations being made and terms of accommodation offered by General
                    Erskine, the commanding officer, the Burmese commander retired from the British
                    territories, when the fugitives were restored, and all differences for the time
                    amicably arranged.</p>
                <p>But it was evident that the gradual extension of the British and Burmese
                    territories would in time bring the two powers into close contact along a more
                    extended line of frontier, and in all probability lead to a war between them. It
                    happened, accordingly, that the Burmese, carrying their arms into Assam and
                    Munnipore, penetrated to the British border near Sylhet, on the N.E. frontier of
                    Bengal, beyond which were the possessions of the chiefs of Cachar, under the
                    protection of the British Government. The Burmese leaders, arrested in their
                    career of conquest, were impatient to measure their strength with their new
                    neighbours. It appears from the evidence of Europeans who resided in Ava, that
                    they were entirely unacquainted with the discipline and resources of the
                    Europeans. They imagined that, like other nations, they would fall before their
                    superior tactics and valour; and their cupidity was inflamed by the prospect of
                    marching to Calcutta and plundering the country. At length their chiefs ventured
                    on the open violation of the British territories. They attacked a party of
                    sepoys within the frontier, and seized and carried off British subjects, while
                    at all points their troops, moving in large bodies, assumed the most menacing
                    positions. In the south encroachments were made upon the British frontier of
                    Chittagong. The island of Shaparee, at the mouth of the Naf river, had been
                    occupied by a small guard of British troops. These were attacked on the 23d
                    September 1823 by the Burmese, and driven from their post with the loss of
                    several lives; and to the repeated demands of the British for redress no answer
                    was returned. Other outrages ensued; and at length, in February 1824, war was
                    declared by the British Government.</p>
                <p>Hostilities having commenced, the British rulers in India resolved to carry the
                    war into the enemy’s country; an armament, under Commodore Grant and Sir
                    Archibald Campbell, entered the Irawadi River, and anchored off Rangoon on the
                    10th May 1824. After a feeble resistance this great seaport surrendered, and the
                    troops were landed. The place was entirely deserted by its inhabitants, the
                    provisions were carried off or destroyed, and the invading force took possession
                    of a complete solitude. On the 28th May, Sir A. Campbell ordered an attack on
                    some of the nearest posts, which were all carried after a feeble defence.
                    Another attack was made on the 10th June on the stockades at the village of
                    Kemmendine. Some of these were battered by' artillery; and the shot and shells
                    struck such terror into the Burmese that they fled in the utmost precipitation.
                    It soon, however, became apparent that the expedition had been undertaken with
                    very imperfect knowledge of the country, and without adequate provision. The
                    devastation of the country, which was part of the defensive system of the
                    Burmese, was carried out with unrelenting rigour, and the invaders were soon
                    reduced to great difficulties. The health of the men declined, and their ranks
                    were fearfully thinned. The monarch of Ava sent large reinforcements to his
                    dispirited and beaten army; and early in July an attack was commenced on the
                    British line, but proved unsuccessful. On the 8th the British assaulted. The
                    enemy were beaten at all points; and their strongest stockaded works, battered
                    to pieces by a powerful artillery, were in general <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0619-0558"/> abandoned. With the exception of an attack by
                    the prince of Sara wadi in the end of August, the enemy allowed the British to
                    remain unmolested during the months of July and August. This interval was
                    employed by Sir A. Campbell in subduing the Burmese provinces of Tavoy and
                    Mergui, and the whole coast of Tenasserim. This was an important conquest, as
                    the country was salubrious and afforded convalescent stations to the sick, who
                    were now so numerous in the British army that there were scarcely 3000 soldiers
                    fit for duty. An expedition was about this time sent against the old Portuguese
                    fort and factory of Syriam, at the mouth of the Pegu River, which was taken; and
                    in October the province of Martaban was reduced under the authority of the
                    British.</p>
                <p>The rainy season terminated about the end of October; and the court of Ava,
                    alarmed by the discomfiture of its armies, recalled the veteran legions which
                    were employed in Arakân, under their renowned leader Maha Bandoola, in vain
                    attempts to penetrate the British frontier. Bandoola hastened by forced marches
                    to the defence of his country; and by the end of November an army of 60,000 men
                    had surrounded the British position at Rangoon and Kemmendine, for the defence
                    of which Sir Archibald Campbell had only 5000 efficient troops. The enemy in
                    great force made repeated attacks on Kemmendine without success, and on the 7th
                    December Bandoola was completely routed by Sir A. Campbell. The fugitives
                    retired to a strong position on the river, which they again entrenched; and here
                    they were attacked by the British on the 15 th, and driven in complete confusion
                    from the field.</p>
                <p>Sir Archibald Campbell now resolved to advance on Prome, about 100 miles higher
                    up the Ira wadi River. He moved with his force on the 13th February 1825 in two
                    divisions, one proceeding by land, and the other, under General Cotton, destined
                    for the reduction of Donabew, being embarked on the flotilla. Taking the command
                    of the land force he continued his advance till the 11th March, when
                    intelligence reached him of the failure of the attack upon Donabew. He instantly
                    commenced a retrograde march; on the 27th he effected a junction with General
                    Cotton’s force, and on the 2d April carried the entrenchments at Donabew with
                    little resistance, Bandoola having been killed by the explosion of a bomb. The
                    English general entered Prome on the 25th, and remained there during the rainy
                    season. On the 17th September an armistice was concluded for one month. In the
                    course of the summer General Morrison had conquered the province of Arakân; in
                    the north the Burmese were expelled from Assam; and the British had made some
                    progress in Cachar, though their advance was finally impeded by the thick
                    forests and jungle.</p>
                <p>The armistice having expired on the 17th October, the army of Ava, amounting to
                    60,000 men, advanced in three divisions against the British position at Prome,
                    which was defended by 3000 Europeans and 2000 native troops. But the British
                    still triumphed, and after several actions, in which the Burmese were the
                    assailants and were partially successful, Sir A. Campbell, on the 1st December,
                    attacked the different divisions of their army, and successively drove them from
                    all their positions, and dispersed them in every direction. The Burmese retired
                    on Meaday and afterwards on Mellone, along the course of the Irawadi, where they
                    occupied, with 10,000 or 12,000 men, a series of strongly fortified heights and
                    a formidable stockade. On the 26th they sent a flag of truce to the British
                    camp; and a negotiation having commenced, peace was proposed to them on the
                    following conditions :—lsi, The cession of Arakân, together with the provinces
                    of Mergui, Tavoy, and Yea; 2&lt;Z, The renunciation by the Burmese sovereign of
                    all claims upon Assam and the contiguous petty states; 3(7, The Company to be
                    paid a crore of rupees as an indemnification for the expenses of the war; <hi
                        rend="italic">½th,</hi> Residents from each court to be allowed, with an
                    escort of fifty men; while it was also stipulated that British ships should no
                    longer be obliged to unship their rudders and land their guns as formerly in the
                    Burmese ports. This treaty was agreed to and signed, but the ratification of the
                    king was still wanting; and it was soon apparent that the Burmese had no
                    intention to sign it, but were preparing to renew the contest. On the 19th
                    January, accordingly, Sir A. Campbell attacked and carried the enemy’s position
                    at Mellone. Another offer of peace was here made by the Burmese, but it was
                    found to be insincere; and the fugitive army made at the ancient city of
                    Pagân-Myo a final stand in defence of the capital. They were attached and
                    overthrown on the 9th February 1826; and the invading force being now within
                    four days’ march of Ava, Dr Price, an American missionary, who with other
                    Europeans had been thrown into prison when the war commenced, was sent to the
                    British camp with the treaty (known as the Treaty of Yandabo) ratified, the
                    prisoners of war released, and an instalment of 25 lacs of rupees. The war was
                    thus brought to a successful termination, and the British army evacuated the
                    country.</p>
                <p>For some years the ^relations of peace continued undisturbed. Probably the
                    feeling of amity on the part of the Burmese Government was not very strong; but
                    so long as the prince by whom the treaty was concluded continued in power, no
                    attempt was made to depart from its main stipulations. That monarch, Phagyi-dau
                    or Noungdaugyi, however, was obliged in 1837 to yield the throne to a usurper
                    who appeared in the person of his brother, Kounboungmen or Tharawadi. The
                    latter, at an early period, manifested not only that hatred of British
                    connection which was almost universal at the Burmese court, but also the
                    extremest contempt. For several years it had become apparent that the period was
                    approaching when war between the British and the Burmese Governments would again
                    become inevitable. The British resident, Major Burney, who had been appointed in
                    1830, finding his presence at Ava agreeable neither to the king nor to himself,
                    removed in 1837 to Rangoon, and shortly afterwards retired from the country.
                    Ultimately it became necessary to forego even the pretence of maintaining
                    relations of friendship, and the British functionary at that time, Captain
                    Macleod, was properly withdrawn, in 1840, altogether from a country where his
                    continuance would have been but a mockery. The state of sullen dislike which
                    followed was after a while succeeded by more active evidences of hostility. Acts
                    of violence were committed on British ships and British seamen. Remonstrance was
                    consequently made by the British Government, and its envoys were supported by a
                    small naval force. The officers on whom devolved the duty of representing the
                    wrongs of their fellow-countrymen and demanding redress, proceeded to Rangoon,
                    the governor of which place had been a chief actor in the outrages complained
                    of; but so far were they from meeting with any signs of regret, that they were
                    treated with indignity and contempt, and compelled to retire without
                    accomplishing anything beyond blockading the ports. A series of negotiations
                    followed; nothing was demanded of the Burmese beyond a very moderate
                    compensation for the injuries inflicted on the masters of two British vessels,
                    an apology for the insults offered by the governor of Rangoon to the
                    representatives of the British Government, and the re-establishment of at least
                    the appearance of friendly relations by the reception of a British agent by the
                    Burmese Government. But the obduracy of the king— known as the Pagân-men, who
                    had succeeded his father in 1846—led to the refusal alike of atonement for past
                    wrongs, of any expression of regret for the display of <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n620/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0620-0559"/> gratuitous insolence, and of any indication
                    of a desire to maintain friendship for the future. Another Burmese war was the
                    result, the first shot being fired in January 1852. As in the former, though
                    success was varying, the British finally triumphed, and the chief towns in the
                    lower part of the Burmese kingdom fell to them in succession. The city of Pegu,
                    the capital of that portion which, after having been captured, had again passed
                    into the hands of the enemy, was recaptured and retained, and the whole province
                    of Pegu was, by proclamation of the Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, declared
                    to be annexed to the British dominions on the 20th December 1852. No treaty was
                    obtained or insisted upon,—the British Government being content with the tacit
                    acquiescence of the king of Burmah without such documents; but its resolution
                    was declared, that any active demonstration of hostility by him would be
                    followed by retribution.</p>
                <p>About the same time a revolution broke out which resulted in Pagân-men’s
                    dethronement. His tyrannical and barbarous conduct had made him obnoxious at
                    home as well as abroad, and indeed many of his actions recall the worst passages
                    of the history of the later Roman emperors. The prince of Mendoon, who had
                    become apprehensive for his own safety, made him prisoner in February 1853, and
                    was himself crowned king of Burmah towards the end of the year. The new monarch,
                    known as Mendoon-men, has shown himself sufficently arrogant in his dealings
                    with the European powers, but has been wise enough to keep free from any
                    approach towards hostility, and, indeed, has latterly displayed a desire to live
                    on peaceful terms with the Indian Government. The loss of Pegu was long a matter
                    of bitter regret, and he absolutely refused to acknowledge it by a formal
                    treaty. In the beginning of 1855 he sent a mission of compliment to Lord
                    Dalhousie, the Governor-General; and in thé summer of the same year Major Arthur
                    Phayre, <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> governor of the new province of Pegu,
                    was appointed envoy to the Burmese court. He was accompanied by Captain (now
                    Colonel) Henry Yule as secretary, and Mr Oldham as geologist, and his mission
                    added largely to our knowledge of the state of the country; but in its main
                    object of obtaining a treaty it was unsuccessful. It was not till 1862 that the
                    king at length yielded, and his relations with Britain were placed on a definite
                    diplomatic basis. Much interest has been taken of recent years in the
                    restoration of the trade between China and British Burmah by the old routes
                    overland, and various important journeys in elucidation of the problem have been
                    successfully undertaken. In 1863 Dr Clement Williams, at that time resident in
                    the capital, received the king’s permission to proceed to Bhamo, and safely
                    accomplished his voyage to the upper defile of the Irawadι beyond that town in
                    the months of January and February. His recall to the capital prevented his
                    further advance.</p>
                <p>In 1867 a treaty was signed by which British steamers were permitted to navigate
                    Burmese waters, and the appointment of British agents at Bhamo or other stations
                    for the collection of customs was formally authorized, and in the following year
                    a Government expedition, consisting of Captain Williams as engineer, Dr Anderson
                    as naturalist, and Captain Bowers and Messrs Stewart and Burn as representatives
                    of the commercial interest of Rangoon, was despatched under the leadership of
                    Major Sladen, political resident at Mandalay. The royal steamer <hi
                        rend="italic">Yaynan-Sekia,</hi> or “The Honesty,” was placed by the king at
                    the service of the expedition, and letters of recommendation were furnished to
                    the Burmese officials, but in other respects scant courtesy was shown to the
                    party. Escorted by fifty armed poli ce, the explorers advancedin safety about
                    135 miles northeast of Bhamo to Momien or Teng-yue-Chow, a principal town of the
                    Mahometan insurgents, known to the Burmese asPanthés; but beyond this it was
                    considered imprudent to proceed on account of the disturbed condition of the
                    country. In 1869 Captain Storer was appointed first British resident at Bhamo;
                    and about the same time the Irawadi Flotilla Company started a monthly steamer
                    service to that town, which has now become almost fortnightly. The king’s
                    interest in the commercial development of his country was shown by his erecting
                    and garrisoning a series of guardhouses through the dangerous parts of the
                    Kakhyen hills, In 1874 Lord Salisbury sent another expedition, consisting of
                    Colonel Horace Browne, Mr Ney Elias, and Dr Anderson, with instructions to
                    proceed, if possible, right across the country to Shanghai in China; and to
                    ensure the success of the undertaking, Mr Margary, a gentleman familiar with the
                    Chinese language and customs, was commissioned to start from Shanghai and meet
                    the party at Momien or the neighbourhood. The king’s reception of the new
                    mission, which arrived on December 23, 1874, at Mandalay, was favourable in the
                    extreme. On the 15th of January 1875 the explorers reached Bhamo; and two days
                    afterwards Mr Margary arrived from Hankow. After the mission had proceeded to
                    the banks of the Nampoung, a river which joins the Tapeng some distance east of
                    Ponline, they heard rumours of hostile preparations in front; and Mr Margary
                    volunteered to proceed to Manwyne to find the truth of the reports. On receiving
                    from him word that the way was clear, his companions advanced; but on the 23d of
                    February their camp was attacked by the Chinese, and they were ultimately
                    compelled to retreat with the sad knowledge that their gallant pioneer had
                    fallen at Manwyne by the hands of cowardly assassins. The Burmese officials
                    stood nobly by the mission. though the enemy assured them that their quarrel was
                    not with them but with the “white devils.” Some fears have been entertained of
                    disagreements between the court of Mandalay and the British authorities, partly
                    in regard to the allegiance of some Karen tribes, and partly in connection with
                    the claim for a right of way for British troops’through the Burmese dominions in
                    case of active measures being required to obtain redress from the Chinese
                    Government for the murder of Mr Margary. Happily these fears have been
                    disappointed; the mission of Sir Douglas Forsyth has come to a peaceful if not
                    altogether a successful termination, and a commission has been formed to settle
                    the Karen boundary. While a certain amount of suspicion in regard to British
                    policy still remains in the king’s mind, he seems more and more disposed to
                    co-operate with his European allies, and shows himself friendly to the European
                    residents in his capital. His reign has been several times disturbed by internal
                    dissensions, and the general condition of the country can hardly be regarded as
                    one of stability. Personally he is an orthodox and devoted Buddhist, and is
                    largely under the influence of ecclesiastical advisers. In 1874 he was recrowned
                    at Mandalay, in compliance with the requirements of a prophecy, and he attempts
                    to enforce stringent sumptuary laws in accordance with his creed. It is
                    satisfactory to know that while some of his officials are undoubtedly hostile to
                    European interests, the great mass of the people seem genuinely favourable.</p>
