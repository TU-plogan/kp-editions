                    Lago Maggiore, in the Milanese, October 2, 1538. Wheu he was about twelve years

                    the management of their domestic affairs. After a time, however, he resumed his
                    studies, and in 1559 he took his doctor’s degree. In the following year his
                    uncle Cardinal de’ Medici was raised to the pontificate, by the name of Pius
                    IV.; and Borromeo was made prothonotary, entrusted with both the public and
                    privy seal of the ecclesiastical state, .created cardinal deacon, and soon after
                    raised to the archbishopric of Milan. In compliance with the pope’s desire, he
                    lived in great splendour; yet his own temperance and humility were never brought
                    into question. He established an academy of learned persons, and published their
                    memoirs as the <hi rend="italic">Noctes</hi><hi rend="italic">Vaticanae.</hi>
                    About the same time he also founded and endowed a college at Pavia, which he
                    dedicated to Justina, virgin and martyr. Upon the death of his elder brother
                    Frederick, his friends advised him to quit the church and marry, that his family
                    might not become extinct. Contrary to expectation, however, he declined the
                    proposal; and from that time became more fervent than ever in exercises of
                    piety, and more zealous for the welfare of the church.</p>
                <p>On the death of Pius IV., January 7, 1566, the skill and diligence of Borromeo
                    materially contributed to stifle the cabals of the conclave. As soon as
                    tranquillity had been re-established he devoted himself wholly to the
                    reformation of his large and important diocese, where the most flagitious
                    irregularities were openly practised. He began by raaking pastoral visits in his
                    metropolis; and by a variety of wise and necessary regulations, he soon restored
                    proper decency and dignity to divine service. In conformity to the decrees of
                    the Council of Trent, he cleared the cathedral of its gorgeous tombs, rich
                    ornaments, banners, arm's, not even sparing the monuments of his own relations.
                    He also divided the nave of the church into two compartments for the separation
                    of the sexes. He proceeded next to the collegiate churches, and even to the
                    fraternities of penitents, particularly that of St John the Baptist. The
                    reformation of the monasteries followed that of the churches; and the vigilance
                    of the archbishop soon extended itself from the city to the country round it.
                    The great abuses which had overrun the church at this time arose principally
                    from the ignorance of the clergy. In order, therefore, to attack the evil at its
                    root, Borromeo established seminaries, colleges, and communities, for the
                    education of young persons intended for holy orders. He met with much opposition
                    in his endeavours to bring about his reforms, but succeeded, nevertheless, in
                    rendering the most important services to the cause of morals as well as
                    religion. The governor of the province, and many of the senators, apprehensive
                    that the cardinal’s ordinances and proceedings would encroach upon the civil
                    jurisdiction, addressed many remonstrances and complaints to the courts of Rome
                    and Madrid. But Borromeo had more formidable difficulties to struggle with, in
                    the inveterate opposition of several religious orders, particularly that of the
                    Brothers of Humility. Some members of that society formed a conspiracy against
                    his life, and a shot was one evening fired at him in the archiépiscopal chapel
                    under circumstances which led to the belief that his escape was miraculous.</p>
                <p>In the year 1576 the city and diocese of Milan were visited by the plague, which
                    swept away great numbers. On this occasion he went about giving directions for
                    accommodating the sick and burying the dead, avoiding no danger, and sparing no
                    expense. He also visited all the neighbouring parishes where the contagion
                    raged, distributing money, providing accommodation for the sick, and punishing
                    those, especially the clergy, who were remiss in discharging the duties of their
                    calling.</p>
                <p>But continual labours and austerities appear to have shortened his life. He was
                    seized with an intermittent fever, and died at Milan, November 4, 1584. He was
                    immediately enrolled among the saints, but was not canonized till 1610. Besides
                    the <hi rend="italic">Noctes</hi><hi rend="italic">Vaticanae,</hi> to which he
                    appears to have contributed, the only literary relics of this intrepid and
                    zealous reformer are some homilies, discourses, and sermons, with a collection
                    of letters. Several lives of him have been published,—by Godeau: by Touron, a
                    Dominican; by Ribadeneira, a Spanish Jesuit; by Bimeus, and by others.</p>
