                    period of a series of novels distinguished by the ingenuity and consistent
                    evolution of the plot. The transition between these intellectual phases is
                    marked by a juvenile romance entitled <hi rend="italic">Carsol,</hi> not
                    published until after the author’s death, which professes to depict an imaginary
                    community, and shows how thoroughly the young American was inspired by Godwin
                    and Mary Wollstonecraft, whose principal writings had recently made their
                    appearance. From the latter he derived the idea of his next work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Alenin,</hi> an enthusiastic but inexperienced essay on the
                    question of woman’s rights and liberties. From Godwin he learned his terse
                    style, condensed to a fault, but too laconic for eloquence or modulation, and
                    the art of developing a plot from a single psychological problem or mysterious
                    circumstance. The novels which he now rapidly produced offer the strongest
                    affinity to <hi rend="italic">Caleb Williams,</hi> and if inferior to that
                    remarkable work in the subtlety of mental analysis, greatly surpass it in
                    affluence of invention and intensity of poetical feeling. All are wild and weird
                    in conception, with incidents bordering on the preternatural, yet the limit of
                    possibility is never transgressed. In <hi rend="italic">Wieland,</hi> the first
                    and most striking, a seemingly inexplicable mystery is resolved into a case of
                    ventriloquism. <hi rend="italic">Arthur</hi> J∕m ’ ynisremarkable forthe
                    description of the epidemic of yellow fever in New York in 1798, which had
                    proved fatal to the author’s most intimate friend. <hi rend="italic">Edgar
                    Huntly,</hi> a romance rich in local colouring, is remarkable for the effective
                    use made of somnambulism, and anticipates Cooper’s introduction of the Red
                    Indian into fiction. <hi rend="italic">Ormond</hi> is less powerful, but
                    contains one character, Constantia Dudley, which excited the
                    enthusiasticadmiration of Shelley, who was also deeply entranced by Brown’s
                    other romances. “Nothing,’’ asserts Mrs Peacock, “so blended <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n431/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0431-0384"/> itself with the structure of his interior mind as
                    the creations of Brown.” The two had, indeed, nearly every leading trait in
                    common, although Brown’s weak health and narrow circumstances restrained him
                    from carrying his enthusiastic aspirations into practice. Two subsequent novels,
                    designed as representations of ordinary life, proved failures, and Brown betook
                    himself to less ambitious literary pursuits, compiling a general system of
                    geography, editing a periodical, and an annual register, and writing political
                    pamphlets which attracted considerable attention at the time. He died of
                    consumption, February 22, 1810. He is depicted by his biographer as the purest
                    and most amiable of men, and in spite of a certain formality due, perhaps, to
                    his Quaker education, the statement is borne out by his correspondence. As a
                    novelist he ranks very high; he is the precursor of Hawthorne, and hitherto his
                    only American rival. Greatly inferior to Hawthorne in truth of natural
                    description and insight into human character, he surpasses him in narrative and
                    constructive ability. <hi rend="italic">Wieland</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Edgar
                    Huntly</hi> especially are thrilling and exciting in the highest degree, while
                    preserved by the constant presence of a psychological problem from degenerating
                    into mere sensationalism. Most of Brown’s novels have been reprinted in England,
                    but none recently. His life by his friend Dunlop (Philadelphia, 1815) is a
                    grievous piece of bookmaking, but is interesting from the subject. An edition of
                    his works in 6 vols, was published at Philadelphia in 1857. <hi rend="smallcaps"
