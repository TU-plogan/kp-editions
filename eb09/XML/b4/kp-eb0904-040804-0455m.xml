                <p><label type="entry">BUCCANEERS</label>, a band of piratical adventurers of
                    different nationalities united in their opposition to Spain, who maintained
                    themselves chiefly in the Caribbean Seas during the 17th century.</p>
                <p>The island of St Domingo was one of several in the West Indies which had early in
                    the 16th century been almost depopulated by the oppressive colonial policy of
                    Spain. Along its coast there were several isolated establishments presided over
                    by Spaniards, w ho were deprived of a free and convenient market for the produce
                    of the soil by means of the monopolies imposed by the mother country.
                    Accordingly English, Dutch, and French vessels were welcomed with eagerness, and
                    their cargoes readily bought. The island, thinned of its former inhabitants, had
                    become the home of immense herds of wild cattle, which multiplied with great
                    rapidity; and it became the habit of the hardy smuggler to provision his ship at
                    St Domingo. The natives still left upon the island were skilled in preserving
                    flesh by means of fire and smoke at their little establishments called Boucans.
                    The adventurers learned “boucanning” from the natives; and gradually Hispaniola
                    became the scene of an extensive and illicit butcher trade. A sailor in those
                    days when piracy abounded was expert with his weapons, and was almost a fighting
                    man by trade. Spanish monopolies were the pest of every port from Mexico to Cape
                    Horn; and the seamen who had sailed the Caribbean were filled with a natural
                    hate of everything Spanish. The pleasures of a roving life gained upon them,
                    while the monotony of its routine was broken by occasional skirmishes with the
                    forces organized and led by Spanish officials. Out of such conditions arose the
                    Buccaneer, alternately sailor and hunter, even occasionally a planter,—roving,
                    bold, not over-scrupulous, not unfrequently savage, with an intense detestation
                    of the power and the representatives of Spain.</p>
                <p>In the year 1625 indirect assistance and encouragement previously given
                    culminated in a combined venture on behalf of the Buccaneers by the Governments
                    of England and France. Each nation contributed a band of colonists, and selected
                    the island of St Christopher, in the West <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0456-0409"/> Indies, where the settlers of both nations were
                    simultaneously planted. The English and French were, however, not over-friendly;
                    and in 1629, after the retirement of several of the former to an adjoining
                    island, the remaining colonists were surprised and partly dispersed by the
                    arrival of a Spanish fleet of thirty-nine sail. Many were carried off, and
                    threats were freely used as to the future settlement of the island. But on the
                    departure of the fleet the scattered bands returned, and encouragement was given
                    to their countrymen in St Domingo. For buccaneering had now becomo a most
                    profitable employment, operations were extended, and a storehouse secure from
                    the attacks of the Spaniards was required. The small island of Tortuga lying to
                    the N.W. of Hispaniola was seized for this purpose in 1630, converted into a
                    magazine for the goods of the rivals, and made their headquarters, St Domingo
                    itself still continuing their lucrative hunting ground.</p>
                <p>Spain was not indifferent to this proceeding, though she could not prudently take
                    immediate action. Eight years, however, had not gone, ere, watching her
                    opportunity when many Buccaneers were absent in the larger island on their
                    ordinary pursuit, she attacked Tortuga, and massacred every settler she could
                    seize. But the hunters to the number of 300 returned; and the Buccaneers, now
                    distinctly seen to be in open hostility to the Spanish arms, began to receive
                    recruits from every European trading nation, and for three-quarters of a century
                    became the acknowledged scourge of the Spanish American trade and dominions.</p>
                <p>France, throughout all this, had not been idle in watching over her own
                    interests. She had named the Governor of St Christopher “Governor-General for
                    the French West India Islands,” and in 1641 he took possession of Tortuga for
                    the Crown of France, expelled all English from the island, and attempted the
                    same with less success in St Domingo. England had at home something vastly more
                    important to attend to, and the Buccaneers had to maintain themselves as best
                    they could,—now mainly on the sea.</p>
                <p>In 1654 the Spaniards regained Tortuga from the French, into whose hands it
                    again, however, fell after a period of six years. But this state of matters was,
                    as may be readily conceived, too insecure even for these rovers, and they would
                    speedily have succumbed to the perils of their mode of life, had not a refuge
                    been found for them by the fortunate conquest of Jamaica in 1655 by the navy of
                    Cromwell, oa behalf of the English Commonwealth. These conquests were not made
                    without the aid of the Buccaneers themselves. The taking and retaking of Tortuga
                    by the French was always with the assistance of the roving community; and at the
                    conquest of Jamaica the English navy had the same influence in its favour. The
                    Buccaneers, in fact, by this time constituted a mercenary navy, ready for
                    employment against the power of Spain by any other nation, on condition of
                    sharing the plunder to be obtained; and they were noted for their daring, their
                    cruelty, and their extraordinary skill in seamanship.</p>
                <p>Their history now conveniently divides itself into three distinct epochs. The
                    first of these extends from the period of their rise to the capture of Panama by
                    Morgan in 1671, during which time their characteristic peculiarity as robbers
                    was that they were hampered neither by Government aid nor, till near its close,
                    by Government restriction. The second, from 1671 to the time of their greatest
                    union and power, 1685, when the scene of their operations was no longer merely
                    the Caribbean, but principally the whole range of the Pacific, from California
                    to Chili. The third and last period extends from that year onwards; it was a
                    time of disunion and disintegration, when the independence and rude honour of
                    the previous periods had degenerated into unmitigated vice and brutality.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly during the first period that those leaders flourished whose names
                    and doings have been associated with all that was really influential in the
                    exploits of the Buccaneers,—the most prominent being Mansvelt and Morgan. The
                    commerce of Spain, which had been gradu ally dwindling since the wreck of the
                    Invincible Armada and the death of Philip IL, had by the middle of the 17th
                    century become utterly insignificant. The Buccaneers were thus deprived of the
                    plunder of the Spanish mercantile marine. But Spanish settlements remained; and
                    in 1654 the first great expedition on land, attended by considerable
                    difficulties, was completed by the capture and sack of New Segovia in Honduras,
                    on the mainland of America. The Gulf of Venezuela, with its towns of Maracaibo
                    and Gibraltar, were attacked and plundered under the command of a Frenchman
                    named LOllonois, who performed, it is said, the office of executioner for the
                    whole crew of a Spanish vessel manned with ninety seamen. Such successes removed
                    the Buccaneers further and further from the pale of ordinary civilized society,
                    fed their revenge, and inspired them with an avarice almost equal to that of the
                    original settlers from Spain. Mansvelt, indeed, in 1664, popular among all the
                    Buccaneers, conceived the idea of their permanently settling as a body of
                    regular colonists upon a small island of the Bahamas, named Providence, and
                    Henry Morgan, a Welshman, intrepid and unscrupulous, joined him in some
                    preliminary cruises. But the untimely death of Mansvelt nipped in the bud the
                    only rational scheme of permanent settlement which seems at any time to have
                    animated the members of this wild community; and Morgan, now elected commander,
                    swept the whole Caribbean, and from his headquarters in Jamaica led triumphant
                    expeditions to Cuba and the mainland. He was leader of the expedition wherein
                    Porto Bello, one of the chief and best fortified ports in the West Indies, was
                    surprised, taken, and plundered.</p>
                <p>But this was too much for even the adverse European powers; and in 1670 a treaty
                    was concluded between England and Spain, proclaiming universal peace and
                    friendship among the subjects of the two sovereigns in the New World, formally
                    renouncing hostilities of every kind, withdrawing commissions granted to
                    privateers, and agreeing to forget the past and for the future to punish all
                    offenders. Great Britain was to hold all her possessions in the New World as her
                    own property (a remarkable concession on the part of Spain), and consented, on
                    behalf of her subjects, to forbear trading with any Spanish port without licence
                    obtained. On the proclamation of the treaty in Jamaica, the Buccaneers rose to a
                    man, ready for the most daring exploit which it had yet been in their power to
                    achieve; they resolved to carry the terror of their name to the shores of the
                    Pacific.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, in 1671 Morgan embarked 2000 men on board a fleet of thirty-nine
                    ships, sailed for a convenient port in the Caribbean, and crossed the Isthmus to
                    lay siege to Panama. After a difficult journey, on foot and in canoes, they
                    found themselves nearing the shores of the South Sea and in view of the turrets
                    of the fated city. On the morning of the tenth day they commenced an engagement
                    which, ere the close of the evening, ended in the rout of the defenders of the
                    town. It was taken, and, accidentally or not, it was burnt. Neither sex nor
                    condition λvas spared in the barbarities which ensued; and the conquerors
                    returned laden with spoil. Morgan was not even true to his own men in the
                    division of the booty; he returned to Jamaica, became respectable under
                    Government, was after a little made deputy-governor of the island, and took
                    advantage of his position to puni, h h’s <pb break="no"

                    Charles II., the “gallant” Sir Henry Morgan.</p>
                <p>From 1671 to 1685 is the time of the greatest daring, prosperity, and maritime
                    power of the Buccaneers. But the expedition against Panama had not been without
                    its influence. Notwithstanding the vigour with which they executed their
                    piratical projects in the Caribbean, and the many successes which they obtained
                    on land, including a second plunder of the unfortunate city of Porto Bello,
                    their thoughts ran frequently on the great expedition across the Isthmus, and
                    they pictured to themselves the shores of the South Sea as a far wider and more
                    lucrative field for the display of their united power.</p>
                <p>In 1680 those longings took formidable shape. A body of marauders over 300
                    strong, well armed and provisioned, landed on the shore of Darien and struck
                    across the country; and the cruelty and mismanagement displayed in the policy of
                    the Spaniards towards the Indians were now in small part revenged by the
                    assistance which the natives eagerly rendered to the adventurers. They acted as
                    guides during a difficult journey of nine days, kept the invaders well supplied
                    with food, provided them with skilfully constructed canoes, and only left them
                    after the taking of the fort of Santa Maria, when the Buccaneers were fairly
                    embarked on a broad and safe river which emptied itself into the South Sea. With
                    John Coxon as commander they entered the Bay of Panama, where rumour had been
                    before them, and where the Spaniards had hastily prepared a small fleet to quell
                    this dangerous attempt to carry insecurity and terror into the Pacific. But the
                    valour of the Buccaneers won for them another victory, and within a week they
                    escaped from the confinement of canoes, and took possession of a small fleet of
                    four Spanish ships; and now successes flowed upon them. The Pacific, formerly
                    free from their intrusion, showed many sail of merchant vessels, while on land
                    opposition south of the Bay of Panama was of little avail, since few were
                    acquainted with the use of fire-arms, and defence as an art was utterly unknown
                    Coxon and seventy of his men returned as they had gone, but the others under
                    Sawkins, Sharp, and Watling, roamed north and south, on islands and mainland,
                    and remained for long ravaging the coast of Peru. Never scant of silver and
                    gold, but often in want of the necessaries of life, they continued their
                    practices for a little longer; then, evading the risk of recrossing the Isthmus,
                    they boldly cleared Cape Horn, and arrived in the Indies, in the not very tender
                    hands of the representatives of the different Governments there. Again in 1683,
                    however, numbers of them under John Cook departed for the South Sea by way of
                    Cape Horn, near which they hailed a Thames built ship fitted out apparently as a
                    trader, but in reality for the purposes of privateering. Thus straight from
                    England the Buccaneers were now receiving a great accession to their numbers and
                    their strength; and Eaton, the commander of the new vessel, told Cook of a
                    certain Captain Swan who would probably be met with soon, prosecuting the same
                    dangerous business. They sailed northward, and on the death of Cook, Edward
                    Davis, undoubtedly the greatest and most prudent commander who ever led the
                    forces of the Buccaneers at sea, took command of his ship. Davis parted with
                    Eaton, who left for the East Indies, but Swan arrived, and the two captains
                    began a cruise which was disastrous to the Spanish trade in the Pacific.</p>
                <p>In 1685 they were joined in the Bay of Panama by large numbers of Buccaneers who
                    had crossed the Isthmus under Townley and others. This increased body of men
                    required an enlarged measure of adventure, and this in a few months was supplied
                    by the Viceroy of Peru. That officer, sole representative of the Spanish
                    sovereign in the vast kingdom, saw that the trade of the colony was cut off,
                    that supplies were stopped, that towns were burned and cleared of the precious
                    metals, and that settled life was broken in upon by the harassing and repeated
                    attacks of the unsparing marauders, and he resolved by vigorous means to put an
                    end to this state of matters. But this was not easily accomplished. In this same
                    year, indeed, a fleet of fourteen sail hove in sight of the united forces of the
                    Buccaneers in the Bay of Panama. The ten ships of the pirates were miserably
                    deficient in cannon, and hung off. The Spaniards evidently were not aware of
                    their advantage, and the two fleets, after remaining in proximity for three
                    days, separated without testing their strength except in the way of a small and
                    distant cannonade.</p>
                <p>At this period the power of the Buccaneers was at its height. But the combination
                    was now too extensive for its work, and the different nationality of those who
                    composed it was a source of growing discord. Nor was the dream of equality ever
                    realized for any length of time. The immense spoil obtained on the capture of
                    wealthy cities was indeed divided equally among the crew of the attacking ships,
                    the commander alone getting an extra share. But in the gambling and debauchery
                    which followed, nothing was more common than that one-half of the conquerors
                    should find themselves on the morrow in most pressing want; and while those who
                    had prudently retained or fortunately increased their store of the precious
                    metals would willingly have directed their course homewards, the others
                    clamoured for renewed attacks upon the hated Spaniards. The separation of the
                    English and French Buccaneers, who together presented a united front to the
                    Spanish fleet in 1685, marks the beginning of the third and last epoch in their
                    history—that of disunion, decay, and extinction as an unaided community.</p>
                <p>The brilliant exploits begun in this third period by the sack of Leon and Realejo
                    by the English under Davis have, even in their variety and daring, a sameness
                    which deprives them of interest, and the wonderful confederacy is now seen to be
                    falling gradually to pieces. The skill of Davis at sea was on one occasion
                    displayed in a seveu days’ engagement with two large Spanish vessels, and the
                    interest undoubtedly centres in him. Townley and Swan had, however, by this time
                    left him, and after cruising together for some time, they, too, parted. In 1688
                    Davis cleared Cape Horn and arrived in the West Indies, while Swan’s ship, the
                    “Cygnet,” was abandoned as unseaworthy, after sailing as far as Madagascar.
                    Townley had hardly joined the French Buccaneers remaining in the South Sea ere
                    he died, and the Frenchmen with their companions crossed New Spain to the West
                    Indies. And thus the Pacific, ravaged so long by this powerful· and mysterious
                    band of corsairs, was at length at peace from California to Cape Horn.</p>
                <p>The West Indies had by this time become hot enough even for the banded pirates.
                    They hung doggedly along the coasts of Jamaica and St Domingo, but their day was
                    nearly over. Only once again—at the siege of Carthagena —did they appear great;
                    but even then the expedition was not of their making, and they formed an
                    accession to regular forces organized in France. After the treachery of the
                    French commander of this expedition a spirit of unity and despairing energy
                    seemed reawakened in them; but this could not avert and scarcely delayed the
                    rapidly approaching extinction of the community.</p>
                <p>The proximate causes of the disappearance of this remarkable body of men are to
                    be found in European policy. The accession of William of Orange to the English
                    throne in 1689 had raised the jealousy of Louis XIV., and the war which ensued
                    was protracted and severe. French and English rovers in the Caribbean could <pb

                    home, and the continuance of hostilities effected the severance of the bond of
                    unity which had for three-quarters of a century kept the subjects of the two
                    nations together in schemes of aggression upon a common foe. The peace of
                    Ryswick in 1697 only left England and France free to pay court to Spain, whose
                    king, weak in body and mind, was evidently hastening to the grave. The
                    succession to the crown was believed to depend upon his will, and the two
                    nations used all their influence, both in the Old World and in the New, to
                    ingratiate themselves into the favour of the Spanish monarch. But that which
                    really stopped the career of the Buccaneers so effectually as to prevent its
                    being resumed was the fact, of so vast importance in the history of Spain and of
                    Europe, that in 1700 Philip V., first of the Bourbon dynasty, ascended the
                    Spanish throne. Spain, so little in herself, yet always great under great kings,
                    now degraded and fallen, almost immediately rose before the eyes of astonished
                    Europe as a gigantic power in the Old World and in the New.</p>
                <p>But the fall of the Buccaneers is no more accounted for fully by these
                    circumstances than is their rise by the alienation and massacre of the islanders
                    of St Domingo. There was that in the very nature of the community which, from
                    its birth, marked it as liable to speedy decline.</p>
                <p>The principles which bound the Buccaneers together were, first, the desire for
                    adventure and gain, and, in the second place, hatred of the Spaniard. The first,
                    as that which could produce union among men of different nationalities, hardly
                    deserves to be called a principle. There was perhaps much to gain, but it could
                    be had nearly always by private venture under the colours of the separate
                    European powers. Only one thing prevented this, and it is connected with their
                    second and great principle of union, namely, that they warred not with one
                    another, nor with every one, but with a single and a common foe. For while the
                    Buccaneer forces included English, French, and Dutch sailors, and were
                    complemented occasionally by not inconsiderable bands of native Indians, the
                    instances during the time of their prosperity and growth are few in which we
                    find them turning upon one another, and treating their fellows with the savagery
                    which they exulted in displaying against the subjects of Spain. The exigencies,
                    moreover, of their perilous career readily wasted their suddenly acquired
                    gains.</p>
                <p>Settled labour, the warrant of real wealth, was beneath the dignity of those who
                    lived by promoting its insecurity. Regular trade—though rendered attractive by
                    smuggling— and pearl gathering and similar operations which were spiced with
                    risk, were open in vain to them. For, as the licence of the debauchee was in
                    almost every case substituted for the cares and pleasures of domestic life, so a
                    hand-to-mouth system of supply and demand rooted out gradually the prudence
                    which accompanies any mode of settled existence. In everything permanency was
                    what was not aimed at, because the whole policy of the Buccaneers, from the
                    beginning to the end of their career, was one of pure destruction, and was
                    therefore ultimately suicidal.</p>
                <p>It has already been seen how great was the influence of the Buccaneers upon the
                    power and the colonial tactics of Spain. But it was more beneficial to the world
                    and more ruinous to Spain, that they opened the eyes of the world, and specially
                    of the nations from whom these Buccaneers had sprung, to the whole system of
                    Spanish American government and commerce—the former in its rottenness, and the
                    latter in its possibilities in other hands. That effected, all was effected,
                    since the extent of Spanish power was known. From this, then, along with other
                    causes, dating primarily from the helplessness and presumption of Spain, there
                    arose the West Indian possessions of Holland, England, and France.</p>
