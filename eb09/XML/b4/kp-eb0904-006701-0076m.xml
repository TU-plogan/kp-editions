                <p><label type="entry">BOSCOVICH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Roger Joseph</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished Italian mathematician and natural philosopher, and one of the
                    earliest of foreign <hi rend="italic">savants</hi> to adopt the theory of
                    Newton, was born at Ragusa in Dalmatia, May 18, 1711, according to the usual
                    aecount, but ten years earlier according to Lalande <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Éloge,</hi> 1792). In his fifteenth year, after passing through the usual
                    elementary studies, he entered the society of Jesus. On completing his
                    noviciate, which was spent at Rome, he studied mathematics and physics at the
                    Collegium Romanum; and so brilliant was his progress in these sciences that in
                    1740 he obtained the appointment of professor of mathematics in the college. For
                    this post he was especially fitted by his large acquaintance with modern
                    advances in science and by his skill in a classical severity of demonstration,
                    acquired by a thorough study of the works of the Greek geometricians. Several
                    years before this appointment he had made himself a name by an elegant solution
                    of the problem to find the sun’s equator and determine the period of his
                    rotation by observation of the spots on his surface. Notwithstanding the arduous
                    duties of his professorship he found time for investigation in all the fields of
                    physical science; and he published a very large number of dissertations, some of
                    them of considerable length, on a wide variety of subjects. Among these subjects
                    were the transit of Mercury, the Aurora Borealis, the figure of the earth, the
                    observation of the fixed stars, the inequalities in terrestrial gravitation, the
                    application of mathematics to the theory of the telescope, the limits of
                    certainty in astronomical observations, the solid of greatest attraction, the
                    cycloid, the logistic curve lines, the theory of comets, the tides, the law of
                    continuity, the double refraction micrometer, various problems of spherical
                    trigonometry, &lt;tc. In 1742 he was consulted, with other men of science, by
                    the pope, Benedict XIV., as to the best means of securing the stability of the
                    dome of St Peter’s, in which a crack had been discovered. His suggestion was
                    adopted. Shortly after he engaged to take part in the Portuguese expedition for
                    the survey of Brazil and the measurement of a degree of the meridian; but he
                    yielded to the urgent request of the pope that he would remain in Italy and
                    undertake a similar task there. Accordingly, in conjunction with Christopher
                    Maire, an English J esuit, he measured an arc of two degrees between Rome and
                    Rimini. The operations were begun towards the close of 1750, and were completed
                    in about two years. An account of them was published in 1755, entitled <hi

                    rend="italic">per pontificam</hi><hi rend="italic">ditionem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">dime</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    gradus</hi><hi rend="italic">a P. P. Maire et Boscovich.</hi> The value of this
                    work was increased by a carefully prepared map of the States of the Church. A
                    French translation appeared in 1770. A dispute having arisen between the Grand
                    Duke of Tuscany and the republic of Lucca with respect to the drainage of a
                    lake, Boscovich was sent, in 1757, as agent of Lucca to Vienna, and succeeded in
                    bringing about a satisfactory arrangement of the matter. In the following year
                    he published at Vienna his famous work on the molecular theory of matter,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Theoria philosophice naturalis redacta ad unicam
                    legem, virium vn natura existentium.</hi> Another occasion for the exercise of
                    his diplomatic ability soon after presented itself. A suspicion having arisen on
                    the part of the British Government that ships of war had been fitted out in the
                    port of Ragusa for the service of France, and that the neutrality of Ragusa had
                    thus been violated, Boscovich was selected to undertake an embassy to London
                    (1760), to vindicate the character of his native place and satisfy the
                    Government. This mission he discharged successfully, with credit to himself and
                    satisfaction to his countrymen. During his stay in England he was elected a
                    fellow of the Royal Society, which received him with marks of the highest
                    respect. He soon after paid this society the compliment of dedicating to it his
                    Latin poem, entitled, <hi rend="italic">De Solis</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Dunoe</hi><hi rend="italic">Defectibus.</hi> This prolix composition, one of a
                    class which at that time was much in vogue—metrical epitomes of the facts of
                    science—contains in about five thousand lines, illustrated by voluminous notes,
                    a compendium of astronomy. It was for the most part written on horseback, during
                    the author’s rides in the country while engaged in his meridian measurements.
                    The book is characterized by Delambre as “uninstructive to an astronomer and
                    unintelligible to any one else.”</p>
                <p>On leaving England Boscovich travelled in Turkey, but ill health compelled him
                    soon to return to Italy. In 1764 he was called to the chair of mathematics at
                    the University of Pavia, and this post he held, together with the directorship
                    of the observatory of Brera, for six years. He was invited by the Royal Society
                    of London to undertake an expedition to California to observe the transit of
                    Venus in 1769; but this was prevented by the recent decree of the Spanish
                    Government for the expulsion of the Jesuits from its dominions. The vanity,
                    egotism, and petulance of Boscovich provoked his rivals and made him many
                    enemies, so that in hope of peace he was driven to frequent change of residence.
                    About 1770 he removed to Milan, where he continued to teach and to hold the
                    directorship of the observatory of Brera; but being deprived of his post by the
                    intrigues of his associates he was about to retire to his native place, when the
                    news reached him (1773) of the suppression of his order in Italy. Uncertainty as
                    to his future lot led him to accept an invitation from the king of France to
                    Paris, where he was naturalized and was appointed director of optics for the
                    marine, an office instituted for him, with a pension of 8000 livres. He remained
                    there ten years, but his position became irksome, and at length intolerable. He
                    continued however to devote himself diligently to the pursuits of science, and
                    published many remarkable memoirs. Among them were an elegant solution of the
                    problem to determine the orbit of a comet from three observations, and memoirs
                    on the micrometer and achromatic telescopes. In 1783 he returned to Italy, and
                    spent two years at Bassano, where he occupied himself with the publication of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">pertinentia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">opticam et astronomiam,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d∙c.,</hi> which appeared in 1785 in five volumes quarto. After a
                    visit of some months to the convent of Vallombrosa, he went to Milan and resumed
                    his literary labours. But his health was failing, his reputation was on the
                    wane, his works did not sell, and he gradually sank a prey to illness and
                    disappointment. He fell into <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0077-0068"/> melancholy, imbecility, and at last madness, with
                    lucid intervals, and died at Milan on the 13th of February 1787. In addition to
                    the works already mentioned Boscovich published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elementa</hi><hi rend="italic">universes matheseos</hi> (1754), the sub-stauce
                    of the course of study prepared for his pupils; and a narrative of his travels,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Giornale di</hi><hi rend="italic">un</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">viaggio da Constantinopoli in Polonia,</hi> of which several
                    editions and a French translation appeared. His latest labour was the editing of
                    the Latin poems of his friend Benedict Stay on the philosophy of Descartes, with
                    scientific annotations and supplements. (W. <hi rend="smallcaps">l. r.
