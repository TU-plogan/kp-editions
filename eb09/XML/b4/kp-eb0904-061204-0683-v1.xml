                    millennium intervening between the death of Theodosius and the Turkish conquest
                    of Constantinople, are collectively classed together under the above
                    designation. Until, however, the middle of the 6th century, they are, with one
                    conspicuous exception, too merely fragmentary to deserve special notice. This
                    exception is <hi rend="smallcaps">Procopius,</hi> the Polybius of his age, whose

                    580. His character as an epigrammatist and an editor of poetry has been already

                    to him in his historical capacity for an extremely valuable narrative of six of
                    the most eventful years of the Greek empire, 553-558. The first book details the
                    conquest of Italy from the Goths by Justinian’s general Narses; the remainder
                    describe, along with other incidents, the Persian war of 554-556, the two great
                    earthquakes of 554 and 557, the great plague, the rebuilding of St Sophia, and
                    Belisarius’s last exploits against the Bulgarians. The history terminates
                    abruptly, and was probably left unfinished. As a narrator, Agathias is sensible
                    and impartial, but deficient in general knowledge, and far below the standard of
                    a philosophic historian. His style is rhetorical, but not unpleasing. II. <hi

                    eight books, all of which are preserved. The work seems to have been completed
                    under Heraclius. Theophylactus lived until 628 or 629. He is an accurate and not
                    inelegant writer, but frequently trivial and frigid. IV. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Joannes</hi> of Epiphaneia, a contemporary of Theophylactus, wrote the

                    Justinian’s reign until the restoration of Chosroes II. by Mauricius (591). His
                    history has never been printed, but is said to exist in MS. at Heidelberg. V.

                    911-959). Among the many services rendered to literature by this learned
                    sovereign is to be enumerated his history of his grandfather Basil the
                    Macedonian, emperor from 867 to 886. VI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Genesius,</hi> who
                    lived in the time of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, wrote by his order the history
                    of Basil II. and of his four immediate predecessors (813-886). The work is brief
                    and meagre, but is almost the only authority we possess for a portion of the
                    period described. VII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Joannes Cameniata,</hi> a native of
                    Thessalonica, and cross-bearer to the archbishop, wrote an account, which has
                    been preserved, of the sack of that wealthy city by the Saracens in 904.
                    Cameniata himself was one of the captives, and his narrative is very lively and
                    valuable. VIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Leo</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Diaconus,</hi>
                    an ecclesiastic in the latter half of the 10th century, is the author of an
                    indifferently written, but honest and instructive, narrative of the remarkable
                    period of national recovery under the emperors Romanus IL, Nicephorus Phocas,
                    and John Zimisces, when Crete was reconquered, Syria invaded, and the Russians
                    driven out of Bulgaria (959-975). Leo wrote at least as late as 993. IX. <hi

                    Alexius Comnenus, and one of the first statesmen and generals of his time, wrote
                    in four books the history of the empire under the Comneni from 1057 to 1081. X.

                    low period of female education, wrote (1148) the history of her father in
                    fifteen books. The period of Alexius is peculiarly interesting as that in which
                    the barrier of Byzantine isolation was broken down, and the East and West
                    brought into contact by the encroachments of the Normans on the Eastern empire
                    and by the Crusades. We cannot be too grateful to the Princess Anna for her
                    vivid sketclι of the arrival of tlιe Crusaders at Constantinople, and the
                    relations between them and the Byzantine court. Her work, however, must be used
                    with great caution. Gibbon’s employment of it is an example of his usual
                    discernment. XI. Her history was continued by <hi rend="smallcaps">Joannes
                        Cinnamus,</hi> one of the m &gt;st eminent of all the Byzantine historians.
                    He was one of the imperial notaries under the reign of Manuel Comnenus
                    (1143-1180), an office nearly corresponding to that of a modern secretary of
                    state. He had, consequently, great administrative experience, and a thorough
                    knowledge of the relations of the empire with foreign states, and of the
                    internal affairs of the latter. He is thus in an excellent position for writing
                    history, besides which his own judgment and sagacity are of a very superior
                    order, and his style is commonly terse and clear. Like most writers who have
                    themselves participated in the transactions they describe, he is not altogether
                    exempt from partiality. His history comprehends the period from the death of
                    Alexius Comnenus in ∏18 to the siege of Iconium by Manuel Comnenus in 1176, four
                    years before the death of that emperor. There is little doubt that Cinnamus
                    brought his work down to the close of Manuel’s reign, and that the conclusion is
                    lost. XII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nicetas Acominatus,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Choniates,</hi> a patrician and holder of many important public offices
                    under the emperor Isaac Angelus at the beginning of the 13th century, described
                    the same period as Cinnamus, but continued his narrative to 1206. The latter
                    books of Nicetas’s history possess especial importance, inasmuch as they contain
                    the Byzantine account of the taking of Constantinople by the Latins in the
                    fourth crusade (1204). Nicetas’s own palace was burned and plundered, and he
                    escaped with difficulty to Nicaea, where he composed his history under the
                    protection of the emperor Theodore Lascaris. His narrative, though too
                    rhetorical, is striking and pathetic; it necessarily requires careful comparison
                    with the Latin accounts. The remainder of his history is also valuable. He is
                    also said to be the author of an account of the statues destroyed by the Latins,
                    which, however, is thought to have been interpolated by a later writer. It has
                    been published by Wilken (Leipsic, 1830). XIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Georgius
                        Acropolita,</hi> an eminent scholar and diplomatist, who lived from
                    1220-1282, wrote the history of the Eastern empire during its subjugation by the
                    Latins (1204-1261). The work is so brief that it has been regarded as merely an
                    epitome of Acropolita’s original history. XIV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Georgius
                        Pachymeres,</hi> a priest and ecclesiastical jurist under Michael and
                    Andronicus Palaeologus, wrote the history of these emperors (1258-1308) in
                    thirteen books. Pachymeres is one of the best of the Byzantine historians; his
                    style is singularly good for his age, and his tone dignified and impartial. XV.
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Nicephorus Gregoras,</hi> a man of great learning, but
                    passionate and untrustworthy as an historian, wrote the history of his country
                    from 1204-1358, in thirty-eight books, the last fourteen of which remained
                    unpublished until 1855, when they were edited at Bonn by Immanuel Bekker. After
                    the recovery of Constantinople by the Greeks in 1261, Byzantine politics entered
                    into a new phase; the feeble and distracted empire, unable to make head against
                    the Turks, was compelled to lean for support upon the European powers, which it
                    sought to obtain by patching up the long-standing religious schism. Greeks and
                    Latins, however, were equally resolved to concede nothing save in appearance,
                    and the history of the time is to a great extent that of hollow negotiations,
                    meant only to deceive. In these Gregoras had a considerable share; he also took
                    an active part in the internal religious controversies of his church, and his
                    personal knowledge of affairs imparts considerable value to his history. He was
                    at one time a favourite of the Emperor Cantacuzenus, but was subsequently
                    persecuted by him. He possessed extensive attainments, and is especially
                    celebrated for having anticipated the astronomers of Pope Gregory XIII. in the
                    correction of the Julian Calendar. XVI. The Emperor <hi rend="smallcaps">John
                        Cantacuzenus,</hi> after his abdication, wrote the history of his times from
                    1320-1357, including the fifteen years of his own eventful reign. This “is
                    written,” as Dr Plate observes, “with elegance and dignity, and shows that the
                    author was a man of superior intelligence, fully able to understand and judge of
                    the great events of history ;” but Gibbon’s remark is no less just that
                    Cantacuzenus “presents, not a confession, but an apology of the life of an
                    ambitious statesman. Instead of unfolding the true counsels and characters of
                    men, he displays the smooth and specious surface of events, highly varnished
                    with his own praises and those of his friends.” The truth is arrived at by a
                    comparison of Cantacuzenus with the rival and inimical narrative of Nicephorus
                    Gregoras, so far as they cover the same ground. XVII. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    of the prince of that island, and wrote his history after the reduction of
                    Lesbos by the Turks in 1462. It commences in 1342, and goes down to the conquest
                    of Lesbos. Ducas is the most difficult and barbarous of all the Byzantine
                    historians, and the only one who appears entirely unacquainted with classical
                    models. At the same time he is among the most intelligent, impartial, and
                    sagacious. The ruin of the Greek empire has also been recorded by XX. <hi

                    of their disastrous period, and Phrantzes in particular played a very important
                    part in diplomacy. Broken hearted at the capture of his native city and the
                    death of his son and daughter in slavery, he retired to a monastery in Corfu,
                    where he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Chronicon</hi> about 1477, to which year it
                    extends. It commences at the year 1259, but by far the most valuable portion is
                    that which records the transactions of the author’s lifetime, and the value of
                    this is very great. Chalcocondyles, beginning at 1298, brings his history down
                    to the invasion of the Morea by the Turks in 1463. He also is an accomplished
                    man, of much experience in public business; and although his digressions
                    respecting the affairs and manners of other nations are irrelevant, and betray
                    ignorance, they are interesting as an index to the knowledge possessed by his
                    countrymen at his time.</p>

                <p>The contribution of the Byzantine historians to literature may be compared with
                    the part enacted by the Byzantine empire in the history of the world. That
                    empire added nothing to the treasures of civilization, but it preserved much.
                    Like the earth in winter, it seemed barren and unlovely, but it kept the good
                    seed hidden in its bosom for better days. Had it perished before the
                    intellectual revival of Western Europe, the solution of continuity between
                    ancient and modern culture would have been irreparable. In like manner the
                    Byzantine historians preserved the traditions of historical composition, while
                    their brethren of the West were merely chroniclers and annalists. They have
                    safely embalmed in their generally unattractive pages a vast mass of most
                    valuable information, for which we are in most cases solely dependent upon them,
                    and they aid us to reconstruct the polity, and to some extent the social life,
                    of what was for several centuries the only really civilized Christian state in
                    the world. They are undoubtedly for the most part perfectly ignorant of the
                    significance of their own times; they have postponed what was really interesting
                    to barren details of battles and court intrigues, and have wasted opportunities
                    which would have been invaluable to a philosophic historian. Cinnamus and Ducas
                    are the only two with any claim to this character, and Anna Comnena is the only
                    artist. When, however, all their disadvantages are taken into consideration, it
                    will probably be deemed that they are much better than might have been expected.
                    They were isolated from all the rest of the known world by prejudice, policy,
                    and religious hatred. There was no scientific or other intellectual movement in
                    their times, no aspiration for liberty, no conception of a more liberal culture;
                    they were crushed by a rigid despotism, and enthralled by an abject
                    superstition. Under these circumstances the good sense and sagacity of many
                    among them are very remarkable, and are chiefly to be explained by the large
                    proportion among them of men accustomed to practical life and public affairs.
                    Their roll includes sovereigns, generals, prime ministers, secretaries of state,
                    diplomatists, and other important public officers; even the ecclesiastics among
                    them are not recluses but men versed in business. The Byzantine civil service
                    was the strong point of the empire, and its solid if prosaic qualities are
                    admirably reflected by its literary representatives.</p>
                <p>The first collective edition of the Byzantine historians was published at Paris,
                    1648-1702, in 27 volumes, with a preface by Labbe, and notes and translations by
                    Fabrotus, Combefisius, and others. It was reprinted, with additions, at Venice,
                    1729-33. These editions are superseded by the great edition of Bonn, 1828-55, in
                    48 volumes, undertaken at the recommendation and under the superintendence of
                    Niebuhr, and continued after his death under the patronage of the Royal Prussian
                    Academy. The separate volumes are edited by Bekker, Dindorf, Hase, and other
                    distinguished scholars; nevertheless, according to Brunet, “de bons textes des
                    historiens byzantins restent encore à donner.” Like former collections it
                    contains several works of value not strictly belonging to Byzantine history, but
                    illustrative of it. No guide to Byzantine history is comparable to Gibbon, whose
                    narrative of this period is an unparalleled literary feat of masterly and
                    impartial condensation. See likewise Lebeau, <hi rend="italic">Histoire du
                        Bas</hi><hi rend="italic">Empire,</hi> Paris, 1824-36. Mr Finlay’s volumes
                    are also invaluable companions to the Byzantine historians. Of special works on
                    the subject, the most important is Hankius, <hi rend="italic">Be</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Byzantinarum</hi><hi rend="italic">rerum scriρtorilηιs
                        Groecis,</hi> Leipsic, 1677, a book distinguished by extensive and accurate
                    erudition, but necessarily deficient as respects the writers not published in
                    the author’s day. It contains notices of Byzantine ecclesiastical writers also.
                    Special points of interest are discussed in Von Hammer’s essay in the Göttingen
                        <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> (vol. 6) on the correction of the Byzantine
                    historians from Ottoman sources; in Heyne’s <hi rend="italic">Antiquatates
                        Byzantinoe</hi> (1808-11); and in Hullman’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des
                        Byzantinischen</hi><hi rend="italic">Handels</hi> (1808). Sabatier’s great
                    work on Byzantine numismatics also affords much illustrative matter, and there
                    is a lively sketch of the general social condition of the Eastern Empire in
                    Áugustin Marrasvs <hi rend="italic">Esquisses Byzantines.</hi> (Paris, 1874.)
