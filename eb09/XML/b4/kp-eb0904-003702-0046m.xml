                    bulk, now applied particularly to a printed composition forming a volume. The
                    name is also used for. the literary divisions of a work.</p>
                <p>Wachter, with some other writers, derives the word from the same root as the
                    German <hi rend="italic">biegen,</hi> to bend, as the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >volumen</hi> comes from <hi rend="italic">volvere.</hi> But the more common
                    etymology makes the tree the parent of the book, and refers the origin of the
                    latter (Angl. Sax., <hi rend="italic">boc;</hi> Germ., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Buch;</hi> Dutch, <hi rend="italic">boek)</hi> to writing on the bark of the
                    beech tree (Angl. Sax., <hi rend="italic">boc;</hi> Germ., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Buche</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Iccl., <hi rend="italic">beyke;</hi> Dutch,
                    <hi rend="italic">beuke),</hi> or perhaps on beach boards. Analogy supports this
                    derivation. The <hi rend="italic">byblos</hi> of the Greeks—whence their name
                    for a book—refers to the Egyptian papyrus itself, and the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">liber</hi> to the pellicle which enclosed its stalk. The <hi
                    rend="italic">codex</hi> of the Romans meant at first the trunk of a tree; and
                    tho <hi rend="italic">leaves</hi> of a book indicate a similar origin.</p>
                <p>The earliest writings were purely monumental, and accordingly those materials
                    were chosen which were supposed to last the longest. The same idea of perpetuity
                    which in architecture found its most striking exposition in the pyramids was
                    repeated, in the case of literary records, in the two columns mentioned by
                    Josephus, the one of stone and the other of brick, on which the children of Seth
                    wrote their inventions and astronomical discoveries; in the pillars in Crete on
                    which, according to Porphyry, the ceremonies of the Corybantes were inscribed;
                    in the leaden tablets containing the works of Hesiod, deposited in the temple of
                    the Muses, in Boeotia; in the ten commandments on stone delivered to Moses; and
                    in the laws of Solon, inscribed on planks of wood. The notion of a literary
                    production surviving the destruction of the materials on which it was first
                    written—the “monumentum aere perennius” of Horace’s ambition—was unknown before
                    the discovery of substances for systematic transcription.</p>
                <p>Tablets <hi rend="italic">(tabulae)</hi> of ivory or metal were in common use
                    among the Greeks and Romans. When made of wood— sometimes of citron, but usually
                    of beech or fir—their inner sides were coated with wax, on which the letters
                    were traced with a pointed pen or stiletto <hi rend="italic">(stylus),</hi> one
                    end of which was used for erasure. It was with his <hi rend="italic">stylus</hi>
                    that Caesar stabbed Casca in the arm when attacked by his murderers. Two such
                    tablets, joined together, were called <hi rend="italic">diptycha,</hi><note

                    of bookbinding. They were fastened together at the back by wires, which acted as
                    hinges; the pages were called <hi rend="italic">cerae,</hi> from their waxen
                    coating, and a raised margin was left round each to prevent obliteration by
                    friction. Wax tablets of this kind continued in partial use in Europe during the
                    Middle Ages; the oldest extant specimen, now in the museum at Florence, belongs
                    to the year 1301. The leaves of the palm tree were afterwards used in their
                    stead, as also the inner bark of the lime, tho ash, the maple, aud the elm. But
                    the earliest, though long obsolete, flexible material of importance was made
                    from the concentric coats which wrapped the stalk of the Egyptian <hi
                    rend="italic">papyriis,</hi> from which is derived our word <hi rend="italic"
                    >paper.</hi> The time of its introduction has been much disputed; but it was
                    certainly known long before Herodotus. The length of the Greek papyri is said to
                    vary from eight to twelve inches; the Latiu often reach sixteen. Some rolls,
                    however, have been found as long as thirty feet. They were written on with reeds
                    dipped in gum-water coloured with charcoal or soot of resin, the writing being
                    readily obliterated with a sponge; and it is conjectured that the surface was
                    sometimes prepared for that purpose with a wash or varnish. Pliny mentions also
                    the ink of the cuttie fish as having been used for writing, as well as a
                    decoction of the lees of wine.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    ink consisted of a preparation from cinnabar. The next material commonly
                    employed after papyrus was parchment, made from the skins of animals, usually of
                    sheep or lambs. Vellum is a finer substance, consisting of prepared calf-skin.
                    Parchment is commonly ascribed to Eumenes, king of Pergamus, in Asia Minor; but
                    he was, in all probability, not the inventor but the improver. Writing on skins
                    is mentioned by Herodotus as common in bis day; and Diodorus and Ctesias speak
                    of ancient Persian records on leather. The word itself <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pergamena)</hi> first occurs, according to Mabillon, in the writings of Tatto,
                    a monk of the 4th century. It appears to have superseded papyrus about the 7th
                    century; but its quality afterwards <pb break="no"

                    on, the back being frequently stained. Parchments written on both sides are
                    called by Pliny <hi rend="italic">opisthographi.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic"
                    >boc-fell</hi> is found, in early English, to designate this material. Its
                    dearness in classical times led to the practice of erasing the original writing
                    for the purpose of substituting new. Parchments so obliterated are known as <hi
                    rend="italic">palimpsests,</hi> from a Greek word signifying twice rubbed, or
                    prepared for writing; and they are alluded to under that name by Cicero <hi
                    rend="italic">(ad Div.</hi> vii. 18). Paper made from cotton <hi rend="italic"
                    >(charta bombycina')</hi> came into use, according to Montfaucon, towards the
                    end of the 9th or the beginning of the 10th century; and the invention was
                    opportune, as it checked the further use of palimpsests, which, from the
                    scarcity of parchment and the demand for books of devotion, had imperilled the
                    preservation of much classical literature. Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">De
                    Republica</hi> was discovered by Angelo Mai in the Vatican library written under
                    a commentary of St Augustine on the Psalms; and the Institutions of Gaius, in
                    the library of the chapter at Verona, were deciphered in like manner under the
                    works of St Jerome. But the invention of linen paper gave the first real impulse
                    to book production. The precise date of this invention is disputed; Mabillon
                    refers it to the 12th century. Montfaucon, however, found no specimens earlier
                    than 1270, and Maffei none before 1300; the most numerous of them belong to the
                    14th century. Scaliger ascribes the invention to the Germans, Maffei to the
                    Italians, and others to certain Greek refugees at Basel; while Duhalde refers it
                    to the Chinese, and Prideaux to the Saracens in Spain. For further particulars
                    respecting the various substances of early books, the reader may consult the

                    has given a list of authorities on this subject</p>
                <p>The form of ancient books differed with the materials of which they were
                    composed. When flexible matter came into use, it was found convenient to make
                    books in the form of rolls, and the two names are synonymous in legal
                    phraseology to this day. The papyrus, and afterwards the parchment, was joined
                    together to form one sheet, and then rolled upon a staff into a volume <hi
                    rend="italic">(volumen).</hi> When an author divided his work into portions or
                    “books,” in the literary sense of the word, each division was usually a <hi
                    rend="italic">volumen</hi> by itself,—thus Ovid speaks of his fifteen books of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> as so many <hi rend="italic"
                    >volumina</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the same was done when an entire work
                    was too bulky to be rolled on one stick. The staff in the Herculaneum rolls is
                    concealed by the papyrus, but it usually projected, the ends being ornamented
                    with bosses <hi rend="italic">(umbilici)</hi> of wood and ivory. The title <hi
                    rend="italic">(titulus index)</hi> was either suspended like a ticket to the
                    roll, or pasted on the outside. These rolls were frequently protected by a
                    parchment cover; they were deposited in a cylindrical box <hi rend="italic"
                    >(capsa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scrinium),</hi> or were arranged horizontally
                    in cases round the walls of a library, as at Herculaneum. Many books could
                    probably be stowed away in small compass by this means; and the smallness of the
                    rooms devoted in ancient times to such collections is readily explained in this
                    manner. The <hi rend="italic">volumen,</hi> however, in most cases, was far from
                    containing as much as our ordinary books, even in an octavo form. The square
                    form, originally applied to the <hi rend="italic">codices</hi> or wax tablets
                    joined together in the way described above, was resorted to afterwards for
                    separate leaves, the same name being retained with altered materials. Martial
                    speaks of this later kind of <hi rend="italic">codex</hi> as a novelty in his
                    day. It was common, however, in Greek MSS., among the earliest of which
                    Montfaucon discovered few specimens of rolls. The term <hi rend="italic"
                    >liber</hi> in the 4th century is found applied to both rolls and squared
                    leaves, but the former were discontinued in the Middle Ages, and covers of
                    boards -were gradually introduced, the leaves being stitched together as well as
                    folded.</p>
                <p>The internal arrangement of books has undergone many modifications, which belong,
                    however, chiefly to the subject of early writing. At first the letters were
                    divided only into lines, then into separate words, and these by degrees were
                    noted with accents, and distributed by points and stops into periods,
                    paragraphs, chapters, and other divisions. In some countries, as among the
                    Orientals, the direction of the characters was from right to left, in others, as
                    among the Northern and Western nations, from left to right. The early Greeks
                    followed the two directions alternately,—a method which was called <hi
                    rend="italic">boustrophedon,</hi> from its analogy to the path of oxen when
                    ploughing. In most countries the lines run from side to side, but in some,
                    particularly among the Chinese, their direction is vertical.</p>
                <p>The diffusion of early books concerns especially the literary historian. Their
                    scarcity before printing is illustrated by the conditions attached to purchase
                    or loan; but it must be remembered that a particular book might easily bear a
                    monopoly price, and that this is no test of the cost of those which might be
                    multiplied by transcription. When, however, the small number of copyists in the
                    Dark Ages and even later is considered, the high prices recorded in many
                    instances do not appear surprising. A curious collection of scattered notices of
                    this kind is given in the first volume of Warton’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    English Poetry.</hi> A catalogue of the books in the Sorbonne in 1292,
                    consisting of upwards of 1000 volumes, is mentioned by Chevillier<note

                    been valued at 3812 livres, equivalent, according to an English writer, to as
                    many pounds sterling of the present day. In 1425, when the English became
                    masters of Paris, the duke of Bedford, regent of France, sent the whole of the
                    royal library into England; and the collection, which amounted to only 853
                    volumes, was valued at 2223 livres.</p>
                <p>The characteristics of early printed books are noticed under the head of <hi

                    quarto sizes, originally adopted from the largeness of the types in the infancy
                    of printing, are now generally restricted to works of bulk, as dictionaries and
                    other books of reference. The size of a printed book is named from the
                    dimensions of the paper and the number of leaves into which it is folded. The
                    ordinary sizes for a long time were royal, demy, and crown; and the demy 8vo is
                    now the commonest size in use. Post and foolscap are frequently but inaccurately
                    described in catalogues as duodecimo. “Paper-moulds,” says Mr W. Blades,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Notes and
                    Queries,</hi> 3d series, ix. 83.</p></note> a competent authority on this
                    subject, “have fixed conventional sizes; but since the introduction of machines
                    for making paper, and the consequent disuse of moulds, makers work more by a
                    given number of inches than by names of sizes. Consequently, the correct
                    description of book sizes has become impossible, and the trade describe the new
                    by the names of the old size they most resemble. To determine the real size of a
                    bound book,” he adds, “find the signature (a letter or figure at the bottom of
                    the page), and count the <hi rend="italic">leaves</hi> (not pages) to the next.
                    A further test is the binder’s thread in the middle of the sheet; the number of
                    leaves from each thread to the next will give the same result. But these rules
                    do not apply to old black-letter books and those of the 15th and 16th centuries,
                    in which the most satisfactory test is the water-mark. The rule is :—a folio
                    volume will have all the water-marks in the middle of the page; a quarto has the
                    water-mark folded in half in the back of the book, still midway between the top
                    and bottom; in an octavo it is at the back, but at the top, and ofteD <pb

                <p>The trade in books is of a very ancient date. The early poets and orators recited
                    their effusions in public to induce their hearers to possess written copies of
                    their poems or orations. Frequently they were taken down <hi rend="italic">viva
                    voce,</hi> and transcripts sold to such as were wealthy enough to purchase. In
                    the book of Jeremiah the prophet is represented as dictating to Baruch the
                    scribe, who, when questioned, described the mode iu which his book was written.
                    These scribes were, in fact, the earliest booksellers, and supplied copies as
                    they were demanded. Aristotle, we are told, possessed a somewhat extensive
                    library; and Plato is recorded to have paid the large sum of one hundred minae
                    for three small treatises of Philolaus the Pythagorean. When the Alexandrian
                    library was founded about 300 n.c., various expedients were resorted to for the
                    purpose of procuring books, and this appears to have stimulated the energies of
                    the Athenian booksellers, who were termed <hi rend="italic">βιβλίων
                    κάπηλοι.</hi> In Rome, towards the end of the Republic, it became the fashion to
                    have a library as part of the household furniture; and the booksellers, <hi
                    rend="italic">librarii</hi> (Oic., <hi rend="italic">De Leg.,</hi> iii. 20) or
                    <hi rend="italic">bibliopoles</hi> (Martial, iv. 71, xiii. 3), carried on a
                    flourishing trade. Their shops <hi rend="italic">(taberna librarii,</hi> Cicero,
                    <hi rend="italic">Phil.,</hi> ii. 9) were chiefly in the Argiletum, and in the
                    Vicus Sandalarius. On the door, or on the side posts, was a list of the books on
                    sale; and Martial (i. 118), who mentions this also, says that a copy of his
                    First Book of Epigrams might be purchased for five denarii. Iu the time of
                    Augustus the great booksellers were the Sosii. According to Justinian (ii. 1,
                    33), a law was passed securing to the scribes the property in the materials
                    used; and in this may, perhaps, be traced the first germ of the modern law of
                    copyright.</p>
                <p>The spread of Christianity naturally created a great demand for copies of the
                    Gospels and other sacred books, and later on for Missals and other devotional
                    volumes for church and private use. Benedict Biscop, the founder of the abbey at
                    Wearmouth in England, brought home with him from France (671) a whole cargo of
                    books, part of which he had“bought,” but from whom is not mentioned. Passing by
                    the intermediate ages we find that, previous to the Reformation, the text
                    writers or stationers <hi rend="italic">(stacyoneres),</hi> who sold copies of
                    the books then in use,—the ABC, the Paternoster, Creed, Ave Maria, and other MS.
                    copies of prayers, in the neighbourhood of St Paul’s, London,—were, iu 1403,
                    formed into a guild. Some of these “stacyoneres” had stalls or stations built
                    against the very walls of the cathedral itself, in the same manner as they are
                    still to be found in some of the older Continental cities. In Mr Anstey <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s <hi rend="italic">Munimenta Academica,</hi>
                    published under the direction of the Master of the Rolls, we catch a glimpse of
                    the “sworn” university bookseller or stationer, John More of Oxford, who
                    apparently first supplied pupils. with their books, and then acted the part of a
                    pawnbroker. Mr Anstey says (p. 77), “The fact is that they (the students) mostly
                    could not afford to buy books, and had they been able, would not have found the
                    advantage so considerable as might be supposed, the instruction given being
                    almost wholly oral. The chief source of supplying books was by purchase from the
                    university sworn stationers, who had to a great extent a monopoly Of such books
                    there were plainly very large numbers constantly changing hands.” Besides the
                    sworn stationers.there were many booksellers in Oxford who were not sworn; for
                    one of the statutes, passed in the year 1373, expressly recites that, in
                    consequence of their presence, “books of great value are sold and carried away
                    from Oxford, the owners of them are cheated, and the sworn stationers are
                    deprived of their lawful business.” It was therefore enacted that no bookseller
                    except two sworn stationers, or their deputies, should sell any book being
                    either his own property or that of another, exceeding half a mark in value,
                    under pain of imprisonment, or, if the offence was repeated, of abjuring his
                    trade within the university.</p>
                <p>“The trade in bookselling seems,” says Hallam, “to have been established at Paris
                    and Bologna in the 12 th century; the lawyers and universities called it into
                    life. It is very improbable that it existed in what we properly call the Dark
                    Ages. Peter of Blois mentions a book which he had bought of a public dealer <hi
                    rend="italic">(a quodam</hi><hi rend="italic">publico</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mangone librorum)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but we do not find many distinct
                    accounts of them till the next age. These dealers were denominated siαiionαm,
                    perhaps from the open stalls at which they carried on their business, though <hi
                    rend="italic">statio</hi> is a general word for a shop in low Latin. They
                    appear, by the old statutes of the University of Paris, and by those of Bologna,
                    to have sold books upon commission, and are sometimes, though not uniformly,
                    distinguished from the <hi rend="italic">librarii,</hi> a word which, having
                    originally been confined to the copyists of books, was afterwards applied to
                    .those who traded in them. They sold parchment and other materials of writing,
                    which have retained the name of stationery, and they naturally exercised the
                    kindred occupations of binding and decorating. They probably employed
                    transcribers; we find at least that there was a profession of copyists in the
                    universities and in large cities.”</p>
                <p>The modern system of bookselling dates from soon after the introduction of
                    printing. The earliest printers were also editors and booksellers; but being
                    unable to sell every copy of the works they printed, they had agents at most of
                    the seats of learning. Antony Koburger, who introduced the art of printing into
                    Nuremberg in 1470, although a printer, was more of a bookseller; for, besides
                    his own sixteen shops, we are informed by his biographers that he had agents for
                    the sale of his books in every city of Christendom. Wynkin de Worde, who
                    succeeded to Caxton’s press in Westminster, had a shop iu Fleet Street.</p>
                <p>The religious dissensions of the Continent, and the Reformation in England under
                    Henry VIII. and Edward VI., created a great demand for books; but in England
                    neither Tudor nor Stuart could tolerate a free press, and various efforts were
                    made to curb it. The first patent for the office of king’s printer was granted
                    to Thomas Berthelet by Henry VIII. in 1529, but only such books as were first
                    licensed were to be printed. At that time even the purchase or possession of an
                    unlicensed book was a punishable offence. In 1556 (3 and 4 Philip and Mary) the
                    London Company of Stationers was incorporated, and very extensive powers were
                    granted in order that obnoxious books might be repressed. In the following
                    reigns the Star Chamber exercised a pretty effectual censorship; but in spite of
                    all precaution, such was the demand for books of a polemical nature, that many
                    were printed abroad and surreptitiously introduced into England. Queen Elizabeth
                    interfered but little with books except when they emanated from 'Roman
                    Catholics, or touched upon her royal prerogatives; and towards the end of her
                    reign, and during that of her pedantic successor, James, bookselling flourished.
                    Archbishop Laud, who was no friend to booksellers, introduced many arbitrary
                    restrictions; but they were all, or nearly all, removed during the time of the
                    Commonwealth. So much had bookselling increased during the Protectorate that, in
                    1658, was published <hi rend="italic">A Catalogue of the most Vendible Books in
                    England, digested under the heads of Divinity, History, Physic, &lt;kc., with
                    School Books, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, and an Introduction, for the use
                    of</hi><pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n49/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0049-0040"/><hi rend="italic">Schools,</hi> by W. London. A
                    bad time immediately followed. The Restoration also restored the office of
                    Licenser of the Press, which continued till 1694.</p>
                <p>In the first Copyright Act (8 Anne, c. 19), which specially relates to
                    booksellers, it is enacted that, if any person shall think the published price
                    of a book unreasonably high, he may thereupon make complaint to the archbishop
                    of Canterbury, and to certain other persons named, who shall thereupon examine
                    into his complaint, and if well founded reduce the price; and any bookseller
                    charging more than the price so fixed shall be fined £5 for every copy sold.
                    Apparently this enactment remained a dead letter.</p>
                <p>The modern bookselling trade divides itself into the several branches of
                    publishing and wholesale bookselling, and the retail, the old or second-hand,
                    and the periodical trades. Publishing is confined to a few of the larger cities,
                    London naturally taking the lead, followed by Edinburgh, Glasgow, Oxford,
                    Manchester, Liverpool, Cambridge, Dublin, and a few other places; while purely
                    wholesale dealers are to be found in the large towns only. In Great Britain, and
                    especially in Scotland, booksellers are located in every small town; but in
                    Ireland there are very few, except in the chief cities. Formerly the retail
                    booksellers were expected to demand the full retail price of a book, and make no
                    greater reduction than discount for ready money; but this restriction has been
                    discontinued as contrary to the spirit of free trade. The trade in old or (they
                    are sometimes called) second-handbooks is in a sense a higher class of business,
                    requiring a knowledge of bibliography, while the transactions are with
                    individual books rather than with numbers of copies. Occasionally dealers in
                    this class of books replenish their stocks by purchasing remainders of books,
                    which, having ceased from one cause or another to sell with the publisher, they
                    offer to the public as bargains. The periodical trade is entirely the growth of
                    the present century, and was in its infancy when the <hi rend="italic">Penny
                    Magazine, Chambers's Journal,</hi> and similar publications first appeared. The
                    growth of this important part of the business has been greatly promoted by the
                    abolition of the newspaper stamp and of the duty upon paper, the introduction of
                    attractive illustrations, and the facilities offered for purchasing books by
                    instalments.</p>
                <p>The history of bookselling in the New World has yet to be written. The Spanish
                    settlements in America drew away from the old country much of its enterprise and
                    best talent, and the presses of Mexico and other cities teemed with publications
                    mostly of a religious character, but many others, especially linguistic and
                    historical, waere also published. Bookselling in the United States was of a
                    somewhat later growth, although printing was introduced into New York as early
                    as 1673, Boston in 1674, and Philadelphia in 1683. Franklin had served to make
                    the trade illustrious, yet few persons were engaged in it at the commencement of
                    the present century. Books chiefly for scholars and libraries were imported from
                    Europe; but after the second war printing-presses multiplied rapidly, and with
                    the spread of newspapers and education there also arose a demand for books, and
                    publishers set to work to secure the advantages offered by the wide field of
                    English literature, the whole of which they had the liberty of reaping free of
                    all cost beyond that of production. The works of Scott, Byron, Moore, Southey,
                    Wordsworth, and indeed of every author of note, were reprinted without the
                    smallest payment to author or proprietor. Half the names of the authors in the
                    so called “American” catalogue of books printed between 1820 and 1852 are
                    British. By this means the works of the best authors have been brought to the
                    doors of all classes in the cheapest variety of forms. In consequence of the war
                    with the Southern States, the high price of labour, and the restrictive duties
                    laid on in order to protect native industry, coupled with the frequent
                    intercourse between the two countries, a great change has taken place during the
                    last few years. Books printed and bound in Britain are greatly appreciated, and
                    American publishers, in the absence of an international copyright, make liberal
                    offers for early sheets of new publications. Boston, New York, and Philadelphia
                    still retain their old supremacy as bookselling centres.</p>
                <p>In Australia the sale of books is not large at present; there are, however,
                    indications of a great increase. The booksellers there as in Canada, although
                    supposed to be bound by the copyright law restricting the sale of any but
                    genuine editions, avail themselves of American and other reprints, in which the
                    authors have little or no interest.</p>
                <p>In the course of the 16th and 17th centuriβ3 the Low Countries for a time became
                    the chief centre of the bookselling world, and many of the finest folios and
                    quartos in our libraries bear the names of Jansen, Blauw, or Plantin, with the
                    imprint of Amsterdam, Utrecht, Leyden, or Antwerp, while the Elzevirs besides
                    other works produced their charming little pocket classics. The southern towns
                    of Douai and St Omer at the same time furnished polemical works in English.</p>
                <p>Germany, the birthplace of the art of printing, is still the first bookselling
                    country in the world. There, distributed over 786 towns, are 3473 publishers and
                    booksellers, Leipsic being the centre to which they all look, all of any
                    consequence having an agency there, where their books are collected, and their
                    own publications distributed. In Leipsic there are 105 commission-agents for
                    4202 booksellers, of whom 1143 carry on business in Austria, France, Russia,
                    Holland, America, and England. The book exchange has 115 members who transact
                    business there. The other centres of the German book trade are Stuttgart, with
                    16 agents for 542 booksellers; Vienna, with 31 agents for 475; Berlin, with 29
                    agents for 305; and Prague, with 18 agents for 98. The great book fair at
                    Leipsic is held every year immediately after Easter, and is attended by
                    booksellers from every part of the world.</p>
                <p>In France the press is still shackled, and every book and pamphlet must be
                    registered before publication; but notwithstanding this booksellers flourish,
                    especially in all the large towns, and some of the finest illustrated works of
                    the day are issued from the French press. In Italy booksellers are few, and in
                    Spain they can hardly be said to have any existence at all.</p>
                <p>From the <hi rend="italic">English Catalogue of Books for</hi> 1874 it appears
                    that there were about 4500 books published in Great Britain and Ireland during
                    that year. This number includes new editions of works previously issued, as well
                    as the principal books published in the United States.</p>
                <p>The values of books exported and imported during 1874 are given in the official
