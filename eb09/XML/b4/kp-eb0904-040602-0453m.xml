                    Brutus), which character, however, he had assumed with a view both to his
                    present security and future revenge. The opportunity came when Lucretia, wife of
                    Collatinus, was outraged by Sextus Tarquinius; and he took a leading part,
                    together with her husband and father, in expelling the family of the Tarquinii
                    from Rome. He and Collatinus were therefore elected consuls,—or rather praetors,
                    which was the original title. In a conspiracy formed afterwards for the
                    restoration of the banished dynasty, the two sons of Brutus were found to be
                    deeply implicated, and were executed by sentence of their father, and in his
                    sight. The Etruscans of the cities of Veii and Tarquinii making an attempt to
                    restore Tarquinius to the throne, a battle took place between them and the
                    Romans, in which Junius Brutus engaged Aruns, son of the deposed king, in single
                    combat on horseback, and both fell by each other’s hands. The Roman matrons are
                    said to have mourned a year for him, as “the avenger of woman’s honour,” and a
                    statue was erected to him on the Capitol.</p>
                <p>Many members of the family rose to eminence in the Republic, and are found, as
                    plebeians, ranged on the popular side. The most distinguished of these was <hi

                <p>In later times came <hi rend="smallcaps">Marcus Junius Brutus,</hi> a jurist of
                    high authority, considered as one of the founders of Roman civil law, to whom
                    Cicero dedicates his treatise called <hi rend="italic">Orator.</hi> His son, of
                    the same name, made a great reputation at the Roman bar, chiefly by undertaking
                    prosecutions, and from the vehemence and bitterness of his speeches became known
                    as “the Accuser.”</p>

                    served under Julius Caesar in Gaul, and afterwards commanded his fleet, and was
                    held by him in great honour and esteem. Nevertheless, whether from patriotism or
                    from lower motives, he joined in the conspiracy against his patron, and, like
                    his relative Marcus Junius Brutus, was one of his assassins. He afterwards
                    resisted the attempt of Antony to obtain absolute power; and after heading the
                    republican armies against him for some time with success, was deserted by his
                    soldiers in Gaul, betrayed by one of the native chiefs, and put to death by
                    order of Antony, 43 B.c.</p>
                <p>Best known of all is <hi rend="smallcaps">Marcus Junius Brutus,</hi> son of a
                    father of the same name (treacherously put to death by order of Pompey during
                    the civil wars), and of Servilia, sister of Cato of Utica. Young Marcus was only
                    eight years old at his father’s death, and was educated with great care by his
                    mother and uncles. He at first practised as an advocate. In spite of his
                    father’s fate, he at first supported the cause of Pompey against Caesar, but was
                    pardoned by the latter after the victory of Pharsalia, and subsequently
                    appointed by him to the government of Cisalpine Gaul. His justice and moderation
                    won him great honour from the provincials under his rule. Influenced probably by
                    his friend Caius Cassius, he afterwards joined in the conspiracy against the
                    great dictator, and was one of the foremost in his assassination. He maintained
                    the cause of the republic by seizing and holding against Antony’s forces the
                    province of Macedonia, where he was joined by Cassius. But at Philippi they were
                    defeated by Antony and Octavianus Caesar, and rather than be taken prisoner, he
                    fell on his sword, 42 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> He was an earnest studerit
                    through all his active life, and is said to have been employed in his tent, on
                    the night before the battle of Pharsalia, in making an abridgment of
                    Pausanias.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Is not the

                    nothing has survived. He combined with these tastes the incongruous occupation
                    of a money-lender, Cicero and King Ariobarzanes being amongst his clients. His
                    second wife was his cousin Portia, daughter of Cato.</p>
