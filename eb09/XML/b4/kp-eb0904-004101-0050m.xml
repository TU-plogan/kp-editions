                <p><label type="entry">BOOKBINDING</label> is the art of fastening together the
                    sheets of paper composing a book, and enclosing them in cases of pasteboard
                    covered with leather, cloth, or other materials,—the object being the
                    preservation of the book, and its protection from injury while in use.</p>
                <p>t At the time when books were rarities, being either manuscripts produced by
                    patient secluded labour or the productions of the printing-press during the
                    infancy of typography, they were naturally very highly prized; and as much
                    labour and expense were bestowed upon the protection and embellishment of a
                    cherished folio as would suffice at the present day for the building of a house.
                    The wooden cover of a book, with its metal hinges, bosses, guards, and clasps,
                    seems, in all but dimensions, fit for a church door; but the great improvement
                    in all the mechanical arts, together with the extension of education to all
                    classes, and the consequent diffusion of knowledge, has led to the
                    multiplication of books, and the gradual but radical changes witnessed during
                    the present century in the art of bookbinding.</p>
                <p>For a period of one thousand years—from the end of the 5th to the 15 th
                    century—books were excessively rare and costly, and comparatively few bindings
                    illustrative of the art during the Dark Ages have been preserved to the present
                    day. From being the task of slaves during the Roman empire, the transcribing of
                    books came to be the duty of monks, who copied and bound the works which were
                    among the chief treasures of religious establishments. Numerous documents exist
                    indicating the attention which was given by all grades of the priestly order to
                    the binding and preservation of their literary treasures. The general aspect of
                    monastic bindings was thick, heavy, and solid, and according to modern ideas
                    somewhat clumsy. Books for common use were enclosed in boards of hard wood
                    covered with leather, with the binding protected by metallic bosses, corner
                    plates, and clasps. The literary treasures, on the other hand, of kings and
                    ecclesiastical dignitaries, and the sacred volumes of churches and monasteries,
                    were encased in ivory sides, with appropriate subjects artistically carved on
                    them, in silver and sometimes even gold <hi rend="italic">plaques,</hi> or in
                    the enamels of Limoges, &amp;c.; and these bindings were frequently enriched
                    besides with gems and jewels. Often these precious volumes were, in keeping with
                    ancient customs, further preserved in boxes or cases no less rich and costly
                    than the bindings they were meant to preserve. As the period of the Renaissance
                    approached, silk and velvet came into use for ornamental bindings.</p>
                <p>The most ancient binding in the British Museum is the St Cuthbert gospels and
                    manuscript, written about the beginning of the 8th century, bound in velvet
                    intermixed with silver, with a broad silver border, enriched with inlaid gems.
                    One of the most ancient and remarkable of bindings, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lectionarium,</hi> which was formerly in the collection of Μ. Libri, that
                    eminent bibliophile thus describes in his <hi rend="italic">Monuments</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">inédits</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> “Manuscript upon vellum of
                    the 11th or 12th century in an ornamented cover (forming a diptych), both sides
                    being gilt and silvered metal, with ivory carvings, figures in <hi rend="italic"
                    >alto rilievo,</hi> and enamels <hi rend="italic">en taille d'épargne.</hi> The
                    borders contain thirty-two large ivory medallions (sixteen on each side),
                    representing the old prophets and saints, with their symbols, and having
                    inscriptions in ancient uncial letters, the whole surrounded with a foliage of
                    ivory work in the Greek style, and with baguettes carved in compartments. The
                    ivory medallions are very early, probably as old as the 6th century, whilst the
                    enamels and metal ornamentation are specimens of the handiwork of a rather later
                    period. . . . This <hi rend="italic">Lectionarium</hi> has evidently been
                    inserted in the present cover at a later period, the original one having most
                    probably been damaged or destroyed by use.” Referring to this work, Μ. Libri, in
                    the introduction to the volume above quoted, says: “Whether the enamels
                    contained in this binding are Byzantine and contemporary with the ivory
                    sculptures, or were introduced later (as we have shown was frequently the case)
                    into an older covering, the medallions and other workmanship in ivory, adorning
                    the sides of this coating, appear, from the character of the heads, from the
                    inscriptions, and from the workmanship itself, to date back to the earliest
                    period of the Byzantine school.”</p>
                <p>With the invention of printing, and the consequent multiplication of books in a
                    portable shape, came the modern style of bookbinding. The old massive boards,
                    with their bosses, corner plates, and heavy clasps disappeared, and thin sides
                    covered with leather, parchment, and vellum came into use. Bindings in which
                    enamels, precious metals, or gems were employed almost entirely disappeared, and
                    were followed by bindings in richly-coloured leather or vellum, with elaborate
                    designs, blind-tooled or worked in gold and colour, and gilt gauffré edges. By
                    the wealthy and powerful families of Italy this style of binding and
                    ornamentation was first encouraged towards the end of the 15 th century, and
                    skilful artists were employed to design appropriate decorations to be worked out
                    by the bookbinders. Among the most famous early patrons of the bibliopegic art
                    in Italy were Michael and Thomas Maioli, the books of the latter being the
                    models on which were fashioned the bindings of later collectors and of other
                    countries. More rare and artistically valuable still are the works of another
                    Italian collector of the 16th century, Demetrio Canevari, commonly called
                    Mecenate, physician to Pope Urban. They are distinguished by a medallion
                    executed in gold, silver, and colour, with the device of a charioteer driving
                    towards Pegasus on an elevation, and the motto, OPΘΩ2. KAI. MH ΛOSIΩ2. These
                    elegantly gilt bindings have, in the opinion of Μ. Libri, never been
                    surpassed.</p>
                <p>Artistic bindings of Italy and Italian binders were brought to France by Charles
                    VIII. and Louis XII.; but it was not till the time of Francis I.—himself a lover
                    of books and bindings—that Grolier, his military treasurer and the governor of
                    Milan, brought the French school of binding suddenly to the front, and placed
                    it, where it long remained, at the head of the art in Europe. The bindings
                    executed for Grolier usually contain on their obverse the inscription, IO.
                    GROL·IERII ET AMICORUM, and on the reverse his usual motto was PORTIO MEA DOMINE
                    SIT IN TERRA VIVENTIUM. Of Grolier’s bindings the learned De Thou, a later and
                    little less famous French bibliophile, remarked “that his books partook of the
                    elegance and polish of their owner.” The Grolier style is yet recognized as the
                    most chaste, elegant, and appropriate method of book ornamentation, and it
                    immediately attained an enormous reputation in France. “The very tools used by
                    his binders,” remarks Μ. Libri, “were employed for contemporary collectors, and
                    his admirable patterns have been imitated and copied by other French
                    bibliophiles. The gradual change in those patterns is very perceptible. At first
                    they were formed by a simple and chaste combination of various links only; but
                    afterwards Grolier successively introduced into the designs more rich ornaments,
                    such as small flowers, wreaths, &amp;c.” Some of his later covers were
                    resplendent with gold and coloured ornament, most elaborately tooled.</p>
                <p>After the period of Grolier the taste for magnificent bindings in France grew
                    into a passion, and the sumptuous bindings in which the famous Diana of Poitiers
                    indulged <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n51/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0051-0042"/> are almost without parallel. The designs for many
                    of her bindings are said to have been prepared by order of her royal lover Henry
                    II., under the superintendence of the celebrated artist Le Petit Bernard. Her
                    books are marked with her favourite symbols, the luuar crescent and the bow, and
                    the monogram D q, sometimes (probably in the case of love-gifts) with the H of
                    Henry interlaced, and surmounted by the crown. It would be a useless and almost
                    endless task to name the patrons of artistic bindings up to near the period of
                    the revolutionary outbreak, during which long time French binders stood at the
                    head of their craft. Such outstanding names among many bibliophiles as those of
                    the historian De Thou (Jacobus Augustus Thuanus) and Colbert, the minister of
                    Louis XIV., cannot be passed over. Such was Colbert’s care for artistic
                    bookbinding that, in a treaty with Marocco, he inserted a stipulation for a
                    certain number of skins annually to ba used for bindings in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliothèque Royale.</hi> Much less is known concerning the
                    bookbinders themselves than of their patrons and the works they executed; but
                    prominent among the bibliopegic artists of all times stand the chief French <hi
                    rend="italic">relieurs</hi> of the 17th and 18th centuries—Le Gascon, Abbé
                    Dusseuil, Padeloup, and Derome. Bindings by these artists are among the esteemed
                    prizes of modern collectors.</p>
                <p>Although during the 16th and 17th centuries bindings were produced in England
                    which suffer no disgrace by comparison with contemporary masterpieces of French,
                    Italian, and German bibliopegy, it was not till well into the 18th century that
                    England took the leading place in the workmanlike forwarding and artistic
                    finishing of books. Silk and velvet long remained the favourite coverings for
                    the more costly bound books in the royal library, and down to the time of James
                    I. we find very elaborately worked bindings in these substances. But, at the
                    same time, there are not wanting magnificent examples of work in calf, morocco,
                    and vellum, with blind and gold toolings, and gilt gauffré edges. The bindings
                    of John Beynes, bookbinder to Henry VIII., had embossed on them the curious
                    heraldic conceit of a shield, supported by a pair of unicorns, charged with the
                    emblems of the passion, and along with his monogram the inscription <hi
                    rend="italic">Redemptoris mundi</hi><hi rend="italic">arma.</hi> Before James
                    VI. of Scotland came as James I. to the English throne, he was, as became his
                    literary character, a collector of books and a lover of bindings. John Gibson of
                    Edinburgh held, under James, the office of royal binder, with an annual salary
                    of £20 Scots. A detailed list of bindings, with the prices charged by Gibson, is
                    printed by the Bannatyne Club in <hi rend="italic">The Library of Mary Queen of
                    Scots and James VI.</hi> Mr J. T. Gibson-Craig of Edinburgh has in his excellent
                    collection an original Scotch binding from the library of Queen Mary, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Clonique</hi><hi rend="italic">de Savoye,</hi> a small folio in
                    brown calf, richly tooled in silver, with the Scottish arms, and the initial Μ.
                    The same collector also possesses a Scotch binding in brown calf, with blind and
                    gold panelling, gilt and gauffré edges, with the name and arms of the Earl of
                    Bothwell, the third husband of Queen Mary. De Quincey, in a paper on “Secret
                    Societies,” ranks a Bible bound by Mr Farrer in 1635 above the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chefs d'oeuvre</hi> of British and Continental artists.</p>
                <p>The acknowledged supremacy attained by English bookbinding in the latter half of
                    last century is due in large measure to the work of Roger Payne, a man gifted
                    with extraordinary skill, dexterity, and taste, but unfortunately also of the
                    most erratic and dissolute habits. Payne’s work was, as he himself expressed it,
                    “very carefully and honestly done;” his tooling especially was very beautiful,
                    and his ornaments, many of which he fashioned with his own hands, were at once
                    highly appropriate and artistic. In his bills he was in the habit of taking Ins
                    patrons into his confidence in an unusual manner, and one of these may be worth
                    copying.</p>

                    Tools must be fitted and cover’d at the bottom with Gold to prevent flaws and
                    cracks.”</p>
                <p>Payne, in poverty aud distress, came prematurely to a drunkard’s grave in 1797.
                    His style of binding bas still many admirers, and the Roger Payne style is one
                    of the established methods of finishing in bookbinders’ establishments at the
                    present day. After Payne, Charles Lewis was the next famous English binder
                    flourishing in London in the early part of the present century, and his bindings
                    come down to and connect with the work of bibliopegistic artists who still
                    exercise their calling.</p>
                <p>The operations of bookbinding are now carried on upon a scale which could not
                    have been dreamt of even at the beginning of the present century, and the
                    millions of volumes which annually issue from the press could not possibly be
                    put into the hands of the reading public in the form and at the price at which
                    they are sold without the aid of machinery. In Great Britain nearly all books
                    are first issued in cloth cases, and while the greatest variety of grain and
                    colouring has been reached in the preparation of the cloth for such cases, their
                    gilding, embossing, and lettering, all accomplished by machinery, leave almost
                    no improvement to be desired, and the most handsome and fairly durable bindings
                    can thus be supplied at an incredibly small cost. At the same time, it is
                    practicable to prepare, emboss, and gild cheap leather covers by the same
                    processes and machinery adopted for cloth cases, and the bindings of cheap
                    family and pocket Bibles are thus produced. But although the old solid and
                    substantial handiwork of the craft is thus fairly eclipsed, there is still
                    employment—and more employment than ever—for binders in leather, who chiefly
                    rely on manual dexterity for the forwarding of their work, and individual taste
                    and skill for its artistic finishing.</p>
                <p>Modem bookbinding thus divides itself into two principal branches—1st, Leather
                    work, and all kinds in which manual labour and skill are chiefly employed; and
                    2d, Cloth-casing, or such work as is largely executed by the aid of
                    machinery.</p>
                <p>It may be convenient first to notice the various operations through λvhich a book
                    passes in ordinary or leather binding. These operations are grouped under two
                    main di vision»—“forwarding” and “finishing.” Under the first is comprehended
                    everything necessary to the preservation of a book; the second concerns merely
                    the embellishment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forwarding.—</hi> In the first place, the sheets of a book <hi
                    rend="italic">axe folded</hi> in such a manner that the pages follow each other
                    in consecutive order. In this operation the binder is guided by the
                    “signatures,” which indicate the part of a sheet to be superimposed upon
                    another. This labour is performed by women and girls, who acquire incredible
                    dexterity by continued practice. The sheets, after being folded, are loose and
                    bulky. The next operation has for its object the bringing them into a more
                    compact form, which was formerly accomplished by beating them with a broad-faced
                    hammer upon a smooth flat stone. The condensing or compacting is now generally
                    accomplished by passing the sheets between the cylinders of a rolling-machine. A
                    quantity of sheets, called a “section,” is gathered and arranged between two
                    pieces of tin plate and passed through <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0052-0043"/> between the powerful cast-iron rollers of the
                    machine. After rolling, the sections composing a volume, supposing it to have
                    been necessary to press it in more than one division, are brought together and
                    carefully collated. The whole of the sheets to compose the volume being found in
                    their proper place and order, they are taken in sections to the standing-press,
                    in which a number of them are piled up between boards. The form of
                    standing-press generally used is what is termed the Atholl or Isle of Man press,
                    on account of the three arms, or rather legs, by which the compound screw of the
                    press is worked.</p>
                <p>The volumes are then adjusted and clamped up in the laying or cutting-press for
                    the operation of <hi rend="italic">sawing the back.</hi> Two or three grooves
                    are, in this operation, sawn straight across the back of the volume, according
                    to the number of bands on which the book is to be sewed. In these grooves the
                    bands are lodged, so that when the sewing of the book is complete, the bands are
                    “flush” with the rest of the back, instead of projecting out as they did in old
                    times. A slight cut is made near each end for holding the “kettle stitch,” or
                    stitch by which the sewer fastens her thread each time she passes up and down.
                    The <hi rend="italic">sewing</hi> is done at an apparatus called the
                    sewing-press or frame, upon which the number of cords to be employed are
                    fastened at proper distances, in accordance with the saw-marks in the back of
                    the volume. The method of sewing varies according as the sewer is working one or
                    two “sheets on;” and the number of bands employed may be from two to six,
                    according to the size of sheet, weight of the book, &amp;c. When taken out of
                    the sewingframe the fly-leaves are pasted on, and the volume being neatly
                    squared, the back is covered with a coating of thin glue; it is then laid on a
                    board and allowed gradually to dry. When the glue is quite dry the back is <hi
                    rend="italic">rounded</hi> by beating with a hammer, and subsequently the volume
                    is placed between two feather-edged boards, above which the back slightly
                    projects. These are then placed together in a lying-press, for the <hi
                    rend="italic">backing</hi> process, that is, the back of the book is well beaten
                    until it projects a little over each side of the bevelled board, so as to form a
                    groove or place for the millboard covers to lie in. The book is now ready for
                    the <hi rend="italic">boarding.</hi> The boards were formerly, as the name
                    indicates, really of wood, but now of millboard of various thicknesses,
                    according to the size of the book. They are cut a little larger than the book
                    itself, and are attached by the ends of the bands, left for that purpose, being
                    passed through holes in the sides of the boards. The ends of the slips or bands
                    are then frayed out, pasted down, and hammered flat and smooth. The volume is
                    next placed between pressing boards, and put with others into the
                    standing-press, where it is submitted to a powerful f)ressure for several hours.
                    Thereafter it is again fastened into a ying-press for cutting or <hi
                    rend="italic">ploughing</hi> the edges with a knife-edged instrument called the
                    plough. The object of the binder in this operation is to make every page of
                    uniform size, presenting a smooth and equal “head,” “tail,” and “fore-edge.” The
                    binder is careful to leave as broad a margin as practicable; but the size of the
                    smallest sheet is the real gauge of the whole book. The head is first cut, next
                    the tail, and before the face is cut it is necessary to have the back flattened
                    by passing “trindles” through between the cords and the boards. After the face
                    has been ploughed the back springs back into its rounded form, and thus the face
                    presents the appearance of having been cut in the round.</p>
                <p>The book is now ready to have its edges either <hi rend="italic">sprinkled,
                    coloured, marbled,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gilt. Sprinkling</hi> is
                    accomplished by merely mixing the colour or colours with paste or size, and
                    throwing the mixture from a brush violently on the edges. The uniform <hi
                    rend="italic">colouring</hi> of the edges is done by screwing the volume up in
                    the lying-press and applying the colour with a sponge. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marbling</hi> is usually carried on as a separate trade, and requires
                    considerable adroitness. The colours to be used are thrown into a square shallow
                    trough containing prepared gum water, and as they float on the top they are
                    dexterously mixed and combed through each other so as to produce the kind of
                    marble pattem desired. In this the edges to be marbled are dipped, and when they
                    are withdrawn it is found that the marbled colours have adhered to them. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">gilding</hi> the fore-edge or face is first operated on; and
                    to level it the back must again be flattened, as in ploughing. The book is then
                    firmly fixed in the lying-press, and the edges are scraped and smoothed with a
                    steel scraper. The edges are next coloured, the gold, size, consisting of white
                    of egg mixed with water, called glaire, is laid on with a camel’s-hair brush,
                    and immediately covered with gold leaf. When dry, it is burnished by rubbing
                    with an agate burnisher, and the head and tail are put through the same
                    processes. Gilt edges in early bound books were usually <hi rend="italic"
                    >gauffré,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> had designs impressed on them; but
                    scarcely any such work is now done.</p>
                <p>The head-bands, which are next attached to the back head and tail, are ornamental
                    appendages, which partly conceal the folded-in edges of the leather, and give a
                    finished aspect to the book. They consist of strips of vellum or parchment
                    worked over with coloured silk or cotton, and are partly glued to the backs and
                    partly fastened by threads passing through the kettle stitches. The back is then
                    lined with strong paper glued on it, two or three thicknesses being used
                    according to the weight of the book. Nearly all books are now bound with open or
                    elastic backs, that is, with the leather of the cover not attached to the back
                    of the sheets. The elastic back is composed of a strip of thin cardboard as long
                    as the volume and a little broader than the back, so that it covers the whole
                    back, and is glued in the joint at the edge of the millboards. Across this
                    elastic back false bands are glued to imitate the projections produced by the
                    cords of ancient bindings; and when these are dry, the book is ready for
                    covering.</p>
                <p>The materials used for <hi rend="italic">covering</hi> are very various; but for
                    the greater part of modern books calf-skin dyed of various colours is employed;
                    while kid-skin, and its imitation in sheep-skin or roan, and sheep-skin
                    acknowledged as such, in which school-books and many law-books are bound, are
                    also used in great quantities. The piece of leather, cut to a proper size, is
                    moistened with water, next covered on the inner side with paste or glue, and
                    then applied evenly to tlιe millboard sides. The superfluous edge of the
                    leather, first pared to reduce its thickness, is turned over on the inside, and
                    concealed from view by the end papers attached to the sheets forming the book,
                    which are subsequently pasted down upon the millboards. As a last operation in
                    forwarding, but one now frequently omitted, the book is “corded,” that is,
                    firmly tied between two boards until it is dry, so as to insure perfect
                    smoothness in the cover. A book is <hi rend="italic">half-bound</hi> when only
                    the back and comers are protected with leather, the rest of the boards being
                    covered with prepared paper or cloth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Finishing.—</hi> Finishing processes are so varied and
                    numerous, according to the material under treatment and the effect to be
                    produced, that a lengthy treatise would be required to detail the operations. It
                    will suffice here to notice the operations in finishing an ordinary white-calf
                    binding. The whole of the leather is first λvashed over with a thin paste of the
                    consistency of cream and allowed to dιy. The colouring is then done by brushing
                    over it a solution of “salts of tartar” (tartrate of potash), which produces the
                    brown tint of ordinary bindings. If the sides are to be further ornamented, as,
                    for example, by forming “tree-calf,” they are washed over with glaire (white of
                    egg). Each board when dry is separately bent convex, and water is sprinkled on
                    till it runs downwards from the central ridge in a great number of separate
                    branching runlets. As the water is so running, a solution of copperas is
                    sprinkled on and carried along and out by every tricklet, and thus the
                    dark-coloured branched markings are produced. The appearance of “French calf” is
                    produced by dabbing copperas from a sponge on the brown covers. The back is next
                    <hi rend="italic">pieced for title,</hi> by pasting a piece of coloured morocco
                    into the space between the first ana second bands. The points at which lines
                    either blind or in gold are to cross the back are then marked, the whole back is
                    washed with thin paste, and two coatings of glaire are applied to it. When dry
                    the gold leaf is laid on, the lines and ornaments are tooled, and the title
                    lettered with tools and letters which have been heated at a gas stove. The
                    superfluous gold is cleaned off, and after polishing the whole with a hot iron
                    tool the back is finished. The same processes are followed with the sides and
                    the “squares” when any ornamentation is tooled upon them. In the case of
                    finishing of a high class, in morocco, &amp;c., the ornaments are first tooled
                    blind, glaire is pencilled into the lines, and allowed to dry, and gold leaf is
                    then laid on and tooled in. A book is said to be bound <hi rend="italic"
                    >extra</hi> when well forwarded, lined with superior paper, and gilt round the
                    sides and inside the squares.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Casing.—</hi> Previous to the year 1825, new books were
                    generally issued in <hi rend="italic">boards,</hi> that is, in millboards
                    covered with drab paper, upon which the title, printed on a white label, was
                    pasted. Although this was greatly superior to the Continental mode of covering
                    new books with thin paper, something more elegant and durable was needed, and Mr
                    Archibald Leighton of London endeavoured to meet this want by introducing
                    coloured cloth (glazed calico). One of the first books of importance bound in
                    this material was the edition of Lord Byron’s works in seventeen volumes. The
                    covering of books in cloth cases can be done profitably only in a factory where
                    there is much division of labour and many labour-saving machines. In cloth
                    binding the preparation and ornamentation of the cases are throughout distinct
                    from the preparation of the sheets, and it is only in the very last stage that
                    the volume and its case are brought together. The first process in the
                    preparation of the cloth cases is cutting the millboard. This is now effected by
                    a rotary cutring-machine or “ripper,” an invention introduced from America,
                    whence indeed comes most of the machinery used in this species of binding. The
                    machine consists essentially of a pair of strong spindles placed above each
                    other, on which are mounted circular scissor-edged discs, which cut in pairs
                    like the blades of a pair of scissors. The cutting discs can be arranged on the
                    spindles to cut any desired size of board, and the gauge-frame on the feeding
                    table pushes the pieces of millboard into the machine by a motion communicated
                    by a cam-wheel. Such a machine will cut 50,000 pairs of boards in the w orking
                    hours of a week. When the boards arc to be bevelled this is done in a kind of
                    planing-machine. The cloth for the covers being cut to the required size and
                    covered with glue, a pair of boards are laid on with the help of a brass gauge,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n53/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0053-0044"/> which keeps them parallel, and regulates the
                    width of the space to be left for the back. A strip of paper is pasted into the
                    back, the edges of the cloth are laid in, and the boards are passed between a
                    pair of india-rubber rollers, by the pressure of which any air-spaces between
                    the cloth and the millboards are squeezed out. They are then hung up to dry
                    previous to receiving title and ornamentation. The ornamentation on book cases
                    consists of embossing or blind tooling, black or colour printing, and gilding;
                    and the machines in which the work is done are the same in principle. They are
                    powerful presses, worked either by long lever handles or by power with heavy
                    fly-wheels. Blind patterns, or gilded work and titling, are done at one
                    operation, the dies containing the pattem being heated either with steam or gas.
                    In the case of ornaments to be printed in ink, the pattern is first blocked in
                    the blind with a heated die, and subsequently ink-printed in the same press with
                    the die cold. .</p>
                <p>The gathering, collating, and stitching of the sheets diner in no way from the
                    same processes already described for leather work. Machinery has been adapted
                    for folding, but, for the working of folding-machines, guide points require to
                    be printed on the sheets, as books must be folded by the type and not by the
                    edge of the sheet. A machine of American origin, besides folding 8vo sheets,
                    will cut, fold, and insert the half sheet of a 12mo. This machine, attended, by
                    a single girl, is sufficient to fold from 1200 to 1500 sheets in an hour. The
                    folded sheets are sometimes condensed in another American machine called “The
                    Smasher,” which is similar in its action to the embossing press. After
                    stitching, books which are to be cased up with uncut edges have their face and
                    tail cut square by means of a trimming-machine. The principle of this machine
                    consists in a revolving circular knife driven with a treadle or handle; a table
                    (containing the gauge, press bar, and rest), upon which the books are placed,
                    glides across the axis of the knife, and the parts requiring cutting off, coming
                    in contact with the revolving knife, are cut away. When the edges are to be gilt
                    they are cut in some of the numerous forms of guillotine cutting-machines. The
                    commonest form of guillotine is a heavy knife fixed in a strong framework, and
                    having a diagonal motion in its descent by which it cuts with a kind of shearing
                    action. In another machine the knife acts with a punching motion, and cuts the
                    three edges in one descent; and there is in Use a most ingenious American
                    machine, with a revolving table, in which each edge of the book is in succession
                    drawn in a slanting direction up against a fixed cutter. The edges are gilt as
                    in ordinary binding, but instead of each volume being operated on singly, a
                    number are placed evenly in a lying press and gilt simultaneously.</p>
                <p>After trimming or gilding, as the case may be, the backs are glued up, and when
                    dιy they are rounded, generally with the hammer. Several machines have been
                    devised to perform this operation, and one patented in 1865 by Messrs Cope and
                    Bradbrook has come into extensive use. In this machine the book is clamped up
                    between a pair of horizontal cheeks on a table which moves backwards and
                    forwards under a heavy roller adjusted in a frame over the table. The pressure
                    of the roller against the back gives the required “round,” which can be varied
                    by raising or lowering the pitch of the roller. From the rounding process the
                    volume goes to the backing-machine? by which the joint or groove along the back
                    in which the boards lie is formed. The backing-machine is worked by the hand,
                    and its action is somewhat similar to that of the rounding-machine. The book is
                    seized between a pair of jaws, which only leave about a quarter of an inch
                    projecting above them. The workman brings down a roller on this projecting part
                    of the volume, and its pressure forces the free portion of end sheets over the
                    sides of the jaws, thus forming the joint to receive the boards. With the
                    backing the part of the work done by machinery ends. The backs are next coated
                    with glue, pieces of calico for pasting down are laid on, and the entire back is
                    covered with paper. When dry, the volume is fitted into its cases and “pasted
                    up,” and the operations are finished by piling the cased books in a hydraulic
                    press between boards, so as to leave only the backs projecting.</p>
                <p>A k* <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> d °f binding in which the process of sewing
                    is dispensed with, and the backs coated with a rapidly-drying solution of
                    indiarubber, was patented by Mr William Hancock in 1836, and is still used to
                    some extent. The sheets in this binding must either be cut into single leaves or
                    folded as folios, as they all require to be agglutinated by repeated coatings of
                    the india-rubber solution. The india-rubber backing is convenient for volumes of
                    plates, music books, and any volumes made up of large separate sheets.</p>
                <p>Although cloth casing is found sufficient for the greater proportion of the
                    literature which now circulates so extensively, books of reference and works in
                    public libraries require the more secure and workmanlike binding accomplished by
                    hand. At the same time, while ornaments stamped from dies may be very pretty and
                    effective, they have no claim to rank as works of art, and for the collections
                    of bibliophiles the hand-tooling of bibliopegic artists is m as great demand and
                    as handsomely remunerated as was the art of the most accomplished binders of the
                    16th century. (J. PA )</p>
