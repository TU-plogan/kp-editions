                <p><label type="entry">BRICK</label>, a kind of artificial stone made of baked clay.
                    The usual form of a brick is a parallelopipedon, about 9 inches long, 4⅜
                    inches.broad, and 3 inches thick. The art of brick making dates from very early
                    times. We read that burnt brick was used in budding the tower of Babel. The
                    walls and various other buildings of ancient Babylon were made of burnt brick;
                    several varieties of brick figure in Assyrian art, and most of the Assyrian
                    literature was in the form of minute characters in baked clay (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Babylon, Babylonia).</hi> Brickmaking formed tfie chief
                    occupation of the Israelites during their degrading bondage in Egypt. The bricks
                    were made of clay mixed with chopped straw, and were probably sun dried. We
                    „read (2 Sam. xii. 31) that David made the children of Ammon pass through the
                    brick kiln; and while the meaning of the statement is doubtful, it is thought
                    that the instruments mentioned in the context may have been used in preparation
                    of the clay. Pliny informs us of three different kinds of bricks made by the
                    Greeks. In Italy we have abundant evidence that the Romans used bricks largely;
                    and it was they, probably, who introduced brickmaking into England. By the time
                    of Henry VIII. the art had reached great perfection; and many fine brick
                    buildings <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the older part of Hampton Court) are
                    extant from that period. Previous to the great fire of 1666, many of the London
                    houses consisted chiefly of timber framework, filled in with lath and plaster;
                    but after the fire, brick was used almost exclusively in building. Much of the
                    brickwork remaining from that time is finely <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n323/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0323-0280"/> carved with the chisel. From the latter part of
                    last century (1784) till 1850, bricks in this country were subject to taxation.
                    In Holland, where stone is scarce, bricks have been in use from a very early
                    period, both for domestic and public buildings.</p>
                <p>The quality of bricks depends primarily on the choice of an earth There are three
                    principal classes of brickearths:—(1.) Pure clays, consisting chiefly of alumina
                    and silica, in various proportions, and with a small percentage of other salts,
                    iron, lime, magnesia, &lt;fcc.; (2.) Loams or sandy clays; (3.) Marls, or earths
                    with a considerable proportion of lime. A paste of pure clay alone (made with
                    water), while it may be easily moulded, will shrink and crack in drying and
                    firing, in proportion to the excess of alumina over silica; but this can be
                    remedied by mixture with a milder earth or with sand. Loams, again, are often so
                    loose that they require the addition of lime as a flux. The London brickmakers
                    add lime and ashes, or <hi rend="italic">breeze,</hi> to their loams and marls,
                    both as a flux and to prevent shrinking; such admixtures also, as will be seen,
                    affect colour. Brick-earths are very various in composition. The proportion of
                    ingredients in a good earth will be something like the following :—silica,
                    three-fifths; alumina, one-fifth; iron, lime, magnesia, manganese, soda, and
                    potash forming the other one-fifth. The clays of which fire-bricks for furnaces
                    are made are almost entirely free from lime, magnesia, and like substances,
                    which act as fluxes; they are found throughout the coal measures, immediately
                    beneath the coal. The best, that of Stourbridge, will bear the most intense heat
                    that can be produced, without fusion. The Welsh fire-bricks, and those of
                    Windsor, Newcastle, and Glasgow, are other well-known varieties. The Dinas
                    fire-brick consists almost entirely of silica; to this is added about one per
                    cent, of lime, and the mixture, after moulding, is intensely heated. In Austria,
                    a very refractory siliceous brick is manufactured by Μ. Khern, the chief
                    ingredient being quartz of the highest possible degree of purity.</p>
                <p>The colour of bricks is determined by the proportion of hydrated oxide of iron
                    and other ingredients they contain, also by the degree of heat in burning. Where
                    iron is present without lime or such substances, a moderate red heat makes the
                    bricks red, the intensity varying with the proportion of iron; with more intense
                    heat, the bricks, if slightly fusible, may be vitrified externally, and become
                    greenish blue <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> the blue bricks of Staffordshire).
                    The presence of lime changes the red colour produced by iron to a cream brown;
                    magnesia also arrests the development of red. Clays burning a pale red will burn
                    yellow if mixed with a fusible white sand, such as is often found on heaths.
                    Some clays, as those of Devonshire and Dorsetshire, burn of a clear white. The
                    London malms give a rich brimstone yellow. The art of ornamental polychrome
                    brick work has of late years been much developed, especially by the German
                    architects. The principal varieties of common bricks made in England are <hi
                    rend="italic">place bricks, grey and red stocks, marl facing bricks,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">cutting bricks.</hi> The first two are used in ordinary
                    walling. The marl facing bricks, made in the neighbourhood of London, are
                    superior to the stocks, and used in the outsides of buildings. Cutting bricks,
                    which are the finest kind of marl and red bricks, are used in arches over
                    windows and doors.</p>
                <p>The process of brickmaking varies considerably in different localities. In the
                    following account we shall, in the first instance, confine our attention to
                    methods adopted in the vicinity of London, and thereafter note some of the
                    peculiarities of other systems. The most common mode of preparing the clay, in
                    the London district, is that of <hi rend="italic">maiming.</hi> Among the
                    varieties of brick-earth found there <hi rend="italic">malm</hi> is a substance
                    that can be used for bricks without any addition. But it is now rare, and an
                    artificial malm is made by mixing chalk and clay, previously reduced to pulp,
                    and allowing the mixture to consolidate by evaporation. Bricks of the best
                    quality are made with this alone; but for the commoner sorts some of the malm is
                    added to the clay or loam, sufficient to make it fit for brickmaking.</p>
                <p>The earth is dug up in autumn, and placed on a level floor, banked round in order
                    to retain the malm in the process of maiming. Exposed during the winter, it is
                    more or less broken up and pulverized by the frost, &amp;c. The machinery for
                    maiming consists of two washing-mills, viz., the chalk and clay mills, which are
                    placed together, not far from the brick-earth. The chalk-mill is a circular
                    trough in which chalk is ground in water, by two heavy wheels with spiked tires,
                    drawn round by horses. The pulp thus made passes by a shoot into the clay-mill,
                    another and a larger circular trough, where it gets mixed with clay that is
                    being cut and stirred in water by knives and harrows, also put in motion by
                    horses. The creamy liquid malm passes through a grating into shoots which convey
                    it to the brick-earth, over which it is distributed as equally as possible. It
                    is now left to settle for a month or more, the water being drained off at
                    intervals, till the mass is firm enough to bear a man walking over it. A thin
                    layer of ashes, about 3 inches for every spit of earth, is spread over the
                    surface (this process being technically called <hi rend="italic">soiling),</hi>
                    and the whole is now ready for the moulding season, which commences generally in
                    April.</p>
                <p>The mass of earth, malm, and ashes is first <hi rend="italic">tempered,</hi> or
                    thoroughly turned over and mixed with the spade, while water is added to give it
                    the proper consistence. The tempered clay is then conveyed to the <hi
                    rend="italic">pug-mill,—</hi> a conical tub, in which revolves (driven by
                    horses) a vertical shaft with horizontal knives so inclined that the clay is
                    slowly forced down to the narrow end by their motion. Several of these
                    knife-arms are furnished with cross knives, which assist in the cutting and
                    kneading process. The clay comes out laterally at the bottom as a uniform mass,
                    and is ready for moulding.</p>
                <p>The moulder stands at a table or stool, on which are placed some of the tempered
                    clay in front of him, a little dry sand to the right and left, a small tub of
                    water with the <hi rend="italic">strike</hi> in it, a brick-mould, and a
                    stock-board. Backwards from the stool extends the <hi rend="italic">page,</hi> a
                    pair of iron rails, on w ood, on which the raw bricks are pushed away by the
                    moulder. The <hi rend="italic">brick-mould</hi> is a rectangular case of
                    sheet-iron, without top or bottom, having the two longer sides strengthened with
                    wood. The <hi rend="italic">stock-board,</hi> supported on four pins in the
                    moulder’s stool, fits easily into the mould; it has often a solid elevation in
                    the middle, for producing a hollow in the brick. The moulder receives from the
                    clotmoulder (usually a woman), standing on his right, a piece of clay somewhat
                    larger than a brick. Having sprinkled sand on the stock-board, and dashed the
                    mould, after moistening it, in the left sand heap, he places the mould on the
                    stock-board, and dashes the clay into it with force, then pressing it with his
                    fingers so as to fill the angles. With the <hi rend="italic">strike</hi> (a
                    short, smooth piece of wood) he strikes off the surplus clay; then he turns the
                    brick out of the mould on a thin board or <hi rend="italic">pallet,</hi> rather
                    larger than the brick, and slides it along the page to the taking-off boy, who
                    stands ready to put the bricks on a barrow of special construction; on this,
                    after sprinkling with sand, they are conveyed to the hack ground. The bricks are
                    each carefully removed from the barrow between two pallets, and built up in <hi
                    rend="italic">hacks,</hi> about eight bricks high, and two in width (placed
                    edgewise, and in an angular direction,—the hacks being about 11 feet apart, from
                    centre to centre. They are covered with straw or reeds at night or in bad
                    weather. When half dry the bricks are separated somewhat <hi rend="italic"
                    >(scintled),</hi> to allow <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0324-0281"/> free access of the air. The time taken in drying
                    varies from three to six weeks.</p>
                <p>In the vicinity of London bricks are commonly burnt in <hi rend="italic"
                    >clamps;</hi> the peculiarity of which process is that, as each brick contains
                    in itself the fuel necessary for its vitrification, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >breeze</hi> merely serves to ignite the lower tiers, and the heat gradually
                    spreads over the whole. The general structure of a clamp is as follows :—A
                    number of walls, or <hi rend="italic">necks,</hi> three bricks thick, about
                    sixty long, and twenty-four to thirty high, are built slantingly against a
                    central upright wall, which narrows upwards. The sides and top are cased with
                    burnt bricks. Cinders (or <hi rend="italic">breeze)</hi> are distributed in
                    layers between the courses of brick, the thickest strata being at the bottom. A
                    single clamp will contain from 200,000 to 500,000 bricks. For firing the clamps,
                    <hi rend="italic">live holes</hi> or flues (9 inches by 7) are left in the
                    centre of the upright, and at every seventh neck or so, extending throughout the
                    thickness of the clamp. These are filled with faggots, and fired by a coal fire
                    at the end of each vent; and the fire ignites the adjacent breeze. Once the
                    clamp is fairly lighted, the mouths of the live holes are stopped with bricks
                    and plastered over with clay, and the clamp burns till all the breeze is
                    consumed, usually from three to six weeks. After cooling, the bricks are
                    removed, sorted, perhaps, and stacked. (For a fuller account of the most
                    approved methods of building clamps, the reader is referred to Mr Dobson’s
                    excellent little treatise on brickmaking, to which we are indebted for many of
                    the details given in this paper.)</p>
                <p>In the Nottingham district a very hard marl is often used in brickmaking; and as
                    ordinary weathering and tempering would not make it sufficiently plastic, it is
                    subjected to grinding between rollers, the hard lumps and pieces of limestone
                    being thus crushed to powder, all pebbles and hard stones having been previously
                    picked out by the hand. The wash-mill is only used in making arch-bricks, and
                    the pug-mill is dispensed with, the tempering of the clay, after grinding, being
                    done by treading and spade labour. Sometimes the clay is kept in damp cellars
                    for a year or more to ripen. Brass moulds (technically called copper moulds) are
                    used, and the moulder, after filling the mould, works over the clay, first on
                    one side then on the other, with a flat implement called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >plane.</hi> A boy takes the mould with its contents to the floor, where he
                    turns out the brick, and then puts back the mould on the stool, the moulder
                    meanwhile filling another mould. The bricks are sprinkled with sand on the
                    floors, and turned twice at a few hours’ interval, and are then taken by boys to
                    the <hi rend="italic">hovel</hi> or drying-shed, when they are built in hacks.
                    They are burnt in kilns, which are made with four upright walls and a sunken
                    floor. On the two sides of the kiln there are shallow pits with lean-to roofs to
                    protect the fuel and fireman. The doorways are narrow openings at the ends, a
                    step above the ground, and the fire-holes are arched openings opposite each
                    other in the side of the kiln, lined with fire-bricks. Narrow openings or flues
                    are left between the bricks, connecting the opposite fire-holes. Each brick has
                    some free space round it for passage of heat. The fuel employed is coal.</p>
                <p>In the Staffordshire Potteries it is a common practice to pass the marl through
                    several pairs of rollers, and then mix some three or four marls together, with
                    water, by spade labour. For ordinary bricks the ground marl is mixed with marl
                    that has been tempered but not ground. The pug-mill is employed for tiles and
                    dust bricks,—the latter so called from coal dust being used when they are
                    moulded. The bricks are moulded by the <hi rend="italic">slop-moulding</hi>
                    process, the mould being dipped in water only before using; the brick is emptied
                    from the mould on the floor. (The other process is distinguished as that of <hi
                    rend="italic">sand-stock moulding.)</hi> The oven used in burning is of circular
                    form, with spherical top, and will contain about 8000 bricks. Red, blue, and
                    drab bricks are produced in the district, besides the dust brick just referred
                    to, which is used for the paving of footways..</p>
                <p>In Holland, the chief material used for bricks is the slime deposited in rivers
                    and arms of the sea. It is collected in boats by men with long poles, having a
                    cutting circle of iron at the end, and a bag net with which they lug up the
                    slime. Hard bricks are made of a mixture of this slime with sand from the banks
                    of the River Maas. The ingredients are well kneaded together, and the mixture is
                    deposited in heaps. The mode of moulding and drying is similar to that used
                    elsewhere. The kilns are square and will sometimes hold as many as 1,200,000
                    bricks. Peat turf is used in firing.</p>
                <p>For an account of brickmaking in India the reader is referred to a paper by Major
                    Falconnet, R.E., in the <hi rend="italic">Professional Papers on Indian
                    Engineering,</hi> May 1874.</p>
                <p>Thus far only brickmaking by haud has been spoken of, but of recent years there
                    has been no little activity in the invention of brickmaking machines, with a
                    view to economy, certainty, and rapidity of production, and improvement in the
                    quality and appearance of the bricks. It is only in brickmaking on a
                    considerable scale, of course, that moulding by machinery can present much
                    advantage over hand moulding, since the cost of moulding bears so small a
                    proportion to the total cost. The various machines that have been offered to the
                    public may be arranged in two classes,—those which operate on the clay (with
                    moderate pressure) in a moist and plastic state, and those in which the material
                    used is pulverized and dry, or nearly so. A denser brick, and one less liable to
                    shrinking, is produced in the latter case; but much care is needed in
                    preparation of the clay, and a much stronger compression is required, to ensure
                    the proper tenacity. The different arrangements of rollers and pug-mills <hi
                    rend="italic">lox preparation</hi> of the clay, whether plastic or dry, we need
                    not here describe at any length. Rollers and pug-mill are sometimes combined,
                    forming a composite machine. Two or more pairs of rollers are sometimes arranged
                    one set under another, the closest at the bottom; and opposing rollers are
                    driven at different speeds so as to produce a rub as well as a squeeze, thus
                    promoting disintegration. As to that class of bric kmaking machines proper in
                    which plastic clay is used, we find, in some examples, a continuous length of
                    clay forced out from a vertical or horizontal pug-mill through a suitable
                    mouthpiece, and the column divided into bricks by wires or otherwise. Of
                    mouthpieces, some are simple dies, or dies fitted with cores to make hollow
                    bricks; in others the mould is lubricated by a constant stream of water; in
                    others, again, the mouthpiece is made with two or four rollers covered with
                    thick cloth, which are perforated with small holes, and filled with oil to
                    lubricate the faces of the bricks. In cutting, a frame of parallel wires may be
                    moved across, either while the clay is at rest, or while it is in motion, by the
                    wires being moved obliquely at an angle to compensate for the speed at which the
                    clay travels. Or the clay may be cut by radial wires of a wheel, or again by
                    metallic discs. Another variety of treatment of plastic clay is that in which
                    the clay is pressed from the pug-mill into moulds of the form of brick required.
                    In one such machine, a mould-block, with two moulds, moves backwards and
                    forwards under the pug-mill, one mould receiving a charge while the other is
                    having the brick pressed out of it by a piston. In another, the moulds are
                    arranged radially round the border of a circular table, which revolves under the
                    pug-mill. There are piston rods in the mould which ascend an inclined spiral
                    plane, and thus gradually lift the bricks out of the moulds, whence they are
                    taken by a boy and placed on an endless band, which conveys them <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0325-0282"/> away. In another machine, also with revolving
                    table, two moulds receive the charge of clay at once. While these are being
                    filled the two that had just been filled are being subjected to considerable
                    pressure, and the two bricks that had been pressed immediately before are in
                    process of delivery out of the moulds, and on to a flat belt which takes them
                    away. (This machine is also suitable for dry clay.) In yet another, a cylinder
                    revolving under the means of the wire frame D. The bricks are then removed to
                    the barrow E. These machines are often constructed for double delivery.</p>
                <p>As an example of the second class of machines,—those for working dry, or
                    half-dry, and non-plastic material,—we may take another machine constructed by
                    Messrs Clayton. It affords a good practical solution of the problem of making
                    bricks from coal shale, bind, fire-clay, or the like. The arrangement is shown
                    in figs. 3 and 4. In fig. 3, A</p>
                <p>is a pan roller mill, in which a pan containing the raw material is driven round
                    under rollers; there are perforations in the bottom, through which the ground
                    clay escapes, and is swept by arms into a general receiver, whence a band with
                    buckets conveys it to the hopper of the moulding and pressing machines C, of
                    which fig. 4 gives another view. Here the moulds are contained in a box at B,
                    bolted between the standards. There are two sets of pistons, one above and the
                    other below the brick-moulds, and they simultaneously press the top and the
                    bottom of the pug-mill presents to it successively four brick-moulds, each of
                    which, on reaching the lowest point, is made to deposit its brick on an endless
                    band. The annexed drawing represents one of Messrs H. Clayton, Son, &amp;
                    Howlett’s single delivery machines for brickmaking with plastic clay. After what
                    has been said little description will be necessary. A is the pair of rollers, B
                    the pug-mill, C the stream of issuing clay, which a little further on is cut
                    across by brick in the mould. The lower pistons are attached to a cross bar
                    which slides in vertical guides in the standards, and has friction rollers C on
                    the lower extremities, in contact with which work two pressing cams D on the
                    main shaft. The upper pistons E are attached as shown to a cross-head above,
                    which is moved up and down in its guides bv connecting rods and two cranks on
                    the main shaft. These pistons are hollow, and are heated by steam to prevent the
                    brick-earth adhering to them. The prepared material is supplied to the two
                    moulds by a feed-box which slides to and fro under the feeding hopper of the
                    machine, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n326/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0326-0283"/> and thus passes alternately under it and over the
                    moulds, conveying sufficient each time to fill the latter. The bricks are
                    delivered from the moulds by the lower pistons, which are forced upwards by the
                    complete revolution of the cams, and the newly-made bricks are forthwith moved
                    forward by the approach of the feed-box with a fresh charge of the material. In
                    another dry-clay machine constructed by Messrs Bradley and Craven of Wakefield,
                    two or three distinct pressures can be given to a brick, and by this means the
                    air is gradually forced out from the interstices, and the brick consolidated to
                    a greater extent than can be effected by a single pressure.</p>
                <p>The varieties of brickmaking machinery are too numerous to be separately noticed,
                    however briefly, but the foregoing may suffice to illustrate the general
                    principles involved in their construction. With suitable modifications,
                    perforated or hollow bricks are frequently produced, on which there is a saving
                    in cost of carriage, and also in mortar and labour.</p>
                <p>Among the objects at the International Exhibition of 1874 there were several
                    varieties of brick prepared without burning, according to a process devised by
                    Messrs Bodmer. They are made by intimately mixing certain materials of the
                    nature of cements or mortars, and squeezing the mixture into the desired shape
                    by hydraulic pressure in a specially-constructed machine. Sand and selenitic
                    lime are the constituents of one kind of brick; these substances, together with
                    Portland cement, of another; and a very serviceable kind of brick is prepared
                    from blast-furnace slag, which, consisting chiefly of silicates decomposable by
                    lime, is just as suitable for the purpose as the volcanic products, trass and
                    pozzuolano, which have long been employed. The bricks give good results on
                    application of the usual tests.</p>
                <p>The old invention of <hi rend="italic">floating bricks</hi> (known to Pliny) was
                    completely lost till Μ. Fabroni discovered they could be made from the earth
                    known as fossil meal, which is abundant in Tuscany, and is found near Castel del
                    Piano in the territories of Siena.</p>
                <p>For the drying and burning of bricks, the construction of kilns according to
                    Hoffmann’s method is a remarkable improvement of late years. These kilns are
                    formed by a series of arched chambers connected by passages to one main chimney
                    flue, each passage or flue having suitable dampers to regulate the heat at any
                    desired point. Small coal, slack, or peat fuel may be used, which is fed in from
                    the top of the kilns through small openings. The waste gases from the burning
                    and cooling chambers are made to pass successively into other chambers and give
                    out their heat before escaping to the chimney, thus completing the drying, and
                    effecting a partial burning, of newly-made bricks before the actual firing of
                    the chambers in which these latter are newly set. Such kilns are no doubt beyond
                    the means of most brickmakers, but it is perhaps a question for consideration
                    whether bricks must necessarily be burnt in immediate proximity to the spot
                    where the clay is obtained.</p>
                <p>In an instructive report on the manufacture of bricks, drawn up a few years ago
                    by a committee of the Manchester Society of Architects, the following points
                    were specified as requiring attention, in order to improve the character of the
                    common brick :—(a) Greater care in cleaning the clay and in thoroughly tempering
                    it; (ά) variation in the size of moulds, so as to produce uniform sized bricks
                    from various clays; (c) moulding the brick with material of such consistency
                    that it may not become misshapen by the effects of its own gravity; <hi
                    rend="italic">(d)</hi> greater regularity of surface of the drying-ground; (e)
                    protection from extreme variations of temperature and rain in drying; (∕) less
                    frequent and more careful handling in the process of drying, so as to preserve
                    the edges; <hi rend="italic">(g)</hi> a means of burning whereby the amount of
                    firing shall be under control. In experiments on the absorption and retention of
                    moisture, it was found that the bricks which parted most readily with their
                    moisture at first were the longest in drying, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi></p>
                <p>Tiles, being a thinner ware than bricks, have to be made of purer and stronger
                    clay, and require more care in treatment, but the process of manufacture is not
                    essentially different. The numerous varieties of tiles may be roughly arranged
                    in three classes, viz., <hi rend="italic">paving tiles, roofing tiles</hi>
                    (including the flat plain tiles, the curved pantiles, hip, ridge, and valley
                    tiles), and <hi rend="italic">drain tiles.</hi> In weathering, the clay is
                    spread in layers of about 2 inches thickness during winter, and each layer is
                    allowed the benefit of at least one night’s frost before the succeeding layer is
                    put upon it. Sometimes the weathering is effected by sunshine. The comminuted
                    clay is next placed in pits and allowed to mellow or ripen under water. Then it
                    is passed through the pug-mill, and the tempered product, if necessary, <hi
                    rend="italic">slung</hi> (that is, cut in thin slices with a piece of wire fixed
                    to two handles, in order to detect any stones), and then passed through the
                    pug-mill again, after which it is generally ready for moulding. To take the case
                    of <hi rend="italic">pantiles</hi> (hand-moulded), the moulder turns the tile
                    out of the flat mould on to the <hi rend="italic">washing-off frame,</hi> on the
                    curved surface of which, with very wet hands, he washes it into a curved shape.
                    Then he strikes it with a semi-cylindrical implement called the <hi
                    rend="italic">splayer,</hi> and conveys it on this to the flat block where he
                    deposits it, with the convex side uppermost, and, removing the splayer, leaves
                    the tile to dry. The tile is afterwards beaten on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >thwacking-frame,</hi> to correct any warping that may have occurred, and
                    trimmed with the <hi rend="italic">thwacking-knife.</hi> In the kiln, which is
                    constructed with arched furnaces at the base of a conical erection called the
                    dome, the tiles are closely stacked in upright position, on a bottom of
                    vitrified bricks. The fuel used is coal, and the burning continues usually about
                    six days. In making <hi rend="italic">pipe drain tiles,</hi> the clay is first
                    moulded to the proper length, width, and thickness, then wrapped round a drum;
                    the edges are closed together, and the tile is carefully shaped by the
                    operator’s hand, sometimes assisted by a wooden tool. Tiles as well as bricks
                    can be made by machinery; with suitable dies, almost any form of tile may be
                    thus had, which is producible by the advance of a given section of clay parallel
                    to itself. In other machines pressure is exerted on the clay in a mould.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of <hi rend="italic">tesserce</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >encaustic tiles</hi> has been brought to great perfection in recent times,
                    through the enterprise especially of Mr Minton. It is a revival and extension of
                    a very old art, which originated, probably, with the Greeks. The tesselated
                    pavements of the Romans, of which many specimens are still extant, were formed
                    of small pieces of stone or marble of various colours, bedded one by one in a
                    layer of cement. The principle on which tesserae are now made, is that dry and
                    finely-powdered clay, compressed between steel dies, is changed into a very
                    compact and hard solid body, a fact first observed by Mr Prosser in 1840. The
                    solid pieces, which are thus produced in a screw-press, are enclosed in
                    earthenware cases or pans, call <hi rend="italic">saggers,</hi> and fired in a
                    potter’s kiln, after which they are ιeady for use, unless they are required to
                    be glazed, in which case they are dipped in a glazing composition and again
                    fired. The mode of setting the pieces differs essentially from the Roman method.
                    In manufacture of the tiles called <hi rend="italic">encaustic,</hi> in which
                    various designs are produced by addition of clays of different colour from that
                    of the ground, the clays first undergo sundry washings and purifications. A
                    portion of the kind which is to form the ground first receives an impression, in
                    the plastic state, from a plaster in relief. The bulk of the tile is made up <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n327/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0327-0284"/> with coarser clay added in a frame, and this is
                    solidified in a screw-press. Then comes the filling in of the design, which the
                    maker does by spreading the coloured clay in a creamy or slip state on the
                    indented surface. After a few days’ evaporation, the surface is scraped or
                    planed, and the tile passes successively to the drying house and the oven. The
                    colours desired in encaustic tiles are sometimes those given by the clay in
                    ordinary treatment, sometimes they are obtained by staining with manganese,
                    cobalt, &amp;c. The products of this branch of manufacture are much admired.</p>
                <p>The fine ornamental bricks of various shape and colour known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >terra cotta</hi> have of late been much used, especially in the facing of
                    public buildings, and with the happiest effects. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. b.
