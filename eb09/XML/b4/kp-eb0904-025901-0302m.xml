                    of the town on the left bank being regarded as Brest proper, while the part on

                    shipwrecked sailors used to address their prayers for the recovery of their
                    property. The hill-sides are in some places so steep that the ascent from the
                    lower to the upper town has to be effected by flights of stairs; and the second
                    or third story of one house is often on a level with the ground story of the
                    next. The town proper has three long parallel streets, of which the chief bears
                    the name of Rue de Siam, in honour of the Siamese embassy sent to Louis XIV.,
                    and terminates at the remarkable swingbridge, or <hi rend="italic">Pont
                    Impérial,</hi> constructed in 1861, which crosses the mouth of the Penfeld.
                    Running along the shore to the south of the town is the Cours d’Ajot, one of the
                    finest promenades of its kind in France, named after the engineer who
                    constructed it. It is planted with trees and <pb break="no"

                    “Gouvernement Consulaire, Le XIIII <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>. Germinal, An
                    IX.” Brest possesses comparatively few buildings of importance, with the
                    exception of those connected with the great naval establishment. The church of
                    the priory of the Seven Saints, the church of St Louis, the old castle with its
                    seven massive towers (dating in part from the 13th century), the exchange, the
                    town-house, the civil hospital, and the theatre are the chief. The great convict
                    establishment, which formerly held some 3000 prisoners, was vacated in 1860, and
                    is now used as a store-house. The Government dockyard is very extensive, and
                    contains a sail-loft, a slopshop, a ropery, a foundry and steam-factory,
                    seamen’s barracks (known as <hi rend="italic">La Cayenne),</hi> and three
                    dry-docks partly excavated in the hill-side. The Hôpital de la Marine, built
                    between 1824 and 1835, contains 26 wards, each with 53 beds, and is under the
                    management of a large band of sisters of mercy. Among the minor establishments
                    are a lyceum, a school of navigation, a medico-chirurgical school, an
                    observatory, a botanical garden, a public library of 25,000 volumes, and two
                    others of 18,000 and 10,000. The manufactures are few, and the trade is of small
                    extent considering the excellence of the ports. The former are chiefly leather,
                    wax-cloth, paper, and rope; and the latter deals mainly in grain, beer, brandy,
                    and fish. Napoleon III. did much for the development of the commerce of Brest,
                    though his extensive plans for a new port, on which £600,000 were expended
                    during his reign, have been only partially carried out. It lies at the foot of
                    the Cours d’Ajot, and has thus much greater scope for any necessary development
                    than the old port, which was formed by the mouth of the Penfeld. The roadstead
                    of Brest, which is in some places three miles broad, and has an area of 15
                    square leagues, is formed by the promontory of Finistère on the N. and that of
                    Kélernn on the S. It breaks up into numerous smaller bays or arms, formed by the
                    embouchures of streams, the most important being the Anse de Kélernn, the Anse
                    de Poulmie, and the months of the Châteaulin, the Dolas, the Lauberlach, and the
                    Landerneau. It is defended on every side by batteries and forts, the first
                    system of which was erected in 1680 under the personal superintendence of
                    Vauban. The only entrance, the Goulet, is about a mile wide; but the Mingant or
                    Mingam rock in the middle compels vessels to pass under the batteries of either
                    the one side or the other. In 1851 the population of the town was 36,500; in
                    1871 it was 66,272.</p>
                <p>Nothing definite is known of Brest till about 1040, when it was ceded by the
                    Count of Léon to the first duke of Brittany. In 1372 duke John IV. gave it up to
                    the English on condition that they should restore it when peace was proclaimed.
                    So important did he consider the place that he declared, “He is not duke of
                    Brittany who is not lord of Brest.” On the death of Edward III. the castle was
                    made over to the dukes; but when war was once more declared between France and
                    England, an English garrison took possession again, and repelled every effort to
                    dislodge it; nor was the place surrendered till 1397, and then only in
                    consideration of a heavy ransom. In the next century it was again captured by
                    the English, and retaken by the French; and by the marriage of Louis XII. with
                    Anne of Brittany, it passed to the French crown. The advantages of the situation
                    for a seaport town were first recognized by Richelieu, who, in 1631, constructed
                    a harbour with wooden wharves, which soon became a station of the French navy.
                    Colbert changed the wooden wharves for masonry, and otherwise improved the port,
                    and Vauban’s fortifications followed in 1680-88. In 1694 an English squadron,
                    under Berkeley, was miserably defeated in attempting a landing; but in 1794,
                    during the revolutionary war, the French fleet, under Villaret de Joyeuse, was
                    as thoroughly beaten in the same place by the English admiral Howe.</p>
