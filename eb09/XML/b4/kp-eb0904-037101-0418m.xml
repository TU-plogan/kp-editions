                <p><label type="entry">BROOKS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles Shirley</hi></label>, an
                    English novelist, and dramatic and miscellaneous writer, was born in 1815. He
                    was the son of an eminent London architect, and received his education at a
                    public school in the city. Applying himself to the study of law, he passed the
                    usual examination for admission; but instead of pursuing further the
                    professional path, he turned aside and began to feeFhis way towards the broader
                    field of literature. He wrote, sometimes alone, sometimes in conjunction with
                    others, slight dramatic pieces of the burlesque kind, and became a newspaper
                    reporter. In this capacity he was for many years engaged on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Morning Chronicle.</hi> For the same paper he afterwards undertook
                    to write the parliamentary summary, and was appointed special commissioner to
                    carry out investigations on the subject of labour and the poor. For this purpose
                    he travelled in Southern Russia, Egypt, and Syria; the results of his inquiries
                    appearing first in the form of letters to the editor, and afterwards in a
                    separate volume, under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Russians of the
                    South</hi> (1856). Brooks was for many years on the staff of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Illustrated London News,</hi> contributing the weekly article on
                    the politics of the day, and the two series entitled “Nothing in the Papers” and
                    “By the Way,” besides other occasional pieces. In 1854 he joined the staff of
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n419/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0419-0372"/><hi rend="italic">Punch,</hi> aud noteworthy among
                    his numerous contributions were the weekly satirical summaries of the
                    parliamentary debates, entitled “The Essence of Parliament.” His long service as
                    newspaper reporter gave him special aptitude for this playful parody. In 1870,
                    on the death of Mark Lemon, “dear old Shirley,” as his friends used to call him,
                    was chosen to succeed to the editorial chair. He added to his reputation by
                    several good novels, the first of which, -dspβ7⅛ <hi rend="italic">Court,</hi>
                    was published in 1855. It was followed by <hi rend="italic">The, Gordian
                    Knot</hi> (1860), <hi rend="italic">The Silver Cord</hi> (1861), and <hi
                    rend="italic">Sooner or Later</hi> (1868). Brooks was a great letterwriter,
                    deliberately cultivating the practice as an art, and imitating the style in
                    vogue before newspapers and telegraphs suppressed private letters. He had an
                    astonishing memory, was brilliant as an epigrammatist, and was a great reader,
                    and a most genial and admirable companion. Though he nearly reached his sixtieth
                    year, he retained all the charm of youthful freshness and brightness. He was in
                    his element with a group of children, reading to them, sharing their fun, and
                    always remembering the birthdays. He died in London, February 23, 1874. His
                    remains were interred, near those of his friends Leech and Thackeray, in Kensal
                    Green cemetery. As a novelist Shirley Brooks holds a high rank, but not the
                    highest. His novels probably suffered in some respects from the manner of their
                    production, the slow piece-meal writing for periodical literature. But they
                    possess qualities of an order which will save them from the swift oblivion that
                    overtakes so many books of their class. He shows in them a large knowledge of
                    men, especially of Londoners, a fair acquaintance with the world of books and
                    the world of art, a fertile imagination, and much critical acumen. And these
                    qualities are set off to the best advantage by the charm of an admirably
                    vigorous and polished style. In this respect, and in the force of his refined
                    satire, he bears some likeness to his greater friend, the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Vanity Fair.</hi></p>
