                    station in India. The other two districts of the division lie upon the plains at
                    the foot of the Himálayas. They are bounded on the N.E. by those mountains, on
                    the N.W. by the river Satlej, on the S.W. by the district of Firozpur, the
                    independent native state of Patiálá, and the district of Karnál, and on the S.E.
                    by the river Jamná.</p>

                    N.W. and S.E. along the lower face of the Himálayas, and lies between 29° 55'
                    and 31° 14' N. lat, and between 76° 37' and 77° 38' E. long. It is bounded on
                    the N.E. by the Himalayas, on the N.W. by the river Satlej, on the S.E. by the
                    river Jamni, and on the S. W. by the district of Ludhiáná, the state of Patiálá,
                    and the district of Karnál. The total area of the district is 2628 square miles,
                    or 1,681,930 acres, of which 945,526 acres are cultivated, 283,989 acres are
                    cultivable, but not actually under tillage, and 452,415 acres are uncultivable
                    and waste. The total population of the district, according to the census of
                    1868, amounts to 1,035,488 souls, divided into the following classes :— Hindus,
                    689,333; Mahometans, 286,874; Sikhs, 56,440; others, 2841. The males numbered
                    567,930, and the females 467,558; the proportion of males to the total
                    population being 54 ∙ 84 per cent The principal tribes and castes in point of
                    numbers are—(1.) Játs, viz., Hindus and Sikhs, 161,967; Mahometans, 13,368:
                    total, 175,335. (2.) Chámárs (Hindus), 125,638. (3.) Rájputs—viz., Hindus and
                    Sikhs, £0,121; Mahometans, 62,866: total, 82,987. (4.) Brahmans, 63,744. (5.)
                    Gujjars—viz., Hindus and</p>
                <p>Sikhs, 24.500; Mahometans, 24,195: total, 48,695. (6.) Baniás (Hindus), 39,093.
                    The total agricultural population was 501,056. Taking the population as compared
                    with the area, the result gives 1 ∙ 62 acres per head of the population, or 3 ∙
                    35 acres per head of the agricultural population. Putting aside the uncultivable
                    and waste land, there are 1 ∙ 18 acres of cultivated or cultivable land per head
                    of the population, or 2 ∙ 45 acres per head of the agricultural population.
                    Taking only the area under actual cultivation, there are ∙ 91 acres per head of
                    population, or 1'88 acres per head of the agricultural population. With one
                    small exception, the whole district consists of a level alluvial plain, sloping
                    away gradually from the foot of the Himálayas, and lying between the rivers
                    Jamná and Satlej. These rivers do not materially affect the district, which has
                    a drainage system of its own, consisting of the numerous torrents and
                    water-courses which pour down upon it from the hills. In the southern portion of
                    the district these torrents run in broad sandy beds scarcely below the surface
                    of the country, and vary from 200 yards to a mile in width, until, at a distance
                    of 20 or 30 miles from the hills, they assume the form of comparatively docile
                    streams, with well-defined clay banks. Towards the northern portion of the
                    district the torrents run in deep beds from the point where they debouch from
                    the hills: they also differ from the streams of the southern tract in being free
                    from sand. The principal of these northern streams is the Ghaggar, into which
                    all the other minor streams sooner or later empty themselves, some within and
                    some beyond the limits of the district Whatever surplus water of this river is
                    not swallowed up by irrigation passes on through Patiala state and Sirsa, and is
                    finally lost in the sandsof Rájputáná. The Ghaggar is the only perennial stream
                    within the district, and even it dwindles down to a tiny rivulet in the dry
                    weather, and disappears altogether beyond the border of the district.</p>
                <p>The Sind, Panjáb, and Dehli railway passes through the centre of the district
                    from south-east to north-west. The other principal land routes are two main
                    lines of road, one passing through the district parallel to the line of railway,
                    and the other coming from Dehli and Karnál, entering it on the south, and
                    running northward till the two roads meet at Ambálá city. A less important road
                    runs northward from this town to the foot of the Himálayas, and forms the route
                    to the hill station of Simlá. The principal agricultural products of Ambálá
                    district are wheat, grain, and barley for the spring harvest, and rice, joár
                    (spiked millet), and Indian corn in the autumn. The total area under cultivation
                    in 1871-72 was, for the spring harvest 437,877 acres, and for the autumn crop
                    496,542 acres. The land settlement of the southern portion of the district was
                    completed in 1853, and that of the northern part in 1855. Both will expire in
                    1880. The following eight towns are returned as containing a population of
                    upwards of 5000 souls, the first-named seven being also municipalities; Ambálá,
                    population, 50,662 souls: Sháhábád, 11,678; Jagádhri, 11,678; Sadhaurá, 11,198;
                    Rúpar, 8700; Búná, 8351; Tháneswar, 7929; Maní Májrá, 5989. A municipal income
                    is also raised from the following seven towns :—Kharar, Síswán, Morindah,
                    Pihewah, Rádaur, Ladwah, and Khizirábád. All the municipalities derive their
                    revenue from a system of octroi duties. The total revenue of Ambálá district for
                    1871 was £101,362, of which 74 per cent., or £74,446, was derived from the land.
                    The other principal items of revenue were as follows:—Distilleries, £3594,14s.;
                    drugs and opium, £3181, 4s.; income-tax, £2709, 14s.; stamps, £9308, 14s.; local
                    rates levied under Act xx. of 1871, £7653, 18s. Ambálá is one of the territories
                    previously held by a Sikh Sandár which lapsed to the East India Company in
                    default of rightful heirs. The district was seized by Ranjit Singh during one of
                    his marauding expeditions. This aggression caused the movement of British troops
                    in 1809 which resulted in the treaty with Ranjit Singh by which he was required
                    to withdraw his army from the left bank of the Satlej, and to relinquish his
                    recent conquests in Sirhind.</p>

                    the district of the same name, is situated in 30° 24' N. lat, and 76° 49' E.
                    long. It forms a large and important station on the Sind, Pan-jáb. and Dehli
                    railway. The military station and cantonments lie a few miles south-east of the
                    town. Ambálá is a large walled town, situated in a level and highly-cultivated
                    country, well supplied with water, and capable of furnishing abundant supplies.
                    The houses are built of burnt brick, and the streets are very narrow. The town
                    population is returned at 50,662 souls, but this probably includes the English
                    station. The population within municipal limits numbers 24,040, divided as
                    follows :—Agriculturists, 3226; non-agriculturists, 20,814. The town has been
                    constituted a second-class municipality, the affairs of which are conducted by a
                    committee consisting of six official and five non-official members. The
                    municipal income is derived from an octroi duty, and the revenue has increased
                    from £836, 16s. in 1867-68, to £1520 in 1871-72. The average incidence of
                    municipal taxation in the latter year was 1s. 3⅛d. per head of the population
                    within municipal limits.</p>
