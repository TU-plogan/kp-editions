                    bounded on the north and east by the Etáwah and Farrakhábád districts and the
                    province of Oudh; on the south by the Benares division and the Rewah state; and
                    on the west by the states of Bandelkhand and the Jhánsí division. Total
                    population (1872), 5,466,116.</p>

                    between 81° 14' and 82° 26' E. long. In shape the district is that of an
                    irregular oblong; and it is difficult accurately to describe its boundaries, as
                    at one extremity it wanders into Oudh, while on the south the villages <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n616/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0616-0579"/> of the state of Rewah and those of this district
                    are hopelessly intermingled. Roughly speaking, however, the boundaries may be
                    described as follows:—On the north by the district of Jaunpur and by the Ganges;
                    on the west by the districts of Fathipur and Bándá; on the south by the
                    independent state of Rewah; and on the east by the districts of Mirzápur and
                    Jaunpur. The settlement of the district is at present undergoing revision; and
                    as the measurements are still incomplete, it is impossible to state the exact
                    area. For practical purposes, it may be estimated at 2802 square miles, or
                    1,793,906 acres, of which 1,065,990 acres are cultivated, and 727,916 acres are
                    uncultivated; of this latter, however, there are about 250,000 acres capable of
                    being brought under tillage, although not actually cultivated. The census of
                    1872 returned the population of the district at 1,394,245 souls, of whom
                    1,211,778 are Hindus, 181,574 Mussulmans, and 893 Christians. There is, however,
                    a manifest error in these figures, as the European and Eurasian population of
                    Allahábád city alone cannot be set at a lower figure than 3500. The census
                    returns are in consequence undergoing revision. Of the Hindu population, 173,916
                    are returned as Bráhmans.</p>
                <p>The Jamná and the Ganges meet at Allahabad city, and enclose within their angle a
                    fertile tract, well irrigated by means of tanks and wells. The East Indian
                    Railway and the Grand Trunk road afford the principal means of land
                    communication. The former enters the district from the east, crosses the Jamná
                    at Allahábád city, and travels westward, leaving the district near Khágá
                    station. The Grand Trunk road enters Allahábád from the north-east, meets the
                    railway at Allahábád city, and thence runs almost parallel with it till it
                    leaves the district. Only three towns are returned as containing a population of
                    over <hi rend="italic">5000</hi> souls—viz., Allahábád, population 144,464;
                    Manaimá, population 6146; and Chizwá, population 5791. Rice is the principal
                    crop, the area under it being returned at 139,000 acres, and the average produce
                    at 5⅛ cwt. per acre. A little more than half of the total rice crop is retained
                    for local consumption, and the remainder exported. The average price of common
                    rice in February 1873 was 6s. 9d. per cwt. Pulses are also grown in large
                    quantities, the area under the various sorts being about the same as rice, and
                    the yield also about the same. Joár and bajrá cover as large an area as either
                    rice or pulses, but the yield is neither so large nor of such value. About half
                    the crop is said to be annually exported. Wheat is cultivated to the extent of
                    about 150,000 cwt. per annum, of which about one-half is exported; the average
                    yield is said to be about 6½ cwt. per acre, and the average price from 6s. 2d.
                    to 6s. 9d. per cwt. Mustard, tobacco, opium, linseed, and indigo are also
                    cultivated largely, with cotton and sugar-cane in small quantities. Indigo
                    stands first among the manufactures of the district, and large factories exist
                    at Alam-chánd, Sarái Salem, Gadúpur, Kansaridh, Thardai, and Dum-duma. These are
                    generally under the supervision of European managers, and the produce is
                    forwarded direct to the Calcutta market. Next to indigo, the most important
                    industry is stone-cutting. The stone is chiefly quarried from a low range of
                    hills near Shiorájpur, whence it is carried in country carts to the Jamná river;
                    and after crossing it in flat-bottomed boats, it is finally landed at Balwá
                    Ghát. Here the stone-masons take it in hand. The gross income of the Balwá Ghát
                    stone traders is estimated at £2000 per annum. A brisk trade is also carried on
                    in hides, the principal mart being the village of Karwá, in Aráil fiscal
                    division, where it is estimated that the sale of skins amounts to upwards of
                    £10,000 per annum for the Mirzápur and Calcutta hide markets. Paper is
                    manufactured in the fiscal division of Karrá, and a considerable quantity
                    exported to Oudh. Several villages in the fiscal divisions of Karrá and Chail
                    are noted for the manufacture of brass and copper vessels; and iron vessels are
                    largely manufactured in Khairágarh, Karrá, and Phulpur. The East India Railway
                    Company have a large castor-oil manufactory at the village of Manaurí. The total
                    net revenue of the district in 1871 -72 is returned at £244,537, and the total
                    net civil expenditure at £51,770. The district passed into the hands of the
                    English in 1801, by a treaty between the Vazír of Oudh and the East India
                    Company.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">City,</hi> the capital of the North-Western Provinces, is also
                    the administrative headquarters of the Allahábád division and of the district of
                    the same name. It is situated at the confluence of the Ganges and Jamná rivers,
                    in 25° 26' N. lat., and 81° 55' E. long. Its most conspicuous feature is the
                    fort, which rises directly from the banks of the confluent rivers, and
                    completely commands the navigation of both streams. Within the fort are the
                    remains of a splendid palace, erected by the Emperor Akbar, and once a favourite
                    residence of his. A great portion of it has been destroyed, and its hall is
                    converted into an arsenal. Outside the fort, the places most of importance are
                    the Sarái and garden of Khasrú, the son of the Emperor Jahángír, and the Jumá
                    Masjid, or great mosque. When the town first came into the hands of the English
                    this mosque was used as a residence by the military officer commanding the
                    station, and afterwards as an assembly-room. Ultimately it was returned to its
                    former owners, but the Mahometans considered it desecrated, and it has never
                    since been used as a place of worship. Allahábád is one of the most noted
                    resorts of Hindu pilgrimage. It owes its sanctity to its being the reputed
                    confluence of three sacred streams—the Ganges, the Jamná, and the Saraswatí.
                    This last stream, however, is not visible. It leaves the Himálayas to the west
                    of the Jamná, passes close to Tháneswar in the Panjáb, and loses itself in the
                    sands of Sirhind, 400 miles north-west of Allahábád. The Hindus, however, assert
                    that the stream joins the other two rivers under ground, and in a subterraneous
                    temple below the fort a little moisture trickling from the rocky walls is
                    pointed out as the waters of the Saraswatí An annual fair is held at Allahábád,
                    at the confluence of the streams, on the occasion of the great bathing festival,
                    at the full moon of the Hindu month of Mágh. Allahábád was taken by the British,
                    in the year 1765, from the Vazír of Oudh, and assigned as a residence for Sháh
                    Alam, the titular Emperor of Dehli. Upon that prince throwing himself into the
                    hands of the Marhattás, the place was resumed by us in 1771, and again
                    transferred to the Nawáb of Oudh, by whom it was finally ceded, together with
                    the district, to the British in 1801, in commutation of the subsidy which the
                    Vazír had agreed to pay for British protection. The population and trade of
                    Allahábád city have rapidly increased of late years. According to the census of
                    1853, the city and suburbs contained 72,098 inhabitants. Before 1872 the
                    population had exactly doubled, the census returns for that year exhibiting a
                    total population of 144,464. The municipal income and expenditure of Allahábád
                    city in 1871-72 were as follows:—Income—Octroi duties, £13,676, 14s.; tax on
                    professions, £220,10s.; carriage tax, £1264, 4s.; proceeds of the Hindu fair and
                    ground rents, £5364: total municipal income, £20,525, 8s.; incidence of
                    taxation, 2s. 11d. per head of the population. Expenditure—Establishment,
                    including cost of collection, police, conservancy, and lighting, £9906,4s.;
                    street watering, £1002,12s.; new works,£7677, 16s.; repairs, £1088, 2s.;
                    vaccination, £20; dispensary, £330; charities, £250; Alfred Park, £800; other
                    items, £223, 2s.: total, £21,297, 16s. Allahábád forms the junction of the great
                    railway system which unites Bengal with Central India and Bombay, and it is
                    rapidly developing, into a great centre of inland and export trade.</p>
