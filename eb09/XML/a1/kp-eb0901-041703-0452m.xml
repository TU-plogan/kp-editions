                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Josephus informs us that, after the death of his
                    father, Herod, his grandfather, sent him to Rome to the court of Tiberius. The
                    emperor conceived a great affection for Agrippa, and placed him near his son
                    Drusus, whose favour he very soon won, as well as that of the empress Antonia.
                    On the death of Drusus, Agrippa, who had been recklessly extravagant, was
                    obliged to leave Rome, overwhelmed with debt, and retired to the castle of
                    Malatha. After a brief seclusion, Herod the tetrarch, his uncle, who had married
                    Herodias, his sister, made him principal magistrate of Tiberias, and presented
                    him with a large sum of money; but his unde grudging to continue his support,
                    and reproaching him with his bad economy, Agrippa left Judea, and soon after
                    returned to Rome. There he was received with favour by Tiberius, and commanded
                    to attend Tiberius Nero, the son of Drusus. Agrippa, however, chose rather to
                    attach himself to Caius, who at that time was universally beloved, and so far
                    won upon this prince that he kept him continually about him. Agrippa being one
                    day overheard by Eutyches, a slave whom he had made free, to express his wishes
                    for Tiberius's death and the advancement of Caius, was betrayed to the emperor
                    and cast into prison. Tiberius soon after died, and Caius Caligula ascended the
                    throne 37 A.D. The new emperor heaped wealth and favours upon Agrippa, changed
                    his iron fetters into a chain of gold, set a royal diadem upon his head, and
                    gave him the tetrarchy of Batanaea and Trachonitis, which Philip, the son of
                    Herod the Great, had formerly possessed. To this he added that held by Lysanias;
                    and Agrippa returned very soon into Judea to take possession of his new kingdom
                    On the assassination of Caligula, Agrippa, who was then at Rome, contributed
                    much by his advice to maintain Claudius in possession of the imperial dignity,
                    to which he had been advanced by the army; and while he made a show of being in
                    the interest of the senate, he secretly advised Claudius to maintain his
                    position with firmness. The emperor, as an acknowledgment of his services, gave
                    him the government of Judea; and the kingdom of Chalcis. at his request, was
                    given to his brother Herod. Thus Agrippa became of a sudden one of the greatest
                    princes of the East, the territory he possessed equalling in extent that held by
                    Herod the Great, his grandfather. He returned to Judea, and governed it to the
                    great satisfaction of the Jews. But the desire of pleasing them, a mistaken zeal
                    for their religion, impelled him to acts of cruelty, the memory of which is
                    preserved in Scripture (Acts xii. 1, 2, &amp;c.) About the feast of the
                    Passover, 44 A.D., James the elder, the son of Zebedee and brother of John the
                    evangelist, was seized by his order and put to death. He proceeded also to lay
                    hands on Peter, and imprisoned him, delaying his execution till the close of the
                    festival But God having miraculously delivered Peter from prison, the designs of
                    Agrippa were frustrated. After the Passover, he went from Jerusalem to Caesarea,
                    where he had games performed in honour of Claudius, and the inhabitants of Tyre
                    and Sidon waited on him to sue for peace. Agrippa having come early in the
                    morning to the theatre to give them audience, seated himself on his throne,
                    dressed in a robe of silver tissue, which reflected the rays of the rising sun
                    with such lustre as to dazzle the eyes of the spectators. When the king had
                    delivered his address, the parasites around him shouted out that it was not the
                    voice of a man but of a god. The vain Agrippa received the impious flattery with
                    complacent satisfaction; but in the midst of his elation, looking upwards, he
                    saw, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n453/mode/1up"

                    head. During his confinement by Tiberius he had been startled by a like omen,
                    which had been interpreted as portending his speedy release, with the warning
                    that whenever he should behold the same sight again, his death was to follow
                    within the space of five days. Seized with terror, he was immediately smitten
                    with disease, and after a few days of excruciating torment, died, according to
                    the Scripture expression, “eaten of worms,” 44 <hi rend="smallcaps"
