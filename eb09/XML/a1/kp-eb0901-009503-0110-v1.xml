                <p><label type="entry">ÁCHÍN</label> (pronounced <hi rend="italic">Atcheen),</hi> a
                    town and also a state of Northern Sumatra; the one state of that island which
                    has been powerful at any time since the discovery of the Cape route to the East,
                    and the only one that still remains independent of the Dutch, though that
                    independence is now menaced.</p>
                <p>De Barros names Achin among the twenty-nine states that divided the sea-board of
                    Sumatra when the Portuguese took Malacca. Northern Sumatra had been visited by
                    several European travellers in the Middle Ages, such as Marco Polo, Friar
                    Odorico, and Nicolo Conti. Some of these as well as Asiatic writers mention
                    Lambri, a state which must have nearly occupied the position of Achin. But the
                    first voyager to visit Achin, by that name, was Alvaro Tellez, a captain of
                    Tristan d’Acunha’s fleet, in 1506. It was then a mere dependency of the
                    adjoining state of Pedir; and the latter, with Pasei, formed the only states on
                    the coast whose chiefs claimed the title of Sultan. Yet before twenty years had
                    passed Achin had not only gained independence, but had swallowed up all other
                    states of Northern Sumatra. It attained its climax of power in the time of
                    Sultan Iskandar Muda (1607-1636), under whom the subject coast extended from Aru
                    opposite Malacca round by the north to Padang on the west coast, a sea-board of
                    not less than 1100 miles; and besides this, the king’s supremacy was owned by
                    the large island of Nyás, and by the continental Malay states of Johōr, Páháng,
                    Quedah, and Perák.</p>
                <p>The present limits of Achin supremacy in Sumatra are reckoned to be, on the east
                    coast the River Tamiang, in about 4° 25' N. lat., which forms the frontier of
                    territories tributary to Siák; and on the west coast a line in about 2° 48' N.,
                    the frontier of Trumon, a small modern state lying between Achin and the Dutch
                    government of Padang. Even within these limits the actual power of Achin is
                    precarious, and the interior boundary can be laid down only from conjecture.
                    This interior country is totally unexplored. It is believed to be inhabited by
                    tribes kindred <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0901-0111-0096"/> to the Battas, that remarkable race of
                    anthropophagi who adjoin on the south. The whole area of Achin territory,
                    defined to the best of our ability, will contain about 16,400 English square
                    miles. A rate of 20 per square mile, perhaps somewhat too large an average,
                    gives a probable population of 328,000.</p>
                <p>The production of rice and pepper forms the chief industry of the Achin
                    territory. From Pedir and other ports on the north coast large quantities of
                    betel-nut are exported to continental India, to Burmah, and to Penang for China.
                    Some pepper is got from Pedir, but the chief export is from a number of small
                    ports and anchorages on the west coast, where vessels go from port to port
                    making up a cargo. Achin ponies are of good repute, and are exported. Minor
                    articles of export are sulphur, iron, sappan-wood, gutta-percha, <hi
                        rend="italic">dammer,</hi> rattans, bamboos, benzoin, and camphor from the
                    interior forests. The camphor is that from the <hi rend="italic">Dryabalanops
                        camphora,</hi> for which so high a price is paid in China, and the whole
                    goes thither, the bulk of that whole being, however, extremely small. Very
                    little silk is now produced, but in the 16th century the quantity seems to have
                    been considerable. What is now wanted for the local textures, which are in some
                    esteem, is imported from China.</p>
                <p>The chief attraction to the considerable trade that existed at Achin two
                    centuries ago must have been gold. No place in the East, unless Japan, was so
                    abundantly supplied with gold. We can form no estimate of the annual export, for
                    it is impossible to accept Valentyn’s statement that it sometimes reached 80
                    bahars (512,000 ounces !). Crawford (1820), who always reckoned low, calculated
                    the whole export of Sumatra at 35,530 ounces, and that of Achin at 10,450;
                    whilst Anderson (1826), who tends to put figures too high, reckoned the whole
                    Achin export alone at 32,000 ounces. The chief imports to Achin are opium
                    (largely consumed), rice (the indigenous supply being inadequate), salt, iron
                    ware, piece-goods, arms and ammunition, vessels of copper and pottery, China
                    goods of sorts, and a certain kind of dried fish.</p>
                <p>The great repute of Achin at one time as a place of trade is shown by the fact,
                    that to this port the first Dutch (1599) and first English (1602) commercial
                    ventures to the Indies were directed. Lancaster, the English commodore, carried
                    letters from Queen Elizabeth to the king of Achin, and was well received by the
                    prince then reigning, Aláuddín Shàh. Another exchange of letters took place
                    between King James I. and Iskandar Muda in 1613. But native caprice and natural
                    jealousy at the growing force of the European nations in those seas, the
                    reckless rivalries of the latter and their fierce desire for monopoly, were
                    alike destructive of sound trade; and the English factory, though several times
                    set up, was never long maintained. The French made one great effort under
                    Beaulieu (1621) to establish relations with Achin, but nothing came of it.</p>
                <p>Still the foreign trade of Achin, though subject to spasmodic interruptions, was
                    important. Dampier and others speak of the number of foreign merchants settled
                    there,— English, Dutch, Danes, Portuguese, Chinese, Banyans from Guzerat,
                    &amp;c. Dampier says the roads were rarely without ten or fifteen sail of
                    different nations, bringing vast quantities of rice, as well as silks, chintzes,
                    muslins, and opium. Besides the Chinese merchants settled at Achin, others used
                    to come annually with the junks, ten or twelve in number, which arrived in June.
                    A regular fair was then established, which lasted two months, and was known as
                    the China camp,—a lively scene, and great resort of foreigners.</p>
                <p>The Achinese are not identical with the Malays proper either in aspect or
                    language. They are said to be taller, handsomer, and darker, as if with a
                    mixture of blood from India proper. Their language is little known; but though
                    it has now absorbed much Malay, the original part of it ia said to have
                    characteristics connecting it both with the Batta and with the Indo-Chinese
                    tongues. The Achin literature, however, is entirely Malay; it embraces poetry, a
                    good deal of theology, and several chronicles.</p>
                <p>The name of the state is properly <hi rend="italic">Ácheh.</hi> This the
                    Portuguese made into <hi rend="italic">Achem;</hi> whilst we, with the Dutch,
                    learned to call it <hi rend="italic">Achin.</hi> The last appears to have been a
                    Persian or Indian form, suggested by jingling analogy with Máchín (China).</p>
                <p>The town itself lies very near the north-west extremity of Sumatra, known in
                    charts as Achin Head. Here a girdle of ten or twelve small islands affords
                    protection to the anchorage. This fails in N.W. winds, but it is said that
                    vessels may find safe riding at all seasons by shifting their berths. The town
                    lies between two and three miles from the sea, chiefly on the left bank of a
                    river of no great size. This forms a swampy delta, and discharges by three
                    mouths. The central and chief mouth is about 100 yards wide, and has a depth of
                    20 to 30 feet within the bar. But the latter has barely 4 feet at low tide; at
                    high tide it admits native craft of 20 or 30 tons, and larger craft in the rainy
                    season. The town, like most Malay towns, consists of detached houses of timber
                    and thatch, clustered in enclosed groups called <hi rend="italic">kampongs,</hi>
                    and buried in a forest of fruit-trees. The chief feature is the palace of the
                    Sultan, which communicates with the river by a canal, and is enclosed, at least
                    partially, by a wall of cut stone.</p>
                <p>The valley or alluvial plain in which Achin lies is low, and subject to partial
                    inundation; but it is shut in at a short distance from the town, on the three
                    landward sides, by hills. It is highly cultivated, and abounds in small villages
                    and kampongs, with white mosques interspersed. The hills to the eastward are the
                    spurs of a great volcanic mountain, upwards of 6000 feet in height, called by
                    natives Yamuria, by mariners “the Golden Mountain.”<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Several other great volcanic cones exist
                            in the Achin territory, and two visible from seaward rise to a height of

                    population we find no modern estimate.</p>
                <p>The real original territory of the Achinese, called by them Great Achin (in the
                    sense of Achin proper), consists of three districts immediately round the city,
                    distinguished respectively as the 26, the 25, and the 22 múkims<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A múkim is said properly
                            to embrace 44 households.</p></note> (or hundreds, to use the nearest
                    English term).</p>
                <p>Each of these three districts has two heads, called <hi rend="italic"
                        >pang-</hi><hi rend="italic">limas;</hi> and these, according to some modern
                    accounts, constitute the council of state, who are the chief administrators, and
                    in whose hands it lies to depose the sovereign or to sanction his choice of a
                    successor. Late notices speak of a chief minister, apparently distinct from
                    these; and another important member of the government is the Shábandar, who is
                    over all matters of customs, shipping, and commerce.</p>
                <p>The court of Achin, in the 17th century, maintained a good deal of pomp; and,
                    according to Beaulieu, the king had always 900 elephants. These animals, though
                    found throughout Sumatra, are now no longer tamed or kept.</p>
                <p>Hostilities with the Portuguese began from the time of the first independent king
                    of Áchín; and they had little remission till the power of Portugal fell with the
                    loss of Malacca (1641). Not less than ten times before that event were armaments
                    despatched from Achin to reduce Malacca, and more than once its garrison was
                    very hard pressed. One of these armadas, equipped by Iskandar Muda in 1615,
                    gives an idea of the king’s resources. It consisted of 500 sail, of which 250
                    were galleys, and <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n112/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0901-0112-0097"/> among these a hundred were greater than any
                    then used in Europe. 60,000 men were embarked, with the king and his women.</p>
                <p>On the death of Iskandar’s successor in 1641, the widow was placed on the throne;
                    and as a female reign favoured the oligarchical tendencies of the Malay chiefs,
                    three more queens were allowed to reign successively. Though this series of
                    female sovereigns lasted only fifty-eight years altogether, so dense is apt to
                    be the ignorance of recent history, that long before the end of that period it
                    had become an accepted belief among foreign residents at Achin that there never
                    had been any sovereigns in Achin except females; and hence, by an easy
                    inference, that the Queen of Sheba had been Queen of Achin!</p>
                <p>In 1699 the Arab or fanatical party suppressed female government, and put a chief
                    of Arab blood on the throne. The remaining history of Achin is one of rapid
                    decay. Thirty sovereigns in all have reigned from the beginning of the 16th
                    century to the present day.</p>
                <p>After the restoration of Java to the Netherlands in 1816, a good deal of weight
                    was attached by the neighbouring English colonies to the maintenance of our
                    influence in Achin; and in 1819 a treaty of friendship was concluded with the
                    Calcutta Government, which excluded other European nationalities from fixed
                    residence in Achin. When the home Government, in 1824, made a treaty with the
                    Netherlands, surrendering our remaining settlements in Sumatra in exchange for
                    certain possessions on the continent of Asia, no reference was made in the
                    articles to the Indian treaty of 1819; but an understanding was exchanged that
                    it should be modified by us, whilst no proceedings hostile to Achin should be
                    attempted by the Dutch.</p>
                <p>This reservation was formally abandoned by our Government in a convention signed
                    at the Hague, November 2, 1871; and little more than a year elapsed before the
                    government of Batavia declared war upon Achin. Doubtless there was provocation,
                    as there always will be between such neighbours; but the necessity for war has
                    been greatly doubted, even in Holland. A Dutch force landed at Áchín in April
                    1873, and attacked the palace. It was defeated with considerable loss, including
                    that of the general (Köhler). The approach of the soutli-west monsoon was
                    considered to preclude the immediate renewal of the attempt; but hostilities
                    were resumed, and Achin fell in January 1874.</p>
