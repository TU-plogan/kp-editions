                    by a neck of land about a mile broad. The island is mountainous, but is for the
                    most part fertile and well-watered. Large tracts are covered with rich tropical
                    forests, which embrace a great variety of trees, although ordinary building
                    timber is scarce. The climate is comparatively pleasant and healthy; the average
                    temperature is 80° Fahr., rarely sinking below 72°. The rainfall, however, after
                    the eastern monsoons, is very heavy, and the island is liable to violent
                    hurricanes and earthquakes. Amboyna produces most of the common tropical fruits
                    and vegetables, including the sago-palm, bread-fruit, cocoa-nut, sugar-cane,
                    maize, coffee, pepper, and cotton. Cloves, however, form its chief product, and
                    the only one that is of any real commercial importance. The Dutch have done much
                    to foster the cultivation of this article in the island, and at one time
                    prohibited the rearing of the clove-tree in all the other islands subject to
                    their rule, in order to secure the monopoly to Amboyna. Each tree yields
                    annually from 2 to 5 lb of cloves, and sometimes even more; while the total
                    annual quantity produced probably averages about 500,000 lb. The animal kingdom
                    is poorly represented. Indigenous mammals are feeble in species as well as few
                    in number; birds are more abundant, but of no greater variety. The entomology of
                    the island is, however, very rich, particularly among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepi-doptera.</hi> The aborigines of Amboyna are a race called Horaforas, but
                    Malays constitute the main body of the population; there are also Chinese,
                    Dutch, and a few Portuguese. The Malays in most points resemble those of Java.
                    They are naturally lazy and effeminate, but when properly trained make good
                    soldiers. The inhabitants are mostly Christians or Mahometans. Amboyna is the
                    chief island of the Dutch residence of the Moluccas, which comprises, in
                    addition, the islands of Boeroe, Amblauw, Ceram, Manipa, Kilang, Bonoe,
                    Haroekoe, Honimoa or Saparoa, Noesa-laut, and Hila. The Portuguese were the
                    first European nation to visit Amboyna (1512). They established a factory there
                    in 1521, but did not obtain peaceable possession of it till 1580, and were
                    dispossessed by the Dutch in 1605. About the year 1615 the British formed a
                    settlement in the island, at Cambello, which they retained until 1623, when it
                    was destroyed by the Dutch, and frightful tortures inflicted on the unfortunate
                    persons connected with it. In 1654, after many fruitless negotiations, Cromwell
                    compelled the United Provinces to give the sum of £300,000, together with a
                    small island, as compensation to the descendants of those who suffered in the
                    “Amboyna massacre.” In 1796 the British, under Admiral Rainier, captured
                    Amboyna, but restored it to the Dutch at the peace of Amiens in 1802. It was
                    recaptured by the British in 1810, but once more restored to the Dutch in 1814.
                    Population, about 50,000. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Moluccas.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amboyna,</hi> the chief town of the above island, and also of
                    the Dutch Moluccas, is situated towards the north-west of the peninsula of
                    Leitimor. The streets are broad and unpaved, running at right angles to one
                    another, and intersected by numerous rivulets. The houses are of wood, roofed
                    with palm leaves, and mostly of one storey, on account of the frequent
                    earthquakes. An esplanade of 250 yards reaches from Fort Victoria to the town,
                    and is terminated by a handsome range of houses. The townhouse is a neat
                    structure of two storeys; and among the other buildings are two Protestant
                    churches and a hospital. The government offices are in Fort Victoria. The
                    roadstead of Amboyna is safe and commodious. Population, about 13,000.</p>
