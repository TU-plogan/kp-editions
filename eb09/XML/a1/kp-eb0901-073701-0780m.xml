                    and consists partly of fertile valleys formed by spurs of the mountain system
                    which divides it from Siam, and partly of a rich alluvial tract created by the
                    great rivers which issue from them. The most important of these are the Salween
                    river and the Houng-da-raw Khyoung. The river highways bring down inexhaustible
                    supplies of rice to Maulmain, the chief town of the district, as also of the
                    province of Tenasserim, and the second city in British Burmah. The district
                    comprises an area of 15,144 square miles, of which 346 are cultivated, 4889 are
                    capable of being brought under cultivation, and the remaining 9909 square miles
                    are returned as uncultivable. The population in 1872 numbered 235,738 souls,
                    occupying 38,945 houses, and consisting of 203,774 Buddhists, 15,598 Hindus,
                    12,279 Mahometans, and 4081 Christians. The town of Maulmain contains 53,653
                    inhabitants. The rainfall is very heavy, 245 ’ 85 inches being registered
                    inl871-72. The temperature is uniform, but not excessive, and averaged 83° at 2
                    p.M. throughout the month of May 1871, 80° at 2 P.M. throughout July, and the
                    same at 2 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> throughout December 1871.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amherst Town,</hi> situated in the district of the same
                    name, about 30 miles south of Maulmain. It was founded by the English in 1826 on
                    the restoration of the town of Martaban to the Burmese, and named in compliment
                    to the Governor-General of India who projected it. The proclamation inviting the
                    natives to people the town was well adapted to the character and capacities of
                    those whom it addressed. “The inhabitants of the towns and villages who wish to
                    come shall be free from molestation, extortion, and oppression. They shall be
                    free to worship as usual, temples, monasteries, priests, and holy men. The
                    people shall go and come, buy and sell, do and live as they please, conforming
                    to the laws. In regard to slavery, since all men, common people or chiefs, are
                    by nature equal, there shall be under the English government no slaves. Whoever
                    desires to come to the new town may come from all parts and live happy, and
                    those who do not wish to remain may go where they please without hindrance.”
                    Shortly after its settlement the number of houses amounted to 230, and the
                    population to 1200. Large teak forests abound in its neighbourhood, and the
                    timber is exported in considerable quantities. The harbour, though large and
                    capable of accommodating ships of any burden, is difficult of access, and
                    dangerous during the south-west monsoon. Amherst town has been eclipsed by the
                    rapidly rising city of Maulmain, which has absorbed to itself the trade and
                    mercantile enterprise alike of Amherst district and of the Tenasserim
                    province.</p>
