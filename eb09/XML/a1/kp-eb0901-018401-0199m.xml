                <p><label type="entry">AERATED WATERS</label>. Waters impregnated with an unusually
                    large proportion of carbonic acid, or other gaseous substances, occur abundantly
                    in springs throughout the world; and, in addition to their gaseous constituents,
                    generally hold in solution a large percentage of different salts. The
                    manufacture of aerated waters arose out of the attempt to imitate these by
                    artificial means, but till about the beginning of the present century such
                    efforts did not meet with great success. The earliest method of producing
                    acidulated water was that which still obtains in the preparation of effervescing
                    draughts, such as are made from “Seidlitz” powders. These powders consist of
                    separate portions of sodium bicarbonate and tartaric acid, which, on being
                    dissolved together in water, form sodium tartrate and liberate carbonic acid,
                    which bubbles up through the water. In recent years “granular” effervescent
                    preparations have been introduced, in which the acid and salt are mixed in a dry
                    state, and produce their reaction on being dissolved. The popular preparation
                    termed effervescent citrate of magnesia, and several others under a variety of
                    names, consist essentially of sodium bicarbonate and tartaric acid, to which a
                    little citric acid is sometimes added. A limit, however, is set to the use of
                    waters so aerated on account of the purgative action of the alkaline earths they
                    necessarily contain.</p>
                <p>In the manufacture of common aerated waters the carbonic acid is prepared apart
                    from the pure water in which it is to be dissolved. There are essentially only
                    two methods on which the manufacture is conducted, although there is an endless
                    variety in the apparatus used. In the first process, which may be distinguished
                    as the method of chemical pressure, the carbonic acid gas saturates the water by
                    its own pressure, passing directly from the chamber in which it is produced and
                    purified into the cylinder or cylinders containing the water to be aerated. The
                    small apparatus frequently used in private houses and hospitals may be taken as
                    an illustration of this method. The most common form consists of two strong
                    glass globes A and B, protected by netting in case of breakage. Into the globe A
                    are placed the materials for generating carbonic acid, usually in this case
                    tartaric acid and sodium bicarbonate. When charged with these materials, a metal
                    tube C, accurately fitted to the aperture in the globe, is inserted. The globe B
                    is inverted and filled with water, and in this position the globe A is screwed
                    tightly up by the joint D, the metal tube reaching to near the top of globe B.
                    On placing the apparatus upright, a proportion of water escapes through the
                    metal tube into globe A, acts on the charge it contains, and evolves carbonic
                    acid, which passes up the tube and saturates the water in B. As the pressure of
                    the gas augments, the quantity absorbed increases, and when fully saturated the
                    aerated water may be drawn off by the cock E. In manufacturing on a large scale,
                    a combination of globes or cylinders is used for producing continuous action,
                    and less expensive sources of carbonic acid than sodium bicarbonate and tartaric
                    acid are employed. The second or mechanical pressure process is that generally
                    followed in the manufacture in this country. In this process the gas is prepared
                    in a lead chamber by the action of sulphuric acid on chalk, and is washed by
                    passing through water into the gas-holder in which it is collected. By the
                    action of a force-pump, water, filtered when necessary, and carbonic acid, are
                    pressed, in due proportions, into a very strong copper cylinder, tinned
                    internally, termed a receiver or saturator, in which an agitator is kept
                    revolving. A pressure gauge is attached to the receiver, and when the index
                    indicates from 120 to 140 lb pressure per square inch, what is termed aerated
                    water, and very frequently does duty for soda-water, is ready for drawing off at
                    the bottling apparatus. Real soda-water is best prepared by adding to the water
                    before aeration a proportion of sodium bicarbonate equal to about 30 or 36
                    grains per pint of water. Potash-water, Seltzer, lithia, Carrara, bromide of
                    potassium, and a host of other waters, are similarly prepared, the various salts
                    being used in different proportions, according to the taste and experience of
                    manufacturers. Lemonade, and other aerated drinks flavoured with fruit syrups,
                    have the proportion of syrup placed in the bottle to which simple aerated water
                    taken from a receiver, indicating a pressure of 80 to 100 ft per square inch, is
                    added. From a syrup composed of 14 lb of sugar, 2½ oz. of tartaric acid, 3½ oz.
                    of citric acid, and 4½ drachms of essence of lemon, dissolved in 2½ gallons of
                    water, 30 dozen bottles of an excellent quality of lemonade can be prepared. On
                    account of the rapidity with which the gas escapes on the removal of pressure,
                    special arrangements are required for the bottling and corking processes, and
                    the frequent explosion of bottles necessitates guards to protect the bottler. A
                    dexterous bottler will fill and cork 5000 bottles in ten hours. The consumption
                    of aerated waters, especially in hot climates, is very great.</p>
