                <p><label type="entry">AERONAUTICS</label></p>
                <p>IN every stage of society men have sought, by the combination of superior skill
                    and ingenuity, to attain those distinct and obvious advantages which nature has
                    conferred on the different tribes of animals, by endowing them with a peculiar
                    structure and a peculiar force of organs. The rudest savage learns from his very
                    infancy to imitate the swimming of a fish, and plays on the surface of the water
                    with agility and perseverance. But an art so confined in its exercise, and
                    requiring such a degree of bodily exertion, could not be considered of much
                    avail. It must have been soon perceived (even if the discoveries of the arts of
                    natation and navigation were not absolutely simultaneous), that the fatigue of
                    impulsion through the water could be greatly diminished by the support and
                    floating of some light substance. The trunk of a tree would bear its rude
                    proprietor along the stream; or, hollowed out into a canoe and furnished with
                    paddles, it might enable him even to traverse a river. From this simple fabric
                    the step was not great to the construction of a boat or barge, impelled by the
                    force of oars. But it was a great advance to fix masts and apply sails to the
                    vessel, and thus substitute the power of wind for that of human labour. The
                    adventurous sailor, instead of plying on the narrow seas or creeping timidly
                    along the shore, could now launch with confidence into the wide ocean.
                    Navigation, in its most cultivated form, may be fairly regarded as one of the
                    sublimest triumphs of human genius, industry, courage, and perseverance.</p>
                <p>Having by his skill achieved the conquest of the waters that encompass the
                    habitable globe, it was natural for man to desire likewise the mastery of the
                    air in which we breathe. In all ages, therefore, great ingenuity has been
                    expended in efforts at flying, all of which have as yet resulted in failure. But
                    the analogy between sailing on the water and sailing in the air is not so close
                    as many enthusiasts have supposed it to be. There is a general resemblance,
                    inasmuch as in both cases the propulsion must be made by means of a fluid. But
                    in the one case the fluid is inelastic, in the other elastic; and the physicist
                    or mathematician knows how vastly different are the properties of liquids, even
                    in fundamental points, from those of aeriform or gaseous bodies. Again, in the
                    one case the vessel floats on the surface of the water, in the other it must
                    float totally immersed in the aerial fluid. A ship, while sailing, is acted on
                    by two fluids—the water supports it and the air propels it; but a ship sailing
                    in the air would be only under the action of the one fluid that surrounds it on
                    all sides. These few considerations—and many more might be added—indicate the
                    essential distinctions between the two cases; and a very little thought shows
                    that it is not so remarkable as it at first sight appears, that the invention of
                    the art of sailing on the water should be lost in prehistoric antiquity, while
                    that of sailing in the air is not a century old; and that while navigation is
                    one of the most perfect of the arts, the power of directing a body floating in
                    the air still remains unattained. Many have argued, that because navigation is
                    an accomplished fact, therefore the navigation of the air must be possible; and
                    without denying the truth of the conclusion, it is worth while at the outset of
                    this article to point out the fallacy of the reasoning. It is true that there is
                    no reason to despair of the attainment of aerial navigation, as the history of
                    invention and science records many victories as great and at one time apparently
                    as far off; still, it is as well to notice how little assistance the old
                    discovery affords towards the solution of the new: it may, indeed, even be that
                    progress has been retarded by the false analogy, for we may feel pretty certain
                    that if ever the air is navigated, it will be by ships presenting little
                    resemblance to those that traverse the ocean.</p>
                <p>The subject of aerostation is scarcely ever alluded to by the classical writers,
                    and the fable of Daedalus and Icarus, and the dove of Archytas, form almost all
                    we have to record in relation to flying previous to the dark ages. Daedalus, an
                    Athenian, killed his nephew Talus through jealousy of his talents, and fled with
                    his son Icarus to Crete, where he built the celebrated labyrinth for Minos, the
                    king. But having offended Minos, so that he was imprisoned by him, he made wings
                    of feathers, cemented with wax, for himself and his son, so that they might
                    escape by flight. He gave his son directions to fly neither too low nor too
                    high, but to follow him. Icarus, however, becoming excited, forgot his father’s
                    advice, and rose so high that the heat of the sun melted the wax of his wings,
                    and he fell into the sea near Samos, the island of Icaria and the Icarian sea
                    being named after him. Daedalus accomplished his flight in safety. (Ovid, <hi
                    rend="italic">Met.</hi> lib. viii. Fab. iii.) The explanation of the myth may
                    be, as has been supposed, that Daedalus used sails, which, till then, according
                    to Pausanius and Palaephatus, were unknown, and so was enabled to escape from
                    Minos’ galleys, which were only provided with oars; and that Icarus was drowned
                    near the island Icaria. But the whole story of Daedalus is so fanciful a
                    romance, that it is scarcely worth while even to speculate upon what the
                    infinitesimal fragment of truth that lay at the bottom of it may have been.</p>
                <p>Archytas of Tarentum was a well-known geometer and astronomer, and he is
                    apostrophised by Horace (<hi rend="italic">Ode</hi> 28, lib. i.) The account of
                    his flying pigeon or dove we owe to Aulus Gellius <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Noctes</hi><hi rend="italic">Atticoe),</hi> who says “that it was the model of
                    a dove or a pigeon formed in wood, and so contrived as by a certain mechanical
                    art and power to fly: so nicely was it balanced by weights, and put in motion by
                    hidden and enclosed air.” Gellius gives as his authorities “many men of eminence
                    among the Greeks,” whom he does not mention by name, and Favorinus the
                    philosopher.</p>
                <p>Archytas thus has been regarded as holding to aeronautics much about the same
                    position as Archimedes does to the mechanical sciences; but while the claim of
                    the latter rests on real discoveries and great contributions to knowledge, the
                    former owes his position merely to an unsupported and untrustworthy tradition.
                    When the fire-balloon was invented, it was only natural that many should see in
                    the “hidden and enclosed air” of Archytas’ dove a previous discovery of the
                    hot-air balloon. It is quite possible that Archytas may have rarefied the air in
                    his dove by heat, and so made it ascend; but in this case it certainly could not
                    have been made of wood. But if the dove ever was made to appear to fly, it is
                    much the more probable that this effect was produced, as in the scenes at
                    theatres, by means of fine strings or wires invisible to the spectators.</p>
                <p>The ancients seem to have been convinced of the impossibility of men being able
                    to fly, and they appear to have made no attempts in this direction at all. The
                    power of flying was attributed only to the most powerful of the divinities; and
                    it was regarded as only secondary to Jupiter’s prerogative of flashing the
                    lightning and hurling the thunderbolt.</p>
                <p>The history of aerostatics in the Middle Ages, like that of every other subject
                    relating even remotely to science or knowledge of any kind, is little better
                    than a record of the falsehoods or chimeras circulated by impostors or
                    enthusiasts. Truth was completely obscured by ignorance and fanaticism, and
                    every person of superior talents and acquire<pb break="no"

                    perform his feats of skill chiefly through the secret aid granted him by the
                    prince of darkness; and in a later and comparatively recent period, those
                    wretched creatures whom the unfeeling credulity of our ancestors, particularly
                    during the prevalence of religious fanaticism, stigmatised and murdered under
                    the denomination of witches, were supposed to work all their enchantments, to
                    change their shapes at will, and to transport themselves through the air with
                    the swiftness of thought, by a power derived from their infernal master, to whom
                    was thus assigned the privilege of conferring the gift of aerial navigation upon
                    his servants.</p>
                <p>During the darkness of the Middle Ages every one at all distinguished for his
                    knowledge in physics was generally reputed to have obtained the power of flying
                    in the air. Friar Bacon did not scruple to claim the invention; and the
                    credulity and indulgent admiration of some authors have lent to these
                    pretensions more credit than they really deserved. Any one who takes the trouble
                    to examine the passages of Bacon’s obscure and ponderous works will find that
                    the propositions advanced by him are seldom founded on reality, but ought rather
                    to be considered as the illusions of a lively fancy. Albertus Magnus, who
                    flourished in the first half of the 13th century, was reputed to have discovered
                    the art; and to give an idea of the state of the physical sciences at that time,
                    it is worth while to quote the following recipes from his <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirabilibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae:</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> “Take one pound of sulphur, two pounds of willow-carbon,
                    six pounds of rock-salt ground very fine in a marble mortar; place, when you
                    please, in a covering made of flying papyrus to produce thunder. The covering,
                    in order to ascend and float away, should be long, graceful, well filled with
                    this fine powder; but to produce thunder, the covering should be short, thick,
                    and half full.” (Quoted in <hi rend="italic">Astra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Castra,</hi> p. 25.) Regiomontanus, the first real mathematician after the
                    partial revival of learning, is said, like Archytas, to have formed an
                    artificial dove, which flew before the Emperor Charles V. at his public entry
                    into Nuremberg; but the date of Regiomontanus’ death shows this to have been
                    impossible.</p>
                <p>Attempts at flying have, as a rule, been made by a somewhat low class of
                    projectors, who have generally united some little share of ingenuity to a
                    smattering of mechanics. At the beginning of the 16th century an Italian
                    alchemist visited Scotland, and was collated by James IV. to the abbacy of
                    Tungland, in Galloway. Having constructed a set of wings, composed of various
                    plumage, he undertook from the walls of Stirling Castle to fly through the air
                    to France. This feat he actually attempted, but he soon came to the ground, and
                    broke his thigh-bone by the violence of the fall—an accident he explained by
                    asserting that the feathers of some fowls were employed in his wings, and that
                    these had an affinity for the dunghill, whereas, if composed solely of eagles’
                    feathers, they would have been attracted to the air. This anecdote has furnished
                    to Dunbar, the Scottish poet, the subject of one of his rude satires. In 1617,
                    Fleyder, rector of the grammar school at Tübingen, delivered a lecture on
                    flying, which he published eleven years afterwards. A poor monk, however,
                    ambitious to reduce the theory to practice, provided himself with wings; but his
                    machinery broke down, and falling to the ground, he broke his legs and perished.
                    Bishop Wilkins <hi rend="italic">(Mathematical Magick,</hi> 1648) says it was
                    related that “a certain English monk called Elmerus, about the Confessor’s
                    time,” flew by means of wings from a tower a distance of more than a furlong;
                    that another person flew from St Mark’s steeple at Venice; and another, at
                    Nuremberg. He also quotes Busbequius to the effect that a Turk also attempted
                    something of the kind at Constantinople. It would probably not be very difficult
                    to make a long list of such narrations, in some of which the experimenter is
                    related to have been successful, and in others to have failed; but the evidence
                    is in no case very good, and we may feel certain that all the traditions of
                    attempts with a successful issue are false.</p>
                <p>In Borelli’s posthumous work, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Motu
                    Animalium,</hi> published at Rome in 1680-81, he calculated the enormous
                    strength of the pectoral muscles in birds; and his proposition cciv. (vol. i.
                    pp. 322-326) is entitled “Est impossibile, ut homines propriis viribus
                    artificiosè volare possint,” in which he clearly points out the impossibility of
                    man being able by his muscular strength to give motion to wings of sufficient
                    extent to keep him suspended in the air. But Borelli did not, of course, as has
                    sometimes been stated, demonstrate the impossibility of man’s flying otherwise
                    than merely by means of his own muscular power.</p>
                <p>A very slight consideration of the matter shows that, although the muscles of man
                    may not be of sufficient strength to enable him to use wings, this objection
                    does not apply against the possibility of making a flying chariot in which the
                    motive power should be produced mechanically as in a watch, or a boat to float
                    in the atmosphere. Both these projects have therefore always engaged the
                    attention of abler men than has the art of flying, and it was only the ignorance
                    of the nature and force of the atmosphere, as well as of the properties of all
                    aeriform bodies, that caused so long a time to elapse before the invention of
                    the balloon.</p>
                <p>Albert of Saxony, a monk of the order of St Augustine, and a commentator on the
                    physical works of Aristotle, seems first to have comprehended (though in a very
                    vague and erroneous manner) the principles on which a body might be made to
                    float in the atmosphere. Adopting, of course, Aristotelian views with regard to
                    the nature of the elements, he considered that, as fire is more attenuated, and
                    floats above our atmosphere, therefore a small portion of this ethereal
                    substance, enclosed in a light hollow globe, would raise it to a certain height
                    and keep it suspended in the air; and that, if more air were introduced, the
                    globe would sink like a ship when water enters by a leak. Long afterwards
                    Francis Mendoza, a Portuguese Jesuit, who died in 1626, at the age of forty-six,
                    embraced this theory, and he held that the combustible nature of fire was no
                    real obstacle, as its extreme levity and the extension of the air would prevent
                    it from supporting inflammation. Casper Schott, also a Jesuit, adopted the same
                    speculation, only that he replaced the fire by the thin ethereal substance which
                    he believed floated above our atmosphere; but, of course, the difficulty of
                    procuring any of this ether was a sufficient obstacle.</p>
                <p>Similar notions have been revived at different times. They were likewise often
                    blended with the alchemical tenets so generally received in the course of the
                    15th, 16th, and part of the 17th centuries. Thus Schott quotes Lauretus Laurus
                    to the effect that if swans’ eggs or leather balls be filled with nitre,
                    sulphur, or quicksilver, and be exposed to the sun, they will ascend. It was
                    also believed that dew was of celestial origin, being shed by the stars, and
                    that it was drawn up again in the course of the day to heaven by the heat of the
                    sun. Thus Laurus states that hens’ eggs filled with dew and exposed to the solar
                    heat will rise. He was so grossly ignorant, however, of the principles of
                    motion, that it is not worth while even to allude to his other assertions.</p>

                    sun, by its attractive power on the dew, raised him up to the middle region of
                    the atmosphere, whence, some of the flasks being broken, the adventurer sank
                    again to the ground. Other aeronautical ideas occur in the romance.</p>
                <p>Cardan proposed that ascensional power might be applied as in a rocket; and one
                    Honoratus Fabry has described a huge apparatus, consisting of long tin pipes,
                    worked by air compressed by the action of fire.</p>
                <p>The most noted scheme for navigating the air promulgated previously to the
                    successful experiments of the Montgolfiers, is due to a Jesuit, Francis Lana,
                    and was proposed by him in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Prodromo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dell' Arte Maestra,</hi> Brescia, 1670. His idea, though useless
                    and unpractical in so far that it could never be carried out, is yet deserving
                    of notice, as the principles involved are sound; and this can be said of no
                    earlier attempt. His project was to procure four copper balls of very large
                    dimensions, yet so extremely thin that after the air was exhausted from them
                    they would be lighter than the air displaced, and so would rise; and to those
                    four balls he proposed to attach a boat, with sails, &amp;c., and which would
                    carry up a man. He submitted the whole matter to calculation, and proposed that
                    the globes should be about 25 feet in diameter and <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 225</hi> th of an inch in thickness; this would
                    give from all four balls a total ascensional force of about 1200 lb, which would
                    be quite enough to raise the boat, sails, passengers, &amp;c. But the obvious
                    objection to the whole scheme is, that it would be quite impossible to construct
                    a globe of so large a size and of such small thickness which would even support
                    its own weight without falling to pieces if placed on the ground, much less bear
                    the external atmospheric pressure when the internal air was removed. Lana
                    himself noticed the latter objection, but he thought that the spherical form of
                    the copper shell would, notwithstanding its extreme thinness, enable it, after
                    the exhaustion was effected, to sustain the enormous pressure, which, acting
                    equally on every point of the surface, would tend to consolidate rather than to
                    break the metal. Of course this assumed the ball to be absolutely spherical, a
                    state of affairs as impossible as indifferent equilibrium actually is. He
                    proposed to exhaust the air from the globes by attaching each to a tube 36 feet
                    long, fitted with a stopcock, and so produce a Torricellian vacuum. He was thus
                    apparently ignorant of the invention of the air-pump by Otto Guericke about
                    1650; and though his project is noteworthy as the hydrostatics of it is correct,
                    still Lana displays his ignorance of philosophical facts known in his day, quite
                    as much as his originality; and his proposition has, since Montgolfier’s
                    discovery, received a greater share of notice than it deserves.</p>
                <p>So late as 1755, and not long before the invention of balloons, a very fanciful
                    scheme was proposed by Joseph Galien, a Dominican friar, and professor of
                    philosophy and theology in the papal university of Avignon. This visionary
                    proposed to collect the diffuse air of the upper regions, and to enclose it in a
                    huge vessel extending more than a mile every way, and intended to carry
                    fifty-four times as much weight as did Noah’s ark. It is unnecessary to notice
                    at greater length this absurd chimera, which is merely mentioned here at all
                    because it is sometimes referred to, though only on account of the magnitude of
                    the fantastic scheme.</p>
                <p>It is proper here to remark, that nearly all the early projectors imagined that
                    the atmosphere was of no great height, and that it covered the earth like a
                    shallow ocean, having a well-defined boundary; and the aerial vessels which they
                    proposed were intended to float on the surface of this ocean, exactly as ships
                    do on the sea, with their upper portions in the ether or diffuse air, or
                    whatever the fluid might be, that lay above. And these ideas were, of course,
                    not dispelled till after the invention of the barometer and the discovery of the
                    law of the decrease of atmospheric pressure with elevation.</p>
                <p>Some writers have stated that Francis Bacon first published the true principles
                    of aeronautics. This assertion we cannot help noticing, because it has really no
                    foundation except in the propensity, fostered by indolence, which would gladly
                    refer all the discoveries ever made to a few great names. They mistake, indeed,
                    the character of Bacon who seek to represent him as an inventor. His claim to
                    immortality rests chiefly on the profound and comprehensive views which he took
                    of the bearings of the different parts of human knowlege; for it would be
                    difficult to point out a single fact or observation with which he enriched the
                    store of physical science. On the contrary, being very deficient in mathematical
                    learning, he disregarded or rejected some of the noblest discoveries made in his
                    own time.</p>
                <p>We can find only two passages in Bacon’s works which can be considered as
                    referring to aeronautics, and they both occur in that collection of loose facts
                    and inconclusive reasonings which he has entitled <hi rend="italic">Natural
                    History.</hi> The first is styled <hi rend="italic">Experiment Solitary,
                    touching Flying in the Air,</hi> and runs thus—“Certainly many birds of good
                    wing (as kites and the like) would bear up a good weight as they fly; and
                    spreading feathers thin and close, and in great breadth, will likewise bear up a
                    great weight, being even laid, without tilting up on the sides. <hi
                    rend="italic">The farther extension of this experiment might be thought
                    upon.”</hi> The second passage is more diffuse, but less intelligible; it is
                    styled <hi rend="italic">Experiment Solitary, touching the Flying of unequal
                    Bodies in the Air:—</hi> “Let there be a body of unequal weight (as of wool and
                    lead or bone and lead); if you throw it from you with the light end forward, it
                    will turn, and the weightier end will recover to be forwards, unless the body be
                    over long. The cause is, for that the more dense body hath a more violent
                    pressure of the parts from the first impulsion, which is the cause (though
                    heretofore not found out, as hath been often said) of all violent motions; and
                    when the hinder part moveth swifter (for that it less endureth pressure of
                    parts) than the forward part can make way for it, it must needs be that the body
                    turn over; for (turned) it can more easily draw forward the lighter part.” The
                    fact here alluded to is the resistance that bodies experience in moving through
                    the air, which, depending on the quantity of surface merely, must exert a
                    proportionally greater effect on rare substances. The passage itself, however,
                    after making every allowance for the period in which it was written, must be
                    deemed confused, obscure, and unphilosophical.</p>
                <p>We now come to the discovery of the balloon, which was due to Stephen and Joseph
                    Montgolfier, sons of Peter Montgolfier, a large and celebrated papermaker at
                    Annonay, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n205/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0205-0188"/> a town about 40 miles from Lyons. The brothers
                    had observed the Suspension of clouds in the atmosphere, and it occurred to them
                    that if they could enclose any vapour of the nature of a cloud in a large and
                    very light bag, it might rise and carry the bag with it into the air. They
                    accordingly made experiments, inflating bags with smoke from a fire placed
                    underneath, and found either that the smoke or some vapour emitted from the fire
                    did ascend and carry the bag with it. Being thus assured of the correctness of
                    their views, they determined to have a public ascent of a balloon on a large
                    scale. They accordingly invited the States of Vivarais, then assembled at
                    Annonay, to witness their aerostatic experiment; and on June 5, 1783, in the
                    presence of a considerable concourse of spectators, a linen globe of 105 feet in
                    circumference was inflated over a fire fed with small bundles of chopped straw,
                    and when released rapidly rose to a great height, and descended, at the
                    expiration of ten minutes, at the distance of about 1½ mile. This was the
                    discovery of the balloon. The brothers Montgolfier imagined that the bag rose
                    because of the levity of the smoke or other vapour given forth by the burning
                    straw; and it was not till some time later that it was recognised that the
                    ascending power was due merely to the lightness of heated air compared to an
                    equal volume of air at a lower temperature. Air, like all other fluids, expands
                    by heat, aud thereby becomes rarefied, so that any volume of hot air weighs less
                    than the corresponding volume of air at a lower temperature. If, then, the air
                    inside the balloon be so heated that it, together with the balloon, weighs less
                    than the air displaced, the balloon will rise till it arrives at such a height
                    that it and the enclosed air are equal in weight to that of the displaced air,
                    when equilibrium will be obtained. In Montgolfier’s first balloon, no source of
                    heat was taken up with it, so that the air inside rapidly cooled, and the
                    balloon soon descended.</p>
                <p>The news of the experiment at Annonay rapidly spread over Europe, and at Paris
                    attracted so much attention that M. Faujas de Saint-Fond, a naturalist, set on
                    foot a subscription for paying the expense of repeating the experiment. The
                    balloon was constructed by two brothers of the name of Robert, under the
                    superintendence of M. Charles, professor of natural philosophy in Paris, and
                    afterwards a member of the Academy of Sciences. It had at first been suggested
                    to copy the process of Montgolfier, but Charles proposed the application of
                    hydrogen gas, which was adopted. The filling of the balloon, which was made of
                    thin silk varnished with a solution of elastic gum, and was about 13 feet in
                    diameter, was commenced on August 23, 1783, in the Place des Victoires. The
                    hydrogen gas was obtained by the action of dilute sulphuric acid upon iron
                    filings, and was introduced through leaden pipes; but as the gas was not passed
                    through cold water, great difficulty was experienced in filling the balloon
                    completely; and altogether about 500 lb of sulphuric acid and twice that amount
                    of iron filings were used. Bulletins were issued daily of the progress of the
                    inflation; and the crowd was so great that on the 26th the balloon was moved to
                    the Champ de Mars, a distance of 2 miles. This was done secretly, in the middle
                    of the night, to avoid the crowd; and the appearance of the balloon being thus
                    removed, preceded by lighted torches and escorted by a detachment of soldiers,
                    is described as having been very remarkable. On the next day, August 27, an
                    immense concourse of people covered the Champ de Mars, and every spot from which
                    a view could be obtained was crowded. About five o’clock a cannon was discharged
                    as the signal for the ascent, and the balloon when liberated rose to the height
                    of about 3000 feet with great rapidity. A shower of rain which began to fall
                    directly after the balloon had left the earth in no way checked its progress;
                    and the excitement was so great, that thousands of well-dressed spectators, many
                    of them ladies, stood exposed, watching it intently the whole time it was in
                    sight, and were drenched to the skin. The balloon, after remaining in the air
                    for about three-quarters of an hour, fell in a field near Gonesse, about 15
                    miles off, and terrified the peasantry so much that it was torn into shreds by
                    them. Hydrogen gas was at this time known by the name of inflammable air; and
                    balloons inflated with gas have ever since been called by the people
                    air-balloons, the kind invented by the Montgolfiers being designated
                    fire-balloons. French writers have also very frequently styled them after their
                    inventors, <hi rend="italic">Charlières</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Montgolfières.</hi></p>
                <p>On the 19th of September 1783 Joseph Montgolfier repeated the Annonay experiment
                    at Versailles, in the presence of the king, the queen, the court, and an immense
                    number of spectators. The inflation was commenced at one o’clock, and completed
                    in eleven minutes, when the balloon rose to the height of about 1500 feet, and
                    descended after eight minutes, at a distance of about two miles, in the wood of
                    Vaucresson. Suspended below the balloon, in a cage, had been placed a sheep, a
                    cock, and a duck, which were thus the first aerial travellers. They were quite
                    uninjured, except the cock, which had its right wing hurt in consequence of a
                    kick it had received from the sheep; but this took place before the ascent. The
                    balloon, which was painted with ornaments in oil colours, had a very showy
                    appearance.</p>
                <p>The first human being who ascended in a balloon was M. François Pilâtre de
                    Rozier, a young naturalist, who, two years afterwards, was killed in an attempt
                    to cross the English Channel in a balloon. On October 15, 1783, and following
                    days, he made several ascents (generally alone, but once with a companion, M.
                    Girond de Villette), in a captive balloon <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> one
                    attached by ropes to the ground), and demonstrated that there was no difficulty
                    in taking up fuel and feeding the fire, which was kindled in a brazier suspended
                    under the balloon, when in the air. The way being thus prepared for aerial
                    navigation, on November 21, 1783, M. Pilâtre de Rozier and the Marquis
                    d’Arlandes first trusted themselves to a free fire-balloon. The experiment was
                    made from the Jardin du Chateau de la Muette, in the Bois de Boulogne. The
                    machine employed, which was a large fire-balloon, was inflated at about two
                    o’clock, and leaving the earth at this time, it rose to a height of about 500
                    feet, and passing over the Invalides and the Ecole Militaire, descended beyond
                    the Boulevards, about 9000 yards from the place of ascent, having been between
                    twenty and twenty-five minutes in the air. The result was completely successful;
                    and it is scarcely necessary to add, the excitement in Paris was very great.</p>
                <p>Only ten days later, viz., on December 1, 1783, MM. Charles and Robert ascended
                    from Paris in a balloon inflated with hydrogen gas. The balloon, as in the case
                    of the small one of the same kind previously launched from the Champ de Mars,
                    was constructed by the brothers Robert. It was 27 feet in diameter, and the car
                    was suspended from a hoop surrounding the middle of the balloon, and fastened to
                    a net which covered the upper hemisphere. The balloon ascended very gently from
                    the Tuileries at a quarter to two o’clock, and after remaining for some time at
                    an elevation of about 2000 feet, it descended in about two hours at Nesle, a
                    small town about 27 miles from Paris, when M. Robert left the car, and M.
                    Charles made a second ascent by himself. He had intended to have replaced the
                    weight of his companion by a nearly equivalent quantity of ballast; but not
                    having any suitable means of obtaining such ready at the place of descent, and
                    it being just upon sunset, he gave the word <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n206/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0206-0189"/> to let go, and the balloon being thus so greatly
                    lightened, ascended very rapidly to a height of about 2 miles. After staying in
                    the air about half-an-hour, he descended 3 miles from the place of ascent,
                    although he believed the distance traversed, owing to different currents, to
                    have been about 9 miles. In this second journey M. Charles experienced a violent
                    pain in his right ear and jaw, no doubt produced by the rapidity of the ascent.
                    He also witnessed the phenomenon of a double sunset on the same day; for when he
                    ascended, the sun had set in the valleys, and as he mounted he saw it rise
                    again, and set a second time as he descended.</p>
                <p>All the features of the modern balloon as now used are more or less due to
                    Charles, who invented the valve at the top, suspended the car from a hoop, which
                    was itself attached to the balloon by netting, &amp;c. The M. Robert who
                    accompanied him in the ascent was one of the brothers who had constructed
                    it.</p>
                <p>On January 19, 1784, the largest balloon on record (if the contemporary accounts
                    are correct) ascended from Lyons. It was more than 100 feet in diameter, about
                    130 feet in height, and when distended had a capacity, it is said, of over
                    half-a-million cubic feet. It was called the <hi rend="italic">Flesselles</hi>
                    (from the name of its proprietor or owner, we believe), and after having been
                    inflated from a straw fire in seventeen minutes, it rose with seven persons in
                    the car, viz., Joseph Montgolfier, Pilâtre de Rozier, Count de Laurencin, Count
                    de Dampierre, Prince Charles de Ligne, Count de Laport d’Anglefort, and M.
                    Fontaine, the last gentleman having leaped into the car just as the machine had
                    started. The fire was fed with trusses of straw, and the balloon rose
                    majestically to the height of about 3000 feet, but descended again after the
                    lapse of about a quarter of an hour from the time of starting, in consequence of
                    a rent in the upper part.</p>
                <p>It is proper here to state that researches on the use of gas for inflating
                    balloons seem to have been carried on at Philadelphia nearly simultaneously with
                    the experiments of the Montgolfiers; and when the news of the latter reached
                    America, Messrs Rittenhouse and Hopkins, members of the Philosophical Academy of
                    Philadelphia, constructed a machine consisting of forty-seven small hydrogen
                    gas-balloons attached to a car or cage. After several preliminary experiments,
                    in which animals were let up to a certain height by a rope, a carpenter, one
                    James Wilcox, was induced to enter the car for a small sum of money; the ropes
                    were cut, and he remained in the air about ten minutes, and only then effected
                    his descent by making incisions in a number of the balloons, through fear of
                    falling into the river, which he was approaching.</p>
                <p>The improvements that have been made in the management and inflation of balloons
                    in the last ninety years have only had reference to details, so that as far as
                    essential principles are concerned the subject is now in pretty much the same
                    state as it was in 1783. We have therefore arrived at a point in the history of
                    the balloon where it is well to consider how much the Montgolfiers and Charles
                    owed to their predecessors; and it is proper here to state that, although we
                    have assigned the invention to the two brothers, Stephen and Joseph—as no doubt
                    they both conducted the early experiments together—still there is reason to
                    believe that the share of the latter was very small. Stephen, however, although
                    the originator of balloons, does not appear ever to have ascended himself, aud
                    Joseph did not repeat the ascent just mentioned in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flesselles.</hi> The Montgolfiers had studied Priestley’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Experiments relating to different kinds of Air,</hi> whence they first
                    conceived the possibility of navigating the atmosphere; but their experiment was
                    so simple as to require scarcely any philosophical knowledge. They had seen
                    smoke ascend, and thought that if they could imprison it in a bag, the bag might
                    ascend too; and the observation and reasoning were both such as might occur to
                    anybody. This does not detract from their merit; it, on the contrary, adds to
                    it. The fact that millions of persons must have observed the same thing, and had
                    <hi rend="italic">not</hi> derived anything practical therefrom, only enhances
                    the glory of those who in such well-worn tracts did make a discovery; but the
                    simplicity of the invention shows that it is needless to inquire whence the
                    brothers were led to make it, and how far any part of the credit is due to their
                    predecessors. It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more remarkable than
                    that the fact that a light bag held over a fire would ascend into the air was
                    not discovered till 1783, notwithstanding that men in all ages had seen smoke
                    ascend from fire (though, of course, the fire-balloon does not ascend for
                    exactly the same reason that smoke does). It might be supposed that the
                    connection of the Montgolfiers with a paper manufactory gave them facilities for
                    constructing their experimental balloons of thin paper; and perhaps such was the
                    case, although we can find no evidence of it. With regard to Charles’s
                    substitution of hydrogen gas, there are anticipations that must be noticed. As
                    early as 1766 Cavendish showed that this gas was at least seven times lighter
                    than ordinary air, and it immediately occurred to Dr Black, of Edinburgh, well
                    known as the discoverer of latent heat, that a thin bag filled with hydrogen gas
                    would rise to the ceiling of a room. He provided, accordingly, the allantois of
                    a calf, with the view of showing at a public lecture such a curious experiment;
                    but for some reason it seems to have failed, and Black did not repeat it, thus
                    allowing a great discovery, almost within his reach, to escape him. Several
                    years afterwards a similar idea occurred to Tiberius Cavallo, who found that
                    bladders, even when carefully scraped, are too heavy, and that China paper is
                    permeable to the gas. But in 1782, the year before the invention of the
                    Montgolfiers, he succeeded in elevating soap-bubbles by inflating them with
                    hydrogen gas. The discovery of fire-balloons might have taken place almost at
                    any time in the world’s history, but the substitution of hydrogen gas for heated
                    air could not have been made previously to the latter half of the last century;
                    and although all the honour of an independent discovery belongs to the
                    Montgolfiers, Charles, by his substitution of “inflammable air” for heated air,
                    merely showed himself acquainted with the state of chemical science of his day.
                    Charles never again ascended after his double expedition on the 1st of December
                    1783.</p>
                <p>We now return to the history of aerial navigation, and commence with an account
                    of the first ascents of balloons in this country. Although the news of the
                    Annonay and subsequent experiments in France rapidly spread all over Europe, and
                    formed a topic of general discussion, still it was not till five months after
                    the Montgolfiers had first publicly sent a balloon into the air that any
                    aerostatic experiment was made in England. In November 1783 Count Zambeccari, an
                    Italian, who happened to be in London, made a balloon of oil-silk, 10 feet in
                    diameter, and weighing 11 lb. It was publicly shown for several days, and on the
                    25th it was three-quarters filled with hydrogen gas, and launched from the
                    Artillery ground at one o’clock. It descended after two hours and a half near
                    Petworth, in Sussex, 48 miles from London. This was the first balloon that
                    ascended from English ground. On February 22, 1784, a hydrogen gas balloon, 5
                    feet in diameter, was let up from Sandwich, in Kent, and descended at Warneton,
                    in French Flanders, 75 miles distance. This was the first balloon that crossed
                    the Channel. The difficulties and dangers of aerial navigation having been
                    surmounted by the end of the year <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n207/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0207-0190"/> 1783, the ascents of balloons were now multiplied
                    in all quarters. It will therefore be sufficient to notice very briefly only the
                    more remarkable of the succeeding ascents.</p>
                <p>The Chevalier Paul Andreani, of Milan, constructed a fireballoon 68 feet in
                    diameter, and on February 25, 1784, ascended from Milan with two brothers of the
                    name of Gerli, and remained in the air for about twenty minutes. This is usually
                    regarded as the first ascent in Italy (but see Monck Mason’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeronautica,</hi> p. 247). Andreani ascended again on March 13, with two other
                    persons.</p>
                <p>On the 2d of March Μ. Jean Pierre Blanchard, who had been for some years before
                    occupied with projects for flying, made his first voyage from Paris in a balloon
                    27 feet in diameter, and descended at Billancourt, near Sévres. Just as the
                    balloon was about to ascend, a young man jumped into the car, and, drawing his
                    sword, declared his determination to ascend with Blanchard. He was ultimately
                    removed by force. The episode is worth noting, as it has sometimes been stated
                    that the young man was Napoleon Bonaparte, but this is untrue; his name was
                    Dupont de Chambon. Blanchard made subsequently, it is said, more than thirty
                    aerial voyages, and he is one of the most celebrated of the earlier aeronauts.
                    He also crossed the English Channel, as noticed further on.</p>
                <p>On July 15, 1784, the Duc de Chartres and the two brothers Robert ascended from
                    St Cloud; but the neck of the balloon becoming choked up with an interior
                    balloon filled with common air, intended to regulate the ascending and
                    descending power, they were obliged to make a hole in the balloon, in order to
                    allow of the escape of the gas, but they descended in safety.</p>
                <p>The first person who rose into the air from British ground appears to have been
                    Mr J. Tytler,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Tytler
                    contributed largely to, and, indeed, appears to have been virtually editor Of,
                    the second edition (1778-83) of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Britannica.</hi></p></note> who ascended from the Comely Gardens,
                    Edinburgh, on August 27, in a fire-balloon of his own construction. He descended
                    on the road to Restalrig, about half-a-mile from the place where he rose. A
                    brief account appeared in a letter, under date August 27, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">London Chronicle,</hi> and we have seen a picture of the balloon
                    copied in some journal from a “ticket in the British Museum.” Mr Tytler’s claims
                    were for a long time entirely overlooked, the honour being invariably assigned
                    to Lunardi, till attention was called to them by Mr Monck Mason in 1838. After
                    Lunardi’s successful ascents in 1785, Mr Tytler addressed a set of verses to him
                    (quoted in <hi rend="italic">Astra</hi><hi rend="italic">Castra,</hi> p. 108),
                    in a note, to which he gives a modest account of his own “misfortunes,”
                    describing his two “leaps.” This is, perhaps, the most correct name for them, as
                    his apparatus having been damaged at different times, he merely heated the air
                    in the balloon, and went up without any furnace, being seated in an ordinary
                    basket for carrying earthenware. He reached a height of from 350 to 500
                    feet.</p>
                <p>Although by a few days Tytler has the precedence, still his attempts and partial
                    success were all but totally unknown; whereas Lunardi’s experiments excited an
                    enormous amount of enthusiasm in London, and it was he that practically
                    introduced aerostation into this country in the face of very great
                    disadvantages. We have already referred to the extraordinary apathy displayed in
                    England with regard to aerostatic experiments, one consequence of which was that
                    their introduction was due to a foreigner. Vincent Lunardi was secretary to
                    Prince Caramanico, the Neapolitan ambassador, and his published letters to his
                    guardian, the Chevalier Compagni, written while he was carrying out his project,
                    and detailing all the difficulties, &amp;c., he met with as they occurred, are
                    very interesting, and give a vivid account of the whole matter. His balloon was
                    33</p>
                <p>feet in circumference, and was exposed to the public view at the Lyceum in the
                    Strand, where it was visited by upwards of 20,000 people. It was his original
                    intention to have ascended from Chelsea Hospital, but the conduct of a crowd at
                    a garden at Chelsea, which destroyed the fire-balloon of a Frenchman named De
                    Moret, who announced an ascent on August 11, but was unable to keep his word,
                    led to the withdrawal of the leave that had been granted. Ultimately, after some
                    difficulties had been arranged, he was permitted to ascend from the Artil-lery
                    ground, and on September 15, 1784, the inflation with hydrogen gas took place.
                    It was intended that Mr Biggin, an English gentleman, should accompany Lunardi;
                    but the crowd becoming impatient, the latter judged it prudent to ascend with
                    the balloon only partially full rather than risk a longer delay, and accordingly
                    Mr Biggin was obliged to leave the car. Lunardi therefore ascended alone, in
                    presence of the Prince of Wales and an enormous crowd of spectators. He took up
                    with him a pigeon, a dog, and a cat, and the balloon was provided with oars, by
                    means of which he hoped to raise or lower it at pleasure. Shortly after
                    starting, the pigeon escaped, and one of the oars became broken and fell to the
                    ground. In about an hour and a half he descended at South Mimms, in
                    Hertfordshire, and landed the cat, which had suffered from the cold: he then
                    ascended again, and descended, after the lapse of about three-quarters of an
                    hour, at Standon, near Ware, where he had great difficulty in inducing the
                    peasants to come to his assistance; but at length a young woman, taking hold of
                    one of the cords, urged the men to follow her example, which they then did. The
                    excitement caused by this ascent was immense, and Lunardi at once became the
                    star of the hour. He was presented to the king, and was courted and flattered on
                    all sides. To show the enthusiasm displayed by the people during his ascent, he
                    tells himself, in his sixth letter, how a lady, mistaking the oar which fell for
                    himself, was so affected by his supposed destruction that she died in a few
                    days; but, on the other hand, he says he was told by the judges “that he had
                    certainly saved the life of a young man who might possibly be reformed, and be
                    to the public a compensation for the death of the lady;” for the jury were
                    deliberating on the fate of a criminal, whom they must ultimately have
                    condemned, when the balloon appeared, and every one became inattentive, and to
                    save time they gave a verdict of acquittal, and the whole court came out to view
                    the balloon. The king also was in conference with his ministers; but on hearing
                    that the balloon was passing, he broke up the discussion, remarking that they
                    might resume their deliberations, but that perhaps they might not see Lunardi
                    again; upon which he, Mr Pitt, and the other ministers viewed the balloon
                    through telescopes. The balloon was afterwards exhibited in the Pantheon. In the
                    latter part of the following year (1785) Lunardi made several very successful
                    ascents from Kelso, Edinburgh, and Glasgow (in one of which he traversed a
                    distance of 110 miles): these he has described in a second series of letters. He
                    subsequently returned to Italy, where we believe he still followed the practice
                    of aerostation, and made many ascents. He died on July 31, 1806, at Lisbon,
                    according to the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman’s Magazine,</hi> but a contemporary
                    newspaper gives Genoa as the place, and adds that he died in a state of very
                    great indigence.</p>
                <p>Lunardi’s example was soon followed by others, and on October 16, 1784, Blanchard
                    ascended from Little Chelsea with Mr Sheldon, and having deposited the latter at
                    Sunbury, rose again alone, and descended at Romney Marshes. On November 12, Mr
                    James Sadler, sen., ascended from Oxford, and there is every reason to believe
                    that he made a previous ascent from the same place on October 12, four <pb

                    274, where it is stated that he attempted to ascend in a fireballoon on
                    September 12, but that the balloon was burnt), On November 30, 1784, Blanchard
                    again ascended, accompanied this time by Dr J. Jeffries, an American physician.
                    On January 4, 1785, Mr Harper ascended from Birmingham; and on January 7,
                    Blanchard and Dr Jeffries achieved the feat of crossing the Channel from Dover
                    to Calais. At seven minutes past one the balloon left Dover Castle, and in their
                    passage they had a most magnificent view of both shores. When about one-third
                    across they found themselves descending, and threw out every available thing
                    from the boat or car. When about three-quarters across they were descending
                    again, and had to throw out not only the anchor and cords, but also to strip and
                    throw away part of their clothing, after which they found they were rising, and
                    their last resource, viz., to cut away the car, was rendered unnecessary. As
                    they approached the shore the balloon rose, describing a magnificent arch high
                    over the land. They descended in the forest of Guinnes.</p>
                <p>On March 23, 1785, Count Zambeccari, who had, as we have seen, launched the first
                    balloon from English ground, ascended for the first time with Admiral Vernon
                    from London. Shortly afterwards he returned to his own country, and there
                    applied himself assiduously to the practice of aerial navigation. He twice, in
                    1803 and 1804, descended into the Adriatic, and both times only escaped after
                    undergoing much danger. Descending in a fireballoon on September 21, 1812, after
                    a voyage from Bologna, the shock of the grapnel catching in a tree caused the
                    balloon to catch fire; and to save themselves from being burnt, Zambeccari and
                    his companion, Signor Bonaga, leaped from the car. The former was killed on the
                    spot, but the latter, though fearfully injured, escaped with his life.</p>
                <p>On June 15, 1785, Pilâtre de Rozier made his last fatal voyage from Boulogne. It
                    was his intention to have repeated the exploit of Blanchard and Jeffries in the
                    reverse direction, and have crossed from Boulogne to England. For this purpose
                    he had contrived a double balloon, which he expected would combine the
                    advantages of both kinds—a fire-balloon, 10 feet in diameter, being placed
                    underneath a gas-balloon of 37 feet in diameter, so that by increasing or
                    diminishing the fire in the former it might be possible to ascend or descend
                    without waste of gas. Rozier was accompanied by M. P. A. Romain, and for rather
                    less than half-an-hour after the aerostat ascended all seemed to be going on
                    well, when suddenly the whole apparatus was seen in flames, and the unfortunate
                    adventurers came to the ground from the supposed height of more than 3000 feet.
                    Rozier was killed on the spot, and Romain only survived about ten minutes. A
                    monument was erected on the place where they fell, which was near the sea-shore,
                    about four miles from the starting-point. The Marquis de la Maisonfort had
                    accompanied Rozier to Boulogne, intending to ascend with him, but Μ. Romain
                    there insisted on a prior promise. Either the upper balloon must have been
                    reached by the flames, and the gas taken fire, or the gas must have poured down
                    into the lower balloon, and so have caused the explosion.</p>
                <p>We must not omit to mention that on June 4, 1784, Madame" Thible ascended from
                    Lyons in a fire-balloon with Μ. Fleurand, in the presence of King Gustavus of
                    Sweden, then travelling under the name of Count Haga. Madame Thible is very
                    likely the only woman who ever ascended in a fire-balloon. The first
                    Englishwoman who ever ascended into the air was Mrs Sage, who accompanied Mr
                    Biggin in his voyage from London on June 29, 1785.</p>
                <p>Accounts are given of an ascent at Constantinople, made in the presence of the
                    Sultan, by a Persian physician, accompanied by two Bostangis, early in the year
                    1786, who, crossing the sea which divides Europe from Asia, descended about 30
                    leagues from the coast.</p>
                <p>We have now given a brief account of all the noteworthy voyages that took place
                    within the first two or three years after the discovery of the balloon by
                    Montgolfier. Ascents were multiplied from this time onwards, and it is
                    impossible to give even a list of the many hundreds that have taken place since:
                    this omission is, however, of slight importance, as henceforth the balloon
                    became little better than a toy, let up to amuse people at <hi rend="italic"
                    >fêtes</hi> or other public occasions. When the first ascents were made in
                    France, the glow of national vanity was lighted up, and the most brilliant
                    expectations were felt with regard to aerostation, and the glory to the nation
                    that would accrue therefrom. These anticipations have not been realised, and the
                    balloon at this moment has received no great improvement since the time of
                    Charles, except the substitution of ordinary coal-gas for hydrogen, which has
                    rendered the inflation of a balloon at any gas-works a comparatively simple
                    matter, bearing in mind the elaborate contrivances required for the generation
                    of hydrogen in sufficient quantities. But in one respect the balloon has been of
                    real service, viz., to science, in rendering the attainment of observations in
                    the higher strata of the atmosphere not only possible but practicable. In regard
                    to such matters the balloon is unique, as the atmosphere is the great laboratory
                    of nature, in which are produced all the phenomena of weather, the results of
                    which we perceive on the earth; and no observations made on mountain-sides can
                    take the place of those made in the balloon, as what is required is the
                    knowledge of the state of the upper atmosphere itself, free from the disturbing
                    effects of the contiguity of the land. Although, therefore, in what follows, we
                    shall notice any particularly remarkable ascents, we shall chiefly confine
                    ourselves to the few that have been undertaken for the sake of advancing
                    science, and which alone are of permanent value. It will be necessary to make
                    one exception to this rule, however, in the case of the parachute, the
                    experiments with which require some notice, although they have been put to no
                    useful purpose. The balloon has also been used in warfare as a means of
                    observing the movements of the enemy; and the applications of it to this purpose
                    deserve notice, although we think not so much use has been made of the balloon
                    in this direction as might have been.</p>
                <p>The substitution of coal-gas for hydrogen is due to Mr Charles Green, the veteran
                    aeronaut, who made several hundred ascents, the first of which took place on
                    July 19, 1821, the coronation day of George IV. In this ascent ordinary coal-gas
                    was first used; and every balloon, with very few exceptions, that has ascended
                    since this date has been so inflated. Pall Mall was first lighted by gas in
                    1807, and at the end of 1814 the general lighting of London by gas commenced; so
                    that coal-gas could not have been available for filling balloons long before it
                    was actually used.</p>
                <p>Leaving out of consideration the ascents undertaken for scientific objects (very
                    many of which were remarkable for the height attained or the distance traversed,
                    and which will be specially noticed further on), we proceed to mention the most
                    noteworthy ascents that have taken place and that have not ended fatally (these
                    latter will be referred to separately). Mr Crosbie, a gentleman who was the
                    first to ascend from Ireland (January 19, 1785), on the 19th July 1785 attempted
                    to cross St George’s Channel to England, but fell into the sea; he was saved by
                    some vessels that came to his rescue. Lunardi also fell into the sea, about a
                    mile and a half from the shore, after an ascent from Edinburgh in December 1785;
                    he was rescued by a fishing-boat. Richard Maguire was the second person <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n209/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0209-0192"/> who ascended from Ireland. Mr Crosbie had
                    inflated his balloon on May 12, 1785, but it was unable to take him up, when Mr
                    Maguire, a student at the university, who was present, offered to ascend. His
                    offer was accepted, and he made the ascent. For this he was knighted by the
                    Lord-Lieutenant (Monck Mason, p. 266). On July 22, 1785, Major Money ascended
                    from Norwich. The balloon was blown out to sea, and he was obliged to descend
                    into the water. After remaining there seven hours he was rescued by a revenue
                    cutter which had been despatched to his assistance. Mr James Sadler attempted to
                    cross St George’s Channel on the 1st of October 1812, and had nearly succeeded,
                    when, in consequence of a change in the wind, he was forced to descend into the
                    sea off Liverpool. After remaining in the water some time, he was rescued by a
                    fishing-boat. But on July22, 1817, Mr Windham Sadler, his second son, succeeded
                    in crossing the Channel from Dublin to Holyhead. On May 24, 1837, Mr Sneath
                    ascended from near Mansfield in a fire-balloon, and descended safely. At
                    half-past one o’clock on November 7, 1836, Mr Robert Hollond, Mr Monck Mason,
                    and Mr Charles Green ascended from Vauxhall Gardens, and descended at about two
                    leagues from Weilburg, in the duchy of Nassau, at half-past seven the next
                    morning, having thus traversed a distance of about 500 miles in 18 hours; Liége
                    was passed in the course of the night, and Coblentz in the early morning. A full
                    account of this trip is given by Mr Monck Mason in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeronautica</hi> (1838). The balloon in which the journey was performed (a very
                    large one, containing about 85,000 cubic feet of gas), was subsequently called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nassau Balloon,</hi> and under that name became famous,
                    and ascended frequently.</p>
                <p>We ought also, perhaps, to notice a curious ascent made by Mr Green on July 29,
                    1828, from the Eagle Tavern, City Road, on the back of a favourite pony.
                    Underneath the balloon was a platform (in place of a car) containing places for
                    the pony’s feet, and some straps went loosely under his body, to prevent his
                    lying down or moving about. Everything passed off satisfactorily, the balloon
                    descending safely at Beckenham; the pony showed no alarm, but quietly ate some
                    beans with which its rider supplied it in the air. Equestrian ascents have since
                    been repeated. In 1852, Madame Poitevin, who had made several such journeys in
                    Paris, ascended from Cremorne Gardens, London, on horseback (as “Europa on a
                    bull”); but after the first journey its repetition was stopped in England by
                    application to the police courts, as the exhibition outraged public feeling.
                    Lieutenant Gale was killed at Bordeaux on Sept. 8, 1850, in descending after an
                    equestrian ascent, through mismanagement in landing of the horse. M. Poitevin,
                    descending in 1858, after an equestrian ascent from Paris, was nearly drowned in
                    the sea near Malaga. Among remarkable balloon ascents must also be noticed that
                    of Mr Wise, from St Louis, on June 23, 1859, in which a distance of 1120 miles
                    was traversed.</p>
                <p>In 1863, Nadar, a well-known photographer at Paris, constructed an enormous
                    balloon, which he called “Le Géant.” It was the largest gas-balloon ever
                    constructed, containing over 200,000 cubic feet of gas. Underneath it was placed
                    a smaller balloon, called a compensator, the object of which was to prevent loss
                    of gas during the voyage. The car had two stories, and was, in fact, a model of
                    a cottage in wicker-work, 8 feet in height by 13 feet in length, containing a
                    small printing-office, a photographic department, a refreshment-room, a
                    lavatory, &amp;c. The first ascent took place at five o’clock on Sunday, October
                    4, 1863, from the Champ de Mars. There were thirteen persons in the car,
                    including one lady, the Princess de la Tour d’ Auvergne, and the two aeronauts
                    Louis and Jules Godard. In spite of the elaborate preparations that had been
                    made and the stores of provisions that were taken up, the balloon descended at
                    nine o’clock, at Meaux, the early descent being rendered necessary, it was said,
                    by an accident to the valve∙line. A second ascent was made a fortnight later
                    viz., on October 18; there were nine passengers, including Madame Nadar. The
                    balloon descended at the expiration of seventeen hours, near Nienburg in
                    Hanover, a distance of about 400 miles. A strong wind was blowing, and the
                    balloon was dragged over the ground a distance of 7 or 8 miles. All the
                    passengers were bruised, and some more seriously hurt. The balloon and car were
                    then brought to England, and exhibited for some time at the Crystal Palace at
                    the end of 1863 and beginning of 1864. The two ascents of Nadar’s balloon
                    excited an extraordinary amount of enthusiasm and interest, vastly out of
                    proportion to what they were entitled to. The balloon was larger than any of the
                    same kind that had previously ascended; but this was scarcely more than just
                    appreciable to the eye, as the doubling the contents of a balloon makes
                    comparatively slight addition to its diameter. M. Nadar’s idea was to obtain
                    sufficient money, by the exhibition of his balloon, to carry out a plan of
                    aerial locomotion he had conceived possible by means of the principle of the
                    screw; in fact, he spoke of “Le Géant” as “the last balloon.” He also started L'
                    <hi rend="italic">Aeronaute,</hi> a newspaper devoted to aerostation, and
                    published a small book, which was translated into English under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">The Right to Fly.</hi> Nadar’s ascents had not the remotest
                    connection with science, although he claimed that they had; nor was his
                    knowledge, as shown in his writings, sufficient to have enabled him to advance
                    it in any way.</p>
                <p>Directly after Nadar’s two balloon ascents, M. Eugene Godard constructed what was
                    perhaps the largest aerial machine that has ever been made. It was a Montgolfier
                    or fire-balloon, of nearly half-a-million cubic feet capacity (more than double
                    the capacity of Nadar’s). The balloon <hi rend="italic">Flesselles,</hi> 1783,
                    is said to have slightly exceeded this size. The air was heated by an 18 feet
                    stove, weighing<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n210/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0210-0193"/>, with the chimney, 980 lb. This furnace was fed
                    by straw; and the “car” consisted of a gallery surrounding it. Two ascents of
                    this balloon were made from Cremorne Gardens, on July 20 and July 28, 1864.
                    After the first journey the balloon descended at Greenwich, and after the second
                    at Walthamstow, where it was injured by being blown against a tree.
                    Notwithstanding the enormous size of the balloon, M. Godard asserted that it
                    could be inflated in half an hour, and the inflation at Cremorne did not occupy
                    more than an hour. The ascent of the balloon was a very striking sight, the
                    flames roaring up the chimney of the furnace into the enormous globe above. The
                    trusses of straw were suspended by ropes from the gallery below the car, and
                    were drawn up and placed in the furnace as required. This was the first
                    fire-balloon seen by the inhabitants of London, and it was the second ascent of
                    this kind that had been made in this country, Mr Sneath’s ascent at Mansfield
                    having been the first, as Mr Tytler’s experiment at Edinburgh in 1784 was a
                    leap, not an ascent, as no source of heat was taken up. In spite of the rapidity
                    with which the inflation was effected, few who saw the ascent could fail to
                    receive an impression most favourable to the gas-balloon in the matter of
                    safety, as a rough descent, with a heated furnace as it were in the car, could
                    not be other than most dangerous.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1873 the proprietors of the New York <hi rend="italic">Daily
                    Graphic,</hi> an illustrated paper, determined to construct a very large
                    balloon, and enable Mr Wise, the well-known American aeronaut, to realise his
                    favourite scheme of crossing the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. It was believed by
                    many that a current from west to east existed constantly at heights above 10,000
                    feet, but this seems very uncertain. Mr Green having stated that he had met with
                    such a current, Mr Glaisher made a point of investigating the directions of the
                    wind at different heights in his ascents, but found that they were as capricious
                    as near the ground. The same result was found by others, and a comparison of the
                    courses of the balloons sent up from Paris during the siege will show that no
                    constant current exists. The American project came to nothing owing to the
                    quality of the material of which the balloon was made. The size was said to be
                    such as to contain 400,000 cubic feet, so that it would lift a weight of 14,000
                    S&gt;. On September 12, 1873, during its inflation, Mr Wise declared the
                    material of which it was made was so bad that he could not ascend in it, though
                    the other two persons who were to accompany him agreed to go. When, however,
                    325,000 feet of gas had been put into the balloon, a rent was observed, and the
                    whole rapidly collapsed. Although this accident was greatly regretted at the
                    time, it seems pretty certain, from what subsequently took place, that the
                    aeronauts would not have succeeded in their object, and a serious mishap was
                    probably avoided. On October 6, 1873, Mr Donaldson and two others ascended from
                    New York in the balloon after it had been repaired, and effected a perilous
                    descent in Connecticut. During the autumn of 1873 a great amount of discussion
                    took place both in England and America about the existence of the westerly
                    current and the subject of aerostation. In September 1873 Mr Barnum, the
                    well-known American showman, visited England with the view of eliciting whether,
                    in the opinion of those best qualified, there was sufficient probability of a
                    successful result to induce him to undertake the construction of a suitable
                    balloon.</p>
                <p>By aeronauts (omitting the pioneers Lunardi, Zambec-cari, and others who have
                    been already spoken of) we mean persons who have followed ballooning as a
                    business or trade. Of these, perhaps the best known and most successful have
                    been Blanchard, Garnerin, tho Sadlers, Mr Charles Green, Mr Wise, Mr Coxwell,
                    and the brothers Godard. Blanchard made, it is said, thirty-six ascents, his
                    first having taken place on March 2, 1784. His wife also made many ascents; she
                    was killed on July 7, 1819. Garnerin is said to have ascended more than fifty
                    times; he introduced night ascents with fireworks, &amp;c., the first of which
                    took place on August 4, 1807. We shall have occasion to refer to him again when
                    we treat of parachutes. Mr James Sadler made about sixty ascents, the first of
                    which took place on October 12, 1784. His two sons, John and Windham, both
                    followed in their father’s steps; the latter was killed in 1817. In the minds of
                    most Englishmen the practice of ballooning will, for a long time, be associated
                    with the name of Mr Charles Green, the most celebrated of English aeronauts,
                    who, having made his first ascent on July 19, 1821, only died in the year 1870,
                    at a very advanced age. He is credited with 526 ascents by Mr Turnor; and from
                    advertisements, &amp;c., we see that in 1838 he had made 249. Mr Green may be
                    said to have reduced ballooning to routine, and he made more ascents than any
                    other person has ever accomplished. He accompanied Mr Welsh in his scientific
                    ascents, and to him is also due the invention of the <hi rend="italic">guide
                    rope,</hi> which he used in many of his voyages with success. It merely
                    consisted of a rope not less than 1000 feet in length, which was attached to the
                    ring of the balloon (from which the car is suspended), and hung down so that the
                    end of it was allowed to trail along the surface of the ground, the object being
                    to prevent the continual waste of gas and ballast that takes place in an
                    ordinary balloon journey, as such an expenditure is otherwise always going on,
                    owing to the necessity of keeping the balloon from getting either too high or
                    too low. If a balloon provided with a guide rope sinks so low that a good deal
                    of the rope rests on the earth, it is relieved of so much weight and rises
                    again; if, on the contrary, it rises so high that but a little is supported by
                    the earth, a greater weight is borne by the balloon, and equilibrium is thus
                    produced. Mr Green frequently used the guide rope, and found that its action was
                    satisfactory, and that it did not, as might be supposed, become entangled in
                    trees, &amp;c. It was used in the Nassau journey, but more recent aeronauts have
                    dispensed with it. Still, in crossing the sea or making a very long journey,
                    where the preservation of the gas was of great importance, it could not fail to
                    be valuable. Mr Green had, in his time, more experience in the management than
                    has fallen to the lot of any one else, and he brought to bear on the subject a
                    great amount of skill and practical knowledge. There is also a plain
                    matter-of-fact style about his accounts of his ascents that contrasts very
                    favourably with the writings of some other aeronauts. Mr Coxwell, who has made
                    several hundred ascents, first ascended in 1844, under the name of Wells. He it
                    was who, as aeronaut, accompanied Mr Glaisher in most of his scientific ascents,
                    1862-65. The Godard family have made very many ascents in France, and are well
                    known in all countries in connection with aeronautics. It was to two of the
                    Godards that the management of the military balloons in the Italian campaign was
                    entrusted; it was M. Jules Godard who succeeded in opening the valve in the
                    dangerous descent of Nadar’s balloon in Hanover in 1863, and it was Eugene
                    Godard who constructed perhaps the largest Montgolfier ever made, an account of
                    the ascensions of which has been given above. M. Dupuis Delcourt was also a
                    well-known aeronaut; he has written on the subject of aerostation, and his
                    balloons were employed by MM. Bixio and Barral in their scientific ascents. In
                    America Mr Wise is <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> the aeronaut; he has
                    made several hundred ascents, and many of them are distinguished for much skill
                    and daring. He also appears to have pursued his profession with more energy and
                    capacity than has any other aeronaut in recent times, and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi><pb break="no"

                    possess much higher scientific attainments than balloonists usually have. In
                    fact, Mr Wise stands alone in this respect, as nearly all professional aeronauts
                    are destitute of scientific knowledge.</p>
                <p>The number of fatal accidents that have occurred in the history of balloons is
                    not very great, and nearly all have resulted either from the use of the
                    fire-balloon, or from want of knowledge, or carelessness on the part of the
                    aeronauts themselves. We have already referred to the accidents that closed the
                    careers of Pilâtre de Rozier and Zambeccari. On November 25, 1802, Signor
                    Olivari, at Orleans, and on July 17, 1812, Herr Bittorff, at Mannheim, perished
                    in consequence of the accidental combustion of their <hi rend="italic"
                    >Montgolfiéres.</hi> On April 7, 1806, Μ. Mosment ascended from Lille upon a
                    platform, from which he accidentally fell and was killed. On July 7, 1819,
                    Madame Blanchard ascended from Paris at night with fireworks attached to the
                    car, a spark from one of which ignited the gas in the balloon, and she was
                    precipitated to the ground and killed. Lieut. Harris ascended from London on May
                    25, 1824, but, through mismanagement of the valve-line, he allowed all the gas
                    to escape suddenly from the balloon, which descended with terrible velocity. He
                    was killed by the fall, but his companion, Miss Stocks, escaped almost
                    uninjured. In an ascent from Blackburn on September 29, 1824, by Mr Windham
                    Sadler, the balloon, in rising, struck against a chimney, and the aeronaut fell
                    over the side of the car and was killed. On July 24, 1837, Mr Cocking descended
                    from a balloon in a parachute, which struck the ground with such violence that
                    he was killed on the spot. In descending with a horse on September 8, 1850,
                    Lieut. Gale was killed; and in 1863 Mr Chambers was killed at Nottingham, his
                    death arising from suffocation by the gas that poured out at the neck of the
                    balloon, which was not separated from the car by a sufficient interval.</p>
                <p>The number of accidents that have occurred bears but a very small proportion to
                    the number of successful ascents that have been made. Mr Monck Mason, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeronautica,</hi> gives a list of the names, with the dates and
                    places of their ascent, of all persons who, as far as he could find, had
                    ascended previously to 1838. His list contains 471 names, which are distributed
                    among the inhabitants of the different countries as follows:—England, 313;
                    France, 104; Italy, 18; Germany and the German States, 17; Turkey, 5; Prussia,
                    3; Russia, 2; Poland, 2; Hungary, 2, Denmark, 1; Switzerland, 1; and the United
                    States, 3. Among these are the names of 49 women, of whom 28 are English, 17
                    French, 3 German, and 1 Italian. Some of the persons had ascended a great number
                    of times; thus Mr Charles Green’s ascents alone amounted to more than 249; and
                    those of the members of the same family to 535. Mr Mason calculated that the
                    whole number of ascents executed by Englishmen was 752. Of the 471 adventurers
                    only nine were killed, and of these six owed their fate to the dangers attendant
                    on the use of the fire-balloon, and one to bravado. The great number of our own
                    countrymen that appear in the above list is no doubt partially due to the fact
                    that it was compiled by an Englishman, to whom English newspapers and other
                    records were more accessible; still there is no reason to doubt that a much
                    greater number of Englishmen have ascended than inhabitants of any other
                    country, as balloons as an amusement at fêtes, &amp;c., have been more common
                    here. The number of Englishmen who have ascended might now be estimated at from
                    1500 to 2000.</p>
                <p>We can call to mind but three fatal casualties that have taken place since Mr
                    Mason compiled his list, viz., Mr Cocking’s parachute accident, Mr Gale’s death
                    in 1850, and Mr Chambers’ death in 1863.</p>
                <p>We come now to an account of the use to which the balloon has been applied for
                    the advancement of science. The ascents that have been made are by Sacharof,
                    Biot, and Gay-Lussac in 1804, by Bixio and Barral in 1850, by Mr Welsh in 1852,
                    by Mr Glaisher in 1862-66, and MM. Flammarion and De Fonvielle in 1867-68. We
                    shall give a brief account of these ascents, because, as has been remarked, with
                    a few exceptions, they form the only useful purpose to which the balloon has
                    been applied. The general description of the phenomena, &amp;c., met with in a
                    high ascent, and the general results found, are referred to in the account of Mr
                    Glaisher’s experiments, as not only are his accounts more detailed, but the
                    number of ascents made by him is much in excess of that of all the others put
                    together.</p>
                <p>The Academy of Sciences at St Petersburg, entertaining the opinion that the
                    experiments made on mountain-sides by De Luc, De Saussure, Humboldt, and others
                    must give results different from those made in free air at the same heights,
                    resolved in 1803 that a balloon ascent should be made for the purpose of making
                    scientific researches. Accorddingly, on January 30, 1804, Μ. Sacharof, a member
                    of the academy, ascended, with Μ. Robertson as aeronaut, in a balloon belonging
                    to the latter, which was inflated with hydrogen gas. The ascent was made at a
                    quarter past seven, and the descent effected at a quarter to eleven. No great
                    height was reached, as the barometer never sank below 23 in., corresponding to
                    less than 1½ mile. The experiments were not very systematically made, and the
                    chief results were the filling and bringing down several flasks of air collected
                    at different elevations, and the supposed observation that the magnetic dip was
                    altered. A telescope was fixed in the bottom of the car pointing vertically
                    downwards, so that the travellers might be able to ascertain exactly the spot
                    over which they were floating at any moment. Μ. Sacharof found that, on shouting
                    downwards through his speaking-trumpet, the echo from the earth was quite
                    distinct, and at his height was audible after an interval of about ten seconds.
                    Μ. Sacharof’s account is given in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Magazine</hi> (Tilloch’s), vol. xxi. pp. 193-200 (1805).</p>
                <p>At the commencement of 1804 Laplace proposed to the members of the French Academy
                    of Sciences that balloons should be employed for the purpose of solving certain
                    physical problems, adding that, as the government had placed funds at their
                    disposal for the prosecution of useful experiments, he thought they might be
                    well applied to this kind of research. The proposition was supported by Chaptai
                    the chemist, who was then minister of the interior, and accordingly the
                    necessary arrangements were speedily effected, the charge of the experiments
                    being given to MM. Gay-Lussac and Biot.</p>
                <p>The principal object of this ascent was to determine if the magnetic force
                    experienced any appreciable diminution at heights above the earth’s surface, De
                    Saussure having found that such was the case upon the Col du Géant. On August
                    24, 1804, MM. Gay-Lussac and Biot (the former eminent as a chemist and the
                    latter as a natural philosopher) ascended from the Conservatoire des Arts at ten
                    o’clock in the morning. Their magnetic experiments were incommoded by the
                    rotation of the balloon, but they found that, up to the height of 13,000 feet,
                    the time of vibration of a magnet was appreciably the same as on the earth’s
                    surface. They found also that the air became drier as they ascended. The height
                    reached was about 13,000 feet, and the temperature declined from 63° Fahr. to
                    51°. The descent was effected about half-past one, at Meriville, 18 leagues from
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>In a second experiment, which was made on September 16, 1804, Μ. Gay-Lussac
                    ascended alone. The balloon left the Conservatoire des Arts at 9.40 A.M., and
                    descended at 3.45 P.M. between Rouen and Dieppe. The chief result obtained was
                    that the magnetic force, like gravitation, did <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n212/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0212-0195"/> not experience any sensible variation at heights
                    from the earth’s surface which we can attain to. Gay-Lussac also brought down
                    air collected at the height of nearly 23,000 feet, and on analysis it appeared
                    that its constitution was the same as that of air collected at the earth’s
                    surface. At the time of leaving the earth the thermometer stood at 82° Fahr.,
                    and at the highest point reached (23,000 feet) it was 14° ∙9 Fahr. Gay-Lussac
                    remarked that at his highest point there were still clouds above him.</p>
                <p>From 1804 to 1850 there is no record of any scientific ascents in balloons having
                    been undertaken. In the latter year MM. Bixio and Barral made two ascents for
                    this purpose. They ascended from the Paris Observatory on June 29, 1850, at
                    10.27 A.M., the balloon being inflated with hydrogen gas. The day was a rough
                    one, and the ascent took place suddenly, without any previous attempt having
                    been made to test the ascensional force of the balloon. When liberated, it rose
                    with great rapidity, and becoming fully inflated it pressed upon the network,
                    bulging out at the top and bottom. As the ropes by which the car was suspended
                    were too short, the balloon soon covered the travellers like an immense hood. In
                    endeavouring to secure the valve-rope, a rent was made in the balloon, and the
                    gas escaped so close to the faces of the voyagers as almost to suffocate them.
                    Finding that they were descending then too rapidly, they threw overboard
                    everything available, including their coats, and only excepting the instruments.
                    The ground was reached at 10h. 45m., near Lagny. Of course no observations were
                    made.</p>
                <p>MM. Bixio and Barral determined to ascend again without delay, and accordingly,
                    on July 27, 1850, they repeated the experiment. The ascent was remarkable on
                    account of the extreme cold met with. At about 20,000 feet the temperature was
                    15° Fahr., the balloon being enveloped in cloud; but on emerging from the cloud,
                    at 23,000 feet, the temperature sank to - 38° Fahr., no less than 53° Fahr.
                    below that experienced by Gay-Lussac at the same elevation. The existence of
                    these very cold clouds served to explain certain meteorological phenomena that
                    were observed on the earth both the day before and the day after the ascent.
                    Some pigeons were taken up in this, as in most other high ascents, and
                    liberated; they showed a reluctance to leave the car, and then fell heavily
                    downwards.</p>
                <p>In July 1852 the committee of the Kew Observatory resolved to institute a series
                    of balloon ascents, with the view of investigating such meteorological and
                    physical phenomena as require the presence of an observer at a great height in
                    the atmosphere. Mr Welsh, of the Kew Observatory, was the observer, and Mr
                    Green’s great Nassau balloon was employed, Mr Green himself being the aeronaut.
                    Four ascents were made in 1852, viz., on August 17, August 26, October 31, and
                    November 10, when the respective heights of 19,510, 19,100, 12,640, and 22,930
                    feet were attained. A siphon barometer, dry and wet bulb thermometers, aspirated
                    and free, and a Regnault’s hygrometer were taken up. Some air collected at a
                    considerable height was found on analysis not to differ appreciably in its
                    composition from air collected near the ground. The original observations are

                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1853, pp. 311-346. The lowest
                    temperatures met with in the four ascents were respectively 8° ∙7 Fahr. (19,380
                    feet); 12° ∙4 Fahr. (18,370); 16° ∙4 Fahr. (12,640); — 10 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > o∙</hi> 5 Fahr. (22,370); the decline of temperature being very regular.</p>
                <p>At the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science held at
                    Aberdeen in 1859, a committee was appointed for the purpose of making
                    observations in the higher strata of the atmosphere by means of the balloon. For
                    the first two years nothing was effected, owing to the want both of an observer
                    and of a suitable balloon. In 1861, at Manchester, the committee was
                    reappointed, and it then consisted of Colonel Sykes (chairman), Mr Airy, Sir
                    David Brewster, Mr Fairbairn, Admiral Fitzroy, Mr Gassiot, Mr James Glaisher,
                    Sir J. Herschel, Dr Lee, Dr Lloyd, Dr W. A. Miller, Dr Robinson, and Dr Tyndall.
                    Some unsuccessful experiments were made with a balloon of Mr Green’s, and also
                    with one hired from the proprietors of Cremorne Gardens, which turned out to be
                    in a hopelessly leaky condition; the trained observers also, on whom the
                    committee had relied, failed to perform their duties. In this state of affairs,
                    Mr Coxwell, an aeronaut who had made a good many ascents, was communicated with,
                    and he agreed to construct a new balloon, of 90,000 cubic feet capacity, on the
                    condition that the committee would undertake to use it, and pay £25 for each
                    high ascent made especially for the committee, the latter defraying also the
                    cost of gas, &amp;c., so that the expense of each high ascent amounted to nearly
                    £50. An observer being still wanted, Mr Glaisher, a member of the committee,
                    offered himself to take the observations, and accordingly the first ascent was
                    made on July 17,1862, from the gas-works at Wolverhampton, this town being
                    chosen on account of its central position in the country. Altogether, Mr
                    Glaisher made twenty-eight ascents, the last having taken place on May 26, 1866.
                    Of these only seven were specially high ascents, although six others were
                    undertaken for the objects of the committee alone. On the other occasions Mr
                    Glaisher availed himself of public ascents from the Crystal Palace and other
                    places of entertainment, merely taking his place like the other passengers. In
                    the last six ascents another aeronaut, Mr Orton, and a smaller balloon, were
                    employed. The dates, places of ascent, and greatest heights (in feet) attained
                    in the twenty-eight ascents were—1862: July 17, Wolverhampton, 26,177; July 30,
                    Crystal Palace, 6937; August 18, Wolverhampton, 23,377; August 20, Crystal
                    Palace, 5900; August 21, Hendon, 14,355; September 1, Crystal Palace, 4190;
                    September 5, Wolverhampton, 37,000; September 8, Crystal Palace, 5428. 1863;
                    March 31, Crystal Palace, 22,884; April 18, Crystal Palace, 24,163; June 26,
                    Wolverton, 23,200; July 11, Crystal Palace, 6623; July 21, Crystal Palace, 3298;
                    August 31, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 8033; September 29, Wolverhampton, 16,590;
                    October 9, Crystal Palace, 7310. 1864: January 12, Woolwich, 11,897; April 6,
                    Woolwich, 11,075; June 13, Crystal Palace, 3543; June 20, Derby, 4280; June 27,
                    Crystal Palace, 4898; August 29, Crystal Palace, 14,581; December 1, Woolwich,
                    5431; December 30, Woolwich, 3735. 1865: February 27, Woolwich, 4865; October 2,
                    Woolwich, 1949; December 2, Woolwich, 4628. 1866: May 26, Windsor, 6325. Of
                    these, all the ascents from Wolverhampton (four in number) and from Woolwich
                    (seven in number) were undertaken wholly for the committee, and Mr Glaisher was
                    merely accompanied by the aeronaut, whose business it was to manage th( balloon.
                    The expense of the special high ascents (about £50 for each, as stated above)
                    rendered it desirable, when possible, to take advantage of the desire felt by
                    many to accompany Mr Glaisher in his journey, and admit one or two other
                    travellers; and of this kind were one or two of the ascents from the Crystal
                    Palace, though the majority, in which the elevation attained frequently fell
                    short of a mile, were the ordinary public ascents advertised beforehand. It is
                    not possible here to give any complete account of the results obtained, and it
                    would be superfluous, as the observations, both as made and after reduction, are
                    printed in the <hi rend="italic">British Association Reports,</hi> 1862-66. It
                    will be enough, after explaining the objects of the experiments, &amp;c., to
                    describe briefly one or two of the most remarkable ascents, and then state the
                    kind of conclusions that follow from them as a whole.</p>

                <p>The primary object was to determine the temperature of the air, and its
                    hygrometrical state at different elevations to as great a height as could be
                    reached; and the secondary objects were—(1) to determine the temperature of the
                    dewpoint by Daniell’s and Regnault’s hygrometers, as well as by the dry and wet
                    bulb thermometers, and to compare the results; (2) to compare the readings of an
                    aneroid barometer with those of a mercurial barometer up to the height of 5
                    miles; (3) to determine the electrical state of the air, (4) the oxygenic
                    condition of the atmosphere, and (5) the time of vibration of a magnet; (6) to
                    collect air at different elevations; (7) to note the height and kind of clouds,
                    their density and thickness; (8) to determine the rate and direction of
                    different currents in the atmosphere; and (9) to make observations on sound.</p>
                <p>The instruments used were mercurial and aneroid barometers, dry and wet bulb
                    thermometers, Daniell’s dewpoint hygrometer, Regnault’s condensing hygrometer,
                    maximum and minimum thermometers, a magnet for horizontal vibration,
                    hermetically sealed glass tubes exhausted of air, and an electrometer. In one or
                    two of the ascents a camera was taken up.</p>
                <p>One end of the car was occupied by the aeronaut; near the other, in front of Mr
                    Glaisher, was placed a board or table, the extremities of which rested on the
                    sides of the car; upon this board was placed suitable framework to carry the
                    several thermometers, hygrometers, magnet, aneroid barometer, &amp;c.; a
                    perforation through it admitted the lower branch of the mercurial barometer to
                    descend below, leaving the upper branch at a convenient height for observing. A
                    watch was placed directly opposite to Mr Glaisher, the central space being
                    occupied by his notebook. The aspirator (for Regnault’s hygrometer) was fixed
                    underneath the centre of the board, so as to be conveniently workable by either
                    feet or hands. Holes were cut in the board to admit the passage of the flexible
                    tubes required for Regnault’s hygrometer and the dry and wet bulb
                    thermometers.</p>
                <p>The first ascent was made, as has been stated, from Wolverhampton on July 17,
                    1862, and the journey was remarkable on account of a warm current that was met
                    with at a great elevation. The weather, previous to the ascent, had been bad for
                    a long time, and it had been delayed in consequence. The wind was still blowing
                    from the west, and considerable difficulty was experienced in the preliminary
                    arrangements, so that no instrument was fixed before starting. The balloon left
                    at 9.43 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.μ.,</hi> and a height of 3800 feet was reached
                    before an observation could be taken. At 4000 feet clouds were entered, and left
                    at 8000 feet. The temperature of the air at starting was 59° Fahr., at 4000 feet
                    it was 45°, and it descended to 26° at 10,000 feet, from which height to that of
                    13,000 feet there was no diminution. While passing through this space Mr
                    Glaisher put on additional clothing, feeling certain that a temperature below
                    zero would be attained before the height of 5 miles was reached; but at the
                    elevation of 15,500 feet the temperature was 31°, and at each successive
                    reading, up to 19,500, it <hi rend="italic">increased,</hi> and was there <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">42</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> o</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">.</hi> The temperature then decreased rapidly, and was 16° at
                    26,000 feet. On descending it increased regularly to 37 <hi rend="superscript">
                    o∙</hi> 8 at 10,000 feet. A very rough descent, in which nearly £50 worth of
                    instruments were broken, was effected near Oakham, in Rutlandshire, Mr Coxwell
                    having judged it prudent to descend on account of the proximity, as he supposed,
                    of the Wash. In coming down, a cloud was entered at an elevation of 12,400 feet,
                    and proved to be more than 8000 feet in thickness. The rise of temperature met
                    with in this ascent was most remarkable.</p>
                <p>The weather on the day (Aug. 18, 1862) of the third assent was favourable, and
                    there was but little wind. All the instruments were fixed before leaving the
                    earth. A height of more than 4 miles was attained, and the balloon remained in
                    the air about two hours. When at its highest point’ there were no clouds between
                    the balloon and the earth, and the streets of Birmingham were distinctly
                    visible. The descent was effected at Solihull, 7 miles from Birmingham. On the
                    earth the temperature of the air was 67 <hi rend="superscript"> o∙</hi> 8, and
                    that of the dew-point 54°·6; and they steadily decreased to 39° ∙5 and 22° ∙2
                    respectively at 11,500 feet. The balloon was then made to descend to the height
                    of about 3000 feet, when both increased to 56° ∙0 and 47° ∙5 respectively. On
                    throwing out ballast the balloon rose again, and the temperature declined pretty
                    steadily to 24° ∙0, and that of the dew-point to - 10° ∙0, at the height of
                    23,000 feet. During this ascent Mr Glaisher’s hands became quite blue, and he
                    experienced a qualmish sensation in the brain and stomach, resembling the
                    approach of sea-sickness; but no further inconvenience, besides such as resulted
                    from the cold and the difficulty of breathing, was experienced. This feeling of
                    sickness never occurred again to Mr Glaisher in any subsequent ascent.</p>
                <p>The ascent from the Crystal Palace on August 20,1862, was merely an ordinary one
                    for the public amusement, in which Mr Glaisher took a place in the car. In these
                    low ascents from places of entertainment, in which other persons also were
                    passengers, the large board stretching right across the car could not be used. A
                    smaller frame was therefore made, which could be screwed on to the edge of the
                    car, to carry the watch, siphon barometer, aneroid barometer, dry and wet bulb
                    thermometers, gridiron thermometer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This was a thermometer with a bulb shaped like a gridiron,
                    so as to have a very great surface exposed to the air. It was thought that the
                    ordinary pea-sized bulb would not permit of the thermometer being sufficiently
                    delicate to register the rapid changes of temperature due to the quick motion of
                    the balloon, as it requires some little time for such a thermometer to take up
                    the temperature of the surrounding medium.</p></note> and Daniell’s and
                    Regnault’s hygrometers, which comprised all the instruments usually taken up in
                    these low ascents. In the first low ascent, July 30, this framework was fixed
                    inside the car; but as it seemed possible that the warmth proceeding from the
                    voyagers might influence the readings of the instruments, it was always
                    afterwards fixed outside, and projected beyond the car, so that all the
                    instruments were freely exposed to the surrounding air. The ascent on August 20
                    was a low one, and presented no remarkable feature except that the balloon was
                    nearly becalmed over London. The earth was left at 6.26 P.M., and the air was so
                    quiet that at the height of three-quarters of a mile the balloon was still over
                    the Crystal Palace. At 7h. 47m. it was over London, and moving so slowly that it
                    was thought desirable to ascend above the clouds in hopes of meeting with a more
                    rapid current of air. At 8h. 5m. the voyagers were above the clouds, and it
                    became quite light again, darkness having come on whilst hovering over London,
                    at which time the gradual illumination by the lights in the streets formed a
                    most wonderful sight, and one never to be forgotten. The roar, or rather loud
                    hum, proceeding from the great city was also most remarkable. After having been
                    above the clouds some time, the lowing of cattle and other agricultural sounds
                    were heard. Accordingly, the valve-line was pulled, and the balloon descended
                    below the clouds, when the light of London was seen in the distance as a misty
                    glare. The darkness increased as the balloon descended very slowly, and it at
                    length touched the ground so gently in the middle of a field at Mill Hill, near
                    Hendon, that those in the car were scarcely aware of the contact. There were
                    twelve voyagers altogether, and when with some trouble sufficient countrymen
                    were collected to take their places and enable <pb break="no"

                    the balloon for the night and to make an ascent in the early morning.
                    Accordingly, at 4.30 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.,</hi> on August 21, the earth was
                    left, there being altogether five persons in the car. It was a dull, warm,
                    cloudy morning, with the sky overcast. In about an hour the height of 3 miles
                    was attained, and the temperature had fallen to 23°, having been 58° on the
                    earth before leaving. The aspect of the clouds under formation before and during
                    the rising of the sun was marvellous in the extreme, and baffled description.
                    There were seen shining masses of cloud in mountain chains, rising
                    perpendicularly from the plain, with summits of dazzling whiteness, forming vast
                    ravines, down which the balloon appeared to glide, or pass through their sides,
                    into other valleys, until, as the balloon rose far above, all appeared a mighty
                    sea of white cloud. The descent was effected about a quarter past seven, and the
                    transition from the magnificent scene above the clouds to the ugly prospect of
                    the dreary earth as seen early on a dull morning, with a uniform leaden sky, was
                    most depressing. The place of descent was near Biggleswade.</p>
                <p>The most noteworthy fact in connection with the ascent, September 1, 1862, was,
                    that from the balloon the clouds were observed to be forming below, and seen to
                    be following the whole course of the Thames from the Nore to Richmond. The
                    clouds were above the river following all its windings, and extending neither to
                    the right nor to the left. It was about the time of high water at London Bridge,
                    and the phenomenon was no doubt connected with the warm water from the sea.</p>
                <p>As in the ascent, September 5, 1862, the greatest height ever reached was
                    attained, it is desirable to give the account of it in some detail, and in Mr
                    Glaisher’s own words. It is only necessary to premise that it was intended on
                    this occasion to ascend as high as possible. The following is an extract from Mr
                    Glaisher’s account <hi rend="italic">{British Association Report,</hi> 1862, pp.
                    383-385):—</p>
                <p>My last observation was made at lh. 54m. at 29,000 feet. I suppose two or three
                    minutes fully were occupied between my eyes becoming insensible to seeing fine
                    divisions aud 1h. 54m., and then that two or three minutes more passed till I
                    was insensible; therefore I think this took place at about lh. 56m. or lh. 57m.
                    Whilst powerless I heard the words ‘temperature’ and ‘observation,’ and I knew
                    Mr Coxwell was in the car speaking to me, and endeavouring to arouse me;
                    therefore consciousness and hearing had returned. I then heard him speak more
                    emphatically, but I could not see, speak, or move. I heard him again say, ‘ Do
                    try—now do.’ Then I saw the instruments dimly, then Mr Coxwell, and very shortly
                    saw clearly. I rose in my seat and looked round, as though waking from sleep,
                    though not refreshed by sleep, and said to Mr Coxwell, ‘ I have been
                    insensible.’ He said, ‘You have; and I too, very nearly.’ I then drew up my
                    legs, which had been extended before me, and took a pencil in my hand to begin
                    observations. Mr Coxwell told me that he had lost the use of his hands, which
                    were black, and I poured brandy over them.</p>
                <p>“I resumed my observations at 2h. 7m., recording the barometer reading at 11 ∙ 53
                    inches and temperature - 2°. I suppose that three or four minutes were occupied
                    from the time of my hearing the words ‘temperature’ and ‘observation’ till I
                    began to observe. If so, then returning consciousness came at 2h. 4m., and this
                    gives seven minutes for total insensibility. I found the water in the vessel
                    supplying the wet bulb thermometer, which I had by frequent disturbances kept
                    from freezing, was one solid mass of ice; and it did not all melt until after we
                    had been on the ground some time.</p>
                <p>“Mr Coxwell told me that whilst in the ring he felt it piercingly cold; that
                    hoar-frost was all round the neck of the balloon; on attempting to leave the
                    ring he found his hands frozen, and he had to place his arms on the ring and
                    drop down; that he thought for a moment I had lain back to rest myself; that he
                    spoke to me without eliciting a reply; that he then noticed my legs projected
                    and my aims hung down by my side; that my countenance was serene and placid,
                    without the earnestness and anxiety he had noticed before going into the ring,
                    and then it struck him I was insensible. He wished to approach me, but could
                    not, and he felt insensibility coming over himself; that he became anxious to
                    open the valve, but in consequence of his having lost the use of his hands he
                    could not, and ultimately did so by seizing the cord with his teeth, and dipping
                    his head two or three times, until the balloon took a decided turn
                    downwards.</p>
                <p>“No inconvenience followed this insensibility, and when we dropped it was in a
                    country where no conveyance of any kind could be obtained, so that I had to walk
                    between 7 and 8 miles.</p>
                <p>“The descent was at first very rapid; we passed downwards 3 miles in nine
                    minutes; the balloon’s career was then checked, and it finally descended in the
                    centre of a large grass field at Cold Weston, 7⅜ miles from Ludlow.</p>
                <p>“In this ascent six pigeons were taken up. One was thrown out at the height of 3
                    miles, when it extended its wings and dropped as a piece of paper; a second, at
                    4 miles, flew vigorously round and round, apparently taking a dip each time; a
                    third was thrown out between 4 and 5 miles, and it fell downwards as a stone; a
                    fourth was thrown out at 4 miles on descending; it flew in a circle, and shortly
                    alighted on the top of the balloon. The two remaining <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n215/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0215-0198"/> pigeons were brought down to the ground. One was
                    found to be dead, and the other, a carrier, was still living, but would not
                    leave the hand when I attempted to throw it off, till, after a quarter of an
                    hour, it began to peck a piece of ribbon which encircled its neck, and was then
                    jerked off the finger, and flew with some vigour towards Wolverhampton. One of
                    the pigeons returned to Wolverhampton on Sunday, the 7th, and this is the only
                    one that has been heard of."</p>
                <p>Mr Glaisher found from his observation-book that the last observation was made at
                    29,000 feet, and that at this time the balloon was ascending at the rate of 1000
                    feet per minute; and that when he resumed his observations, it was descending at
                    the rate of 2000 feet per minute, the interval being thirteen minutes. This
                    gives 36,000 or 37,000 feet for the greatest height attained. Two other series
                    of considerations led to the latter height, and there can be no doubt that the
                    altitude of 37,000 feet, or 7 miles, was attained on this occasion.</p>
                <p>In tho ascent, April 18, 1863, 24,000 feet of elevation was reached. It was
                    remarkable for the rapidity of the descent. At 2h. 44m., the balloon being then
                    at a height of 10,000 feet, Mr Coxwell suddenly caught sight of Beachy Head, and
                    Mr Glaisher, looking over the edge of the car, saw the sea, apparently
                    immediately underneath. There was no time to be lost, and Mr Coxwell hung on to
                    the valveline, telling Mr Glaisher to leave his instruments and do the same. The
                    earth was reached at 2h. 48m., the two miles of descent having been effected in
                    four minutes. The balloon struck the ground near Newhaven with a terrible crash,
                    but, from the free use of the valve-line, it was so crippled that it did not
                    move afterwards. All the instruments, of the value of more than £25, including
                    some that were unreplaceable, were broken, and Mr Glaisher was hurt. In the
                    descent, after the first high ascent on July 17, 1862, the earth was struck with
                    so much violence that most of the instruments were broken, and Mr Glaisher (who
                    was closed in by his observing-board) was a good deal hurt then. In subsequent
                    ascents, therefore, boxes were used filled with small mattresses, in which the
                    instruments could be hurriedly placed, and the board was so arranged that it
                    could be turned over and hung outside the car. These improvements had the effect
                    of diminishing the danger to himself and the chance of breakage of the
                    instruments, but in the Newhaven descent there was not sufficient time to put
                    them in practice.</p>
                <p>The circumstances met with in the ascent, June 26, 1863, were so remarkable that
                    a short account cannot be omitted. The morning was at first very bright and
                    fine, but between 11 and 12 o’clock a change took place; the sky became covered
                    with clouds, and the wind rose and blew strongly, so that great difficulty was
                    experienced in completing the inflation. At 1h. 3m. the balloon left; in four
                    minutes, at 4000.feet high, cloud was entered. Mr Glaisher expected soon to
                    break through it, and enter into bright sunshine as usual, but nothing of the
                    sort took place, as, on emergence, clouds were seen both above and below. At
                    9000 feet the sighing and moaning of the wind were heard, and Mr Glaisher
                    satisfied himself that this was due, not to the cordage of the balloon, but to
                    opposing currents. At this time the sun was seen faintly, but instead of its
                    brilliance increasing, although the balloon was then two miles high, a fog was
                    entered, and the sight of the sun lost. The balloon next passed through a dry
                    fog, which was left at 12,000 feet, and after the sun had been seen faintly for
                    a little time, a wetting fog was entered.</p>
                <p>“At 15,000 feet,” Mr Glaisher proceeds, “we were still in fog, but it was not so
                    wetting. At 16,000 feet we entered a dry fog; at 17,000 feet saw faint gleams of
                    the sun, and heard a train. We were now about 3 miles high; at this time we were
                    not in cloud, but clouds were below us; others were on our level at a distance,
                    and yet more above us. We looked with astonishment at each other, and said as we
                    were rising steadily we surely must soon pass through them. At 17,500 feet we
                    were again enveloped in og, which became wetting at 18,500 feet; we left this
                    cloud below at 19,600 feet. At 20,000 feet the sun was just visible. We were now
                    approaching 4 miles high; dense clouds were still above us; for a space of 2000
                    to 3000 feet we met with no fog, but on passing above 4 miles our attention was
                    first attracted to a dark mass or cloud, and then to another on our level; both
                    these clouds had fringed edges—they were both nimbi. Without the slightest doubt
                    both these clouds were regular rain-clouds. Whilst looking at them we again lost
                    sight of everything, being enveloped in fog whilst passing upwards through 1000
                    feet. At 22,000 feet we again emerged, and were above clouds on passing above
                    23,000 feet. At six minutes to 2 o’clock we heard a railway train; the
                    temperature here was 18°. I wished still to ascend to find the limits of this
                    vapour, but Mr Coxwell said, ‘ We are too short of sand; I cannot go higher; we
                    must not even stop here.’ I was therefore most reluctantly compelled to abandon
                    the wish, and looked searchingly around. At this highest point, in close
                    proximity to us, were rain-clouds; below us dense fog. I was again reminded that
                    we must not stop. With a hasty glance everywhere, above, below, around, I saw
                    the sky nearly covered with dark clouds of a stratus character, with cirri still
                    higher, and small spaces of blue sky between them. The blue was not the blue of
                    4 or 5 miles high as I had always before seen it, but a faint blue, as seen from
                    the earth when the air is charged with moisture.”</p>
                <p>In the downward journey an even more remarkable series of circumstances was met
                    with; for a fall of rain was passed through, and then <hi rend="italic">below
                    it</hi> a snow-storm, the flakes being entirely composed of spiculae of ice and
                    innumerable snowcrystals. On reaching the ground near Ely the lower atmosphere
                    was found to be thick, misty, and murky. At Wolverton the afternoon was cold,
                    raw, and disagreeable for a summer’s day. The fact of rain-clouds extending
                    layer above layer to a height of 4 miles, was one never hitherto regarded as
                    possible; and the occurrence of rain and snow, and the latter underneath the
                    former, and all happening on a day in the very middle of summer, formed a series
                    of most curious and unexpected phenomena.</p>
                <p>Mr Glaisher having, in one of his descents, which took place near sunset,
                    observed that the temperature was the same through a very considerable height,
                    it occurred to him that after dark it was quite possible that, for some
                    elevation above the earth’s surface, the temperature might even increase with
                    increase of height; and to determine this he arranged for some ascents to be
                    made after sunset, so that the temperature during the night might be observed.
                    For this purpose he procured a couple of Davy lamps, which answered their object
                    satisfactorily. Accordingly, on October 2, 1865, an ascent was made from
                    Woolwich Arsenal, the time of starting being about three-quarters of an hour
                    after the sun had set. The temperature on the earth was 56°, and it steadily
                    increased to 59° ∙6 at the height of 1900 feet. This was established
                    conclusively by repeated ups and downs, the temperature falling as the balloon
                    descended. The view of London lighted up, as seen from the balloon in this
                    ascent, the night being clear, was most wonderful. A second night ascent was
                    made from the same place on December 2, 1865, and the balloon left the earth 2¾
                    hours after sunset. On this occasion the temperature did not rise, but the
                    decrease, though steady, was small. In an ascent from Windsor on May 29, 1866,
                    the balloon was kept up till half-past eight o’clock, and the temperature was
                    found to decrease as the earth was approached during the last 900 feet. In this
                    last ascent no paid aeronaut was employed, as Mr Westcar, of the Royal Horse
                    Guards, undertook the management of the balloon. In the preceding five ascents
                    Mr Orton, of Blackwall, was employed as aeronaut.</p>
                <p>It has been found necessary in the present notice to allude merely to the more
                    striking points noticed in Mr Glaisher’s twenty-eight ascents. The number of
                    observations made by him was of course great, and it is only necessary here to
                    repeat that they are to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Reports of the British
                    Association for the Advancement of Science,</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n216/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0216-0199"/> 1862-66. It appeared as one of the results of the
                    experiments that the rate of the decline of temperature with elevation near the
                    earth was very different when the sky was clear from what was the case when it
                    was cloudy; and the equality of temperature at sunset and increase with height
                    after sunset were very remarkable facts which were not anticipated, and which
                    have an important bearing on the theory of refraction, as astronomical
                    observations are usually made at night. Even at the height of 5 miles, cirrus
                    clouds were seen high in the air, apparently as far above as they seem when
                    viewed from the earth, and the air must there be so exceedingly dry that it is
                    hard to believe that their presence can be due to moisture at all. The results
                    of the observations differed very much, and no doubt the atmospheric conditions
                    depended not only on the time of day, but also on the season of the year, and
                    were such that a vast number of ascents would be requisite to determine the true
                    laws with anything approaching to certainty and completeness. It is also clear
                    that England is a most unfit country for the pursuit of such investigations, as,
                    from whatever place the balloon started, it was never safe to be more than an
                    hour above the clouds for fear of reaching the sea. It appeared from the
                    observations that an aneroid barometer could be trusted to read as accurately as
                    a mercurial barometer to the heights reached. The time of vibration of a
                    horizontal magnet was taken in very many of the ascents, and the results of ten
                    different sets of observations proved undoubtedly that the time of vibration was
                    lunger than on the earth. In almost all the ascents the balloon was under the
                    influence of currents of air in different directions. The thickness of these
                    currents was found to vary greatly. The direction of the wind on the earth was
                    sometimes that of the whole mass of air up to 20,000 feet, whilst at other times
                    the direction changed within 500 feet of the earth. Sometimes directly opposite
                    currents were met with at different heights in the same ascent, and three or
                    four streams of air were encountered moving in different directions. Ignoring
                    the different currents of air which caused the balloon to change its direction,
                    and at times to move in entirely opposite directions, and simply taking into
                    account the places of ascent and descent, the distances so measured were always
                    very much greater than the horizontal movement of the air as measured by
                    anemometers. For example, on January 12, 1862, the balloon left Woolwich at 2h.
                    8m. P.M., and descended at Lakenheath, 70 miles distant from the place of
                    ascent, at 4h. 19m. <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> At the Greenwich Observatory,
                    by Robinson’s anemometer, during this time the motion of the air was 6 miles
                    only. With regard to physiological observations, Mr Glaisher found that the
                    number of pulsations increased with elevation, as also the number of
                    inspirations. The number of his pulsations was generally 76 per minute before
                    starting, about 90 at 10,000 feet, 100 at 20,000 feet, and 110 at higher
                    elevations. But a good deal depended on the temperament of the individual. This
                    was also the case in respect to colour; at 10,000 feet the faces of some would
                    be a glowing purple, whilst others would be scarcely affected; at 4 mites high
                    Mr Glaisher found the pulsations of his heart distinctly audible, and his
                    breathing was very much affected, so that panting was produced by the very
                    slightest exertion; at 29,000 feet he became insensible. In reference to the
                    propagation of sound, it was at all times found that sounds from the earth were
                    more or less audible according to the amount of moisture in the air. When in
                    clouds at 4 miles high, a railway train was heard; but when clouds were far
                    below, no sound ever reached the ear at this elevation. The discharge of a gun
                    was heard at 10,000 feet. The barking of a dog was heard at the height of 2
                    miles, while the shouting of a multitude of people was not audible at heights
                    exceeding 4000 feet.</p>
                <p>The majority of Mr Glaisher’s experiments were made in the summer, partly because
                    public ascents took place at this time of the year, and partly because the
                    weather was more settled. But some special ascents were made in the winter;
                    these were found to be very troublesome and costly, owing to the time that was
                    wasted before a suitable day occurred, and to the boisterous weather, which
                    damaged the balloon. Altogether the number of ascents bore but a small ratio to
                    the number of days spent over them. Sometimes it was necessary to wait at
                    Wolverhampton a whole week after the day fixed for the ascent, owing to the
                    unfavourable state of the weather and the necessity of keeping the light gas
                    required for the balloon in a separate gasometer (as the lightest gas is the
                    worst in illuminating power), added to the cost and difficulty. When balloons
                    ascend as public exhibitions from places of entertainment it is very rarely that
                    a height of a mile is reached, although, in the absence of instruments, it is
                    not unusual for the aeronaut to exaggerate the elevation, as the passengers have
                    no reason for disputing what is told them. This must be borne in mind when
                    physiological or other phenomena are described by voyagers unprovided with
                    instruments. We have noticed the observations made in Mr Glaisher’s ascents at
                    greater length, because they are almost the only ones that have been made in
                    which the height and other matters are determined with certainty. A quantity of
                    air was collected in two large bags at the height of 12,000 feet in the ascent
                    on January 12, 1864, and submitted to Professor Tyndall, but he has never made
                    public the analysis of it.</p>
                <p>In the years 1867 and 1868 M. Flammarion made eight or nine ascents from Paris
                    for scientific purposes. The heights reached were not great, but the general
                    result of the observations was to confirm those made by Mr Glaisher. See M.
                    Flammarion in <hi rend="italic">Voyages</hi><hi rend="italic">Aériens,</hi>
                    Paris, 1870, or <hi rend="italic">Travels in the Air,</hi> London, 1871.
                    Observations were also made in some balloon ascents by M. de Fonvielle, which
                    are noticed in the works just referred to.</p>
                <p>The balloon had not been discovered very long before it received a military
                    status, and soon after the commencement of the French revolutionary war an
                    aeronautic school was founded at Meudon; Guyton de Morveau, the chemist, and
                    Colonel Coutelle being the persons in charge. Four balloons were constructed for
                    the armies of the north, of the Sambre and Meuse, of the Rhine and Moselle, and
                    of Egypt. In June 1794 Coutelle ascended with the adjutant and general to
                    reconnoitre the hostile army just before the battle of Fleurus, and two
                    reconnaissances were made, each occupying four hours. It is generally stated
                    that it was to the information so gained that the French victory was due. The
                    balloon corps was in constant requisition during the campaign, but it does not
                    appear that, with the exception of the reconnaissances just mentioned, any great
                    advantages resulted, except in a moral point of view. But even this was of
                    importance, as the enemy were much disconcerted at having their movements so
                    completely watched, while the French were correspondingly elated at the superior
                    information it was believed they were gaining. An attempt was made to revive the
                    use of balloons in the African campaign of 1830, but no opportunity occurred in
                    which they could be employed. It is said that in 1849 a reconnoitring balloon
                    was sent up from before Venice, and that the Russians used one at SebastopoL In
                    the French campaign against Italy in 1859 the French had recourse to the use of
                    balloons, but this time there was not any aerostatic corps, and their management
                    was entrusted to the brothers Godard. Several reconnaissances were made, and one
                    of especial interest the day before the battle of Solferino. No information of
                    much importance seems, however, to have been gained thereby. The Fleurus
                    reconnaissance<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n217/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0217-0200"/> was made in a balloon inflated with hydrogen gas,
                    while at Solferino a fire-balloon was employed. Each system has its advantages
                    and disadvantages; the gas-balloon requires several hours for inflation, but
                    then it can remain in the air any length of time; the fire-balloon can be
                    inflated rapidly, but it will not stay in the air more than five or ten minutes
                    unless a furnace is taken up, the use of which is impracticable in even a
                    moderate wind; besides, the fire-balloon must be of very large dimensions, and
                    only one person could, as a rule, ascend at a time, and he would have to be
                    occupied with the fire: the use of fire-balloons also is always attended with
                    some danger. Μ. Eugene Godard, who was engaged in the management of the balloons
                    in the Italian campaign, wrote to the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> in August
                    1864, expressing his opinion of the superiority of fire-balloons for war
                    purposes, as they are so easily inflated and are not destroyed or compelled to
                    descend even if pierced by several balls; and this was also, we believe, the
                    opinion of the Austrians who made experiments with war balloons.</p>
                <p>In the late American war balloons were a good deal used by the Federals. There
                    was a regular balloon staff attached to M‘Clellan’s army, with a captain, an
                    assistant-captain, and about 50 non-commissioned officers and privates. The
                    apparatus consisted of two generators, drawn by four horses each; two balloons,
                    drawn by four horses each, and an acid-cart, drawn by two horses. The two
                    balloons used contained about 13,000 and 26,000 feet of gas, and the inflation
                    usually occupied about three hours. (See Captain Beaumont’s Account, vol. xii.
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Engineers Papers.)</hi> We are not aware of the
                    value set by the officers in command on the information obtained by this means;
                    but as we believe balloons were employed till the conclusion of the war, it is
                    clear that some importance was attached to their use. In 1862 or 1863 one or two
                    experiments to test the use of balloons in making reconnaissances were made at
                    Aidershot, but nothing came of them.</p>
                <p>When the Montgolfiers first discovered the balloon, its great use in military
                    operations was at once prophesied; but these anticipations have not been
                    realised. On the other hand, however, there can be no doubt that the balloon has
                    never had a fair trial, being viewed coldly by officers enamoured of routine,
                    and when used, being often left unsupplied with suitable appointments. It is
                    probable that a future still remains for the balloon in this direction.</p>
                <p>The paramount value of the balloon during the recent siege of Paris must be fresh
                    in the minds of all. It was by it alone that communication was kept up between
                    the besieged city and the external world, as the balloons carried away from
                    Paris the pigeons which afterwards brought back to it the news of the provinces.
                    The total number of balloons that ascended from Paris during the siege,
                    conveying persons and despatches, was sixty-four—the first having started on
                    September 23, 1870, and the last on January 28, 1871. Gambetta effected his
                    escape from Paris, on October 7, in the balloon <hi rend="italic"
                    >Armand-Barbes,</hi> an event which doubtless led to the prolongation of the
                    war. Of the sixty-four balloons only two were never heard of; they were blown
                    out to sea. One of the most remarkable voyages was that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ville d'</hi><hi rend="italic">Orléans,</hi> which, leaving Paris at eleven
                    o’clock on November 21, descended fifteen hours afterwards near Christiania,
                    having crossed the North Sea. Several of the balloons on their descent were
                    taken by the Prussians, and a good many were fired at while in the air; but we
                    do not hear of any being injured from this cause. The average size of the
                    balloons was from 2000 to 2050 metres, or from 70,000 to 72,000 cubic feet. The
                    above facts we have extracted from <hi rend="italic">Les Ballons</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Siège</hi><hi rend="italic">de Paris,</hi> a sheet published by
                    Bulla &amp;c Sons, Paris; compiled by the brothers Tissandier, well-known French
                    aeronauts, and giving the name, size, and times of ascent and descent of every
                    balloon that left Paris, with the names of the aeronaut and generally also those
                    of the passengers, the weight of despatches, the number of pigeons, &amp;c. Only
                    those balloons, however, are noticed in which some person ascended. A similar
                    list of sixty-two balloons is given by Mr Glaisher in the introduction to the
                    second edition of <hi rend="italic">Travels in the Air</hi> (1871). It was,
                    however, published too soon after the conclusion of the siege to be quite so
                    complete as the sheet of the MM. Tissandier.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps worth stating that the balloons were manufactured and despatched
                    (generally from the platforms of the Orleans or the Northern Railway) under the
                    direction of the Post-Office. The aeronauts employed were mostly sailors, who
                    did their work very well. No use whatever was made in the war of balloons for
                    purposes of reconnaissance. The exceedingly important part played by the balloon
                    in the siege of Paris would alone, if it had been of no other utility, render it
                    one of the most valuable inventions of the last century.</p>
                <p>The principle of the parachute is so simple that the idea must have occurred to
                    persons in all ages. Father Loubere, in his History of Siam, published two
                    centuries ago, tells of a person who frequently diverted the court by the
                    prodigious leaps he used to take, having two parachutes or umbrellas fastened to
                    his girdle. In 1783 a certain Μ. le Normand practically demonstrated the
                    efficiency of a parachute by descending from a high house at Lyons; but he
                    merely regarded it as a useful means whereby to escape from fire. To Blanchard
                    is due the idea of using it as an adjunct to the balloon. As early as 1785 he
                    had constructed a parachute, to which was attached a basket. . In this he placed
                    a dog, which descended safely to the ground when the parachute was released from
                    a balloon at a considerable elevation. It is stated that he descended himself
                    from a balloon in a parachute in 1793; but, owing to some defect in its
                    construction, he fell too rapidly, and broke his leg.</p>
                <p>André Jaques Garnerin was the first person who successfully descended from a
                    balloon in a parachute, and he repeated this experiment so often that he may be
                    said to have first demonstrated the practicability of using the machine; and, in
                    fact, that he invented it in a practical and suitable form. In 1793 Garnerin had
                    been taken prisoner at Marchiennes, and he was confined for between two and
                    three years in the fortress of Bude, in Hungary. While in captivity he
                    elaborated in his mind the means of descending from a balloon by means of a
                    parachute; and on October 22, 1797, he made his first public experiment. He
                    ascended from the park of Monceau at Paris, and when at the height of about 1¼
                    mile he released the parachute, which was attached to the balloon in place of a
                    car; the balloon, relieved suddenly of so great a weight, rose very rapidly till
                    it burst, while the parachute descended very fast, making violent oscillations
                    all the way. Garnerin, however, reached the earth in safety upon the plain of
                    Monceau. In 1802 Garnerin came to England and made a good many ascents in all
                    parts of the country, many of which excited much enthusiasm, as can be seen from
                    the contemporary accounts; and on September 21, 1802, he repeated his parachute
                    experiment in England.</p>
                <p>The parachute was dome-shaped, and bore a resemblance to a large umbrella. The
                    case or dome was made of white canvas, and was 23 feet in diameter. At the top
                    was a truck or round piece of wood 10 inches in diameter, with a hole in its
                    centre, fastened to the canvas by 32 short pieces of tape. The parachute was
                    suspended from a hoop attached to the netting of the balloon, and below the
                    parachute was placed a cylindrical basket, 4 feet high and 2¼ feet in diameter,
                    which contained the aeronaut. The ascent took place at about six o’clock from
                    North Audley Street, Loudon; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n218/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0218-0201"/> and, at a height of about (it is believed) 8000
                    feet, Garnerin separated the parachute from the balloon. For a few seconds his
                    fate seemed certain, as the parachute retained the collapsed state in which it
                    had originally ascended, and fell very rapidly. It suddenly, however, expanded,
                    and the rapidity of its descent was at once checked, but the oscillations were
                    so violent that the car, which was suspended 20 feet below, was sometimes on a
                    level with the rest of the apparatus. Some accounts state that these
                    oscillations increased, others that they decreased as the parachute descended,
                    and the latter seems most probable. It came to the ground in a field at the back
                    of St Pancras Church, the descent having occupied rather more than ten minutes.
                    Garnerin was hurt a little by the violence with which the basket containing him
                    struck the earth; but a few cuts and a slight nausea represented all the ill
                    effects of his fall. He made, certainly, one other descent in a similar way (as
                    that just described is stated to have been his third), and we believe several
                    others on the Continent, but this was the only one he effected in England.</p>
                <p>Jordaki Kuparento, a Polish aeronaut, is the only person who ever made any real
                    use of a parachute. He ascended from Warsaw on July 24,1808, in a fire-balloon,
                    which, at a considerable elevation, took fire; but being provided with a
                    parachute, he was enabled to effect his descent in safety.</p>
                <p>The next experiment made with a parachute was that which resulted in the
                    unfortunate death of Mr Robert Cocking. So early as 1814 this gentleman had
                    lectured on the subject before the City Philosophical Society, and also before
                    the Society of Arts. He always retained an interest in ballooning, and made two
                    ascents—one with Mr Sadler, and the other on September 27, 1836, with Mr Green.
                    The success of the balloon trip of Messrs Hollond, Mason, and Green, seems to
                    have incited Mr Cocking to demonstrate practically the truth of his views. He
                    accordingly constructed a suitable parachute on his principles, and having
                    succeeded in obtaining the consent of Messrs Hughes and Gye, the proprietors of
                    Vauxhall Gardens, to permit the ascent to be made there, he prevailed on Mr
                    Green to ascend in his great Nassau balloon with the parachute attached. The
                    great defect of Garnerin’s umbrella-shaped parachute was its violent oscillation
                    during descent, and Mr Cocking considered that if the parachute were made of a
                    conical form (vertex downwards), the whole of this oscillation would be avoided;
                    and if it were made of sufficient size, there would be resistance enough to
                    check too rapid a descent. He therefore constructed a parachute on this
                    principle, the radius of which at its widest part was about 17 feet. It was
                    stated in the public announcements previous to the experiment that the whole
                    weighed 223 lb; but from the evidence at the inquest it appeared that the weight
                    must have been over 400 lb. Mr Cocking’s weight was 177 lb, which was so much
                    additional. On July 24, 1837, the trial took place; and the Nassau balloon, with
                    Mr Green and Mr Spencer, a solicitor, in the car, and having suspended below it
                    the parachute, in the car of which was Mr Cocking, rose from the ground at
                    twenty-five minutes to eight in the evening. A good deal of difficulty was
                    experienced in rising to a suitable height, partly in consequence of the
                    resistance to the air offered by the expanded parachute, and partly owing to its
                    weight. Mr Cocking wished the height to be 8000 feet; but when the balloon
                    reached the height of 5000 feet, it being then nearly over Greenwich, Mr Green
                    called out to Mr Cocking that he should be unable to ascend to the requisite
                    height if the parachute was to descend in daylight. Mr Cocking accordingly let
                    slip the catch which was to liberate him from the balloon. The parachute for a
                    few seconds descended very rapidly but still evenly, until suddenly the upper
                    rim seemed to give way, and the whole apparatus collapsed (taking a form
                    resembling an umbrella turned inside out, and nearly closed), and the machine
                    descended with great rapidity, oscillating very much. When about two or three
                    hundred feet from the ground, the basket became disengaged from the remnant of
                    the parachute, and Mr Cocking was found in a field at Lee, literally dashed to
                    pieces.</p>
                <p>Mr Green and Mr Spencer, who were in the car of the balloon, had also a narrow
                    escape. At the moment the parachute was disengaged they crouched down in the
                    car, and Mr Green clung to the valve-line, to permit the escape of the gas. The
                    balloon shot upwards, plunging and rolling, and the gas pouring from both the
                    upper and lower valves, but chiefly from the latter, as the great resistance of
                    the air checked its egress from the former. Mr Green and Mr Spencer applied
                    their mouths to tubes communicating with an air-bag with which they had had the
                    foresight to provide themselves, otherwise they would certainly have been
                    suffocated by the gas. Notwithstanding this precaution, however, the gas almost
                    totally deprived them of sight for four or five minutes. When they came to
                    themselves they found they were at a height of about four miles, and descending
                    rapidly. They effected, however, a safe descent near Maidstone.</p>
                <p>Many objections were made, after the result, to the form of Mr Cocking’s
                    parachute; but there is little doubt that had it been constructed of sufficient
                    strength, and perhaps of somewhat larger size, it would have answered its
                    purpose. As it was, the upper rim was made of tin, which soon gave way. Mr Wise,
                    the American aeronaut, made some experiments on parachutes of both forms
                    (Garnerin’s and Cocking’s), and found that the latter always were much more
                    steady, descending generally in a spiral curve.</p>
                <p>In 1839 Mr Hampton made three descents in a parachute, on Garnerin’s pattern,
                    from his oal-loon, the “Albion.” He followed Garnerin’s example in attaching the
                    parachute to the netting of the balloon, so that when the connection between the
                    two was severed the latter was left to its own devices. Mr Hampton took
                    measures, however, that it should descend soon after the parachute, and it was
                    generally found no great distance off, and returned to him. All his parachute
                    descents were safely performed, although in one he was a good deal shaken.</p>
                <p>We may remark that a descending balloon half-full of gas either does rise, or can
                    with a little management be made to rise, to the top of the netting and take the
                    form of a parachute, thus materially lessening the rapidity of descent. Mr Wise,
                    in fact, having noticed this, once purposely exploded his balloon when at a
                    considerable altitude, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n219/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0219-0202"/> the resistance offered to the air by the envelope
                    of the balloon was sufficient to enable him to reach the ground without injury.
                    And a similar thing took place in one of Mr Glaisher’s high scientific ascents
                    (April 18, 1863), when, at a height of about 2 miles, the sea appeared directly
                    underneath; the gas was let out of the balloon as quickly as possible, and the
                    velocity of descent was so great, that the 2 miles of vertical height were
                    passed through in four minutes. On the balloon reaching the ground at Newhaven,
                    close to the shore, it was found to be nearly empty. The balloon had, in fact,
                    for the last mile or more, merely acted as a parachute; the shock was a severe
                    one, and all the instruments were broken, but nothing serious resulted to the
                    occupants of the car.</p>
                <p>Numerous attempts have been made both to direct balloons and contrive independent
                    flying machines. After the invention of the balloon by the brothers Montgolfier,
                    it was at once thought that no very great difficulty would be found in devising
                    a suitable steering apparatus; in fact, it was supposed that to rise into the
                    air and remain there was the chief difficulty, and that, this being
                    accomplished, the power of directing the aerostat would be a secondary
                    achievement that must follow before long. Accordingly, in most of the early
                    balloons the voyagers took up oars, sails, or paddles, which they diligently
                    worked while in the air; sometimes they thought an effect was produced, and
                    sometimes not. If we consider the number of different currents in the
                    atmosphere, it is no wonder that some should have announced with confidence that
                    their course was changed from that of the wind by means of the sails or oars
                    that they used; in fact, it is not very often that the whole atmosphere up to a
                    considerable height is moving <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >masse</hi> in the same direction, so that generally the course taken by the
                    balloon, as determined merely by joining the places of ascent and descent, is
                    not identical with the direction of the wind, even when it is the same at both
                    places. Although there is no reason why balloons should not be so guided by
                    means of mechanical appliances attached to them as to move in a direction making
                    a small angle with that of the wind, still it must have been evident to any one
                    who has observed a balloon during inflation on a windy day, that any motion in
                    which it would be exposed to the action of a strong current of air must result
                    in its destruction. It has therefore gradually become recognised that the
                    balloon is scarcely a step at all towards a system of aerial navigation; and
                    many have thought that the principles involved in the construction of a flying
                    machine must be very different from the simple statical equilibrium that
                    subsists when a balloon is floating in the air. “To navigate the air the machine
                    must be heavier than the air,” has frequently been regarded as an axiom; and
                    there can be no doubt that an apparatus constructed of such light material as is
                    necessary for a balloon must either be destroyed or become ungovernable in a
                    high wind. Recently, however, M. Dupuy de Lôme, an eminent French engineer, has
                    constructed and made experiments with a balloon which he considers satisfies
                    some of the conditions. The balloon is spindle-shaped, the longer axis being
                    horizontal, and it contains about 120,000 cubic feet. The car is suspended below
                    the middle of the balloon, and there are provided a rudder and a screw. The
                    rudder consists of a triangular sail placed beneath the balloon and near the
                    rear, and is kept in position by a horizontal yard, about 20 feet long, turning
                    round a pivot in its forward extremity; the height of the sail is 16 feet, and
                    its surface 160 square feet. Two ropes for working the rudder extend forward to
                    the seat of the steerer, who has before him a compass fixed to the car, the
                    central part of which will contain fourteen men. The screw is carried by the
                    car, and is driven by four or eight men working at a capstan. A trial was made
                    with the machine on February 2, 1872, on a windy day, and M. de Lôme considered
                    that he had been enabled by his screw and rudder to alter his course about 12°.
                    (See <hi rend="italic">Report of the Aeronautical Society,</hi> 1872).</p>
                <p>Whatever difficulties may present themselves in regulating the horizontal
                    movement of the balloon, there can be no doubt that the vertical motion could be
                    obtained by means of a screw or other mechanical means; and the power of being
                    able to ascend or descend without loss of ballast would be a considerable gain.
                    In the opinion of many, however, the balloon is not worth improvement; and as
                    ballooning is now generally practised merely as a spectacle by which the
                    aeronaut or showman gains his living, it is not likely that any advancement will
                    be made.</p>
                <p>Of flying machines, in which both buoyancy and motion were proposed to be
                    obtained by purely mechanical means, the number has been very great. Most of the
                    projects have been chimerical, and were due to persons possessed of an
                    insufficient knowledge of the principles of natural philosophy, both
                    theoretically and practically. They serve, however, to show how great a number
                    of individuals must have paid attention to the matter, and even at the present
                    time several patents are taken out annually on the subject. We do not propose
                    here to give an account of any of these projects, for but few have ever passed
                    beyond projects, but will merely refer to Mr Henson’s aerial carriage, which in
                    1843 attracted some attention. The apparatus was an elaborate one, and its
                    principal feature was the great expanse of the sustaining planes. The machine
                    was to advance with its front edge a little raised, the effect of which would be
                    to present its under surface to the air over which it was passing; the
                    resistance of this air, acting on it like the strong wind on the sails of a
                    windmill, would, it was thought, prevent the descent of the machine. Mr Henson
                    invented a steam-engine of great lightness, but he proposed that the machine
                    should be started down an inclined plane, so that the steam-engine would only
                    have to make up for the velocity lost by the resistance of the air. The scheme
                    never came to anything.</p>
                <p>In the still air of a room it is, of course, not difficult to attach an apparatus
                    to a balloon so as to direct its motion, and even models of flying machines have
                    been made which, when tried in a room, seemed moderately successful. Some
                    instruments which would very nearly support themselves in the air were shown -at
                    the Aeronautical Society’s exhibition at the Crystal Palace. A good deal would
                    be accomplished if an accurate knowledge of the exact motion of a bird’s wing
                    could be obtained; in fact, until this is known, or until sufficient experiments
                    on the resistance experienced by different-shaped laminae with different motions
                    are made, there seems little chance of the construction of a satisfactory flying
                    machine, unless means can be found to make a steam-engine of much less weight
                    than is at present necessary.</p>
                <p>In 1865 the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain was founded, the officers
                    being—President, the Duke of Argyle; Treasurer, Mr J. Glaisher; and Secretary,
                    Mr Brearey. It has published an annual report every year since [1873],
                    containing selections from the papers read to the society, and abstracts of the
                    discussions that took place thereon at the meetings. The numerous papers
                    submitted to this society bear witness to the great number of minds that are
                    engaged on the solution of the problem of aerial navigation. Of course, not a
                    few of the methods proposed are the fanciful projects of ignorant men, but some
                    show the careful thought and elaborate experiment of trained engineers and other
                    qualified persons. In 1868 the society held an exhibition of flying machines,
                    &amp;c., at the Crystal Palace, which was visited by many persons. A
                    fire-balloon of a M. de la Marne, which should have ascended during this
                    exhibition, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n220/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0220-0203"/> caught fire and was burnt. In 1871 a series of
                    experiments was made at Penn’s factory (Greenwich) on the resistance of
                    different shaped planes placed at different angles, in a current of air produced
                    by a rotary fan. Investigations of this kind not only form the first step
                    towards obtaining data for a true knowledge of the exact nature of flying, but
                    are also independently of high scientific interest. The chief object of the
                    society is to bring together those persons who are interested in the subject of
                    aeronautics (except balloonists by trade, who are ineligible), and to encourage
                    those who, possessing suitable acquirements, are devoting their time to the
                    investigation of the question.</p>
                <p>Aerostatic societies have also been founded in other countries; but although they
                    have been inaugurated with considerable <hi rend="italic">éclat,</hi> more than
                    one have already terminated a short-lived career. The Vienna society seems,
                    however, to have been unusually active during the recent exhibition of 1873.</p>
                <p>The principle in virtue of which a balloon ascends is exactly the same as that
                    which causes a piece of wood or other material to float partially immersed in
                    water, and may be stated as follows, viz., that if any body float in equilibrium
                    in a fluid, the weight of the body is equal to the weight of the fluid
                    displaced. By the “fluid displaced” is meant the fluid which would occupy the
                    space actually occupied in the fluid by the body if the body were removed. When
                    the fluid is inelastic and incompressible, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a
                    liquid, as water, its density is the same throughout, and bodies placed in it
                    either rise to the surface and float there partially immersed, or sink to the
                    bottom. Thus, suppose a body only one-third as heavy as water (in other words,
                    whose specific gravity is one-third) was floating on the surface of water, then,
                    as the weight of the body must be equal to that of the water it displaces, it is
                    clear that one-third of the body must be immersed. In the case, however, of an
                    elastic or gaseous fluid, such as air, the density gradually decreases as we
                    recede from the surface of the earth, for each layer has to support the weight
                    of all above it, and as air is elastic or compressible, the layers near the
                    earth are more pressed upon, and therefore denser than those above. Thus, if a
                    body lighter than the air it displaces be set free in the atmosphere, it rises
                    to such a height that the air there is so attenuated that the weight of it
                    displaced is equal to that of the body, when equilibrium takes place, and the
                    body ascends no higher. In all cases, therefore, a body floating in the air is
                    totally immersed, and it can never get beyond the atmosphere, and float, as it
                    were, upon its surface.</p>
                <p>To find, therefore, how high any body (lighter than the air it displaces), such
                    as a balloon, of given capacity and weight, will rise, it is only necessary to
                    calculate at what height the volume of a quantity of air equal to the given
                    capacity will be equal in weight to the given weight. Leaving temperature out of
                    the question, the law of the decrease of density in the atmosphere is such that
                    the density at a height <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is equal to <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> -g/k(x)</hi> × the density at the earth’s
                    surface, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> being the measure of gravity, and <hi

                    called the height of the homogeneous atmosphere, viz., it is equal to what would
                    be the height of the atmosphere if it were homogeneous throughout, and of the
                    same density as at the earth’s surface. Its value may be taken at about 26,000
                    feet. Thus, let V be the volume of a balloon and its appurtenances, car, ropes,
                    &amp;c. (viz., the number of cubic feet, or whatever the unit of solidity may
                    be, that it displaces), and let W be its weight (including that of the gas),
                    then it will rise to a height <hi rend="italic">x</hi> such that</p>
                <p>W = V <hi rend="italic">g</hi> × density of air, = v <hi rend="subscript">
                    w</hi>-*∙, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> being the value of the force of gravity, and
                    σ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> being the density of the air at the surface of
                    the earth. This equation is not quite accurate, for several reasons—(1) because
                    the decrease of temperature that results from increase of elevation has not been
                    taken into account; (2) because <hi rend="italic">g</hi> has been taken to
                    measure the force of gravity on the earth’s surface, whereas it should represent
                    this force at a height <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> this is easily corrected by
                    replacing <hi rend="italic">g</hi> by <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ', where <hi

                    but as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is about 4000 miles, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> is never likely in any ordinary question to exceed 10 miles, we can
                    replace <hi rend="italic">g'</hi> by <hi rend="italic">g</hi> without
                    introducing sensible error, for the correction due to this cause would be much
                    less than other uncertainties that must arise; and (3) because W and V could not
                    both remain constant. If the balloon be not fully inflated on leaving, so that
                    the gas contained in it can expand, then V, the volume of air displaced, will
                    increase; while, if the balloon be full at starting, the envelope must either be
                    strong enough to resist the increased pressure of the gas inside, due to the
                    removal of some of the pressure outside (owing to the diminished density of the
                    air), or some of the gas must be allowed to escape. The former alternative of
                    the second case could not be complied with, as the balloon would burst; some of
                    the gas must therefore escape, and so W is diminished. The weight of gas of
                    which the balloon is thus eased cannot properly be omitted from the calculation,
                    if <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be considerable; but a good approximation is
                    obtained without it, as the weight of the gas that escapes will generally bear a
                    small proportion to the weight of balloon, car, grapnel, passengers, &amp;c. The
                    true equation (except as regards temperature) is therefore, for a balloon full
                    at starting—</p>

                    generally be sufficient, especially when temperature is omitted, to take the
                    formula in the approximate form written previously. As the volume of air
                    displaced by the car, ropes, passengers, &amp;c., is usually trifling compared
                    to that displaced by the balloon itself, no great error can arise from taking

                    of 100,000 cubic feet capacity would rise if inflated with pure hydrogen gas,
                    carrying with it a weight of 3000 lb (this including the weight of the balloon
                    itself and appurtenances). A cubic foot of air, at temperature 32° Fahr., and
                    under a pressure of 29∙922 in., weighs ∙080728 lb, and a cubic foot of hydrogen
                    weighs ∙005592 lb, so that (supposing the barometer reading on the earth to be
                    29∙922 in., and the temperature of the air to be 32°) at the surface of the
                    earth the balloon, &amp;c., weighs 3559 lb, and the weight of the air displaced
                    is 8073 lb. The balloon will therefore approximately rise to such a height <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> that 100,000 cubic feet of air shall there weigh 3559 lb;

                    hyperbolic; if common or Briggian logarithms be used, the result must be
                    multiplied by 2∙30258 . . . (the reciprocal of the modulus). In the above <pb

                    21,000 feet, and as at this height rather more than half the gas will have
                    escaped (it having been supposed that the balloon was full at starting). This
                    only reduces the value 3559 by about 300, and the result of taking it into
                    account is only to increase the height just found by about 200 feet. If 2000 lb
                    out of the 3000 were thrown away during the ascent, the balloon would reach a
                    height of about 10 miles; the weight of the gas that escapes is here important,
                    as, if it be not taken into account, the height given by the formula is only
                    about 8 miles.</p>
                <p>In actual aerostation, as at present practised, ordinary coal gas is used, which
                    is many times heavier than hydrogen, being, in fact, usually not less than half
                    the specific gravity of air. Even when balloons are inflated with hydrogen,
                    generated by the action of sulphuric acid on zinc filings, the gas is very far
                    from pure, and its density is often double that of pure hydrogen, and even
                    greater.</p>
                <p>The hydrostatic laws relating to the equilibrium of floating bodies were known
                    long previous to the invention of the balloon in 1783, but it was only in the
                    latter half of the 18th century that the nature of gases was sufficiently
                    understood to enable these principles to have been acted on. As we have seen,
                    both Black and Cavallo did make use of them on a small scale, and if they had
                    thought it possible to make a varnish impervious to the passage of hydrogen gas
                    they could have easily anticipated the Montgolfiers. As it was, no sooner was
                    the fire-balloon invented, than Charles at once suggested and practically
                    carried out the idea of the hydrogen or inflammable air balloon.</p>
                <p>The mathematical theory of the rate of ascent of a balloon possesses remarkable
                    historic interest, from the fact that it was the last problem that engaged the
                    attention of the greatest mathematician of the last century, Euler. The news of
                    the experiment of the Montgolfiers at Annonay on June 5, 1783, reached the aged
                    mathematician (he was in his 77th year) at St Petersburg, and with an energy
                    that was characteristic of him he at once proceeded to investigate the motion of
                    a globe lighter than the air it displaced. For many years he had been all but
                    totally blind, and was in the habit of performing his calculations with chalk
                    upon a black board. It was after his death, on September 7, 1783, that this
                    board was found covered with the analytical investigation of the motion of an
                    aerostat. This investigation is printed under the title, <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Memoirs of the French Academy</hi> for 1781 (pp. 264-268). The
                    explanation of the earlier date is that the volume of memoirs for 1781 was not
                    published till 1784. The peculiarity of Euler’s memoir is that it deals with the
                    motion of a closed globe filled with a gas lighter than air, whereas the
                    experiments of the Montgolfiers were made with balloons inflated with heated
                    air. The explanation of this must be that either an imperfect account reached
                    Euler, and that he supplied the details himself as seemed to him most probable,
                    or that he, like the Montgolfiers themselves, attributed the rising of the
                    balloon to the generation of a special gas given off by the chopped straw with
                    which the fire was fed. The treatment of the question by Euler presents no
                    particular point of importance—indeed, it could not; but the fact of its having
                    given rise to the closing work of so long and distinguished a life, and having
                    occupied the last thoughts of so great a mind, confers on the problem of the
                    balloon's motion a peculiar interest.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to the investigation of the vertical motion of a balloon inflated
                    with gas, the horizontal motion, of course, being always equal to that of the
                    current in which it is placed. In supposing, therefore, the balloon to be
                    ascending vertically into a perfectly calm atmosphere, there is no loss of
                    generality. There are two cases of the problem, viz., when the balloon is only
                    partially filled with gas at starting, and when it is quite filled. The motion
                    in the former case we shall investigate first, as the balloon will ascend till
                    it becomes completely full, and then the subsequent motion will belong to the
                    second case. We may remark that it is usual in investigations relating to the
                    motions of a balloon to regard it in the way that Euler did, viz., as a <hi
                    rend="italic">closed</hi> inextensible bag, capable of bearing any amount of
                    pressure. In point of fact, the neck or lower orifice of the balloon is
                    invariably open while it is in the air, so that the pressure inside and outside
                    is practically always the same, and when the balloon continues ascending after
                    it has become quite full, the gas pours out of the neck or is allowed to escape
                    by opening the upper valve. It is to be noticed that we have not thought it
                    necessary to transform the formulae obtained in such wise that they may be
                    readily adapted to numerical calculations as they stand, as our object is rather
                    to exhibit the nature of the motion, and clearly express the conditions that are
                    fulfilled in the case of a balloon, than deduce a series of formulae for
                    practical use. We shall, however, indicate the simplifications allowable in
                    practical applications. The effect of temperature, though important, is
                    neglected, as the connection between it and height is still unknown. It was
                    chiefly to determine this relation that Mr Glaisher’s ascents were undertaken,
                    and at the conclusion of the first eight he deduced an empirical law which
                    seemed to accord pretty well with the observations; the succeeding twenty
                    ascents, however, failed to confirm this law. In fact, it is evident, even
                    without observation, that the rate of the decline of temperature when the sky is
                    clear must differ from what it is when cloudy, and that, being influenced to a
                    great amount by radiation of heat from the earth’s surface, it will vary from
                    hour to hour. Under these circumstances, as our object is not to deduce a series
                    of practical rules for calculating heights, &amp;c., we have supposed the
                    temperature to remain constant throughout the atmosphere. The assumption of any
                    law of decrease would considerably complicate the equations. Perhaps the
                    simplest law, mathematically considered, would be to assume the curve of descent
                    of temperature to be <hi rend="italic">y = e</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                    Transactions</hi> for 1870, pp. 367-388).</p>
                <p>We thus have, except for temperature, the complete solution of the problem of the
                    motion of the balloon so far as velocity and height are concerned; it would not
                    be possible to connect the time and the height except by the performance of
                    another integration, for the practicability of which it would be necessary to
                    submit to some loss of generality, viz., we should have to regard <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> as small as compared to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and take
                    λ as small, and so on. The equation last written gives the motion until the
                    height (say <hi rend="italic">h)</hi> is attained at which the balloon becomes
                    quite full, after which the gas begins to escape, and we have the second case of
                    the problem.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding, however, to the discussion of this second case, it is worth
                    while to examine the solution more carefully, leaving out of consideration
                    quantities that make no very great difference in the practical result, for the
                    sake of simplicity. Supposing, then, gravity to be constant at all heights, and
                    λ to be zero, the equation of motion takes the simple form d.u <hi

                <p>The integral of this differential equation could be obtained in series as before,
                    only that the resulting equations would be more complicated. As we do not
                    propose to discuss the formulae obtained, it will be sufficient for our purpose
                    to deduce an approximate solution by neglecting V <hi rend="subscript">

                    neglecting the mass of the gas that has escaped during the ascent compared to
                    the mass of the whole balloon and appurtenances. It must fie borne in mind,
                    however, that when coal gas is used, and the ascent is to a great height, the
                    mass of gas that escapes is by no means insensible. The equation thus becomes or

                    zero, except when the balloon starts from the earth quite full. The general case
                    is, when the balloon is only partially filled on leaving; the previous equations
                    then hold until a height <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> at which it becomes quite

                    regards time, completely determined the motion of a balloon inflated with gas in
                    an atmosphere of constant temperature. The introduction of temperature would
                    modify the motion considerably, but in the present state of science it cannot be
                    taken into account.</p>
                <p>The general principle of the equilibrium of a fire-balloon is, of course,
                    identical with that of a gas-balloon; but the motion is different, as the degree
                    of buoyancy at each moment varies with the temperature of the air within the
                    balloon, and therefore with the heat of the furnace by which the air is warmed.
                    Dry air expands <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 273</hi>
                    d part of its volume for every increase of temperature of 1° centigrade, or <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 491</hi> th of its volume for
                    every increase of temperature of 1° Fahr. If, therefore, the air in an envelope
                    or bag be heated 60° Fahr. more than the surrounding air, the air within the bag
                    will expand <hi rend="superscript"> 60</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 491</hi> th
                    of its volume, and this air must therefore escape. The air within the bag weighs
                    less, therefore, than the air it displaces by the <hi rend="superscript">
                    60</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 551</hi> th part of the latter; and if the
                    weight of this be greater than the weight of the bag and appurtenances, the
                    latter will ascend. It is, therefore, always easy to calculate approximately the
                    ascensional power of a fire-balloon if the temperature of the surrounding air be
                    known, and also the mean temperature of the air within the balloon. Thus, let
                    the balloon contain V cubic feet of hot air at the temperature <hi rend="italic"
                    >t'</hi> (Fahr.), and let the temperature of the surrounding air be <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> (Fahr.) Also, suppose the weight of the balloon, car,
                    &amp;., is W lb, and let the barometer reading be <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    inches, then the ascensional power is equal to the weight of the air displaced -
                    weight of the heated air - W lb, viz., <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>•080728 lb being the weight of a cubic foot of air at temperature 32°, under the
                    pressure of one atmosphere, viz., when the reading of the barometer is 29∙922
                    in. Of course, the motion depends upon the temperature of the air in the balloon
                    as due to the furnace, if the latter is taken up with the balloon; but if the
                    air in the balloon is merely warmed, and the balloon then set free by itself,
                    the problem is an easy one, as the rate of cooling can be determined
                    approximately; but it is destitute of interest. We have said that dry air
                    increases its volume by <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    491</hi> th part for every increase of 1° (Fahr.), but the air is generally more
                    or less saturated with moisture. This second atmosphere, formed of the vapour of
                    water, is superposed over that of the air, as it were, and, in a very careful
                    consideration of the question, should be taken into account. Even, however, when
                    the air is completely saturated with moisture but little difference is produced;
                    so that for all practical purposes the presence of the vapour of water in the
                    air may be ignored. Of course the amount of vapour depends on the dew-point, and
                    tables of the pressure of the vapour of water at different temperatures are
                    given in most modern works on heat; but, as has been stated, the matter, in an
                    aeronautical point of view, is of very little importance. At first it was
                    supposed that the cause of the ascent of the balloon of the Montgolfiers was
                    traceable to the generation of gas and smoke from the damp straw which was set
                    light to; but the advance of science showed that the fire-balloon owed its
                    levity merely to the rarefaction of the air produced by the heat generated.</p>

                    the earth’s mean radius in feet. This was the formula used by Mr Glaisher for
                    the reduction of his observations. It is open to the obvious defect that the
                    temperature is assumed uniform, and equal to the mean of the temperatures at the
                    upper and lower stations; but till the law of decline of temperature is better
                    determined, perhaps this is as good an approximation to the truth as we can have
                    without introducing needless complication in the formula.</p>
                <p>A sphere is not a developable surface— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it cannot be
                    divided in any manner so as to admit of its being spread out flat upon a plane,
                    so that no spherical balloon could be made of <hi rend="italic">stiff</hi> plane
                    material. However, the silk or cotton of which balloons are manufactured is
                    sufficiently flexible to prevent any deviation from the sphere being noticeable.
                    Balloons are made in <hi rend="italic">gores,</hi> a gore being what, in
                    spherical trigonometry, is called a <hi rend="italic">lune,</hi> viz., the
                    surface enclosed between two meridians. The approximate shape of these gores is
                    very easy to calculate. Thus, let A B E C be a gore, then the sides ABE, ACE,
                    are not arcs of circles, but curves of sines, viz., PQ bears to DB the ratio
                    that sin AP does to sin A D, or, which comes to the same thing, supposing A D =
                    90°, and A P <hi rend="italic">= x°,</hi> then P Q = B D sin <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> o</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> It is thus
                    easy, by means of a table of natural sines, to form a pattern gore, whatever the
                    required number of gores may be. Thus, supposing there are to be <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> gores, then B C must be <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                    <hi rend="italic subscript"> n</hi> th of the circumference—</p>
                <p>viz., <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="italic subscript"> n</hi> ths of
                    AE; and BD</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">n</hi> and A D being given, any number of points can be found
                    on the curve ABE in the manner indicated above. A slight knowledge of spherical
                    trigonometry shows the reason for the above rule. Balloons, as usually
                    constructed, are spherical, except for the neck, which is made to slope down, so
                    that the whole <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n224/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0224-0207"/> shape resembles rather that of a pear. The
                    pattern gore should originally be made as if for a spherical balloon, and
                    afterwards the slight modification necessary for the formation of the neck
                    should be applied.</p>
                <p>The gores are sewn together, and a small portion of the upper end of each is cut
                    away, so as to leave an aperture at the top of the balloon of from 1 to 3 feet
                    in diameter. This space is occupied by the valve, which is generally made of
                    strong wood, and consists of two semicircular shutters hinged to a diameter of
                    the circular frame, and kept closed by a spring. The valve is opened by pulling
                    a string, technically called the valve-line, which passes down through the
                    balloon and out at the lower orifice in which the neck terminates. The net-work
                    which, like the gores, is attached to the circumferences of the valve, passes
                    over the surface of the balloon, and supports the ring or hoop from which the
                    car is suspended by half a dozen strong ropes, of perhaps 4 or 5 feet in length.
                    The network is thus stretched between the valve and the ring. It is very
                    important that all the ropes by which the car hangs from the ring should be so
                    adjusted that each may bear pretty nearly the same weight, as otherwise the
                    whole netting and balloon will be strained, and perhaps to a serious extent. The
                    car is usually merely a large basket made of wicker-work. The neck of the
                    balloon should be 7 or 8 feet above the car, so that the aeronaut can easily
                    reach it by mounting into the ring. The best material for the envelope is silk;
                    but on account of the expense cotton or alpaca is generally used: in all cases
                    it must be varnished, in order to render it more impervious to the gas. The
                    grapnel or anchor is a large five-pronged hook attached to the ring by a rope
                    100 or 120 feet long. The first care of the aeronaut on leaving the earth is to
                    lower the grapnel gently to the full extent that the rope will permit. Thus,
                    when the balloon is in the air, the grapnel hangs down below it, and when the
                    descent is being effected, is the first thing to touch the ground. If the
                    descent is well managed, and the balloon is moving downwards slowly, the weight
                    of which it is relieved when the grapnel is supported by the earth checks any
                    further descent, and the wind carries the balloon along horizontally, the
                    grapnel trailing over the ground until it catches in some obstruction and is
                    held fast. The balloon is then in much about the same position as a kite held by
                    a string, and if the wind be strong, plunges about wildly, striking the ground
                    and rebounding, until the aeronaut, by continued use of the valve-line, has
                    allowed sufficient gas to escape to deprive it of all buoyancy and prevent its
                    rising again.</p>
                <p>The chief danger attending ballooning lies in the descent; for if a strong wind
                    be blowing, the grapnel will sometimes trail for miles over the ground at the
                    rate of ten or twenty miles an hour, catching now and then in hedges, ditches,
                    roots of trees, &amp;c.; and, after giving the balloon a terrible jerk, breaking
                    loose again, till at length some obstruction, such as the wooded bank of a
                    stream, affords a firm hold. If the balloon has lost all its buoyant power by
                    the escape of the gas, the car also drags over the ground. But even a very rough
                    descent is usually not productive of any very serious consequences; as, although
                    the occupants of the car generally receive many bruises, and are perhaps cut by
                    the ropes, it rarely happens that anything worse occurs. On a day when the wind
                    is light (supposing that there is no want of ballast) nothing can be easier than
                    the descent, and the aeronaut can decide several miles off on the field in which
                    he will alight. It is very important to have a good supply of ballast, so as to
                    be able to check the rapidity of the descent, as in passing downwards through a
                    wet cloud the weight of the balloon is enormously increased by the water
                    deposited on it; and it there is no ballast to throw out to compensate this
                    accession of mass, the velocity is sometimes very great. It is also convenient,
                    if the district upon which the balloon is descending appear unsuitable for
                    landing, to be able to rise again. The ballast consists of fine baked sand,
                    which becomes so scattered as to be inappreciable before it has fallen far below
                    the balloon. It is taken up in bags containing about ⅜ cwt. each. The balloon at
                    starting is liberated by a spring catch which the aeronaut releases, and the
                    ballast should be so adjusted that there is nearly equilibrium before leaving,
                    else the rapidity of ascent is too great, and has to be checked by parting with
                    gas. It is almost impossible to liberate the balloon in such a way as to avoid
                    giving it a rotary motion about a vertical axis, which continues during the
                    whole time it is in the air. This rotation makes it difficult for those in the
                    car to discover in what direction they are moving; and it is only by looking
                    down along the rope to which the grapnel is suspended that the motion of the
                    balloon over the country below can be traced. We may mention that the upward and
                    downward motion at any instant is at once known by merely dropping over the side
                    of the car a small piece of paper: if the paper ascends or remains on the same
                    level or stationary, the balloon is descending; while, if it descends, the
                    balloon is ascending. This test is so delicate that it sometimes showed the
                    motion at a particular instant with more precision than did Mr Glaisher’s very
                    delicate instruments.</p>
                <p>Contrivances are often proposed by which the valve might be opened in less crude
                    ways than by merely pulling a string attached to it; by which the jerks produced
                    by the catching of the grapnel might be diminished, &amp;c. These improvements
                    are not adopted, because simplicity is requisite before everything. Any
                    mechanical contrivance might be broken and rendered useless by the first blow of
                    the car on the earth; whereas the primitive arrangements in use are such that
                    scarcely any rough treatment can impair their efficiency.</p>
