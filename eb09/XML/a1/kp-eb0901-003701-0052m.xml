                    the small and struggling Opposition had already been declared, and he at once
                    attached himself to the Whig party, with which he consistently acted throughout
                    life. In 1812 he was returned for Calne, which he continued to represent until
                    his elevation to the Scotch bench in 1830. During this lengthened period he
                    rendered conspicuous and valuable services to his party and the country. In
                    Scotch affairs he took, as was natural, a deep interest; and, by introducing, on
                    two separate occasions, a motion for the redress of a special glaring abuse, he
                    undoubtedly gave a strong impulse to the growing desire for a general reform. In
                    1824, and again in 1826, he presented a petition from the inhabitants of
                    Edinburgh, and followed it up by a motion “for leave to bring in a Bill for the
                    more effectual representation of the city of Edinburgh in the Commons House of
                    Parliament.” The motion was twice rejected, but by such narrow majorities as
                    showed that the monopoly of the self-elected Council of thirty-three was doomed.
                    In 1827, on the accession of the Whigs to power under Mr Canning, Abercromby
                    received the appointment of Judge-Advocate-General and Privy Counsellor. In 1830
                    he was raised to the judicial bench as Chief Baron of the Exchequer in Scotland.
                    The office was abolished in 1832; and almost contemporaneously, Edinburgh, newly
                    enfranchised, was called to return two members to the first reformed Parliament.
                    As the election marked the commencement of a new political era, the honour to be
                    conferred possessed a peculiar value, and the choice. of the citizens fell most
                    appropriately on Francis Jeffrey and James Abercromby, two of the foremost of
                    those to whom they were indebted for their hard-won privileges. In 1834 Mr
                    Abercromby obtained a seat in the cabinet of Lord Grey as Master of the Mint. On
                    the assembling of the new Parliament in 1835, the election of a speaker gave
                    occasion for the first trial of strength between the Reform party and the
                    followers of Sir Robert Peel. After a memorable division, in which more members
                    voted than had ever before been known, Abercromby was elected by 316 votes, to
                    310 recorded for Manners-Sutton. The choice was amply justified, not only by the
                    urbanity, impartiality, and firmness with which Abercromby discharged the public
                    duties of the chair, but also by the important reforms he introduced in regard
                    to the conduct of private business. In 1839 he resigned the office, and received
                    the customary honour of a peerage, with the title of Lord Dunfermline. The
                    evening of his life was passed in retirement at Colinton, near Edinburgh, where
                    he died on the 17th April 1858. The courage and sagacity which marked his entire
                    conduct as a Liberal were never more conspicuous than when, towards the close of
                    his life, he availed himself of an opportunity of practically asserting his
                    cherished doctrine of absolute religious equality. The important part he took in
                    originating and supporting the United Industrial School in Edinburgh for ragged
                    children, irrespective of their religious belief, deserves to be gratefully
                    acknowledged and remembered, even by those who took the opposite side in the
                    controversy which arose with regard to it.</p>
