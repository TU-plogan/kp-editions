                <p>TAKING a general view of the earth’s surface, the continent of Europe appears to
                    be no more than a great peninsula extending westward from the much vaster
                    continent of Asia. Its shores are deeply indented by two inland seas connected
                    by narrow straits with the Atlantic Ocean, and these in their turn are divided
                    into gulfs that penetrate still more deeply into the land, and form a number of
                    secondary peninsulas. The Mediterranean Sea, by its branches—the Gulf of Genoa,
                    the Adriatic, and the Aegean Sea—forms the Iberian, the Italian, and the Greek
                    peninsulas; and the Baltic Sea, extending northward into the Gulf of Bothnia,
                    forms on one side the great Scandinavian peninsula, and on the other that of
                    Denmark. Save the last, all these peninsulas of Europe are essentially mountain
                    regions, traversed by lofty chains that occupy a large portion of their surface.
                    But in height and importance these are much surpassed by a great mountain zone
                    stretching from the south-east of France to the frontiers of Hungary, and
                    between Italy and the plains of southern Germany, which is collectively known as
                    the Alps, and which must be considered as the most important feature in the
                    physical geography of our continent. Of the influence of this mountain system on
                    the climate of th® surrounding regions, on the distribution of animal and
                    vegetable life, and, indirectly, on the political condition of Europe, some
                    brief notice will here be given; but it may be well to remark that owing to the
                    peculiar disposition of the greater masses which form this system, the Alps do
                    not present so continuous a barrier as might be expected from a comparison with
                    other great mountain ranges.</p>

                <p>Thus if we take the great masses of the Himalaya in Asia, the Andes in South
                    America, or even such lesser ranges as the Pyrenees or the Great Atlas, we find
                    that they interpose a far more absolute limit between the regions lying on their
                    opposite flanks than occurs in respect to the Alps. These are formed of numerous
                    ranges divided by comparatively deep valleys, which, with many local exceptions,
                    tend towards parallelism with the general direction of the entire mass. This,
                    between Dauphiné and the borders of Hungary, forms a broad band convex towards
                    the north, and most of the main valleys lie between the directions west to east
                    and south-west to north-east. But in many parts deep transverse valleys
                    intersect the prevailing direction of the ridges, and facilitate the passage not
                    only for purposes of human intercourse, but also for the migration of animals
                    and plants, and for currents of air which mitigate the contrast that would
                    otherwise be found between the climates of the opposite slopes.</p>
                <p>The received opinion is, that the name Alps is derived from a Celtic root— <hi
                    rend="italic">alp</hi> or <hi rend="italic">alb—</hi> signifying height. This
                    has been connected by some writers with the Latin <hi rend="italic">alb,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">albus,</hi> white, referring to the colour of the peaks. Strabo
                    says that the name ῎Aλπια was formerly ῎Aλβια. <hi rend="italic">Alp</hi> in
                    south Germany— <hi rend="italic">alpa</hi> in old High German—is exclusively
                    applied to mountain pastures. For the present the derivation must remain
                    somewhat uncertain.</p>
                <p>To define the precise limits of the Alps, as will be seen fully in describing the
                    several groups, is a somewhat arbitrary operation. To the W. they extend through
                    a large portion of the French departments of Savoie, Haute-Savoie, Hautes Alpes,
                    and Basses Alpes, being divided from the mountain district of the Cevennes by
                    the broad and deep valley through which the Rhone flows from Lyons to the
                    Mediterranean. The Jura range, usually regarded as distinct from the Alps, is
                    nevertheless closely connected on one side with the outer ranges of the Alps of
                    western Savoy, and on the other with those of northern Switzerland. On the N.
                    side the Alps are definitely bounded by the lake of Constance, the plain of
                    Bavaria, and the low country extending from Salzburg to the neighbourhood of
                    Vienna. By these they are completely separated from the mountainous districts of
                    central Germany, which extend through western Bohemia and Saxony in one
                    direction to the Hartz mountains, and in the other to the Sudeten, or
                    Riesengebirge, of Silesia. Hence it happens that the drainage of the northern
                    slopes of the Alps flows either to the North Sea through the Rhine, or is
                    diverted through the Danube to the Black Sea, and no portion of it reaches the
                    Baltic. The eastern limit of the Alps is not easily defined with accuracy. The
                    region of high hills, chiefly formed of tertiary strata, that extends from the
                    left bank of the Mur into Hungary is continued by the north side of Lake Balaton
                    to the Danube near Buda; and some geographers see in the hilly district that
                    stretches thence to the northern Carpathians a connection between that range and
                    the Alps. For practical purposes it seems that the line of depression, partly
                    formed by the valley of the Mur, through which the railway is carried from
                    Vienna to Laybach, may be considered as the eastern boundary of the Alpine
                    chain. On the southern side the difficulty of fixing the precise limits of the
                    Alpine chain is still more apparent. For a distance of some 350 miles, from the
                    neighbourhood of Turm to that of Gorizia, the boundary is sufficiently obvious.
                    The mountains subside into the continuous plain which includes the greater part
                    of Piedmont, Lombardy, and Venetia; and their drainage is all borne eastward to
                    the Adriatic. But on the west side of Piedmont the Alpine chain dividing Italy
                    from France extends nearly due southward till it approaches to the Mediterranean
                    in the neighbourhood of Nice. About 40 miles north of this city, that which,
                    from its superior height and its geological structure, we call the main chain,
                    is bent round from west to cast in a curve, slightly convex towards the south,
                    till it becomes parallel to the Mediterranean shore, and is merged in the chain
                    of the Apennines. For reasons hereafter mentioned it would appear that the
                    limits of the Alps in this direction may best be fixed at the Col d’Altare, west
                    of Savona, though the boundary commonly adopted is that of the Col di Tenda,
                    lying considerably farther to the west. At the southeastern extremity of the
                    Alpine chain the difficulty of fixing its limits arises rather from the vague
                    use of geographical terms by ancient and modern writers than from the physical
                    structure of the region. Taking no account of the arbitrary proceedings of
                    geographers who have included in the Alps the mountains dividing Bosnia from
                    Croatia and Dalmatia, and regarding only the natural features of the country, it
                    seems clear that the south-eastern extremity of the Alps must be looked for in
                    the group of lofty peaks between the head waters of the Isonzo and those of the
                    Save, whose highest summit is the Terglou; and if we are not to include all the
                    mountain ranges of European Turkey and Greece within the same designation, the
                    plateau of the Karst must be held to form the boundary between these and the
                    Alps. Within these limits the Alps extend from about the 44th to the 48th
                    parallel of N. lat., and from about 5° 10' to 18° 10' E. long.</p>
                <p>In every mountain system geographers are disposed to regard the watershed, or
                    boundary dividing the waters flowing towards Opposite sides of the range, as
                    marking the main chain; and this usage is often justified by the fact that the
                    highest peaks lie on, or very near, the boundary so defined. In applying this
                    term in the case of the Alps, there are, however, difficulties arising from
                    their great extent and the number of their branches and ramifications. Many of
                    the loftiest groups lie altogether on one side of that which we call the main
                    chain, and at the eastern extremity, where all the drainage is ultimately borne
                    to the Black Sea, we must be partly guided by geological considerations in
                    deciding which of several ranges deserves to be considered pre-eminent.</p>
                <p>Starting from the pass of Altare or Cadibona, west of Savona, the main chain
                    extends first south-west, then nearly due west, to the Col di Tenda, but nowhere
                    rising beyond the zone of coniferous trees. ^ Beyond that limit the range is
                    more lofty, and includes four peaks exceeding 10,000 feet in height, till the
                    line dividing the waters flowing to the Adriatic, through the Po, from the short
                    streams that flow into the Gulf of Genoa, reaches the Mont Enchastraye. Beyond
                    that point, although the line of watershed is very sinuous, its general
                    direction for a distance of about 75 miles is nearly due north. On the east side
                    the waters run to the Po; on the west they flow through the Durance to join the
                    Rhone near Avignon. The most considerable peaks in the range immediately north
                    of the Mont Enchastraye are the Grand Rioburent and the Aiguille de Chambeyron;
                    but these are much surpassed by the Monte Viso, which is the highest peak in the
                    range dividing Piedmont from Dauphiné. On the north side of Monte Viso the main
                    chain diminishes much in average height, and presents no prominent peaks until
                    we reach the Mont Tabor. That summit forms the apex of a salient angle which the
                    main chain here presents on the side of France. For a distance of about 28 miles
                    this extends eastward to the prominent peak of the Roche Melon, which may be
                    considered as a re-entering angle in the great rampart by which Italy is guarded
                    from her northern neighbours. Here the main chain resumes its northerly
                    direction, and attains a greater average height than it had previously
                    exhibited. Several of the prominent peaks in the range connecting the Roche
                    Melon with Mont <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n658/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0658-0621"/> Blanc exceed 11,000 English feet in height,
                    though they are much surpassed by the highest group of the Graian Alps, lying on
                    the side of Piedmont, and that of the Tarentaise Alps in Savoy; while there is
                    in this part of the main range but one considerable depression, which is that
                    crossed by the road of the Little St Bernard. In the range crowned by the summit
                    of Mont Blanc the Alpine chain attains its highest elevation. From thence to the
                    Pass of St Gotthard its general direction varies between east and north-east. To
                    the east of Mont Blanc a comparatively low tract allows of several comparatively
                    easy passes between Switzerland and Piedmont, one of which has long been famous
                    as the Pass of the Great St Bernard; but from that to the Simplon Pass, a
                    distance of about 52 miles in a straight line, or about 75 miles if measured
                    along the watershed, the main chain preserves a greater average height than in
                    any other part. Several peaks lying in the dividing ridge, such as the Grand
                    Combin, Matterhorn, Lyskamm, and Monte Rosa, exceed 14,000 feet in height; and
                    these are rivalled by at least six summits on the north side of the same ridge,
                    which at two points only sinks below the level of 10,000 feet. The Simplon Pass
                    corresponds to what may be called a dislocation of the main chain. From thence
                    to the St Gotthard the dividing ridge runs nearly due north-east, and does not
                    present any dominant summit excepting the Monte Leone. On the east and
                    south-east side of the St Gotthard Pass, as far as that of the Maloya, the line
                    of watershed between the affluents of the Rhine and that of the Po is determined
                    by what may be called accidental conditions. The chief mountain ridges, which
                    culminate in the Cima Camadra, Piz Valrhein, and Tambohorn, instead of being
                    arranged along the parting of the waters, lie in a transverse direction, and
                    hence the natural frontier of Italy is here more broken and irregular than
                    elsewhere; and it is only on the south side of the Maloya Pass that the main
                    chain assumes a tolerably continuous direction from west-south-west to
                    east-north-east, as between Piz Güz and the Bernina Pass it rises into the lofty
                    group whose dominant peaks are Piz Tremoggia, Piz Bernina, and Piz Cambrena.
                    Eastward of the Bernina Pass the same direction is preserved, and in the range
                    including the Corno di Campo, Monte Zembrasca, and Monte Foscagno the level
                    scarcely sinks below 9000 feet; but beyond the last-named summit, in the space
                    lying between the Lower Engadine, the head waters of the Adige, and those of the
                    Adda, the semblance of a continuous ridge forming the watershed between the Inn
                    and the Adriatic altogether disappears. If we adhere to the usage of designating
                    as the main chain the ridges which part the waters flowing in different
                    directions, it must be owned that the disposition of the chief mountain masses
                    has no connection with the direction of that chain. Lying between the great mass
                    of the Orteles Alps to the south and the considerable group of the Silvretta
                    Alps on the north side of the Inn, the greater part of the mass in question is
                    drained by streams that flow into the latter river; but the arrangement of the
                    valleys seems to be largely due to erosive action. Few summits in this part of
                    the main chain exceed 10,000 feet, the highest being Piz Scesvenna, on the east
                    side of Val Scarla.</p>
                <p>The break in the continuity of the Alpine chain marked by the deep valley through
                    which the main branch of the Adige descends, first southward and then eastward
                    from its source to Meran and Botzen, is one of the most remarkable features in
                    the orography of the Alps. The little lake which is regarded as the chief source
                    of the river lies within less than five miles of the Inn, where that river
                    enters the Tyrol, and no apparent barrier divides the lake from the Inn valley.
                    Eastward of this limit the Alpine chain exhibits a degree of order in its
                    general arrangement which it is impossible to trace in its western and central
                    portions. For a distance of some 250 miles a broad zone of crystalline rocks
                    extends from west to east, flanked on the north and south sides by parallel
                    zones of sedimentary rocks, chiefly belonging to the older secondary formations.
                    Two great valley systems on the opposite sides of the central zone closely
                    coincide with those geological boundaries, and mark out in the physical aspect
                    of this region the limits between the central and the secondary zones. In the
                    former are situated all the highest peaks of the eastern Alps. For a distance of
                    about 140 miles, from the Schafkogel, south-east of Nauders, to the
                    Markkahrspitz, the average level of the main chain is nearly as high as in any
                    equally long section of the central or western Alps. There is one very
                    considerable depression which is marked by the Brenner Pass, but elsewhere in
                    that long barrier there are but three points where the range is passable by
                    beasts of burden. Between the two main sources of the Adige, at the Reschen
                    Scheideck and the Brenner Pass, the considerable groups of the Oetzthal and
                    Stubay Alps attain a great average elevation, though two points only—the
                    Wildspitz and the Weisskugel—surpass the level of 12,000 feet. The drainage of
                    these groups is mostly carried to the Inn, and the line of watershed, about 53
                    miles in length, is much less direct than in the more easterly portion of the
                    chain. This extends nearly due east for about 90 miles from the Brenner Pass,
                    nowhere falling below the level of 8000 feet, and in two prominent peaks—the
                    Gross Venediger and the Gross Glockner—rising considerably above the limit of
                    12,000 feet. At a point somewhat north of the Markkahrspitz the central chain
                    divides into two parallel ranges, between which lies the upper valley of the
                    Mur. This river flows for a distance of fully 80 miles nearly due east, till at
                    Bruck-an-der-Mur it turns southward to approach the Drave, and ultimately joins
                    that stream. Various reasons combine to induce geographers to regard the more
                    northern of the two ranges above mentioned, which divides the Enns and other
                    minor tributaries of the Danube from those of the Drave, as constituting the
                    eastern extremity of the main chain of the Alps. This extends a little north of
                    due east for more than 110 miles, with a comparatively low mean elevation, from
                    the Arlscharte to the Semmering Pass, which we regard as the eastern limit of
                    the main chain of the Alps.</p>
                <p>Measured along the watershed, as above defined, but without taking into account
                    the minor sinuosities, which would considerably increase the total, the length
                    of the main chain is about 790 English miles.</p>
                <p>For ages before there existed any correct knowledge of the configuration of the
                    Alpine chain, the needs of war and commerce had urged the people dwelling on the
                    opposite sides of the great barrier to seek out the easiest and most direct
                    routes for traversing it. Hence the chief passes of the Alps have been known and
                    frequented from a period antecedent to authentic history, while until a quite
                    modern period little attention was given to the parts of the chain which did not
                    lie in or near the lines of traffic. It is highly probable that many other
                    passes, affording the easiest means of communication between adjacent valleys,
                    have been known and used by the native population from a very remote period, but
                    only those which served for international purposes of war or peace became known
                    at a distance, and are alluded to by ancient writers. A pass is a depression
                    between two adjacent mountains, and the track is usually carried over the lowest
                    part of that depression; but nevertheless nearly all the passes of the Alps
                    involve a long ascent to reach the summit, and a long descent upon the opposite
                    slopes. Hence the Romans, who were the first semi-civilised people to make
                    extensive <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n659/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0659-0622"/> use of the Alpine passes, applied to each of them
                    the term <hi rend="italic">Mons.</hi> The same names, more or less modified in
                    the middle ages, have been preserved in the dialects of Latin origin that
                    prevail throughout the western half of the Alpine chain, and the modern name for
                    the chief passes are still Mont Genévre, Mont Cenis, Mont Iséran, Petit Mont St
                    Bernard, Grand Mont St Bernard, Monte Moro, and Monte San Gottardo. In more
                    recent times, since geographers have attempted to fix the names and positions of
                    the chief summits of the Alps, they have been continually misled by the
                    supposition that a name of high antiquity designating a mountain must belong to
                    some prominent peak. The errors arising from that source have not yet
                    disappeared from geographical works of high repute, but in point of fact each of
                    the names above enumerated belongs solely to the pass, and there is no
                    neighbouring peak entitled to the same designation. The more important passes of
                    the Alps are enumerated in the following description of the chief groups of the
                    Alps; but it may be here remarked that the direction of the main routes for
                    traffic is not exclusively determined by the position of the lowest and easiest
                    passes over the main chain. The configuration of the mountains is such that a
                    traveller proceeding from Italy to France, Switzerland, or Germany, after
                    crossing a comparatively easy pass over the main chain, may find it necessary to
                    traverse a second and loftier pass over a lateral chain, or else follow a
                    circuitous route that may double the length of his journey. Thus a traveller
                    going from Turin to Lyons, who should take what appears to be the direct course
                    over the pass of Mont Genévre, the easiest in the whole range of the western
                    Alps, will find on descending to Briançon that he must cross the much higher and
                    more difficult pass of the Col de Lautaret, or else descend along the Durance
                    till it emerges into the lower country near Gap, and thus more than double the
                    length of his journey. Including the Semmering Pass, there are now not less than
                    60 Alpine passes that are traversed by carriage roads; and besides three lines
                    of railway now open for traffic, several others are in course of
                    construction.</p>
                <p>From the time of Julius Caesar downwards, the Romans, in the prosecution of their
                    policy of universal dominion, or for the purpose of maintaining communication
                    with their military colonies, had become acquainted with all the easiest and
                    most serviceable passes of the Alps, and were thus naturally led to attach names
                    to the chief groups. As their acquaintance with the entire region was very
                    incomplete, the exact boundaries of these groups were imperfectly understood,
                    and the denominations adopted by them were never accurately defined. As might
                    have been expected, the divisions thus roughly established had reference rather
                    to the aspect of the mountains as presented to one travelling from Italy towards
                    the north or west, than to a general view of the physical conformation of the
                    entire region. Hence the ancient divisions are essentially defective, as taking
                    no note of some important groups, or including under a single designation groups
                    entirely distinct. Notwithstanding these defects, the ancient divisions have
                    been adhered to by all but a few modem geographers, and it is therefore
                    desirable to record them separately.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Maritime Alps</hi> (Alpes Maritimae).—These included the
                    portion of the main chain dividing south-western Piedmont from the coast of the
                    Mediterranean, and extending northward to the neighbourhood of the conspicuous
                    peak of Monte Viso.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Cottian Alps</hi> (Alpes Cottiae or Cottianae) included the
                    portion of the main chain dividing Piedmont from Dauphine and Savoy, and
                    extending from Monte Viso to the neighbourhood of the Mont Cenis. The name
                    appears to be derived from Cottius, the king or chief of a powerful tribe who
                    ruled the greater part of this region when the paramount authority of Augustus
                    was established in Cisalpine Gaul.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Graian Alps</hi> (Alpes Graiae).—Under this designation was
                    known the great group of mountains between Turin and the upper Val d’Aosta, and
                    the portion of the main chain lying between the Mont Cenis and the Little St
                    Bernard. Pliny and other Latin writers derive the name from the legendary
                    passage of a body of Greeks led by Hercules through this region; but the true
                    derivation is probably from some lost Celtic appellation.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Pennine Alps</hi> (Alpes Penninae) was the name applied to
                    the great range including Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa, which, from the time of
                    Julius Caesar, if not earlier, was recognised as the highest portion of the
                    entire chain. The word Pen or Ben is still in use in the living dialects of the
                    Celtic stock as a common designation for a conspicuous mountain, and was
                    certainly in use in the speech of this part of Cisalpine Gaul, where many other
                    Celtic terms are preserved in the local names. The Roman designation <hi
                    rend="italic">Jupiter Penninus</hi> was undoubtedly taken from the Celtic root,
                    but the asserted use of the name Pen for a divinity by the native tribes is not
                    established by valid evidence.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Lepontine Alps</hi> (Alpes Lepontinae).—It would appear that
                    this denomination was originally restricted to the parts of the main chain lying
                    on either side of the pass of St Gotthard, including the sources of the river
                    Ticino, with those of its tributaries, of which the most important is the Tosa
                    or Toccia, draining the range between the neighbourhood of the Simplon Pass and
                    that of the Gries. The name is derived from the Lepontii, a tribe of doubtful
                    extraction (Rhaetian, according to Strabo) who inhabited the main valley of the
                    Tessin or Ticino, the upper part of which is still called Val Leventina. The
                    eastern limit of this group was usually fixed at the pass of San Bernardino.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Rhaetian</hi><hi rend="italic">Alps</hi> (Alpes Rhaeticae)
                    derived their name from the Rhaeti, a powerful tribe or nation holding a large
                    tract of territory which appears to have extended from the sources of the Rhine
                    and the Ticino on the west, to those of the Adige and the Salza on the east. The
                    area included under this vague heading is at least equal in area to that of the
                    five divisions hitherto enumerated.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Noric Alps</hi> (Alpes Noricae).—Under this name the entire
                    region lying north of the Drave, and extending thence to the valley of the
                    Danube on the north and the plains of Hungary on the east, was included.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Carnic Alps</hi> (Alpes Camicae).—This name was given to the
                    mountain tract lying between the upper Drove and the low country of Friuli. By
                    some writers it has been limited to the ranges that feed the Tagliamento (<hi
                    rend="italic">Tilaυentus)</hi> and its tributaries; by others the range seems to
                    have been held to extend from the sources of the Piave to those of the Save. The
                    name Carnia is still in use in Friuli, but is strictly limited to the basin of
                    the Tagliamento.</p>

                    </choice><hi rend="italic">Julian Alps</hi> (Alpes Juliae).—This designation has
                    been still more vaguely used by ancient and modem geographers than any of the
                    preceding. The lofty group of peaks crowned by the Terglou, and lying between
                    the head waters of the Isonzo and those of the Save, undoubtedly forms the chief
                    nucleus of the group distinguished by this name; but it also appears to have
                    included the ranges of eastern Friuli, which province, as well as the Alps in
                    question, took its name from the Roman Forum Julii, now known as Cividale. By
                    others, and even by contemporary Italian writers, the term Julian Alps is made
                    to extend southward through the district of Karst between Camiola and the shores
                    of the Adriatic, and thence through Croatia to the frontiers of Bosnia. A great
                    part of this district is an undulating plateau, in part not attaining to 2000
                    feet above the sea-level, to which by no stretch of language can the term Alps
                    be properly applied.</p>
                <p>In addition to the groups above mentioned some writers have enumerated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dinaric Alps</hi> (Alpes Dinaricae), and include under that term
                    the mountain range extending along the western frontier of Bosnia. This is a
                    portion of the extensive mountain system of European Turkey, which in one
                    direction includes the Balkan, and in another is continued through Albania into
                    Greece. The Romans probably applied to these the designation Alps as some of
                    their later writers did to the Pyrenees and the mountains of southern Spain; but
                    it can merely cause confusion to speak of them as a portion of the great system
                    to which the name Alps specially applies. , For the reasons already mentioned it
                    is impossible to regard the ancient groups above enumerated as affording a
                    satisfactory division of the region under consideration; but so far as they can
                    be made to correspond with the divisions suggested by a more exact knowledge of
                    its physical configuration, it seems desirable to retain the established
                    nomenclature.</p>
                <p>Actual observation of the Alpine region through the greater part of its extent,
                    or even the careful study of accurate models, must convince any one who seeks to
                    divide it into groups that it is not possible to do this by adhering rigidly to
                    any single test or rule. In a general way, it is natural and desirable to
                    include under the same name mountain masses that are not divided by a broad and
                    deep opening; but it is sometimes more convenient to include in one group
                    disjoined masses that have some natural connexion with each other, rather than
                    multiply groups to an inconvenient extent. In some cases the geological
                    structure may supply a rational ground for preferring one arrangement to
                    another, when the choice would otherwise be arbitrary; and in a few cases it may
                    be well to yield something to ancient usage, based upon political <pb break="no"

                    the Alps is so recent that few attempts have been made to establish a general
                    division of the entire region, and it cannot be said that any one arrangement
                    has obtained such' general recognition as not to be open to future modification;
                    but there is a pretty general agreement as to the main features of that here
                    proposed, to which a few general remarks must be premised.</p>
                <p>Whatever may have been the original cause of those disturbances of the earth’s
                    crust to which great mountain chains owe their existence, it is generally,
                    though not universally, true that the higher masses (formed of rocks
                    geologically more ancient) are found towards the central part, and that these
                    are flanked by lower ranges, composed of more recent rocks, which surround the
                    central groups very much as an outer line of entrenchment may be seen to
                    surround a fort. In most cases it is not possible to descend continuously in a
                    nearly direct line from the crest of a great mountain chain to the plains on
                    either side, for there are usually intermediate valleys, running more or less
                    parallel to the central range, which separate this from outer secondary ranges.
                    These, in their turn, are often accompanied by external ranges, intermediate
                    between them and the plains, and related to them as they are to the central
                    ranges. The type of arrangement here described is more or less traceable
                    throughout the greater part of the Alps, but is most distinctly exhibited in the
                    eastern portion lying between the Adige and the frontier of Hungary. We have a
                    central range, composed mainly of crystalline rock; a northern range, formed of
                    secondary rocks, separated from the first by the great valleys of the Inn, the
                    Salza, and the Enns; a southern range, somewhat similar to the last in
                    geological structure, divided from the central one by the Rienz, or east branch
                    of the Adige, and the Drave. Flanking the whole, as an external entrenchment on
                    the north side, are the outer ranges of the Bavarian Alps, of the Salzkammergut,
                    and of Upper Austria, to which correspond on the south side the Monti Lessini,
                    near Verona, the mountains of Recoaro, those of the Sette Comuni, and the
                    considerable masses crowned by the summits of the Grappa, the Col Vicentino, the
                    Monte Cavallo, the Monte Matajur, and Monte Nanos. Where, as in the cases above
                    mentioned, the secondary ranges of the Alps rise to a greater altitude, and are
                    completely separated from the neighbouring portions of the central chain, it is
                    impossible not to distinguish them as distinct groups; but the outermost ranges,
                    which rarely rise above the forest zone, are in all cases regarded as appendages
                    of the adjoining groups. These outer ranges are called in German <hi
                    rend="italic">Voralpen,</hi> and in Italian <hi rend="italic">Prealpi,</hi> and
                    it is to be desired that equivalents should be introduced in other European
                    languages. A complete catalogue of the peaks and passes of the Alps would exceed
                    the limits of this article, but it seems desirable to append to each of the main
                    groups in the following arrangement the names of the more conspicuous summits,
                    with the height of each above the sea-level in English feet. No limit of
                    absolute height has been fixed in selecting the peaks here enumerated, as the
                    highest summits of the less lofty groups would appear insignificant in those
                    whose average elevation is much greater. The more important passes are also
                    enumerated, distinguishing those traversed — (1) by carriage road, (2) by
                    bridle-path, practicable for beasts of burden, and (3) by footpath; and (4) snow
                    passes, involving the necessity of crossing snow-fields or glacier <hi

                    ridges divides the upper valley of the Ubaye from that of the Verdon, and sends
                    out a branch which separates the latter from the Bléone. A third ridge divides
                    the Verdon from the Var, and a fourth separates this from its main affluent, the
                    Tinéa. As already mentioned, the range extending S.E. from Mont Enchastraye is
                    regarded as the main chain of the Maritime Alps, and extends, with numerous
                    diverging secondary ridges, in a curved line, gradually approaching nearer to
                    the coast till it is merged in the chain of the Apennines. To fix the limit
                    between the Alps and the Apennines in this direction is necessarily a somewhat
                    arbitrary process, and different criteria may be applied with different results;
                    but it seems most natural to fix on the depression west of Savona known as the
                    Col d’Altare or Col di Cadibona, over which the road is carried which leads in
                    one direction to Alessandria, and in the other to Mondovi. This is by far the
                    lowest depression in the barrier dividing the Adriatic from the Mediterranean,
                    the summit being only 1608 feet above the sealevel; and during the Miocene epoch
                    it formed a strait connecting those seas. In modem times the project of
                    utilising the same pass for the construction of a canal to connect the Po with
                    the Gulf of Genoa is an illustration of its geographical significance. On the
                    north side of the Mont Enchastraye, a comparatively low pass, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Col de l’Argentiére,</hi> divides that mountain from the adjoining portion of
                    the main chain. This might properly be regarded as the northern limit of the
                    Maritime Alps, but ancient usage has included in that group the ranges that
                    enclose the Val Maira, and separate it on one side from the Stura di Demonte,
                    and on the other from the Vraita. Conforming to that practice, we fix the
                    northern limit of the Maritime Alps at the Col de Longet, S.E. of the peak of
                    Monte Viso, connecting the head of Val Vraita in Pied-mont with the sources of
                    the Ubaye in France.</p>

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Cottian Alps.—</hi> In the well-known panorama presented to
                    an observer who takes his stand on the Superga, or some other eminence near
                    Turin, the most distant objects are the peaks of the Maritime Alps south of
                    Cuneo and, exactly in the opposite direction, the great mass of Monte Rosa. In
                    the western horizon, subtended by this chord, about 120 miles in length, the eye
                    follows the irregular curve traced out by the main peaks of the western Alps,
                    that separate upper Italy from France. More than any other part of the Alpine
                    chain, this is characterised by extreme irregularity in the disposition of the
                    mountain masses and the chief valleys. On the west side the prevailing<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n661/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0661-0624"/> direction seems to be from south-west to
                    north-east, while on the east side it is more nearly from west to east; but the
                    valleys and the ridges that enclose them are often curved or irregularly
                    sinuous. Convenience seems to confirm immemorial usage in subdividing this
                    region into two or more groups; but it is not easy to decide how this is to be
                    effected. The great valley of the Dora Riparia, and the low passes connecting it
                    with the valley of the Durance, seem to afford the most natural division.
                    Ancient and modern usage being alike opposed to this, it appears that the valley
                    of the Orco in Piedmont and that of the Arc in Savoy, with the connecting pass
                    of the Col del Carro, may best be taken as the boundary between the northern and
                    southern portions. The latter is distinguished as the group of the Cottian Alps.
                    This includes a number of secondary ridges that extend from the main chain on
                    the side of Piedmont, with a general direction from west to east; and on the
                    French side one considerable range, stretching southwest from the neighbourhood
                    of Monte Viso, that divides the Ubaye from the Guil, besides a lesser parallel
                    ridge lying between the Guil and the head waters of the Durance.</p>

                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Dauphiné</hi><hi rend="italic">Alps.—</hi> On the west side
                    of the Cottian Alps, and separated from these by the broad valley of the
                    Durance, rises a group of lofty peaks, surpassing them considerably in height,
                    and almost completely isolated from their neighbours. This group has not usually
                    been included amongst the Cottian Alps by geographers, and it is more natural to
                    regard it as the nucleus of a distinct division constituting the Dauphiné Alps.
                    On the north side of this central mass, and separated by the valley of the
                    Romanche and the Col de Lautaret, is a considerable group, including three
                    principal ridges, whose direction is nearly due north and south, separated from
                    the neighbouring mountains of Savoy by the deep valleys of the Arc and the
                    Isère, which may best be regarded as an outlying portion of this division. On
                    the south side of the main group another outlying mass, which on one side feeds
                    the chief sources of the Drac, and on the other several short tributaries to the
                    Durance, must also be included in this division. The ranges of secondary rocks
                    lying west of the broad valley between Grenoble and Chambéry, which are
                    geologically and orographically a southern extension of the chain of the Jura,
                    are at the same time exactly parallel to the northern ranges of the Dauphiné
                    Alps, and must be regarded as the outer range or “Border Alps” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Voralpen)</hi> of the group. The only doubt in fixing the limits of the
                    Dauphiné Alps is as to the boundary between their northern group and the
                    adjoining mass of the Cottian Alps. It seems that this may best be fixed at the
                    <hi rend="italic">Col de Galibier,</hi> connecting the chier source of the
                    Durance with the valley of Valloires in Savoy.</p>

                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Graian Alps.—</hi> The lofty group of snowy mountains lying
                    between the plain of Piedmont and Mont Blanc has from a remote period borne the
                    designation Graian Alps. To the north they are bounded by the Val d’Aosta, and
                    to the south by the valley of the Orco; but on the west side the boundary is not
                    so easily determined. The portion of the main chain dividing Savoy from
                    Piedmont, between the Levana and Mont Blanc, must undoubtedly be included in
                    this division; but it is not so easy to determine the relations of a group of
                    lofty summits that are divided from the rest of the Graian Alps by the upper
                    valley of the Isère, filling the space between the upper course of that river
                    and that of the Arc. This is further geologically distinguished by the fact that
                    the higher summits are chiefly composed of nearly unaltered sedimentary rocks.
                    This group has by some writers been associated with the mountains of Beaufort,
                    lying between the Isère and the Arly, to form, with some subordinate branches, a
                    group of south Savoy Alps; but we prefer to adhere to the older usage of those
                    who have united them with the Graian Alps. The exact boundary between these and
                    the Mont Blanc group may best be fixed at the pass of the Little St Bernard, the
                    lowest in the main chain between the Mont Cenis and the Simplon.</p>

                    >—</hi> The portion of the great chain that includes the peaks of Mont Blanc and
                    Monte Rosa has always been recognised as the most important among the divisions
                    of the Alps. This pre-eminence is due not only to its surpassing height, but to
                    the fact that its peaks are so conspicuous. Throughout the plain of Upper Italy,
                    from Turin to Milan, and even as far as the slopes of the Apennines, Monte Rosa,
                    with its attendant peaks, is commonly the most remarkable object in the northern
                    horizon; while in western Switzerland, and as far westward as the heights above
                    Lyons, the dome of Mont Blanc, rising in the distant eastern horizon, attracts
                    the frequent attention alike of natives and strangers. Some doubts may arise as
                    to the precise limits that should be assigned to this group. Towards the
                    north-east it is generally agreed that the Simplon Pass is the most natural
                    limit. In the opposite direction most writers have fixed on the Col de Bonhomme,
                    south-west of Mont Blanc, as the proper boundary; but it seems reasonable in a
                    general arrangement to regard the range extending from the last-named pass to
                    Grand Coeur, in the valley of the Isère, as a south-western prolongation of the
                    range of Mont Blanc. From the portion of the main chain connecting the Mont
                    Combin with Monte Rosa, numerous branches, with peaks that rival these in
                    height, diverge northward. The secondary ranges that extend on the side of
                    Italy, southward and eastward from Monte Rosa, are much inferior in altitude. On
                    the north and west sides of Mont Blanc an extensive mountain district, including
                    the French department of Haute Savoie, must be considered as an appendage to the
                    group of the Pennine Alps. On the south side, the short range extending parallel
                    to that of Mont Blanc, from Courmayeur to the Val de Bellaval, corresponding to
                    the range of the Aiguilles Rouges and the Brévent, on the opposite side, may
                    best be included within the group of the Pennine Alps.</p>

                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Bernese Alps.—</hi> There is no considerable mass of Alpine
                    summits whose boundaries are better defined than that which is generally known
                    as the group of the Bernese Alps. By the number and height of the peaks, that
                    rise far above the limits of perpetual snow, it ranks next in importance to the
                    Pennine group; and its position with reference to that group has largely
                    contributed to the fame of the region which they occupy for a marvellous and
                    almost unique combination of grandeur and variety. The most characteristic
                    feature in the orography of Switzerland is the great valley system that extends
                    in a nearly direct line from Martigny to Coire—interrupted, it is true, by two
                    passes (the Furka and Oberalp) of small elevation compared to the surrounding
                    heights. On the opposite sides of this great trench the chief groups of the
                    central Alps are arranged in masses that, amid much apparent irregularity,
                    approach to parallelism with the direction of the central valley. Hence the
                    traveller who attains any considerable height on either side sees over against
                    him the dominant summits of the opposite group in constantly varying
                    combination. The highest groups (the Pennine and Bernese) are so placed that the
                    chief peaks on the one side are rarely more than 20 miles apart from their
                    rivals in the opposite chain, and the projecting summits of the secondary ridges
                    between them afford panoramic views of wonderful beauty and grandeur. What may
                    be called the main chain of the Bernese Alps, forming the boundary between the
                    Swiss cantons of Bern and Valais, extends parallel to the course of the Rhone,
                    from the glacier which is the main source of that river, to Martigny, a distance
                    of about 70 miles; and we must regard as a dependency of that chain the mountain
                    district that lies on its northern side, between the upper course of the Aar and
                    the head of the Lake of Geneva. Desiring to adhere to the divisions of the Alps
                    admitted by ancient geographers, many modern writers have included the Bernese
                    group among the Lepontine Alps; but this arrangement is not consistent with any
                    rational criterion that can be applied. The only question admitting of doubt is
                    as to the eastern limit of this group. The Aar issues from its parent glacier at
                    a point very near to the chief source of the Rhone, and separated only by a
                    comparatively deep and broad depression, the Grimsel Pass; and it might appear
                    that the Bernese Alps should be defined as the group enclosed between those
                    rivers. But some ten miles east of the Grimsel Pass the range lying north of the
                    great valley of Switzerland is completely cut through by the valley of the
                    Reuss, where that stream descends towards the Lake of Lucerne through the famous
                    defile of the Devil’s Bridge; and as it would be inconvenient to reckon the
                    comparatively small group that lies between the head waters of the Reuss and
                    those of the Aar as a separate division, we prefer to include this as a portion
                    of the Bernese Alps.</p>

                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">North Swiss Alps.—</hi> Attention has already been called to
                    the great line of valley that traverses Switzerland from Martigny to Coire. The
                    range of high peaks lying on the north side of this valley is interrupted at one
                    point only, where the Reuss flows through the deep defile of the Devil’s Bridge
                    from Andermatt to Altdorf, and this breach in the continuity of the range has
                    been here regarded as the eastern limit of the Bernese Alps. The range extending
                    eastward from that boundary to the neighbourhood of Coire might perhaps be
                    considered as a prolongation of the range of the Bernese Alps; but independently
                    of the inconvenience of assigning such wide boundaries to a single group, there
                    are geologic as well as orographic grounds for preferring to class this along
                    with the dependent ranges lying further north as a separate division of the
                    Alps. With regard to the latter ranges, those lying between the valley of the
                    Reuss and the Lake of Lucerne, on one side, and the ancient valley of the Rhine,
                    which included the lakes of Wallenstadt and Zurich, on the other, manifestly
                    correspond to the outer ranges of central Switzerland, which we regard as
                    appendages of the Bernese Alps. The case is somewhat different as regards the
                    small detached group culminating in the Hoh Sentis, and lying in the angle
                    between the ancient course of the Rhine and the modern Rhine valley from Sargans
                    to the Lake of Constance. This is so far separated orographically and by
                    geological structure that it might properly rank as a separate division, but it
                    is on the whole more convenient to reckon it as an outlying portion of this
                    group. The Oberalp Pass, a few miles east of Andermatt, forms the watershed
                    between the Reuss and the main branch of the Rhine, and the waters meet again at
                    the confluence with the latter of the united streams of the Aar and the Reuss at
                    Waldshut, so that the entire territory comprehending this division of the Alps
                    is enclosed between the two first-named rivers.</p>

                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Lepontine Alps.—</hi> The portion of the Alpine chain lying
                    between the Simplon and Splügen passes, and forming the boundary between the
                    tributaries of the Po and those of the Rhine, presents some peculiar orographic
                    characteristics. The line of watershed is pretty nearly parallel to that great
                    line of depression traced across Switzerland by the valley of the Rhone, the
                    Urserenthal, and the valley of the Vorderrhein; and a tendency to parallelism
                    with the same system may be traced in many parts of this group. But the dominant
                    direction of the secondary valleys and ridges is that of the meridian; and on
                    the south side we find a series of long valleys running from north to south,
                    with occasional slight distortions. The most considerable of these are partly
                    occupied by the two famous Lombard lakes—Maggiore and Como—which have from an
                    early period attracted the admiration of strangers to this region. Ancient
                    geographers limited the term Lepontine Alps to the portion of this group that
                    sends its drainage on the south side to the river Ticino; but the ranges between
                    the Splügen and Bernardino passes, and between the lakes Maggiore and Como,
                    evidently belong to the same system, and must be united in any natural
                    arrangement of the Alps. On considering a tolerably correct model, it is
                    impossible not to be struck by the fact that all the valleys that contain the
                    most considerable streams of the central Alps appear to radiate from the
                    neighbourhood of the St Gotthard Pass. If we measure from the summit of that
                    pass to the head valleys of the Rhone, the Aar, the Reuss, the Vorderrhein, the
                    Ticino, and the Toccia, we find that the most distant lies within 9 English
                    miles from that point. This fact has doubtless a significance which we are not
                    yet able fully to appreciate, but scarcely suffices to justify the view of those
                    who regard the St Gotthard Pass as in some special sense the central point of
                    the whole system of the Alps. It is worth remarking that, so far from being
                    distinguished by superior height, the neighbouring peaks are surpassed by all
                    the surrounding groups, and that the valleys are much deeper than in many other
                    districts, and especially than those of eastern Switzerland.</p>

                    mountain region extending over 6° of long., from the east side of the Lago
                    Maggiore to the left bank of the Salza, and through 2½ <hi rend="superscript">

                    is no assignable reason for uniting in a single division mountain groups so
                    distinct as many of those included within this wide space—scarcely less than
                    that occupied by all the divisions hitherto enumerated— save the fact that at an
                    early period they received a common designation from writers who had a most
                    imperfect acquaintance with their topography. It might be expedient to discard a
                    term to which it is difficult to assign a limited meaning without incurring the
                    risk of confusion; but general usage has so constantly applied the term Rhaetia
                    to the mountain region of Switzerland lying east of the Rhine, with the
                    adjoining portion of Tyrol, that it seems best to preserve the ancient name
                    while endeavouring to restrict it within juster limits. With that object it is
                    necessary to take account of one of the most remarkable features in the
                    orography of the Alps—the great breach in the continuity of the main chain shown
                    in the upper valley of the Adige. On a general view of western Tyrol it is
                    apparent that the lakes which feed the head of that stream lie on the northern
                    side of the axis of elevation of the main chain, and in fact several streams
                    draining the northern slopes of the central mass are borne southward to the
                    Adriatic through that opening. This is not the place to take into consideration
                    the important influence that this breach in the line of defence between Italy
                    and the north, and the equally deep opening of the Brenner Pass at the head of
                    the other main branch of the Adige, has had on the history of Europe, nor to
                    discuss the geological significance of the same depression throughout an
                    incalculably longer period; but it is sufficiently clear that this should be
                    taken as the eastern limit of the group to which the term Rhaetian Alps most
                    properly apphes. On the west the limit, as we have already seen, is marked by
                    the valley of the Rhine, and the line of depression over which the Splügen road
                    is carried to the head of the lake of Como. In the space between these
                    boundaries the chief mountains of the Rhaetian Alps appear as islands of
                    crystalline rock, divided by intervening masses of palaeozoic and older
                    secondary strata; but on the south side lies a district which differs
                    considerably in geological structure, and is cut off by a distinct orographic
                    boundary. A straight line drawn from the head of the lake of Como to Cles in
                    Tyrol, will throughout lie close to a trench formed by the valley of the Adda,
                    the low pass of Aprica, the head of Val Camonica, the Tonale Pass, and the
                    Tyrolese Val di Sole. On the south side of this trench, and parallel to it,
                    extend in succession a broad band of palaeozoic rock and a still broader zone of
                    trias, bordered on the southern slope by a narrow girdle of jurassic rocks which
                    decline towards the plain of Lombardy. Towards the east these are interrupted by
                    a great mass of very peculiar granite, the most considerable tract of true
                    granite to be found in the Alps. Beyond this the ridges and valleys no longer
                    preserve the direction from east to west, but become parallel to the lake of
                    Garda and the valley of the Adige. The district thus limited is enumerated
                    hereafter as a distinct division under the designation <hi rend="italic">Lombard
                    Alps,</hi> the boundary between this and the Rhaetian division being the trench
                    above described, which is prolonged from near Cles over the low Gampen Pass to
                    the neighbourhood of Meran. On the northern side the Rhaetian Alps are divided
                    from the Vindelician by a well-marked trench closely corresponding with the
                    northern limit of the crystalline rocks of the Silvretta group, formed by the
                    valley of the Ill, the Vorarlberg Pass, and the course of the Rosanna. Within
                    the limits here assigned the Rhaetian Alps occupy an area measuring about 80
                    miles by 60. The entire mass is divided into two nearly equal portions by the
                    upper valley of the Inn, known in Switzerland as the Engadine.</p>

                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Lombard Alps.—</hi> The limits of the Lombard Alps have
                    been already pointed out. They are enclosed on the east and west sides by the
                    Adige and the lake of Como, extending through about 90 miles from near Meran to
                    Lecco. Their northern boundary is the great orographic trough that stretches
                    from the head of the lake of Como along the valley of the Adda to Tresenda,
                    thence by the low Aprica Pass to the upper Val Camonica, and over the Tonale
                    Pass to the Val di Sole. Where that valley bends abruptly to SSE., the trough
                    still keeps its original direction across the Gampen Pass to the right bank of
                    the Adige below Meran. In spite of the zeal with which <pb break="no"

                    unfrequented parts of the Alps, this group continues to be very imperfectly
                    known, although it offers abundant attractions to the naturalist and the lover
                    of picturesque and grand scenery.</p>

                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Vindelician Alps.—</hi> Reference has already been made to
                    the contrast offered by the orderly arrangement of the Eastern Alps, as compared
                    with the far more complicated and irregular disposition of the masses that make
                    up the Western and Central Alps. In the former we have a broad zone of
                    crystalline or metamorphic palaeozoic rocks, extending from the upper valley of
                    the Adige to the frontier of Hungary, flanked on either side by a parallel zone
                    of secondary rocks, which rise into peaks that do not much exceed the limit of
                    perpetual snow. The northern zone extends for a distance of fully 260 miles from
                    the lake of Constance to the neighbourhood of Vienna, with an average width
                    varying from 30 to 40 miles. For the greater part of that distance this is
                    separated from the central range by broad and deep valleys, through which the
                    Inn, Salza, and Enns flow from west to east, till each of them, turning abruptly
                    northward, runs through an opening that cuts across the general strike of the
                    stratification to reach the plain of South Germany. In geological structure and
                    general aspect the mountains of this tract show many common characteristics, and
                    convenience supplies the only good reason for dividing it into two main groups,
                    separated by the valley of the Inn, the greatest of the tributaries which the
                    Alps send to the Danube. Of the western portion of this region the larger part
                    belongs to Bavaria, but a considerable share lies in the Austrian provinces of
                    Tyrol and Vorarlberg; and on this account the designations <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bavarian Alps</hi> and <hi rend="italic">North Tyrol Alps</hi> are open to
                    objection, and have the further disadvantage of excluding the Alpine districts
                    of Bavaria and North Tyrol lying east of the Inn. The name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Suabian</hi> Alps is liable to the serious objection that none but a very small
                    part of this district was ever included in the circle of Suabia. On the whole,
                    it seems that the region lying north of the Vorarlberg road and the valley of
                    the Inn, between the lake of Constance and the latter river, may best be termed
                    the Vindelician Alps. The whole was included within the territory of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vindelici</hi> before that powerful tribe was conquered by the
                    Romans, and their territory joined to that of the Rhaetians to form a single
                    Roman province. In height the mountains of this division fall considerably short
                    of those hitherto enumerated, not more than four or five exceeding 9000 feet. It
                    is impossible to consider a map of this region without being struck by the fact,
                    that although the general slope inclines northward towards the plain of Bavaria,
                    or southward towards the Ill and the Inn, nearly all the ridges and minor
                    valleys lie east and west parallel to the course of those rivers and to the
                    outcrop of the sedimentary strata, which is equally the direction of the line of
                    depression followed by the Vorarlberg road forming the southern boundary of this
                    group.</p>

                <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Northern Noric Alps.</hi> —We have already spoken of the
                    broad mountain zone extending from the Inn to the neighbourhood of Vienna, and
                    bearing a general resemblance in orographic and geological character to the
                    group last described. For reasons given hereafter, it seems impossible to
                    preserve the ancient designation <hi rend="italic">Noric Alps</hi> for any
                    portion of the central chain of the Eastern Alps, but the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Northern Noric Alps</hi> seems the most suitable for a region which was
                    altogether included in the Roman province of <hi rend="italic">Noricum,</hi> and
                    which closely coincides with the northern half of the Alpine district known to
                    them as <hi rend="italic">Alpes Noricoe.</hi> The boundaries of this division
                    are easily determined. To the north and east the mountains subside towards the
                    valley of the Danube. To the west it is bounded by the Inn, which bends first to
                    north-east, then to north, to enter the plain of Bavaria. On the south side the
                    boundary runs from the Inn through a part of the Zillerthal, over the low Gerlos
                    Pass, and along the valleys of the Salza and the Enns, evidently forming a
                    single line of depression; but where the Enns enters the defile of Gesaüse, a
                    broad and low valley, through which runs the road from Rottenmann to Leoben,
                    seems to form the most natural division between this and the central chain. The
                    line of separation is completed by the valley of the Mur and the depression of
                    the Semmering Pass, over which the railroad is carried to Vienna. The highest
                    peaks of the Dachstein group form the most considerable prominence in the entire
                    range of the Northern Alps; but the average height of the mountains of this
                    division does not exceed that of the Vindelician Alps.</p>

                    the great central zone, extending from the upper valley of the Adige eastward to
                    the neighbourhood of Gratz, forms but a single district of tolerably uniform
                    structure. He will, however, remark that about the centre of the range the
                    prevailing crystalline rocks—gneiss and mica-schist—give place to metamorphic
                    schists, probably of palaeozoic age, that rise into several of the highest peaks
                    of the entire mass. Those who are disposed to regard the above-named crystalline
                    rocks as merely extreme forms of metamorphic sedimentary strata, may not attach
                    much importance to this circumstance; but it is a still more significant fact
                    that at a short distance east of the same extension of the metamorphic rocks we
                    have proof of the former existence of a depression which seems to have cut
                    completely through the central range. On the north side triassic rocks extend
                    from the Enns to the upper valley of the Mur, and the presence of miocene
                    deposits at several points in the latter valley, the Lieserthal and the
                    Maltathal, seems to show that at a much later period this portion of the chain
                    underwent great relative depression as compared with those on either side.
                    Another and more obvious character that distinguishes the western from the
                    eastern portion of the central zone, is the fact that in the latter the great
                    range that extends like a vertebral column from the Weisskugel to the
                    Hochalpenspitz forks into two branches of inferior height, that enclose between
                    them the upper valley of the Mur. Ancient geographers divided the main mass of
                    the Alps between the Bernardine Pass and the frontier of Hungary into two vast
                    divisions, respectively called the Rhaetian and Noric Alps, placing the boundary
                    between these at or about the Dreiherrnspitz, at the head of the Ahrenthal, and
                    their example has been followed by some modern geographers. Nothing in the form
                    or structure of the chain justifies the adoption of that arbitrary boundary
                    between two main divisions of the Alps. We have already assigned reasons for
                    fixing the western boundary of the Rhaetian Alps at the upper valley of the
                    Adige, and we propose to retain the designation Central Tyrol Alps for the
                    portion of the main chain extending thence to the head of the Malta Thal in
                    Carinthia, nearly the whole of which lies within the limits of Tyrol. The exact
                    boundaries of this division are, on the north, the course of the Inn from
                    Landeck to the opening of the Zillerthal, the track thence over the Gerlos Pass
                    to the head of the Pinzgau, and the valley of the Salza to the opening of the
                    Gross Arl Thal; to the east, the way through the latter valley, over the
                    Arlscharte, through the Malta Thal to Gmünd, and the road thence to Villach; on
                    the south, the continuous trough extending from near the latter town to
                    Mühlwald, on the Reinz, through the Gail Thal, the Lessach Thal, the head of the
                    Drauthal and the upper valley of the Rienz. From Mühlwald the tortuous course of
                    the Eisack forms the boundary as far as Botzen, whence the high road running
                    N.W. along the Adige and though the Finstermünz completes the western boundary.
                    Although the region thus limited does not present many prominent peaks, it is
                    remarkable for the great average height of the main chain which forms the
                    watershed between the affluents of the Danube on one side, and those of the
                    Adige and the Drave on the other. In a distance of 120 miles—which would be much
                    increased if measured along the sinuosities of the main chain—there is but a
                    single low pass, that of the Brenner, none other being below 8000 feet in
                    height, or suited for the construction of a carriage road. The Brenner is the
                    lowest pass in the entire range of the Alps, and has from a remote period
                    afforded the easiest access from middle Europe to the plains of northern Italy,
                    but is properly described as a pass rather than as a breach in the continuity of
                    the chain.</p>

                <p>14∙. <hi rend="italic">Styrian Alps.—</hi> The boundary between the central range
                    of lofty peaks that extends through Tyrol and the adjacent province of Salzburg,
                    and the much lower masses that spread eastward through Styria to the frontier of
                    Hungary, has been already fixed at the Arlscharte. On the east side of that pass
                    the mass whose conspicuous summits are the Markkahrspitz and the Hafnereck is
                    divided into two parallel branches that enclose between them the upper valley of
                    the Mur. The northernmost of these ranges is cut through by the broad and deep
                    valley, traversed by the road that leads from Liesing on the Enns to Leoben,
                    which we have regarded as the Ümit between the Northern Noric Alps and the
                    central mass. The eastern boundary of this division, which we at the same time
                    regard as the proper limit of the Alps, is marked by the river Mur, which, after
                    flowing eastward for about 100 miles to Bruck-an-der-Mur, turns southward, and
                    finally joins the Drave in Hungary. The eastern limit of the Alps is completed
                    by the depression between Spielfeld and Marburg, over which is carried the
                    railway from Vienna to Trieste. The southern boundary of the central range is
                    unmistakably marked by the great valley of the Drave. The whole of this region
                    was, along with large portions of the adjoining divisions, included under the
                    term Noric Alps by ancient geographers; but as the retention of that designation
                    can only lead to confusion, we readily adopt the name <hi rend="italic">Styrian
                    Alps,</hi> proposed by Karl V. Sonklar, whose writings have done so much to
                    increase our knowledge of the Eastern Alps. It must, however, be remarked that
                    the region above defined also includes a considerable district of Carinthia,
                    along with a small part of the province of Salzburg, which extends to the head
                    of the valley of the Mur. Excepting the comparatively high mass in which that
                    river takes its source, the summits of this region do not attain nearly so great
                    a height as those of the other main divisions of the Alps, and only two or three
                    reach the limit of perpetual snow.</p>

                <p>15. <hi rend="italic">South Tyrol and Venetian Alps.—</hi> It has been seen that
                    the mountain zone on the northern side of the main range of Tyrol extends from
                    the lake of Constance to near Vienna, with a remarkable uniformity both of
                    general aspect and of geological structure, so that no reason much more valid
                    than convenience could be assigned for forming it into two separate divisions.
                    The same remark does not hold good on the southern side of the main range. There
                    is, indeed, a general similarity between the northern and southern zones,
                    especially in their geological structure, so far as regards the sedimentary
                    rocks; but in the western portion of the latter—in the region lying between the
                    Adige and the sources of the Piave—the intrusion of igneous rocks on a large
                    scale, and the accumulation of deposits formed from ejected volcanic matter,
                    have profoundly modified the structure and outward aspect of the country.
                    Nowhere else in the Alps do the peaks rise so abruptly and with so little
                    apparent connection, and nowhere are the contrasts depending on differences of
                    geological structure so marked as those which strike the mere passing traveller,
                    when, beside rounded masses of red and black porphyry, he sees white and pink
                    crystalline dolomite limestone rising in towers and pinnacles of extraordinary
                    height and steepness. Dolomite limestone is found in many other parts of the
                    Alps, but nowhere else is it developed on so grand a scale, and the exquisite
                    beauty of this region has of late years led an increasing number of travellers
                    to spots that before were scarcely known even to the inhabitants of adjoining
                    valleys. Though there are abundant grounds for regarding the district here
                    spoken of as a separate division of the Alps, it is very difficult to assign to
                    it a satisfactory designation. The larger portion of the region has long been
                    politically connected with Tyrol, and is partly inhabited by a Germanspeaking
                    population, while the remainder has been politically connected with Venice, and
                    the inhabitants are thoroughly Italian in language and manners. Were it not for
                    a reluctance to introduce new and unfamiliar terms, the present division might
                    be denominated <hi rend="italic">Cimbric Alps,</hi> as, according to ancient
                    tradition, the Cimbri, after their final defeat by Marius, sought and found a
                    refuge in this part of the Alps; but for the present it seems best to designate
                    as <hi rend="italic">South Tyrol and Venetian Alps</hi> the region lying between
                    the valley of the Adige and the sources of the Drave and the Piave, and south of
                    the great valley traversed by the Eisack and the Rienz between Botzen and
                    Innichen. The eastern limit may best be fixed by the track leading through the
                    Sextenthal from Innichen to San Stefano in the head valley of the Piave, and by
                    the road from that place to Conegliano.</p>

                <p>16. <hi rend="italic">South-Eastern Alps.—</hi> Ancient geographers, and those
                    who have followed their example, use the terms Carnic Alps and Julian Alps to
                    designate two of the main divisions of the Alps; but the latter of these at
                    least hasbeen<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n668/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0668-0631"/> applied in a vague and inconsistent way. In point
                    of fact, the south-eastern portion of the Alps, which includes both the groups
                    above specified, presents three principal groups which are very closely
                    connected together. The first of these—the Carnic Alps, properly so called—have
                    been defined as including the region between the upper valley of the Drave and
                    the plain of Friuli But to the orographer the true head of the Drave valley is
                    the Gail-thal, which extends in an almost straight and broad trench from near
                    Innichen to Villach, while the main stream flows through a sinuous and
                    contracted valley. Foτ this reason we have taken the Gailthal as the boundary
                    between the Central Tyrol and the Carnic Alps. Almost continuous with the Carnic
                    Alps is a range, very similar in geological structure, which divides the Drave
                    from the northern branch of the Save, and includes the mountains locally known
                    as the Karawankas and the Sulzbacher Alps. Throughout these, which may be called
                    the main range of the South-Eastern Alps, palaeozoic rocks, probably of
                    carboniferous age, extend in a narrow band for a distance of fully 100 miles,
                    giving place at the eastern extremity to the small granitic mass that forms the
                    hills of the Bacher Gebirge near Marburg. On the south side of the main range of
                    the Carnic Alps two mountain masses, mainly formed of triassic rocks and
                    Dachstein limestone, attain a considerable height in the Monte Cavallo on the
                    west, and the Monte Canin on the east side of Friuli. In a similar position as
                    regards the Karawankas is a still loftier mass which is crowned by the
                    Terglou—the highest peak of the South-Eastern Alps. This group is referred by
                    geographers to the Julian Alps, which are said to divide the Save and its
                    tributaries from the Adriatic. As has been already said, there is no range to
                    which the term Alps can properly be applied forming such a boundary. The plateau
                    of the Karst, though rising here and there into hills of moderate height, has an
                    average elevation of about 2000 feet above the sea, and cannot correctly be
                    spoken of as a mountain chain. The orographer, if seeking an eastern
                    prolongation to the Terglou group, would prefer the hilly region between the
                    Save and the southern Gurk; but the low country through which the railway is
                    carried from Marburg to Laybach, and the road thence to Gorizia, may for all
                    practical purposes be taken as the south-eastern limit of the Alps and of the
                    division here described.</p>

                <p>It is well known that as we rise from the sea-level into the upper regions of the
                    atmosphere the temperature decreases. The effect of mountain chains on
                    prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an
                    upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of
                    heat, often accompanied by the precipitation of moisture in the form of snow or
                    rain. The position of the Alps about the centre of the European continent has
                    profoundly modified the climate of all the surrounding regions. The accumulation
                    of vast masses of snow, which have gradually been converted into permanent
                    glaciers, maintains a gradation of very different climates within the narrow
                    space that intervenes between the foot of the mountains and their upper ridges;
                    it cools the breezes that are wafted to the plains on either side, but its most
                    important function is to regulate the water supply of that large region which is
                    traversed by the streams of the Alps.. Nearly all the moisture that is
                    precipitated during six or seven months is stored up in the form of snow, and
                    gradually diffused in the course of the succeeding summer; and even in the
                    hottest and driest seasons the reserves accumulated during a long preceding
                    period of years in the form of glaciers are available to maintain the regular
                    flow of the greater streams. Nor is this all; the lakes that fill several of the
                    main valleys on the southern side of the Alps are somewhat above the level of
                    the plains of Lombardy and Venetia, and afford an inexhaustible supply, which,
                    from a remote period, has been used for that system of irrigation to which they
                    owe their proverbial fertility. Six regions or zones, which are best
                    distinguished by their characteristic vegetation, are found in the Alps. It has
                    been a common error to suppose that these are indicated by absolute height above
                    the sea-level. Local conditions of exposure to the sun, protection from cold
                    winds, or the reverse, are of primary importance in determining the climate and
                    the corresponding vegetation.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Olive Region.—</hi> The great plain of Upper Italy has a
                    winter climate colder than that of the British Islands. The olive and the
                    characteristic shrubs of the northern coasts of the Mediterranean do not thrive
                    in the open air, but the former valuable tree ripens its fruit in sheltered
                    places at the foot of the mountains, and penetrates along the deeper valleys and
                    the shores of the Italian lakes. The evergreen oak is wild on the rocks about
                    the lake of Garda; and lemons are cultivated on a large scale, with partial
                    protection in winter. The olive has been known to survive severe cold when of
                    short duration, but it cannot be cultivated with success where frosts are
                    prolonged, or where the mean winter temperature falls below 42° Fahr.; and to
                    produce fruit it requires a heat of at least 75° Fahr. during the day, continued
                    through four or five months of the summer and autumn.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Vine Region.—</hi> The vine is far more tolerant of cold
                    than the olive, but to produce tolerable wine it demands, at the season of
                    ripening, a degree of heat not much less than that needed by the more delicate
                    tree. These conditions are satisfied in the deeper valleys of the Alps, even in
                    the interior of the chain, and up to a considerable height on slopes exposed to
                    the sun. The protection afforded by winter snow enables the plant to resist
                    severe and prolonged frosts, such as would be fatal in more exposed situations.
                    Along with the vine, many wild plants characteristic of the warmer parts of
                    middle Europe are seen to flourish. A mean summer temperature of at least 68°
                    Fahr. is considered necessary to produce tolerable wine, but in ordinary seasons
                    this is much exceeded in many of the great valleys of the Alps.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Mountain Region, or Region of Deciduous Trees.—</hi> Many
                    writers take the growth of corn as the characteristic of this region; but so
                    many varieties of all the common species are in cultivation, and these have such
                    different climatal requirements, that they do not afford a satisfactory
                    criterion. A more natural limit is afforded by the presence <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n669/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0669-0632"/> of the chief deciduous trees—oak, beech, ash, and
                    sycamore. These do not reach exactly to the same elevation, nor are they often
                    found growing together; but their upper limit corresponds accurately enough to
                    the change from a temperate to a colder climate that is further proved by a
                    change in the wild herbaceous vegetation. This limit usually lies about 4000
                    feet above the sea on the north side of the Alps, but on the southern slopes it
                    often rises to 5000 feet, sometimes even to 5500 feet. It must not be supposed
                    that this region is always marked by the presence of the characteristic trees.
                    The interference of man has in many districts almost extirpated them, and,
                    excepting the beech forests of the Austrian Alps, a considerable wood of
                    deciduous trees is scarcely anywhere to be found. In many districts where such
                    woods once existed, their place has been occupied by the pine and Scotch fir,
                    which suffer less from the ravages of goats, the worst enemies of tree
                    vegetation. The mean annual temperature of this region differs little from that
                    of the British islands; but the climatal conditions are widely different. Here
                    snow usually lies for several months, till it gives place to a spring and summer
                    considerably warmer than the average of our seasons.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Subalpine</hi><hi rend="italic">Region, or Region of
                    Coniferous Trees.—</hi> This is the region which mainly determines the manner of
                    life of the population of the Alps. On a rough estimate, we may reckon that, of
                    the space lying between the summits of the Alps and the low country on either
                    side, one quarter is available for cultivation, of which about one-half may be
                    vineyards and corn-fields, and the remainder produces forage and grass. About
                    another quarter is utterly barren, consisting of snow-fields, glaciers, bare
                    rock, lakes, and the beds of streams; and there remains about one-half, which is
                    divided between forest and pasture, and it is the produce of this which mainly
                    supports the relatively large population. For nearly half the year the flocks
                    and herds are fed on the upper pastures; but the true limit of the wealth of a
                    district is the number of animals that can be supported during the long winter,
                    and while one part of the population is engaged in tending the beasts and in
                    making cheese and butter, the remainder is busy cutting hay and storing up
                    winter food. The larger villages are mostly in the mountain region, but in many
                    parts of the Alps the villages stand in the subalpine region at heights varying
                    from 4000 to 5500 feet above the sea, more rarely extending to about 6000 feet.
                    The most characteristic feature of this region is the prevalence of coniferous
                    trees, which, where they have not been artificially reduced, form vast forests
                    that cover a large part of the surface. These play a most important part in the
                    natural economy of the country. They protect the valleys from destructive
                    avalanches, and, retaining the superficial soil by their roots, they mitigate
                    the destructive effects of heavy rains. In valleys where they have been rashly
                    cut away, and the waters pour down the slopes unchecked, every tiny rivulet
                    becomes a raging torrent, that cuts away and carries off the grassy slopes and
                    devastates the floor of the valley, covering the soil with gravel and debris. In
                    the pine forests of the Alps the prevailing species are the common spruce and
                    the silver fir; on siliceous soil the larch flourishes, and surpasses every
                    other European species in height. The Scotch fir is chiefly found at a lower
                    level, and rarely forms forests. The Siberian fir is found scattered at
                    intervals throughout the Alps, but is not common. The mughus, creeping pine, or
                    <hi rend="italic">Krummholz</hi> of the Germans, is common in the Eastern Alps,
                    and sometimes forms on the higher mountains a distinct zone above the level of
                    its congeners. In the Northern Alps the pine forests rarely surpass the limit of
                    6000 feet above the sea, but on the south side they commonly attain to 7000
                    feet; and the larch, Siberian fir, and mughus often extend above that
                    elevation.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Alpine Region.—</hi> Throughout the German Alps the word <hi
                    rend="italic">alp</hi> is used specifically for the upper pastures, where cattle
                    are fed in summer, but this region is held to include the whole space between
                    the uppermost limit of trees and the first appearance of permanent masses of
                    snow. It is here that the characteristic vegetation of the Alps is developed in
                    its full beauty and variety. Shrubs are not wanting. Three species of
                    rhododendron vie with each other in the brilliancy of their masses of red or
                    pink flowers; the common juniper rises higher still, along with three species of
                    bilberry; and several dwarf willows attain nearly to the utmost limit of
                    vegetation. The upper limit of this region coincides with the so-called limit of
                    perpetual snow, which demands further explanation.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Glacial Region.—</hi> On the higher parts of lofty mountains
                    more snow falls in each year than is melted on the spot. A portion of this is
                    carried away by the wind before it is consolidated; a larger portion accumulates
                    in hollows and depressions of the surface, and is gradually converted into
                    glacier-ice, which descends by a slow secular motion into the deeper valleys,
                    where it goes to swell perennial streams. As on a mountain the snow does not lie
                    in beds of uniform thickness, and some parts are more exposed to the sun and
                    warm winds than others, we commonly find beds of snow alternating with exposed
                    slopes covered with brilliant vegetation; and to the observer near at hand there
                    is no appearance in the least corresponding to the term <hi rend="italic">limit
                    of perpetual snow.</hi> But the case is otherwise when a high mountain chain is
                    viewed from a distance. Similar conditions are repeated at many different
                    points, so that the level at which large snow-beds show themselves along its
                    flanks is approximately horizontal. But this holds good only so far as the
                    conditions are similar. On the opposite sides of the same chain the exposure to
                    the sun or to warm winds may cause a wide difference in the level of permanent
                    snow; but in some cases the increased fall of snow on the side exposed to moist
                    winds may more than compensate the increased influence of the sun’s rays. Still,
                    even with these reservations, the so-called line of perpetual snow is not fixed.
                    The occurrence of favourable meteorological conditions during several successive
                    seasons may and does increase the extent of the snow-fields, and lower the limit
                    of seemingly permanent snow; while an opposite state of things may cause the
                    limit to rise higher on the flanks of the mountains. From these remarks it may
                    be inferred that all attempts to fix accurately the level of perpetual snow in
                    the Alps are fallacious, and can at the best approach only to local accuracy for
                    a particular district. In some parts of the Alps the limit may be set at about
                    8000 feet above the sea, while in others it cannot be placed much below 9500
                    feet. As very little snow can rest on rocks that lie at an angle exceeding 60°,
                    and this is soon removed by the wind, some steep masses of rock remain bare even
                    near the summits of the highest peaks, but as almost every spot offering the
                    least hold for vegetation is covered with snow, few flowering plants are seen
                    above 10,000 feet. There is reason to think, however, that it is the want of
                    soil rather than climatal conditions that checks the upward extension of the
                    Alpine flora. Increased direct effect of solar radiation compensates for the
                    cold of the nights, and in the few spots where plants have been found in flower
                    up to a height of 12,000 feet, nothing has indicated that the processes of
                    vegetation were arrested by the severe cold which they must sometimes endure.
                    The climate of the glacial region has often been compared to that of the polar
                    regions, but they are widely different. Here, intense solar radiation by day,
                    which raises the surface when dry, to a temperature approaching 80° Fahr., <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0670-0633"/> alternates with severe frost by night. There, a
                    sun which never sets sends feeble rays that maintain a low equable temperature,
                    rarely rising more than a few degrees above the freezing-point. Hence the upper
                    region of the Alps sustains a far more varied and brilliant vegetation.</p>
                <p>At the earliest period of which records are preserved the Alps appear to have
                    been mainly inhabited by Celtic tribes some of which, before they were
                    subjugated by the Romans, had made considerable progress in the knowledge of the
                    useful arts. The Rhaetians and Vindelicians especially, in whom a primitive
                    Turanian stock seems to have been amalgamated with a dominant Celtic race,
                    readily assimilated the civilisation of Rome; and the language of the conqueror,
                    modified by peculiarities of pronunciation and the retention of some native
                    terms, still survives in Eastern Switzerland, and in a few isolated valleys of
                    Tyrol. Throughout by far the larger part of the Alps, however, the flood of
                    Teutonic invasion either exterminated or drove into exile the previous
                    population. The Alemanni and other kindred tribes settled in the main valleys of
                    the Eastern Alps, and finally became masters of the greater part of Switzerland,
                    leaving to the original Celtic population the Western Alps and both slopes of
                    the great Pennine chain. At a later period the invasion of Slavonic hordes
                    threatened to substitute a new nationality throughout the same region, but after
                    prolonged contests these tribes were restricted to its southeastern portion,
                    being nearly confined to the upper valleys of the Drave and the Save, with their
                    tributaries. The Italian valleys of the Alps, from the Val d’Ossola to the
                    Tagliamento, inhabited by people of mixed race, have, with a few exceptions,
                    preserved the language of Italy, much varied in the local dialects; while the
                    western districts, in which the Celtic element remained predominant, have for
                    the most part clung to the French tongue. The estimates formed of the present
                    population of the Alps are uncertain, because they usually include towns and
                    populous districts lying without the mountain region. It is usually reckoned
                    that there are about 1,500,000 of Celto-Gallic stock in the French and Savoy
                    Alps, western Switzerland, and some valleys of Piedmont; about 4,000,000 of
                    Teutonic origin in the Swiss and German Alps; about 1,000,000 of Slavonic stock,
                    chiefly Slovenes; and about 1,000,000 of Italians in the valleys of Northern
                    Italy, the Swiss cantons of Tessin and Grisons, and in the Italian Tyrol, making
                    an aggregate of 7,500,000. To these should be added about 70,000 people speaking
                    some dialect of the Rhaeto-Roman or Romansch. All these numbers excepting the
                    last are excessive, if we would restrict the estimate within the proper limits
                    of the Alps.</p>
                <p>Although no conspicuous species of quadruped or bird is known to be exclusively
                    confined to the Alps, they have afforded an asylum to many animals that have
                    become rare or extinct elsewhere. The great urus, the elk, and the wild swine
                    have disappeared since the Roman period, and the beaver in more recent times;
                    but the brown bear, the lynx, the wild cat, and the wolf still survive. Among
                    Ruminants, the red deer, fallow deer, and roebuck, chiefly found in the lower
                    forest region, are common to other mountain districts. More characteristic of
                    the Alps is the chamois, which is found elsewhere only in the Carpathians,
                    Pyrenees, and the mountains of European Turkey, and is the sole representative
                    of the antelopes in this part of the world. Much rarer is the ibex or bouquetin,
                    which still lives in the higher Alpine region of the Graian Alps, and possibly
                    also in some recesses of the Pennine chain. Unlike the chamois, which descends
                    at night to find sustenance as low as the verge of the pine forests, this fine
                    animal remains, at least in the summer, in the upper region, on the verge of the
                    snow-fields, or on the rocks that rise amidst the glaciers. The massive horns of
                    the male are often a yard or more in length. Closely allied species are found in
                    the Pyrenees and other mountain ranges of the Iberian peninsula, and in the
                    Caucasus, but the true ibex seems to be now confined to this small corner of the
                    Alps. The few endemic species of Mammalia found in the Alps are chiefly small
                    Rodentia and Insectivora, which alone can multiply rapidly in the midst of a
                    large and increasing human population. The marmot, which is the most
                    characteristic of the Rodentia, maintains its ground in the stony recesses of
                    the Alpine region, and does not diminish in numbers as most other wild animals
                    have done. The most singular of this group is the snow-vole <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Arυicola nivalis),</hi> whose nearest ally is a native of East Siberia.
                    Several forms (varieties or sub-species) are found in various parts of the Alps.
                    They ascend through the Alpine region to the rocks of the glacial zone, at least
                    as far as 12,000 feet above the sea; and, unlike other animals framed to endure
                    severe cold, they continue in activity throughout the long winter. There is at
                    least one species of shrew <hi rend="italic">(Sorex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >alpinus)</hi> peculiar to the Alps. The Cheiroptera are represented by numerous
                    forms, which, with one exception (<hi rend="italic">Vesperugo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">maurus),</hi> are not confined to this region; but the Alps form a
                    limit to the distribution of many of this order: some species of middle Europe
                    do not cross the main range, while several species of the Mediterranean region
                    find their northern limit in the valleys on the southern side.</p>
                <p>The Birds of the Alps are proportionately very numerous. Many southern species
                    find a home in the warmer Italian valleys, and there meet northern forms that
                    descend during the winter and spring, but return to the upper zone in the warm
                    season. Of the more conspicuous species of the high Alps, the lämmergeyer <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gypaëtos</hi><hi rend="italic">barbatus)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> once common, but now become very rare—is pre-eminent. It is also found
                    in Algeria, in Syria, and in Northern Asia, but is one of those animals that is
                    threatened with extinction by the progress of civilisation. The rock chough <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pyrrhocorax alpinus),</hi> distinguished by golden-yellow bill
                    and feet, builds on rocks in the glacial region as high as 10,000 feet above the
                    sea. Several song birds, such as the snow lark and snow finch, ascend to the
                    limits of vegetation. The Gallinaceae are well represented. The cock of the
                    woods <hi rend="italic">(Tetrao</hi><hi rend="italic">urogallus),</hi> the
                    grouse, ptarmigan, blackcock, gelinotte, and rock partridge <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Caccabis saxatilis),</hi> are the most remarkable. The first, which is
                    somewhat rare and extremely shy, surpasses the dimensions of an ordinary
                    well-grown fowl.</p>
                <p>Several Reptiles are found even in the upper region of the Alps, though none are
                    very common. Of three venomous species of viper, <hi rend="italic">Vipera
                    berus</hi> ascends to about 8000 feet; and the black viper (<hi rend="italic"
                    >V.</hi><hi rend="italic">prester)</hi> also reaches the Alpine region. <hi
                    rend="italic">V.</hi><hi rend="italic">Pedii</hi> is confined to the warmer
                    Italian valleys. The snakes and lizards frequent the lower zones, excepting <hi
                    rend="italic">Lacerta pyrrhogastra,</hi> which is sometimes seen in the upper
                    region.</p>
                <p>Batrachians are more common than true reptiles. An Alpine frog attains the
                    extreme limit of vegetation, and a toad ascends nearly as far. These have been
                    considered by some as distinct species, by others as varieties of the common
                    animals. At least one triton <hi rend="italic">(T. Wurfbeinii)</hi> is peculiar
                    to the Alps. The spotted salamander is common in the sub-Alpine region, but in
                    the Eastern Alps it is replaced by <hi rend="italic">S. atra,</hi> which is
                    entirely black. This is sometimes found far above the limit of the pine
                    forests.</p>
                <p>The great lakes of the Alps are very rich in Fish, not only as regards the number
                    of individuals, but in species also. Thus in the Chiemsee, at the northern foot
                    of the Bavarian Alps, thirty-three species have been found, in the lake of
                    Constance twenty-six species, and twenty-four <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n671/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0671-0634"/> in the lake of Lucerne. The most esteemed are
                    those of the trout and salmon tribe, whose specific differences have not yet
                    been fully investigated by ichthyologists. First in rank is the saibling <hi
                    rend="italic">(Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">salvellinus),</hi> which flourishes
                    in lakes between 2000 and 4000 feet above the sea, and occasionally extends to
                    those of the Alpine region between 6000 and 7000 feet. The fish of the northern
                    side of the Alps are fully described in Siebold’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Süsswasser-Fische Mitteleuropas.</hi> Those of the waters running to the
                    Mediterranean have not been so fully investigated. Two or three peculiar species
                    have been found in the lake of Geneva. In some of the Lombard lakes, the <hi
                    rend="italic">agone,</hi> a small fish of the herring tribe <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Clupea</hi><hi rend="italic">finta),</hi> is a much esteemed article of
                    diet.</p>
                <p>In the classes hitherto noticed the number of species peculiar to the Alps is
                    very small. This rule is reversed among the Invertebrata, especially as regards
                    the Articulata and Mollusca. The number of insects is very great, and a
                    considerable proportion extend to the limit of perpetual snow. Oswald Heer has
                    pointed out several peculiarities in the insect fauna of the higher Alps. In
                    ascending from the mountain region the proportion of the carnivorous tribes
                    rapidly increases, and the families that feed on living vegetable matter either
                    disappear or are much reduced in numbers. Beetles and other insects either lose
                    their wings in the upper region, or are represented by allied wingless species.
                    Along with the tendency to lose the power of flight, a diminution of brilliancy
                    of colour appears, the prevailing hues being black or dingy grey. These
                    peculiarities are to be explained by the fact that in the upper Alpine zone most
                    insects live under stones, and the power of flight generally proves injurious to
                    animals liable to be carried by the wind and upward air-currents over the
                    snow-fields, whence they are unable to return. This is often seen to occur to
                    butterflies and a few moths, which ascend as far as the highest flowering
                    plants. The snow-fields and glaciers are not devoid of insect life. Several
                    species of snow-flea have been detected; and further observation will probably
                    bring to light other minute animals living in the pools that form on the surface
                    of glaciers, or on the snow-beds, although their activity is often interrupted
                    by the freezing of the surface.</p>
                <p>The Arachnida are eminently characteristic of the fauna of the high Alps, where
                    they abound both in species and individuals. Spiders ascend to the utmost limit
                    of vegetation, and are even to be found on the bare rocks that rise out of the
                    snow up to a height of 11,000 feet.</p>
                <p>Although most of the orders of Articulata are represented in the Alps by numerous
                    forms, these are far outnumbered by the total number of European species of that
                    class; but among land and fresh water Mollusca the proportion is reversed, and
                    as many as seven-eighths of all the species known in middle Europe, and a large
                    proportion of those of the Mediterranean region, have been found in the Alps.
                    Still more remarkable is the large proportion of endemic species. In the
                    important group of the Heliceae fully one hundred species, or four-tenths of the
                    whole number, are peculiar to the Alps. Between thirty and forty species only
                    have been found in the Alpine zone, and of these but five— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vitrina diaphana, V.</hi><hi rend="italic">glacialis,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">foetens,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vertigo Charpentieri—</hi>
                    attain the upper limit of vegetation.</p>
                <p>The Annulosa and Radiata of the Alps, so far as they are known, do not offer any
                    points of special interest; and the study of the minute organisms, which have
                    been proved to exist as high as 12,000 feet above the sea, is still in its
                    infancy.</p>
                <p>In describing the several regions which are found in ascending from the low
                    country to the snow-clad summits of the Alps, and whose existence is due to
                    climatal differences, it was necessary to refer to the characteristic vegetation
                    of each zone, inasmuch as this affords the chief apparent distinction which
                    climatal conditions impress on the earth’s surface. The most cursory observation
                    suffices to show that within each of the zones thus broadly sketched out there
                    exist marked differences in the vegetable population, so that a comparison of
                    the local floras in two spots possessing a similar climate as regards
                    temperature may exhibit but few points of agreement along with many marked
                    contrasts. This partly depends on external conditions, of which the most
                    important are differences in the amount and distribution of moisture in the air
                    and the soil, and differences in the composition and state of aggregation of the
                    soil itself. But a more important element in determining the flora of any
                    particular district depends upon the causes which have operated throughout the
                    whole period since it has become dry land to facilitate migration for certain
                    species, and to impede it for others. The subject of the distribution of Alpine
                    plants, so far as regards the eastern half of the chain, has been very well
                    discussed in an essay by Dr A. Kerner in the 1st vol. of the 2d edit. of
                    Schaubach’s <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Alpen,</hi>
                    although some of the conclusions of the writer may not bear careful criticism.
                    He divides the natural floras of the Alps into four—named respectively <hi
                    rend="italic">Arctic, Baltic, Pontic,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mediterranean,</hi> the term Baltic referring to the region that includes
                    Germany, Southern Scandinavia, and North-Western Russia; while Pontic
                    comprehends the region north and west of the Euxine —the northern provinces of
                    Turkey and the whole space between the Carpathians and the Crimea. It does not
                    appear that the writer holds that the plants existing in the Alps have actually
                    migrated to their present homes from the geographical regions corresponding to
                    the above denominations, but merely that they belong to the types of vegetation
                    characteristic of each of them. It must be borne in mind that the Alps, and
                    especially the mountain and sub-Alpine regions, produce a large number of
                    peculiar forms, many of which have no near allies in the other mountain regions
                    of Europe, while at the same time the differences are seldom so wide as to place
                    these in distinct generic groups; and it seems quite inadmissible to suppose
                    that the flora has been altogether formed by colonisation from surrounding
                    districts. No space can be here found for details, but it may broadly be said
                    that while the highest zone of all, lying close to the limit of permanent snow,
                    exhibits throughout the whole chain an approach to uniformity, several of the
                    most conspicuous species being common to this and to Arctic flora, the zone
                    immediately below this, as well as those lower down, shows a large admixture of
                    quite distinct elements. This is especially true of the southern slopes. In
                    truth, but a very few of the well-marked endemic species of the Alps are
                    confined to the north side of the main chain. A considerable number are common
                    to both slopes, and a still larger proportion are restricted exclusively to the
                    southern side. Of the larger groups which are represented in the Alps by
                    numerous well-marked endemic species, the genera Alsine, Androsace, Arabis,
                    Campanula, Crepis, Gentiana, Pedicularis, Primula, and Saxifraga may be
                    especially noted. Without attempting to enter into details, it may be said that,
                    along with a general Alpine flora, which extends throughout the entire chain,
                    there are three large districts where, along with species common to all, we find
                    a considerable number of others either absolutely local and endemic, or else
                    representative in the Alps of the floras of other distant mountain groups. Only
                    a few of the more remarkable species characteristic of each can be cited. The
                    <hi rend="italic">West Alpine Flora</hi> is found in Dauphiné, South Savoy, and
                    Western Piedmont, as far north as the group of the Graian Alps. In the following

                <p>It is worthy of remark that the central and highest part of the Alpine chain,
                    including the Pennine and Bernese groups, the Lepontine Alps, and those of North
                    Switzerland, produce scarcely a well-marked species—with the doubtful exceptions
                    of <hi rend="italic">Rumex</hi><hi rend="italic">nivalis</hi> and of <hi
                    rend="italic">Potentilla grammopetala,</hi> which is confined to a small
                    district south east of Monte Rosa—that does not spread throughout the rest of
                    the chain.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of glaciers have been chiefly studied in the Alps, but they are not
                    especially characteristic of the mountains of central Europe. The investigation
                    of their origin and structure, and the laws of their motion, fall within the
                    province of the physical philosopher, and are discussed elsewhere. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Glaciers.</hi></p>
                <p>The geological structure of the Alps is a subject that has occupied the labours
                    of many eminent men of science, especially during the last thirty years, yet it
                    may be safely asserted that it will continue to offer new problems to the
                    researches of at least another generation. There is scarcely a single difficult
                    question regarding the nature and mode of deposition of the strata that make up
                    the earth’s crust, the mode of elevation of mountain chains, the causes of the
                    formation of valleys and lake basins, the action of meteoric forces, of rivers
                    and ice-streams, that must not be decided before we can give a rational account
                    of the structure of the Alps. Along with these, and scarcely less important, is
                    the study of the various agencies involved in the phenomena of metamorphism, and
                    that of the part played by volcanic action in some parts of the chain. The study
                    of the organic remains embedded in the rocks is not so constantly the duty of
                    the geologist in the Alps as it is in most other mountain districts; but of late
                    years this has been actively pursued, and has tended to clear up many
                    difficulties, while much room is left for further investigation. The reader is
                    referred to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Geology,</hi> and, with reference
                    to detailed information as to the structure of the Alps, to the list of works on
                    alpine geology given below.</p>
                <p>The number of publications relating to the Alps has been so largely increased
                    during the last quarter of a century that a bare catalogue would fill a
                    considerable space. The majority of these are of a narrative and descriptive
                    character, and do not add much to our knowledge of the Alps, either
                    topographically or scientifically. It will suffice to give here a brief list of
                    the chief works that may fairly be considered to have achieved that object.
                    Works of exclusively scientific character, especially those relating to Alpine
                    geology, are separately enumerated.</p>

                    Alpine Clubs; and also in papers that have appeared in Petermann’s <hi

                <p>No general zoological works of a purely scientific character relating exclusively
                    to the fauna of the Alps can be quoted; but much valuable information, conveyed
                    in a popular form, will be found in Tschudi’s Thierleben der Alpenwelt, of which
                    translations have appeared in English and French. The want of a compact work
                    containing descriptions of all the plants of the Alps has been much felt by
                    botanists. Those of Switzerland and the Eastern Alps are included in Koch’s
                    Synopsis Florae Germanicae et Helveticae, a work of high authority, written in
                    Latin; but it does not comprehend the species peculiar to Piedmont and the
                    Western Alps. An illustrated work, by J. C. Weber, Die Alpenpflanzen
                    Deutschlands und der Schweiz, may also be recommended. Of numerous books and

                <p>With the exception of special maps of small districts, the only maps of the Alps
                    founded on actual survey are those which have been published under the authority
                    of the governments whose territory is concerned. Among these the first place is
                    due to the federal map of Switzerland, executed under the direction of General
                    Dufour, on the scale <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    100000</hi> in 25 sheets. Considering the difficulty of the task, this is
                    unsurpassed both for accuracy and skill in execution. The Austrian War Office
                    has brought out, during the last sixty years, a series of maps, executed on a
                    large scale, of the several states of the empire. These are of very unequal
                    merit. That of the kingdom of Venetian Lombardy, in 42 sheets, on the scale of
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 86400</hi>, has
                    considerable merit, but falls short of the standard of the Swiss map. A new map
                    of Tyrol is in preparation, and will doubtless sustain the reputation of
                    Austrian cartographers. The general map of Piedmont, in 91 sheets, on the scale
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 50000</hi>, is
                    sufficiently correct as regards the inhabited districts, but quite
                    unsatisfactory as regards the higher region. Until lately there existed no
                    tolerable map of the Alpine provinces of France. The general map of France, on

                    of late years been extended to the greater part of Dauphine, and will before
                    long include the newly-acquired departments of Savoy and Nice. The portion
                    already published is quite on a level with modern requirements, and reflects
                    credit on the French war department. The only tolerable map that includes the
                    entire chain of the Alps is that compiled by J. G. Mayr. It is on a small scale
                    (1/450000), and is not free from serious errors. A map published by Wörl, in 48
                    sheets, on a scale <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    200000</hi>, entitled “Atlas von Südwest Deutschland und dem Alpen-lande,” is
                    very unsatisfactory. Scheda’s general map of the Austrian Empire and adjoining
                    territories, in 20 sheets, is an excellent compilation. It includes the Alps as
                    far west as Monte Posa and the lake of Thun, but the scale (<hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 576000</hi>) is
                    inconveniently small.</p>
