                <p><label type="entry">AGAMEMNON</label>. The stern obligations of a king and the
                    majesty of his office, as compared with his humane desires and occasional
                    frailty, give the keynote to the character of Agamemnon. But the kingly office,
                    like the sceptre which was the symbol of it, had come to him from Pelops (<hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> ii. 100) through the stained hands of Atreus and
                    Thyestes, and had brought with it a certain fatality, by which his misfortunes,
                    and especially the catastrophe at the close of his fife, were explained. As his
                    title of Atrides implies, Agamemnon was a son of Atreus, his mother being
                    Aërope. In a later account he is a son of Pleisthenes. But, apart from this
                    difference, it is agreed that he succeeded to the sovereignty of Atreus over
                    Argolis, Corinth, Achaia, and many islands, his seat being at Mycenae, not, as
                    Aeschylus for political reasons asserts, at Argos. The succession had been
                    usurped by Thyestes and Aegisthus. During the usurpation Agamemnon and his
                    brother Menelaus visited Tyndareus, the king of Sparta, and obtained in marriage
                    his two daughters—the former Clytaemnestra, the latter Helena: with his help
                    Agamemnon was reinstated in his rights. Menelaus succeeded Tyndareus. The
                    children born by Clytaemnestra were Chrysothemis, Iphigenia, Electra, and one
                    son, Orestes. Elsewhere are mentioned also Iphianassa and Laodice; but the
                    latter was the original name of Electra, it appears, and it has been suggested
                    that Iphianassa stood in the same relation to Iphigenia. Agamemnon was then the
                    most powerful prince in Greece; and to him of right, as well as naturally, his
                    brother Menelaus turned for aid to compel the Trojans to give up his wife
                    Helena, whom Paris had carried off. The various princes of Greece having been
                    brought to unite in an expedition for this purpose, Agamemnon was chosen leader,
                    he himself furnishing 100 ships and lending also 60 more to the Arcadians. It
                    was not perhaps his fault that the Greeks landed by mistake on the coast of
                    Mysia, from which, after plundering it, they took ship and were scattered in a
                    storm; but it was owing to him (and this is the beginning of his ill-fate) that
                    after again assembling in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0295-0274"/> Aulis, whence they had set out, the fleet was
                    storm-bound. He had slain a deer sacred to Artemis, and boasted himself a better
                    hunter than the goddess. This, as Calchas the seer read the divine will, could
                    only be atoned for by his offering up his daughter Iphigenia in sacrifice.
                    Compelled by his duty to the expedition, he allowed her to be sent for, the
                    pretext given to Clytemnestra being that she was to be married to Achilles. But
                    when the moment of sacrifice came, the goddess substituted a stag, carried her
                    off to the Tauri, and made her immortal. The fleet now sailed; and except the
                    quarrel between him and Achilles at Tenedus or Lemnus, there was no incident in
                    which Agamemnon figured particularly, until, in one of the raids on the towns
                    round Troy, Briseis and Chryseis were brought captives, and assigned, the former
                    to Achilles, the latter to Agamemnon,—who, having to yield up his captive to
                    appease Apollo, claimed and took the other. Upon this Achilles withdrew from the
                    war, and Agamemnon endeavoured at first to maintain it without him. In the face
                    of disaster he repented, and offered reparation—sending costly presents by the
                    hands of Phoenix, Ajax, and Ulysses. His offer rejected, he took the field
                    himself, and did marvels of bravery, but was wounded and defeated. When Troy was
                    finally taken and the captives distributed, he obtained Cassandra, and with her
                    returned home; but before sailing the shade of Achilles appeared to him,
                    foretold what would happen, and sought to restrain him. In his absence
                    Clytemnestra had yielded to the temptations of Aegisthus, and, to cover her
                    shame, planned with him the death of her husband. The approach of Agamemnon
                    being announced by a spy, a feast and an affected welcome were prepared for him
                    and his followers. At the feast they were fallen upon by hired murderers,
                    assisted by Aegisthus and Clytemnestra, the latter herself slaying Cassandra
                    (<hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> iv. 512-537; xi. 385-461). According to
                    Aeschylus, Agamemnon was slain in his bath, his wife first throwing a piece of
                    cloth over him to prevent resistance. For his death vengeance was taken by his
                    son Orestes. In the legends of the Peloponnesus, Agamemnon was regarded as the
                    highest type of a powerful monarch, and in Sparta he was worshipped under the
                    title of Zeus Agamemnon. His tomb was pointed out among the ruins of Mycenae
                    (Pausanias ii. 16. 5). <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. s. μ.)</hi></p>
