                    sea-fight of Salamis disputing the palm of victory with the Athenians. It was
                    the native country and kingdom of Aeacus, who called it <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aegina,</hi> from his mother’s name. (Ovid.) The inhabitants were called <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeginetoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aeginenses.</hi> Aegina is
                    triangular in shape, and is about 8 miles long from N.W. to S.E., and about G
                    broad, with an area of about 41 square miles. Strabo states its circumference at
                    180 stadia, or about 22 ½English miles. Its western side consists of stony but
                    fertile plains, which are well cultivated, and produce luxuriant crops of grain,
                    with some cotton, vines, almonds, and figs. The rest of the island is
                    mountainous, and rather barren. The southern end rises in the conical Mount
                    Oros, and the Panhellenian ridge stretches to the north, from which fertile
                    narrow valleys descend on either hand. From the absence of marshes, and its
                    insularity, the climate is mild, and the most salubrious of Greece. The ruins of
                    the ancient Aegina extend along two small ports, still protected by well-built
                    ancient moles, and the shores of an open bay, defended by an ancient breakwater,
                    near the N.W. cape of the island. On the land side the city walls are still
                    distinctly traceable, 10 feet in thickness, strengthened by towers at unequal
                    distances, and pierced by three gates. They abutted on those of the ports, which
                    were thus included within the line of fortifications, as at Athens and elsewhere
                    in ancient Greece. Two elegant Doric columns and substructures are all that
                    remain of the buildings noticed by Pausanias within the precincts of a city that
                    was long the greatest and most opulent maritime power of Greece; but the ruins
                    of seventeen Christian churches, still visible, prove that after the glories of
                    the proud city had passed away—after what it suffered from the jealousy of its
                    rival Athens, and from an earthquake about the beginning of our era—a
                    considerable modern town had occupied its site. Some of these may perhaps only
                    date from the time that Aegina remained under its Venetian masters, as does a
                    tower erected at the entrance <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n196/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0196-0181"/> of the largest port. The Venetians resigned
                    possession of the island to the Turks in 1715, under whom it became the prey of
                    Mainote and other pirates, until the emancipation of Greece made it, in 1828-29,
                    the seat of the Greek government. On a hill near the N.E. corner of the island
                    stands the modern little town of Aegina (as it is pronounced by the modern
                    Greeks). It is separated by a ravine from the hill, on which rise in lonely
                    majesty the ruins of a noble temple, supposed to be that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jupiter Panhellenius,</hi> though the point has been disputed. The temple
                    occupies the rocky summit of a hill, in the midst of a forest of pines, at the
                    extremity of the Panhellenian ridge. It was a ruin in the days of Cicero, as
                    mentioned in one of his letters, and seems to have been thrown down by an
                    earthquake at an unknown epoch. This temple is conspicuous from a distance, and
                    was visited by Chandler in the last century; but has been chiefly known to us by
                    the successful excavations of our countrymen Cockerell and Foster, assisted by
                    Baron Haller and Μ. Linckh of Stuttgard, in 1811. These gentlemen united in
                    clearing away the rubbish which the lapse of 2000 years had accumulated on the
                    basement and floor of the cella; and after twenty days’ exertion they were
                    rewarded by the discovery not only of many interesting details relating to
                    Grecian architecture, but also of many statues, in wonderfully energetic
                    attitudes, that had once adorned the fallen pediments of this celebrated temple.
                    These consist of the eleven figures of the eastern and five statues of the
                    western pediment, almost entire, besides fragments of the rest, and two
                    statuettes, and other ornaments of the acroteria. These sculptures supply an
                    important link in the history of ancient art, and connect the schools of early
                    Greece with that of Etruscan sculpture. The efforts of Messrs Cockerell and
                    Foster to secure those treasures to their country are well known, as well as
                    their failure through an unlucky mistake of the agent sent out to purchase them
                    for the British Museum. They now form one of the most interesting acquisitions
                    of the magnificent <hi rend="italic">Glyptothek</hi> of Munich. The temple
                    stands on a stylobate of 94 feet by 45 feet. The original number of columns in
                    the peristyle was thirty-two, of which twelve were ranged on each side, and six
                    in each front, 17 feet 2 inches high, including the wide spreading ovolo of the
                    capital, and a diameter of 3 feet 3 inches at the base. Two other columns, of 3
                    feet 2 inches between antae, are in the pronaos, and two similar in the
                    opisthodomos or <hi rend="italic">posticum.</hi> The cella had a door at each
                    end; a double row of smaller columns, 2 feet 4 inches in diameter, were within
                    the cella to support its partial roof; but the greatest portion of the cella was
                    open, as this temple was <hi rend="italic">hypaethral.</hi> There still remain
                    twenty-one columns of the peristyle, with their architraves; six of the eastern
                    front, and continuously with them are five columns of the north side; the four
                    columns of the pronaos and opisthodomos, and the lower part of the shafts of
                    five within the cella. The tympana had been painted of a bright azure, to give
                    relief to the statues; and the drapery of Minerva, the middle figure of each
                    group, had been painted red and blue. The whole of the ornaments on the cornices
                    and upper mouldings of the pediment had been painted in <hi rend="italic"
                    >encaustic,</hi> not carved. The subject of the groups of statuary appears -t'o
                    be the contest for the body of Patroclus, one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeacidae</hi> (or royal progeny of Aegina of old), as described by Horner.
                    (Cockerell <hi rend="italic">On the</hi><hi rend="italic">Aegina</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Marbles;</hi> Brand’s <hi rend="italic">Journal.)</hi> This
                    magnificent structure was erected most probably in the 6th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but, at all events, undoubtedly belongs to the
                    brilliant period of Aeginetan power, when its navy and its commerce were the
                    pride of Greece, and carried its citizens to the remotest shores of the
                    Mediterranean and the Euxine. Silver money is said to have been struck at Aegina
                    long before it was coined even at Athens. The victory of Salamis was in a great
                    measure owing to the thirty ships of Aegina, and the voice of grateful Greece
                    assigned to her warriors on that eventful day the prize of valour. Yet not long
                    after, the rivalry of Athens began to cloud the prosperity of the haughty
                    islanders, whose fleet she had before defeated; and Aegina at length sunk under
                    the enmity of a relentless commercial rival, that banished her citizens and
                    supplied their place with Attic colonists. After the close of the Peloponnesian
                    war Lysander restored the banished inhabitants, but Aegina never recovered its
                    ancient prosperity.</p>
