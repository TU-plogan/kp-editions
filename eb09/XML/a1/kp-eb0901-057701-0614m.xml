                    Bart., the celebrated historian, younger son of the preceding, was born at
                    Kenley, Shropshire, on the 29th December 1792. He studied at the university of
                    Edinburgh, distinguishing himself especially in the classes of Greek and
                    mathematics. In 1814 he passed at the Scotch bar, but he did not at once enter
                    on the regular practice of his profession. The close of the war had opened up
                    the Continent, and Alison, sharing with many of his countrymen the desire to
                    witness the scene of the stirring events of the previous twenty years, set out
                    in the autumn of 1814 for a lengthened tour in France. It was during this
                    period, as he tells us in a characteristic passage of the work itself, that he
                    “conceived the first idea” of writing his History, and “inhaled that ardent
                    spirit, that deep enthusiasm,” which enabled him to accomplish his self-imposed
                    task. A more immediate result of the tour was his first literary work of any
                    importance, <hi rend="italic">Travels in France during the Years</hi> 1814-15,
                    which appeared in the latter year. On his return to Edinburgh, Mr Alison
                    practised at the bar for some years with but very moderate success. In 1822,
                    however, he became one of the four advocates-depute for Scotland. The extensive
                    and varied experience gained in this office, which he held until 1830, gave him
                    the necessary qualifications for writing his <hi rend="italic">Principles of the
                    Criminal Law of Scotland</hi> (1832), and <hi rend="italic">Practice of the
                    Criminal Law of Scotland</hi> (1833), works that are still of standard
                    authority. It was the acknowledged merit of these treatises that chiefly induced
                    Sir Robert Peel, during his brief administration of 1834, to confer on Mr Alison
                    the important judicial office of sheriff of Lanarkshire, which ranks next in
                    dignity and emolument to a judgeship in the supreme court. The office, though by
                    no means a sinecure, afforded considerable leisure, which Mr Alison employed in
                    not only making frequent contributions to periodical literature, but also
                    writing the long-projected <hi rend="italic">History of Europe,</hi> for which
                    he had been collecting materials for more than fifteen years. The history of the
                    period from the commencement of the French revolution till the restoration of
                    the Bourbons in 1815 was completed in ten volumes in 1842, and met with a
                    success almost unexampled in works of its class. Within a few years it ran
                    through ten editions, and was translated into most of the languages of Europe,
                    as well as into Arabic and Hindustani. At the time of the author’s death it was
                    stated that 108,000 volumes of the library edition and 439,000 volumes of the
                    popular edition had been sold. A popularity so wide-spread must almost of
                    necessity have had some basis of real merit on which to rest, and the good
                    qualities of Mr Alison’s work lay upon the surface. It brought together, though
                    not always in a well-arranged form, an immense amount of information that had
                    before been practically inaccessible to the general public. It made an attempt
                    at least to show the organic connection in the policy and progress of the
                    different nations of Europe; and its descriptions of what may be called external
                    history—of battles, sieges, and state pageants—were always spirited and
                    interesting. On the other hand, the faults of the work were so numerous and
                    glaring as to prevent it from ever taking rank as a classic. The general style
                    was prolix, involved, and vicious; inaccurate statements and fallacious
                    arguments were to be found in almost every page; and the constant repetition of
                    trite moral reflections and egotistical references seriously detracted from its
                    dignity. A more grave defect resulted from the author’s strong political
                    partisanship, which entirely unfitted him for dealing with the problems of
                    history in a philosophical spirit. In the position of unbending Toryism which he
                    occupied, it was impossible for him to give any explanation of so complex a fact
                    as the French revolution that would be satisfactory to reflective minds.
                    Accordingly, his treatment of what may be called the inner history of those
                    forces hidden in the French revolution which have made modern Europe what it is,
                    was meagre and incomplete in the last degree.</p>
                <p>A continuation of the History, embracing the period from 1815 to 1852, which was
                    completed in four volumes in 1856, did not meet with the same success as the
                    earlier work. The course of events did not afford the same material for the
                    exercise of the author’s powers of description, and the period being so near as
                    to be almost contemporary, there was a stronger temptation, which he seems to
                    have found it impossible to resist, to yield to political prejudice. Three great
                    measures of English legislation— the Act restricting the paper currency, the
                    Reform Act of 1832, and the Act abolishing the corn laws—were the object of his
                    special aversion; and, with little regard for consistency, he was in the habit
                    of tracing, now to one and now to another of these measures, all the real and
                    many imaginary evils in the state of the nation. On the currency question, in
                    regard to which he stood from the first almost alone in opinion, he has inserted
                    several tedious dissertations in the continuation of his History, besides
                    publishing a separate pamphlet in 1847. On the two other great measures he clung
                    tenaciously to his opinion long after the more intelligent of his party had
                    admitted the necessity, if not the justice, of the concessions that had been
                    made. The use which Mr Alison made of statistics in the continuation of his
                    History to support his peculiar political and economic theories was little short
                    of astounding. He will be acquitted of intentional unfairness only by those who
                    are aware, not merely how easy it is to make figures yield any result that may
                    be wished, but also how difficult it is to bring out the correct result, even
                    with the most honest purpose, unless there be special aptitude and special
                    training on the part of the investigator.</p>
                <p>Mr Alison’s successful literary career received from time to time due recognition
                    in the form of public honours. In 1845 he was chosen rector of Marischal
                    College, Aberdeen, and in 1851 he was raised to the same honourable position by
                    the students of Glasgow University. In 1852 the dignity of baronet was conferred
                    upon him by Lord Derby, and in the following year he was made a D.C.L. of
                    Oxford. His literary activity continued till within a short time of his death,
                    the chief works he published in addition to his History being the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles of Population</hi> (1840), in answer to Malthus; a <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Marlborough</hi> (1847); and the <hi rend="italic">Lives
                    of Lord Castlereagh and Sir C. Stewart</hi> (1861). Three volumes of his
                    political, historical, and miscellaneous essays were reprinted in 1850. Sir
                    Archibald died at Possil House, Glasgow, on the 23d May 1867.</p>
