                <p><label type="entry">ALE</label>, a fermented liquor obtained from an infusion of
                    malt, and differing from beer chiefly in having a less proportion of hops.
                    Before the introduction of hops into England from Flanders, about 1524, ale was
                    the name exclusively applied to malt liquor, the term beer being gradually
                    introduced at a later period to describe liquor brewed with an infusion of hops.
                    The two words, however, are now used with little distinction of meaning. Ale,
                    the wine of barley, is said to have originally been made in Egypt. The natives
                    alike of Spain, France, and Britain all use an infusion of barley for their
                    ordinary liquor, which was called <hi rend="italic">coelia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ceria</hi> in the first country, <hi rend="italic">cerevisia</hi>
                    in the second, and <hi rend="italic">curmi</hi> in the third—all literally
                    importing <hi rend="italic">the strong water.</hi></p>
                <p>“All the several nations,” says Pliny, “who inhabit the west of Europe have a
                    liquor with which they intoxicate themselves, made of corn and water. The manner
                    of making this liquor is sometimes different in Gaul, Spain, and other
                    countries, and is called by many various names; but its nature and properties
                    are everywhere the same. The people of Spain, in particular, brew the liquor so
                    well that it will keep good a long time. So exquisite is the cunning of mankind
                    in gratifying their vicious appetites that they have thus invented a method to
                    make water itself intoxicate.”</p>
                <p>The method in which the ancient Britons and other Celtic nations made their ale
                    is thus described by Isidores and Orosius :—</p>
                <p>“The grain is steeped in water, and made to germinate, by which its spirits are
                    excited and set at liberty; it is then dried and ground; after which it is
                    infused in a certain quantity of water, which, being fermented, becomes a
                    pleasant, warming, strengthening, and intoxicating liquor.”</p>
                <p>This ale was most commonly made of barley, but sometimes of wheat, oats, and
                    millet. Ale was the favourite liquor of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes. Before their
                    conversion to Christianity, they believed that drinking large and frequent
                    draughts of ale was one of the chief felicities which those heroes enjoyed who
                    were admitted into the hall of Odin. Anciently the Welsh and Scots had two kinds
                    of ale, called <hi rend="italic">common ale</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spiced
                    ale,</hi> the relative values of which were thus appraised by law: “If a farmer
                    had no mead, he shall pay two casks of spiced ale, or four casks of common ale,
                    for one cask of mead.” By this law a cask of spiced ale, nine palms in height
                    and eighteen palms in diameter, was valued at a sum of money equal in value to
                    £7, 10s. of our present money; and a cask of common ale of the same dimensions
                    at a sum equal to £3, 15s. This is a sufficient proof that even common ale at
                    that period was an article of luxury among the Welsh, which could only be
                    obtained by the great and opulent.</p>
