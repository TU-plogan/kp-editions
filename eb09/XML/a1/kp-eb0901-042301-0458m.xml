                    the following eleven tálukás or sub-districts: — Nagar, Jámkhair, Párnair,
                    Srígonda, Karjt, Newasa, Kopargám, Sangamnair, Rahurí, Siogám, and Ankolá. A
                    natural boundary is formed on the west of the Ankolá táluká by the Western
                    Gháts, and, further south, by the edge of the table-land of Párnair; on the S.W.
                    the district is bounded by the Gor river; on the S. by the Bhímá and Sholápur
                    collectorates; on the E. by the Nizám’s dominions; on the N.E. by the Godávarí
                    river; and on the N. by the Násik district. The total area of the district is
                    returned at 4,209,036 acres, or 6576∙62 square miles. Of the total area,
                    3,068,162 acres, or 479∙00 square miles, are cultivated; 121,474 acres, or
                    189∙80 square miles, are cultivable, but not actually under tillage; and
                    1,019,400 acres, or 1592∙81 square miles, are uncultivable. The last portion
                    includes (besides unarable lands) village sites, roads, tanks, rivers, &amp;c.
                    The population of the district, according to the census taken on the night of
                    the 21st February 1872, numbered 773,938 souls, divided into the following five
                    classes:— Hindus, 716,820, or 92∙62 per cent, of the total population;
                    Mahometans, 42,435, or 5∙49 per cent.; Buddhists, 12,547, or 1∙62 per cent.;
                    Christians, 941, or 0∙12 per cent.; and other denominations, 1195, or 0∙15 per
                    cent. The bulk of the population consists of Marhattás and Kunbis, the latter
                    being the agriculturists. On the north the district is watered by the Godávarí
                    and its tributaries the Prawara and the Múlá; on the north-east by the Dor,
                    another tributary of the Godávarí; on the east by the Séphaní, which flows
                    through the valley below the Bálá Ghát range; and in the extreme south by the
                    Bhímá and its tributary the Gor. The Síná river, another tributary of the Bhímá,
                    flows through the Nagar and Karjat tálukás. The collectorate on the whole is
                    fairly well watered, although in some villages among the hills and spurs of the
                    Western Gháts the supply is insufficient. The district is intersected by the
                    Bombay and Agra road; a second road connects Puná <hi rend="italic">via</hi>
                    Serur with the town of Ahmadnagar, and is continued thence towards Máligám; a
                    third road leads from Puná to Náráyangám, besides various cross-tracts and minor
                    roads connecting the different towns of the district</p>
                <p>The only important industry is weaving. The principal agricultural products are
                    wheat, gram, bajrá, joár, and tur dal. The early or spring crop is bajrá and tur
                    dál; wheat, gram, and joár being sown later in the season. Several other food
                    grains are also raised; and sugar-cane, betel leaves, a little cotton, and all
                    descriptions of vegetables are sown on suitable soils. The staple food of the
                    people is bajrá and joár (coarse kinds of millet). The total revenue of the
                    district is returned at nearly £170,000; about £140,000 being derived from the
                    land revenue. The total annual expenditure is returned at £50,000. The present
                    land settlement was introduced about 1844-45, and the thirty years’ leases are
                    now beginning to fall in. In a few villages which were transferred to Ahmadnagar
                    from the Násik collectorate the leases have already expired, and a revision of
                    the settlement is in progress (1873). The following eight towns are returned as
                    containing a population oi upwards of 5000 souls :—Ahmadnagar, population
                    32,841; Sangamnair, 9978; Páthardí, 7117; Khurdá, 6889; Srígonda, 6175; Bhingar,
                    5752; Karjat, 5535; and Sonái, 5254. The municipal system has been introduced
                    into the towns of Ahmadnagar, Sangamnair, and Bhingar. In the two first named,
                    the municipal revenue is derived from a house tax and octroi duties on goods and
                    articles imported into the town for consumption. In Bhingar the municipal
                    revenue is raised by the levy of a classified tax on professions and trades
                    carried on within the town. The municipal revenue and expenditure in 1872,
                    together with the incidence of municipal tax per head of the population in each
                    of the three towns, was as follows:—Ahmadnagar, municipal income, £3611, 18s.;
                    municipal expenditure, £3557, 12s.; incidence per head of population, 2s. 2¼d.
                    Sangamnair, municipal income, £275, 4s.,— 6½d. per head; expenditure, £217.
                    Bhingar, municipal revenue, £259, 18s.—8¾d. per head; expenditure, £259, 18s.
                    Ahmadnagar district contains 1 high school, 1 first-grade Anglo-vernacular
                    school, 3 middle-class schools, 164 lower-class schools, and 1 girls’ school.
                    Education is making fair progress, and the number of schools is annually
                    increasing as funds become available. For the protection of person and property,
                    a regular police force of 594 men of all grades is maintained, at a cost, during
                    1872-73, of £9869. A village police, numbering 2042 men, is also kept up, at a
                    cost of £1978 per annum. There are no special criminal classes in the district
                    except a few Bhils, and they are now much less troublesome than formerly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ahmadnagar City,</hi> the capital of the district of the
                    same name, is situated in 19° 6' N. lat., and 74° 46' E. long. It is a town of
                    considerable antiquity, having been founded, in 1494, by Ahmad Nizám Sháh, on
                    the site of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n459/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0459-0424"/> a more ancient city, Bhingar. This Ahmad
                    established a new monarchy, which lasted until its overthrow by Sháh Jahán in
                    1636. In 1759 the Peshwá obtained possession of the place by bribing the
                    Mahometan commander; and in 1797 it was ceded by the Peshwá to the Marhattá
                    chief Daulat Ráo Sindhiá. During our war with the Marhattás in 1803 Ahmadnagar
                    was invested by a British force under General Wellesley, and captured. It was
                    afterwards restored to the Marhattás, but again came into the possession of the
                    British in 1817, according to the terms of the treaty of Puná. The town has
                    rapidly advanced in prosperity under British rule. It now contains a population
                    of 32,841 souls, is an important station on the Great Indian Peninsular Railway,
                    and has been created a municipality, as is mentioned above.</p>
