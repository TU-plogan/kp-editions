                <p><label type="entry">ALBACETE</label>, one of the new provinces of Spain, was
                    formed in 1833 out of districts taken from Murcia and New Castile. It is bounded
                    on the N. by Cuença, on the E. by Valencia and Alicant, on the S. by Murcia, and
                    on the W. by Ciudad Real and Jaen. The area is 5971 square miles. The province
                    is generally hilly, some of the peaks of the sierras rising to a height of 5000
                    feet; but it contains rich plains and many fertile valleys. The principal rivers
                    are the Mundo in the southern and the Jucar in the northern part of the
                    province; and there are numerous smaller streams. Some parts of the country have
                    a bare appearance, being destitute of wood, but the neighbourhood of Alcarez is
                    covered with fruit trees, and presents the aspect of a garden. Agriculture is in
                    a tolerably prosperous state, more advanced than in the centre of Castile, but
                    less so than in the rich districts of Murcia and Valencia. Cereals, pulse, and
                    fruits of all kinds are produced, as well as wine of fair quality, and excellent
                    honey. Saffron also is produced in large quantities, and some attention is given
                    to the keeping of silk-worms. Many of the inhabitants devote themselves to the
                    rearing of cattle, sheep, and goats. The bulls of Albacete are in request for
                    bull-fights; there is a good breed of mules, and the horses of the province have
                    long mounted the Spanish cavalry. Manufactures are confined to the spinning of
                    hemp, and the making of coarse cloths, porcelain, earthenware, and cutlery.
                    There are several distilleries, and a considerable trade in wood. The district
                    is rich in minerals, including silver, iron, copper, zinc, sulphur, gypsum, and
                    coal; but, excepting stones and marble for building purposes, they are little
                    wrought. In addition to agricultural produce, small quantities of zinc, iron,
                    and sulphur are exported. There are numerous mineral springs, chiefly
                    sulphureous, and hot as well as cold, at various places in the province. Among
                    the chief towns are Albacete, Chinchilla, Bonillo, and Alcarez. The railway from
                    Madrid to Valencia traverses the province, and at Chinchilla a line branches
                    southward to Murcia.</p>

                <p>The state of education throughout the province is very low. In the town of
                    Albacete, where it is best, little more than half the population can read; while
                    at Yeste, where it is worst, the proportion is only 1 in 15. The graver crimes
                    are of infrequent occurrence; but the inhabitants always wear arms, and offences
                    against the person are numerous. Population in 1867, 221,444.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Albacete,</hi> a town of Spain, capital of the above
                    province, is situated about 140 miles S.E. of Madrid, and is a station on the
                    railway between Madrid and Valencia. It is surrounded by a fertile plain, and
                    has considerable trade in saffron and in the agricultural products of the
                    district. A great market, chiefly for the sale of cattle, is held annually in
                    September, and extends over several days. The town is well built, and has
                    several churches, two hospitals, and a normal school. At one time it had an
                    extensive trade in cutlery, from which it received the name of the Sheffield of
                    Spain. This manufacture has been very much reduced by the importation of cutlery
                    from England and Germany, but Albacete is still famous for its daggers, which
                    are held in high repute and much worn by the Spaniards. They are formidable
                    weapons, of coarse manufacture, but with richly-ornamented handles, and
                    frequently bear proverbial inscriptions suitable to their murderous appearance.
