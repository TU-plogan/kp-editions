                    Rhine, on the south by Switzerland, and on the west by the Vosges Mountains; and
                    it comprises an area of 3344 English square miles. The district possesses many
                    natural attractions, and is one of the most fertile in central Europe. There are
                    several ranges of hills, but no point within the province attains a great
                    elevation. The only river of importance is the Ill, which falls into the Rhine
                    after a course of more than 100 miles, and is navigable below Colmar. The hills
                    are generally richly wooded, chiefly with fir, beech, and oak. The agricultural
                    products are corn, flax, tobacco, grapes, and various other fruits. The country
                    has a great wealth of minerals, silver having been found, and copper, lead,
                    iron, coal, and rock-salt being wrought with profit. There are considerable
                    manufactures, chiefly of cotton and linen. The chief towns are Mühlhausen and
                    Colmar in the upper district, and Strasburg in the lower. The province is
                    traversed from east to west by the railway from Strasburg to Nancy, and the main
                    line north and south runs between Basle and Strasburg.</p>
                <p>From a very early period and for many ages Alsace has been a disputed territory,
                    and has suffered in the contentions of rival races. It formed part of ancient
                    Gaul, and was therefore included in the Roman empire. The Romans held it nearly
                    five hundred years, and on the dissolution of their power it passed under the
                    sway of the Franks and of the early French monarchs, by whom it was governed
                    until the time of Otho I., Emperor of Germany, who reigned about the middle of
                    the 10th century. It was at that period that Alsace became German: its original
                    population of Celtic tribes, which had been first Romanised and then further
                    qualified by a Frankish element, was now to a great extent supplanted by a
                    purely Teutonic stock. By Otho II. the province was erected into a landgraviate,
                    and it subsequently came into the possession of the House of Austria, which
                    succeeded in 1273 to the imperial dignity of Germany. This state of things
                    continued until 1648, when a large part of Alsace was ceded to France by the
                    treaty of Münster. In the war which preceded this peace (generally known as the
                    Thirty Years’ War) Alsace had been so terribly devastated by the French that the
                    German emperor found himself unable to hold it. The population was greatly
                    reduced in numbers, and much of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0674-0637"/> and was left uncultivated. In the subsequent war
                    between France and the empire of Germany, arising out of the attempt of Louis
                    XIV. to seize Holland, that part of Alsace which remained to Germany was again
                    overrun by the French. Although this war was terminated in 1678 by the treaty of
                    Nimeguen, the French monarch was desirous of incorporating a still larger amount
                    of Rhine territory; and accordingly, in 1680 he laid claim to a number of
                    territories, belonging to princes of the empire, which he alleged had been
                    dismembered from Alsace. It was ordered that these territories should be at once
                    restored to that province under the crown of France, and several independent
                    sovereigns were cited to appear before two chambers of inquiry which Louis had
                    established at Brissac and Metz. The princes appealed to the German emperor and
                    to the Diet; but the previous wars had so exhausted the power of the former that
                    nothing could be done to resist the aggression. In 1681 the French troops under
                    Louvois seized Strasburg, aided by the treachery of the bishop and other great
                    men of the city. A further war broke out, but by the treaty of Ratisbon in 1684,
                    Strasburg was secured to France. Again the war was renewed in 1688, and
                    continued for nine years, when, at the peace of Ryswick, in 1697, another
                    considerable portion of Alsace was ceded to France. Some remaining territories
                    of small extent were acquired by the French after the revolution of 1789.</p>
                <p>It will be seen from the foregoing sketch that Alsace was originally French, that
                    it then became German, and then French again. From the middle of the tenth
                    century, however, the population has in the main been Teutonic; and the French
                    conquests of the seventeenth century, while modifying this element, still left
                    it predominant. The people continued to use German as their native tongue,
                    though the educated classes also spoke French. Protestantism was professed by a
                    large number of the inhabitants; and in many respects their characteristics
                    identified them rather with the race to the east than that to the west of the
                    Rhine. In process of time, however, they considered themselves French, and lost
                    all desire for re-annexation to any of the German States.</p>
                <p>Alsace suffered a good deal in the war of 1870-71. The earlier battles of the
                    campaign were fought there; Strasburg and other of its fortified towns were
                    besieged and taken; and its people were compelled to submit to very severe
                    exactions. The civil and military government of the province, as well as that of
                    Lorraine, was assumed by the Germans as soon as they obtained possession of
                    those parts of France, which was very shortly after the commencement of the war.
                    The Alsatian railways were reorganised and provided with a staff of German
                    officials. German stamps were introduced from Berlin; the occupied towns were
                    garrisoned by the Landwehr; and requisitions on a large scale were demanded, and
                    paid for in cheques which, at the close of the war, were to be honoured by
                    whichever side should stand in the unpleasant position of the conquered. The
                    people, notwithstanding their German origin, showed a very strong feeling
                    against the invaders, and in no part of France was the enemy resisted with
                    greater stubbornness. It was evident from an early period of the war, however,
                    that Prussia was resolved to reannex Alsace to German territory. When the
                    preliminaries of peace came to be discussed at Versailles in February 1871, the
                    cession of Alsace, together with what is called German Lorraine, was one of the
                    earliest conditions laid down by Count Bismarck and accepted by Μ. Thiers. This
                    sacrifice of territory was afterwards ratified by the National Assembly at
                    Bordeaux, though not without a protest from the representatives of the
                    departments about to be given up; and thus Alsace once more became German. By
                    the bill for the incorporation of Alsace and German Lorraine, introduced into
                    the German Parliament in May 1871, it was provided that the sole and supreme
                    control of the two provinces should be vested in the Emperor of Germany and the
                    Federal Council until January 1st, 1873, when the constitution of the German
                    empire was to be established. Bismarck admitted the aversion of the populace to
                    Prussian rule, but said that everything would be done to conciliate the people.
                    This policy appears really to have been carried out, and it was not long in
                    bearing fruit. Many of the inhabitants of the conquered districts, however,
                    still clung to the old connection, and on the 30th of September 1872—the day by
                    which the people were required to determine whether they would consider
                    themselves German subjects and remain, or French subjects and transfer their
                    domicile to France—45,000 elected to be still French, and sorrowfully took their
                    departure. The German system of compulsory education of every child above the
                    age of six was introduced directly after the annexation. The population in 1871
                    amounted to upwards of 1,060,000.</p>
