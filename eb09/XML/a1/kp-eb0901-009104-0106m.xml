                <p>During the year ending April 30, 1873, the <hi rend="italic">total</hi> amount of
                    bills, checks, &amp;c., paid at the Clearing House showed an increase
                    of£643,613,000 during the same period ending April 1872, and o: £2,745,924,000
                    over 1868. The amounts passing through on the <hi rend="italic">4ths of the
                    month</hi> amounted to £265,965,000, showing an increase of £36,336,000 over
                    1872. The payments on <hi rend="italic">Stock Exchange Account Days</hi> formed
                    a sum of £1,032,474,600, being an increase of £90,028,000 over 1872. The
                    payments on <hi rend="italic">Consols Account Days</hi> for the same period
                    amounted to £243,561,000, giving an increase of £9,718,000 over 1872.</p>
                <p>In English and Indian Government Securities, the settle ments are monthly, and
                    for foreign, railway, and other securities, generally speaking, they are
                    fortnightly. It follows therefore that in 1867—1868, an ordinary Stock Exchange
                    Account Day involved payments, on Stock Exchange accounts only, averaging about
                    £10,000,000 sterling, and in 1872-3 something like £25,000,000 sterling; and
                    these sums again, enormous as they are, represent for the most part only the
                    balance of much largertransactions. The London Account is, in fact, probably the
                    greatest and most important periodical event in the financial world. The great
                    European centres have theirown Account Days and methods of settlement, but the
                    amounts dealt in are very much less than on the London market. The leading
                    cities in the United Kingdom have also their Stock Exchanges, but their practice
                    follows more or less that of London, where the bulk of their business is
                    transacted by means of post and telegraph.</p>
                <p>The Account in Consols or other English Government Securities, or in the
                    securities of the Government of India, or in Bank of England Stock, or other
                    Stocks transferable at the Bank of England, extends over a month, the
                    settlements being monthly, and in them the committee of the Stock Exchange does
                    not take cognisance of any bargain for a future account, if it shall have been
                    effected more <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0107-0092"/> than eight days previously to the close of the
                    existing account.</p>
                <p>The Account in Securities to Bearer, and, with the above exceptions, in
                    Registered Securities also, extends over a period of from twelve to nineteen
                    days. This period is in each case terminated by the “settlement,” which occurs
                    twice in each month (generally about the middle and end), on days fixed by the
                    committee for general purposes of the Stock Exchange in the preceding month.</p>
                <p>This “settlement” occupies three continuous days, which are all termed Account
                    days, but the third day is the true Account, Settling, or Pay Day.</p>
                <p>Continuation or Carrying-over is the operation by which the settlement of a
                    bargain transacted for money, or for a given account, may for a consideration
                    (called either a “Contango” or a “Backwardation”) be deferred for the period of
                    another account. Such a continuation is equivalent to a sale “for the day,” and
                    a repurchase for the succeeding account, or to a purchase “for the day,” and a
                    re-sale for the succeeding account. The price at which such transactions are
                    adjusted is the “Making-Up” price of the day.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Contango</hi> is a technical term which expresses the rate of
                    interest charged for the loan of money upon the security of stock transferred
                    for the period of an account or otherwise, or the rate of interest paid by the
                    buyer to the seller to be allowed to defer paying for the stock purchased, until
                    the next settlement day.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Backwardation,</hi> or, as it is more often called, <hi
                    rend="italic">Back</hi> (for brevity), in contradistinction to contango, is the
                    amount charged for the loan of stock from one account to the other, and it is
                    paid to the purchaser by the seller in order to allow the seller to defer the
                    delivery of the stock.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">Bull Account</hi> is one in which either the purchases have
                    predominated over the sales, or the disposition to purchase has been more marked
                    than the disposition to sell.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">Bear Account</hi> is one in which either the sales have
                    preponderated over the purchases, or in which the disposition to sell has been
                    more strongly displayed than the disposition to buy.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the Bull or the Bear disposition extends to the great majority of
                    securities, as when there are general falls or general rises. Sometimes a Bull
                    Account in one set of securities is contemporaneous with a Bear Account in
                    another.— <hi rend="italic">Vide</hi> Cracroft’s Slock Exchange Manual.</p>
