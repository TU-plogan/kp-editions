                    subjugated Goths whom the Emperor Theodosius employed in his war with Eugenius.
                    On the death of Theodosius in 395 the Goths asserted their independence, and
                    under the leadership of Alaric made an incursion from Thrace, where they had
                    been located, into the Morea. Athens yielded to them without resistance, and
                    Alaric enriched himself with the movable treasures of the city, though he did
                    not, as some habe asserted, destroy buildings and works of art. Rufinus, the
                    crafty minister of Arcadius, did nothing to check the advance of the barbarians,
                    and it has even been said that he had a secret understanding with Alaric.
                    Opposition came, however, from the Western Empire. Stilicho, the famous general,
                    landed at Corinth, and drove the Goths to Mount Pholoe, on the frontiers of
                    Elis, where he besieged their camp. With proper vigilance, the siege could not
                    have been raised; but the Romans were careless, and Alaric with his army
                    contrived to escape to Epirus. Stilicho was prevented from following him by an
                    order from the Emperor Arcadius, who conferred upon Alaric the prefecture of
                    eastern Illyricum. About the same time the Gothic chief was chosen king by his
                    people. It was natural that Alaric’s desire of conquest should increase with the
                    increase of his power, and accordingly about the year 400 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> he set out to invade the Empire of the West. His march was
                    exceedingly slow, and it was not until the spring of 403 that he appeared before
                    Milan, from which the Emperor Honorius instantly fled to the fortress of Asta in
                    Liguria. Being besieged there, he was on the point of capitulating when he was
                    relieved by Stilicho, who, in the battle of Pollentia, fought on Easter-day,
                    gained a somewhat doubtful victory over Alaric. Some time after, the contest was
                    renewed at Verona, and Alaric sustained a decisive defeat. He was obliged to
                    accept terms of peace, and to retreat for the time; but his attitude was always
                    threatening, and Honorius found it expedient to buy him off by appointing him
                    prefect of western Illyricum, with a large revenue. In this capacity Stilicho
                    encouraged Alaric to lead his army against Constantinople, probably more with
                    the design of keeping him at a distance from Italy than with any hope of
                    reuniting the divided empire. The final expedition to Constantinople was not
                    undertaken; but for his services during three years in Epirus, Alaric claimed an
                    extravagant reward, and Honorius, on the advice of Stilicho, promised him 4000
                    pounds of gold. Shortly afterwards the weak-minded<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n480/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0480-0443"/> emperor procured the assassination of his
                    minister, the only Roman who had proved himself able to cope with the Gothic
                    forces, and broke all the treaties which Stilicho had made with Alaric. The
                    latter at once marched upon Rome (408) by the Via Flaminia, and laid siege to
                    the city. On coming to treat with him, the Romans found his demands so
                    extravagant that they threatened a desperate resistance, to which Alaric made
                    the well-known reply, “The closer hay is pressed, the easier is it mown.” At
                    last the barbarian was induced to retire by the promise of 5000 pounds of gold
                    and 30,000 pounds of silver, besides other treasure. The respite, however, was
                    but for a time. Honorius, who had left Rome for Ravenna, refused to ratify by
                    treaty certain conditions, moderate in themselves, on which Alaric firmly
                    insisted, and the capital was again at the mercy of the enemy. With commendable
                    forbearance, Alaric contented himself at first with taking possession of Ostia,
                    from which he summoned the city, to surrender, threatening the immediate
                    destruction of the food stores in case of refusal. The terrified people at once
                    opened their gates, and agreed that the conqueror should appoint another emperor
                    in place of Honorius. Alaric’s choice fell upon Attalus, the prefect of the
                    city, who, though well received at first, soon proved himself thoroughly
                    incompetent, and Honorius had to be restored. While the conferences as to the
                    restoration were still being carried on at Ravenna, the treachery of Honorius
                    occasioned yet another and more disastrous siege of Rome by the Goths. Sarus, a
                    barbarian and a hereditary enemy of the house of Balti, was permitted by the
                    emperor to attack the camp of the Goths and return in triumph to Ravenna. Alaric
                    was naturally indignant, laid siege to Rome for the third time, and gained an
                    entrance by the Salarian gate on the night of the 24th August 410. For six days
                    the city was given over to the horrors of a pillage, which the humane orders of
                    Alaric did but little to mitigate. On the 29th August Alaric withdrew his troops
                    from Rome, and led them into southern Italy, which he ravaged for several
                    months. Towards the close of the year, while engaged in the siege of Cosentia
                    <hi rend="italic">(Cosenza),</hi> he was seized with an illness which proved
                    fatal after a very short duration. He was buried with his treasures in the bed
                    of the river Busentinus, which was diverted from its channel for that purpose,
                    and all the prisoners who were engaged in the work were put to death in order
                    that the place of his sepulture might remain unknown. The character of Alaric
                    has been somewhat variously represented by historians. In forming an estimate of
                    it many have been misled by the use of the term barbarian, which, as applied to
                    him, it should be remembered, indicates a national and not a personal
                    distinction. Many proofs may be found of his humanity and moderation in trying
                    circumstances, while, on the other hand, the charges of cruelty brought against
                    him are not borne out by evidence. His marked respect for Christianity is
                    explained by the fact that, if he was not himself a Christian, he had come early
                    under Christian influence, having had frequent intercourse with Arian
                    teachers.</p>
