                <p><label type="entry">ACID</label>, a general term in chemistry, applied to a group
                    of compound substances, possessing certain very distinctive characteristics. All
                    acids have one essential property, viz., that of combining chemically with an
                    alkali or base, forming a new compound that has neither acid nor alkaline
                    characters. The new bodies formed in this way are termed <hi rend="italic"
                        >salts.</hi> Every acid is therefore capable of producing as many salts as
                    there are basic substances to be neutralised; and this salt-forming power is the
                    best definition of an acid substance.</p>
                <p>The majority of acids possess the following <hi rend="italic">contingent</hi>
                    properties :—</p>
                <p>1. When applied to the tongue, they excite that sensation which is called <hi
                        rend="italic">sour</hi> or <hi rend="italic">acid.</hi></p>
                <p>2. They change the blue colours of vegetables to a red. The vegetable blues
                    employed for this purpose are generally tincture of litmus and syrup of violets
                    or of radishes, which have obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">re-agents</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">tests.</hi> If these colours have been previously converted
                    to a <hi rend="italic">green</hi> by alkalies, the acids restore them.</p>
                <p>All these secondary properties are variable; and if we attempted to base a
                    definition on any one of them, many important acids would be excluded. Take the
                    case of a body like silica, so widely diffused in nature. Is pure silicious sand
                    or flint an acid or a neutral substance? When it is examined, it is found to be
                    insoluble in water, to be devoid of taste, and to possess no action on vegetable
                    colouring matters; yet this substance is a true acid, because when it is heated
                    along with soda or lime, it forms the new body commonly called glass, which is
                    chemically a salt of silicic acid. Many other acids resemble silica in
                    properties, and would be mistaken for neutral bodies if the salt-forming power
                    was overlooked.</p>
                <p>Another method of regarding an acid, which is found of great importance in
                    discussing chemical reactions, is to say an acid is a <hi rend="italic"
                        >salt</hi> whose base is <hi rend="italic">water.</hi> This definition is
                    very apparent if we regard what takes place in separating the acid from a salt.
                    In this decomposition the acid would appear to be left without having any
                    substitute for the removed alkali. This is not however the case, as <hi
                        rend="italic">water</hi> is found to enter into union instead of the base.
                    Thus every true acid must contain <hi rend="italic">hydrogen;</hi> and if this
                    is displaced <pb break="no"

                    acid is therefore a salt, whose metal is <hi rend="italic">hydrogen.</hi> The

                        Valens,</hi> a very distinguished scholar and critic, born in 1567 at
                    Wittstock, in Brandenburg. After studying at Rostock and Helmstaedt, and
                    residing about three years in Italy, he took up his residence at Breslau, where
                    he professed the Roman Catholic religion. His excessive application to study was
                    supposed to have caused his untimely death, which occurred in 1595, when he had
                    just completed his twenty-eighth year. He wrote notes on Tacitus and Curtius, a
                    commentary on Plautus, and a number of poems, which are inserted in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Deliciae</hi> of the German poets. Baillet gave him a place
                    among his <hi rend="italic">Enfans</hi><hi rend="italic">Célèbres,</hi> and
                    tells that he wrote the commentary on Plautus and several of the Latin poems
                    when he was only seventeen or eighteen years of age.</p>
