                <p><label type="entry">ALPACA</label> is a name applied generally to several allied
                    South American wool-bearing animals, but more properly restricted to one of the
                    species. It is further used to distinguish the wool obtained from these animals,
                    and the woven textures manufactured from the wool are also known as alpacas. The
                    alpacas or llamas are natives of the lofty table-lands and mountain-range of the
                    Andes in Peru and Chili, and in that region of the globe they long occupied the
                    position held in the Old World by their congeners of larger size, the camels. To
                    the ancient Peruvians the llamas were the only available beasts of burden and
                    wool-bearing creatures, just as to the present day the camel is to the tribes of
                    the Asiatic deserts. The camel (<hi rend="italic">Camelus)</hi> and the llama
                    (<hi rend="italic">Auchenia)</hi> form the two existing genera of the family
                    Camelidae; and thus in a zoological sense also the one <pb break="no"

                    earth. A great deal of doubt and confusion has existed as to the number of
                    species into which the llamas can be divided—a very common occurrence in dealing
                    with domesticated or semi-domesticated creatures. Most authorities now, however,
                    agree in regarding them as separable into four species, following the
                    classification of Von Tschudi, who has given much careful consideration to the
                    subject. The species, according to that naturalist, are the llama <hi
                    rend="italic">(Auchenia lama),</hi> the huanaco or guanaco (A. <hi rend="italic"
                    >huanaco),</hi> the alpaca or paco (<hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >paco),</hi> and the vicugna (<hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >υicunna.)</hi> The two first-named species are, or rather were, more valued as
                    beasts of burden, and for their flesh, than as sources of wool, being able to
                    bear from 120 to 150 lb burden over long distances daily. The guanaco attains a
                    size not much less than our red deer; and is the largest and most widely spread
                    of all the species, being found from the equator southward to Patagonia. The
                    llama is next in size, but its habitat is limited to the loftier mountains of
                    North Peru. Although both species yield a serviceable quality of wool, which is
                    used by the Peruvians and found in commerce, it is chiefly to the alpaca we owe
                    the supply of wool imported into this country under that name. The alpaca is
                    considerably smaller than either the llama or the guanaco, but in general
                    outline all the species resemble each other. In its native condition the alpaca
                    ranges between 10° and 20° S. lat., from the centre of Peru into Bolivia, not
                    coming lower down in vertical distribution than between 8000 and 9000 feet above
                    the sea-level. At and above these heights it lives in herds in a
                    semidomesticated condition, being only driven into the villages to be shorn. The
                    wool, which varies in length from 2 to 6 inches, is of a very lustrous and fine
                    quality, and is mostly white, black, or gray, shades of brown or fawn being
                    rarer. The vicugna is a much rarer animal than the alpaca, being found sparsely
                    scattered from Ecuador, throughout Peru, into Bolivia, but seldom descending
                    under 13,000 feet above the sea-level. It is about the same size as the alpaca,
                    and yields an exceedingly delicate wool, varying in colour from a reddish yellow
                    to a dull white. It is usually worth about twice as much as alpaca, and is
                    greatly valued for fine felts.</p>
                <p>There is evidence of these animals having been held domesticated and used for
                    their wool in their native regions from remote antiquity. Remains of clothing
                    made from alpaca wools have been found in the graves of the Incas; and when, in
                    the early part of the 16th century, Europeans first visited Peru, these animals
                    formed the chief wealth of the natives, being the carriers of their commerce as
                    well as the main source of their food and clothing. Small quantities of the wool
                    were occasionally met with in English commerce; but it was not till 1836 that it
                    became established as a regular trading commodity with Europe. In that year Mr
                    (now Sir) Titus Salt, a wool-broker and manufacturer in Bradford, purchased a
                    quantity he met with in a Liverpool warehouse at 8d. per lb, and set himself to
                    discover its capabilities. The amount and manner of his success will be
                    described in the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Wool</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Worsted Manufactures;</hi> it need only be remarked here that
                    his experiments have resulted in making alpaca a staple second in importance to
                    wool, and so creating an industry of great and rapidly increasing dimensions.
                    The success of his experiments led to the erection of his great manufacturing
                    establishment of Saltaire, in which upwards of 3000 hands are employed in the
                    alpaca manufacture. The quantity of alpaca imported into England from 1836—the
                    year of Sir Titus Salt’s first experimental purchase—to 1840, averaged 560,800
                    lb yearly, which sold at about 10d. per lb. In 1852 the imports had risen to
                    2,186,480 lb. and the price advanced to 2s. 6d. per lb. In 1864 the imports
                    amounted to 2,664,027 lb, and in 1872 they were 3,878,739 lb; the value of
                    average qualities being from 2s. 6d. to 2s. 10d. per lb. The introduction of the
                    various species of llama into Europe has been frequently urged, Geoffrey St
                    Hilaire and other French naturalists having specially pointed out the
                    desirability of their introduction into France, and at one time a herd existed
                    in the Pyrenees; but in Europe the creatures must be still regarded as
                    curiosities of zoological collections. In 1859 systematic and costly attempts
                    were made to acclimatise the alpaca in our Australian colonies by Mr Ledger, a
                    gentleman who had devoted many years to observation of the conditions of life of
                    the animal. At first the experiment presented most encouraging prospects; the
                    herds continued healthy and increased in numbers; but gradually the subtle
                    influences of the loss of their native mountain climate became apparent,—the
                    creatures drooped, their numbers dwindled, and for the present the undertaking
                    must be regarded as a complete failure.</p>
