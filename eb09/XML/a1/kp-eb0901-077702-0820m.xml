                    by the Gujrân-wâlâ and Lahor districts; on the N.W. by the river Chenâb; and on
                    the S.E. by the river Biâs. The total population of the division is returned at
                    2,743,880 souls, divided into the following classes:—Hindus, 659,905;
                    Mahometans, 1,401,290; Sikhs, 352,885; others, 329,800. The number of males was
                    returned at 1,512,480, and the females at 1,231,400, the proportion of males to
                    the entire population of the division being 55 per cent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amritsar District</hi> lies between 30° 40' and 32° 10' N.
                    lat., and between 74° 40' and 75° 40' E. long. It is bounded on the N.W. by the
                    river Râvi, on the S.E. by the river Biâs, on the N.E. by the district of
                    Gurdâs-pur, and on the S.W. by the district of Lahor. Amritsar district is a
                    nearly level plain, with a very slight slope from east to west. The banks of the
                    Biâs are high, and on this side of the district well-water is not found except
                    at 50 feet below the surface; while towards the Râvi wells are less than 20 feet
                    in depth. The only stream passing through the district is the Kirni or Saki,
                    which takes its rise in a marsh in the Gurdâspur district, and after traversing
                    part of the district empties itself into the Râvi. Numerous canals intersect the
                    district, affording ample means of irrigation. The Sind, Panjâb, and Dehli
                    Railway, and Grand Trunk Road, which runs parallel with it, afford the principal
                    means of land communication and traδic. Total population of Amritsar district,
                    832,750, divided into the following classes:—Hindus, 138,027; Mahometans,
                    377,135; Sikhs, 223,219; others, 94,369. The males number 465,074, and the
                    females 367,676; the proportion of males to the total population being 55 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 84 per cent. The principal tribes and castes in point
                    of numbers are as follow:—(1.) Jâts, viz., Hindus and Sikhs, 189,065;
                    Mahometans, 65,964: total, 255,029. (2.) Brâh-mans, 43,846. (3.) Kshattriyas,
                    39,892. (4.) Kâshmiris, 37,456. (5.) Arorâs, 29,103. The total agricultural
                    population is returned at 417,747. Area of the district, 2036 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 23 square miles, or 1,303,188 acres, of which 927,730
                    acres are under cultivation, 178,939 acres are cultivable, but not actually
                    under tillage, and 196,519 acres are uncultivable and waste. This result gives 1

                    population.</p>
                <p>The principal agricultural products of Amritsar are wheat, barley, and grain for
                    the spring crop; and rice, joâr (spiked millet), Indian corn, moth <hi
                    rend="italic">{Phaseolus</hi><hi rend="italic">aconitifolius),</hi> and mash <hi

                    crop. The current settlement of the district expires in 1875-76. Five towns are
                    returned as containing a population of upwards of 5000 souls—namely, Amritsar,
                    population 135,813; Jandrâlâ, 6975; Majithâ, 6600; Ram Bas, 5855; Bundalâ, 5287.
                    Of the foregoing towns Amritsar has been constituted a first-class, and
                    Jandrala, Majithâ, and Ram Das third-class municipalities. Besides the
                    regularly-constituted municipalities, however, a municipal income is also
                    realised at the following ten places :—Tarn Taran, Fathiâbâd, Govindwal,
                    Naushahrâ Pannian, Verowal, Jalalâbâd, Attari, Chamiârf, Vanniki, and Bhallar.
                    Municipal revenue is in all cases levied by means of octroi dutiee, supplemented
                    in some instances by house rates and other direct taxation. The total revenue of
                    Amritsar district in 1871-72 amounted to £113,785, of which £85,727, 18s., or 75
                    percent., was derived from the land. The other principal items of revenue were
                    as follows :—Distilleries, £3677, 14s.; drugs and opium, £3548, 6s.; income tax,
                    £1724, 8s; stamps, £13,621, 18s.; local rates levied under the provisions of Act
                    20 of 1871, £5208, 10s. The staple manufacture of Amritsar is woollen shawls, in
                    imitation of those of Kashmir. The value of this manufacture in 1871-72 was
                    estimated at £91,742.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amritsar City,</hi> the divisional headquarters and capital
                    of the district of the same name, is situated in 31° 40' N. lat. and 74° 45' E;
                    long. It lies at an equal distance between the Biâs and Râvi rivers, is about 8
                    miles in circumference, and forms at once the great trading centre of the
                    Panjâb, and a celebrated seat of the Sikh religion and learning. The following
                    description of the town is extracted from <hi rend="italic">Thornton’s
                    Gazetteer</hi> (ed. 1862):—</p>
                <p>“Amritsar owes its importance to a talâo or reservoir which Râm Dâs, the fourth
                    guru or spiritual guide of the Sikhs, caused to be made here in 1581, and which
                    he termed Amrita Saras, or the Fount of Immortality. It thenceforward became a
                    place of pilgrimage. Nearly two centuries afterwards, Ahmad Shah, the founder of
                    the Durânf empire, alarmed and enraged at the progress of the Sikhs, blew up the
                    shrine with gunpowder, filled up the holy tank, and caused kine to be
                    slaughtered upon the site, thus desecrating the spot. On his return to Kabul,
                    the Sikhs repaired the shrine and reservoir, and commenced the overthrow of
                    Mahometan sway in Hindustan. The sacred tank is a square of 150 paces,
                    containing a great body of water, pure as crystal, notwithstanding the
                    multitudes that bathe in it, and supplied apparently by natural springs. In the
                    middle, on a small island, is a temple of Hari or Vishnu; and on the bank a
                    diminutive structure, where the founder, Râm Dâs, is said to have spent his life
                    in a sitting posture. The temple on the island is richly adorned with gold ana
                    other costly embellishments, and in it sits the sovereign guru of the Sikhs to
                    receive the presents and homage of his followers. There are five or six hundred
                    akâlis or priests attached to the temple, who have erected for themselves good
                    houses from the contributions of the visitors. Amritsar is a very populous and
                    extensive place. The streets are narrow’, but the houses in general are
                    tolerably lofty, and built of burnt brick. On the whole, Amritsar may claim some
                    little architectural <pb break="no"

                    considerable manufactures of shawls and silks in imitation of the Kashmir
                    fabric, Amritsar carries on a veιy extensive transit trade, as well as
                    considerable monetary transactions, with Hindustan and Central Asia. Provision
                    is made for an ample supply of water to the town from the Bari Doâb canal. A
                    striking object at Amritsar is the huge fortress of Govindgarh, built by Ranjit
                    Sinh in 1809, ostensibly to protect the pilgrims visiting the place, but in
                    reality to overawe their vast and dangerous assemblage.”</p>
                <p>Amritsar was the first mission station of the Church of England in the Panjab.
                    The census of 1868 gives a population within municipal limits of 43,931. The
                    total population, however, of the city and suburbs is returned at 135,813, of
                    whom 3477 are agriculturists, the rest being engaged in trade or other
                    non-agricultural pursuits. The town has been constituted a first-class
                    municipality, the affairs of which are conducted by a committee of twenty-eight
                    members. The municipal income is derived from octroi duties, local taxes, house
                    tax, &lt;kc., and amounted in 1871-72 to £19,800, or 9s. per head of the
                    population within municipal limits. Since the opening of the Panjàb railway
                    Amritsar has rapidly become the great centre of trade in that province. Its
                    position on the line and the enterprise of its merchants promise also to give it
                    the command of the trade <hi rend="italic">vid</hi> Leh to Central Asia, which
                    is now (1874) being opened up. It is the chief <hi rend="italic">entrepôt</hi>
                    in the Panjàb for Manchester goods, in return for which it exports to other
                    parts of India food-grains, the local manufactures in imitation of the Kashmir
                    fabrics, and the costly shawls and stuffs which form the staple of the Kashmir
                    trade.</p>
