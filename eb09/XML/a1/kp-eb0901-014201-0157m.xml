                    son of the preceding, was born at Braintree on the 11th July 1767. The greater
                    part of his education was received in Europe, which he visited in company with
                    his father in 1778, and again in 1780, when he attended for a time the
                    university of Leyden. When only fifteen years old he went, as secretary, with
                    Francis Dana on his unsuccessful mission to St Petersburg. Returning home after
                    an interval spent in Holland, London, and Paris, he graduated at Harvard in
                    1788; and, after spending three years in a lawyer’s office, was admitted to the
                    bar in 1791. Three successive series of letters, on political subjects,
                    contributed to a Boston newspaper, attracted much attention, and Washington
                    appointed him ambassador to the Hague in 1794. An appointment to a similar post
                    in Portugal, made just before the expiry of Washington’s presidency, was set
                    aside by his father, who sent him instead to Prussia, giving him the promotion
                    by the express advice of Washington. During his residence as ambassador at
                    Berlin, he succeeded in negotiating a commercial treaty with Prussia. On
                    Jefferson becoming President (1801), Adams was recalled, and resumed the
                    practice of law in Boston. In 1802 Suffolk county returned him a member of the
                    Massachusetts Senate, and in the following year he was elected to Congress.
                    Indebted for his position to the Federal party, Adams supported their views for
                    four years, but separated from them by voting for Jefferson’s proposed <hi
                    rend="italic">embargo.</hi> This course involved him in much controversy, and
                    cost him his seat in the Senate. During his retirement he added to the
                    employment arising from his profession the duties of the professorship of
                    rhetoric and belles lettres at Harvard University, which he held for three years
                    (1806-9). His lectures—the first ever read in an American university—were
                    published in 1810, and were much thought of at the time, though now almost
                    forgotten. In the winter following the resignation of his professorship, he
                    visited Washington; and, in an interview with Jefferson, brought a charge
                    against some of the Federal leaders of a design to dissolve the union, and form
                    a separate confederation for the north. The charge was afterwards repeated in
                    the newspapers; and, though resting on slender grounds, greatly affected the
                    confidence of the other states in the New England representatives. In 1809
                    Madison, having obtained after some delay the concurrence of the Senate,
                    entrusted Adams with the embassy to St Petersburg,—an appointment which the
                    latter accepted against the wishes of his father, and continued to hold, though
                    offered a seat on the judicial bench of New England some time after his arrival
                    in Russia. When war broke out between England and the United States, Adams
                    induced the Czar to make an offer of intervention, which, however, the English
                    Government declined to accept. Independent negotiations were thereupon carried
                    on for six months at Ghent (the representatives of America being Adams, Russell,
                    and Clay), and resulted in the treaty of peace which was signed 24th December
                    1814. After serving for two years (1815-17) as minister in London, he again
                    entered the arena of home politics as secretary of state under Monroe. In this
                    office he distinguished himself specially by his arrangement of the treaty with
                    Spain, which defined the boundaries of the ceded territories of Florida and
                    Louisiana. An elaborate report on weights and measures gained for him also a
                    name for scientific acquirements. In 1825 the election of a President fell,
                    according to the constitution of the States, to the House of Representatives,
                    since no one of the candidates had secured an absolute majority of the electors
                    chosen by the States, and Adams, who had stood second to Jackson in the
                    electoral vote, was chosen in preference to Jackson, Clay, and Crawford. The
                    administration of Adams was marked by the imposition of a high tariff on foreign
                    goods, with the view of promoting internal industry, and by the unsuccessful
                    attempt to purchase Cuba from Spain. Notwithstanding the efforts of Clay, and
                    the special claim he himself made on the voters of Virginia on account of his
                    discovery of the so-called New England “plot" twenty years before, Adams failed
                    to secure his re-election in 1829. Defeated by Jackson, who had 178 votes to his
                    83, he retired o Quincy, where his father’s fortune, increased by his own
                    efforts, afforded <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0158-0143"/> him an ample competency. Two years later he was
                    returned to Congress by the district in which he lived, and which he continued
                    to represent until his death. Having been chosen merely on account of his
                    determined resistance to secret societies, his position was independent of party
                    politics, and correspondingly strong. He stood for the office of governor, and
                    then for that of senator, of Massachusetts, but was on both occasions defeated
                    by Davis. As chairman of the committee on manufactures, he strove to devise a
                    middle policy in regard to tariffs, but his greatest effort at this
                    period—perhaps the greatest service of his whole political life—was in
                    connection with the abolition of slavery. In every form which the question took,
                    he was the bold and determined advocate of abolition, gradually gathering an
                    influential party around him, and so preparing for the triumphs, most of which
                    have been won since his death. He himself witnessed, in 1845, the abolition of
                    the “gag-rule,” restricting the right of petition to Congress on the subject of
                    slavery, which he had persistently opposed during the nine years it was in
                    force. He died of paralysis on 23d February 1848, having been seized two days
                    previously while attending the debates of Congress. Adams wrote a number of
                    works, which are now of little importance. The style is fluent, but has none of
                    the vigour and elegance of his father’s. During his whole lifetime he kept a
                    very voluminous journal, some portions of which have been published.</p>
