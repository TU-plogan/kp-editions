                    commissionership of West Berar, within the Haidarábád assigned districts. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Akolá district</hi> lies between 20° 23' and 21° 10' N. lat.,
                    and between 76° 25' and 77° 19' E. long.; its greatest length from N. to S.
                    being 72 miles, and its greatest breadth from E. to W. 63 miles. It is bounded
                    on the N. by the Sátpurá range; on the E. by Elichpur district; on the S. by the
                    Sátmál and Ajantá hills; and on the W. by the Buldáná and Khandesh districts.
                    The total area of the district in 1869 was 2697¾ square miles.</p>

                <p>or 1,726,625 acres, of which 1,326,583 acres, or 2072∙78 square miles were under
                    cultivation; 127,003 acres, or 198∙45 square miles, cultivable but not actually
                    under tillage; 41,198 acres, or 64∙37 square miles, alienated land held rent
                    free; the remaining 231,842 acres, or 362∙25 square miles, consisting chiefly of
                    unarable land, but including river-beds, tanks, village sites, pasturage land,
                    or land occupied for public uses, &amp;c. The population of the district in 1869
                    numbered 487,558—viz., Hindus, 433,238; Mahometans, 39,030; aborigines, 15,157;
                    Christians, 78; Pársís, 45; Jews, 10. The district is square in shape and almost
                    of a dead level, with the exception of two conical-shaped hills which stand out
                    quite apart from any other eminences, and rise straight up from the plain. The
                    principal river of Akolá, which, although not navigable, represents the main
                    line of drainage, and into which the other streams discharge themselves, is the
                    Púrná, flowing east and west. The principal tributaries on its south bank are
                    the Kátá Púrná, Murná, Núm, and Bordi; and on its north bank, the Sháhnúr,
                    Idrúpá, and Wün. None of these streams are navigable, and some of them almost
                    dry up after the rainy season.</p>
                <p>The extension line of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway from Bhosáwal to Nagpur
                    intersects the district, with stations at Jalam Shegáon, Paras, Akolá, and
                    Borgáon. Of eight main roads, three have been metalled. The first runs from
                    Akolá to Akot, a rising cotton mart, and is 28 miles in length, running
                    north-north-east. It is metalled, and all the smaller water-courses are bridged.
                    The Púrná and Sháhnúr rivers, however, cross the line, and are not bridged, a
                    circumstance which impairs the usefulness of the road during the rainy season.
                    The second road is known as the Básim road, and runs for 24 miles southwards
                    through the district. The third road is 12 miles long, from Khámgáon to Nándurá
                    railway station, and is metalled throughout. The other five lines of road are
                    neither bridged nor metalled, but only marked out and levelled. The district
                    imports piece goods from Bombay, and food grains from the adjoining districts.
                    Its principal exports are cotton to Bombay, clarified butter, dyes (indigo and
                    kusambá), and cattle. Internal trade is chiefly carried on at weekly markets and
                    by annual fairs. The principal manufacture of the district is the weaving of
                    cotton. Carpets and coarse cloths are woven in almost every village, with
                    turbans at Bálápur, and silk cloths for native women at Akolá and in the larger
                    towns. The principal agricultural products are as follows :—The wet weather or
                    kharíf crop consists of joár (eighteen varieties); bajrá (two kinds); cotton
                    (two kinds); túr, urid, and mug (three kinds of pulse); rice and kulkar (a
                    smaller variety of rice); Indian corn; ralá; ganjá; ajwán; indigo; and til
                    (oil-seeds of two kinds). The cold weather or rabí crop consists of—wheat (three
                    kinds); gram; linseed; lakh (a pulse); peas; musuri; tobacco; and mustard. The
                    principal articles of garden produce are the following :—Sugar-cane (two kinds);
                    Indian corn (two kinds); ground nuts; onions; garlic; coriander; pán leaves;
                    chillies; opium; sweet potatoes; grapes; plantains; saffron; and numerous kinds
                    of vegetables. A tenure peculiar to Akolá is that known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >metkarí</hi> holdings. These consist of certain strips of land extending along
                    the whole breadth of the district at the foot of the frontier range. They are
                    now of considerable value, and were originally held as payment for the
                    maintenance of a chain of outposts or watch-towers on elevated points in the
                    ridge, with a view to giving warning of the approach of the Bhil or Gond
                    banditti, and warding off their attacks. Seven towns are returned as containing
                    a population exceeding 5000 —viz., Akolá (the capital of the district),
                    population 12,236; Akot, one of the principal cotton marts of Berar, and also
                    celebrated for its cotton manufacture, 14,006; Khámgáon, now the largest cotton
                    mart in the province, but which has only sprung into importance within recent
                    times, 9432; Bálápur, one of the chief military stations in the Berars during
                    the Mahometan rule, 12,631; Jalgáon, an important cotton market, 8763; Patur,
                    6011; Shegáon, a station Great Indian Peninsular Railway, and a cotton market,
                    7450. In 1869 there were 1 higher class, 10 middle class, and 63 lower schools
                    for boys in Akolá district; besides 7 female schools and 1 normal school for
                    training Hindustani and Marhatí masters, making a total of 82 schools in all.
                    For the protection of person and property there were in 1869 13 police stations
                    and 12 outposts, with a regular police force of 536 officers and. men, equal to
                    one man to every five miles of the district area, or one man to every 909 of the
                    population.</p>

                    >Town,</hi> the headquarters of the district of the same name, and also of the
                    west Berar division of the Haidarábád assigned territory, is situated on the
                    Nágpur extension of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, in 20° 6' N. lat., and
                    76° 2' E. long. The town contains three or four wealthy merchants; and two
                    markets are held each week—one on Sundays, the other on Wednesdays. The
                    commissioner’s and deputy-commissioner’s court-houses, the central jail (capable
                    of holding 500 prisoners), the postoffice, and barracks or rest-houses for
                    European troops, close to the station, are the principal public buildings.
                    Besides these, there are a civil hospital, a charitable dispensary, an English
                    high school, a town-hall, and an English church. A detachment of infantry is
                    stationed at the town. Population in 1869, 12,236.</p>
