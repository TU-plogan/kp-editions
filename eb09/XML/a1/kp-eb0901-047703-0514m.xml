                <p><label type="entry">ALENÇON</label>, the chief town of the French department of
                    Orne, situated in a wide and fertile plain, on the Sarthe, close to its
                    confluence with the Briante. It is a clean, regularly-built town, with broad
                    handsome streets. It is the seat of a bishop; and the Gothic church of Notre
                    Dame, called the cathedral, is a fine building of the 16th century. The only
                    remains of the ancient castle of Alençon are three towers that form part of the
                    present town-hall. The lace known as “point d’Alençon” is the most noted
                    manufacture of the town, although of late years its importance has somewhat
                    diminished. Among the other industries are tanning, spinning, bleaching, linen
                    manufacturing, and cider-making. The cutting of quartz crystals, often called
                    Alençon diamonds, is also carried on. Alençon was a place of small importance
                    when it was handed over to the Normans by Charles the Simple in the beginning of
                    the 10th century. In 1025 it became subject to the De Belesmes, counts of
                    Alençon, by whom it was enlarged and fortified. It was ceded to King Philip
                    Augustus in 1221 by Alice, the heiress of the last count. The duchy of Alençon
                    was created about the end of the 14th century, and remained with the original
                    family, a branch of the house of Valois, until the middle of the 16th. The town
                    was repeatedly taken and retaken in wars with Henry V. and Henry VL of England,
                    and also in the time of the League. In the war between France and Germany,
                    Alençon was taken by the Germans under the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg on the 17th
                    of January 1871. The townspeople did not offer much resistance. The mayor and
                    municipality were, indeed, in favour of yielding without a struggle; but the
                    newly-appointed prefect, an ultra-republican, insisted on a more martial policy.
                    A feeble skirmish took place outside the town on the evening of the 16th of
                    January, and the grand duke entered on the following morning without any further
                    opposition. The Germans, as a punishment for the previous resistance, imposed on
                    the citizens a fine of 300,000 francs, besides a large contribution of cattle,
                    corn, and other provisions. Population (1872), 16,037.</p>
