                    >{Diomedea),</hi> closely allied to the Petrels and Gulls, belonging to the

                    >Diomedea,</hi> assigned to them by Linnaeus, there is a reference to the
                    mythical metamorphosis of the companions of the Greek warrior Diomedes into
                    birds. They have the beak large, strong, and sharp-edged, the upper mandible
                    terminating in a large hook; the wings are narrow and very long; the feet have
                    no hind toe, and the three anterior toes are completely webbed. Of the three
                    species that the genus includes the best known is the Common or Wandering
                    Albatross <hi rend="italic">{D. exulans),</hi> which occurs in all parts of the
                    Southern Ocean, and in the seas that wash the coast of Asia to the south of
                    Behring Strait. It is the largest and strongest of all sea-birds. The length of
                    the body is stated at 4 feet, and the weight at from 15 to 25 lb. It sometimes
                    measures as much as 17 feet between the tips of the extended wings, averaging
                    probably from 10 to 12 feet. Its strength of wing is very great. It often
                    accompanies a ship for days—not merely following it, but wheeling in wide
                    circles round it—without ever being observed to alight on the water, and
                    continues its flight, apparently untired, in tempestuous as well as in moderate
                    weather. It has even been said to sleep on the wing, and Moore alludes to this
                    fanciful “cloud-rocked slumbering” in his <hi rend="italic">Fire
                    Worshippers.</hi> It feeds on small fish and on the animal refuse that floats on
                    the sea, eating to such excess at times that it is unable to fly, and rests
                    helplessly on the water. The colour of the bird is a dusky white, the back being
                    streaked transversely with black or brown bands, and the wings darker than the
                    rest of the body. The flesh, though hard, dry, and unsavoury, is eaten by the
                    inhabitants of Kamtchatka, who also capture the bird for its entrails, which
                    they inflate for net-floats, and its long wing-bones, which they manufacture
                    into various articles, particularly tobacco-pipes. The albatross lays one egg;
                    it is white, with a few spots, and is about 4 inches long. In breeding-time the
                    bird resorts to solitary island groups, like the Crozet Islands and the elevated
                    Tristan da Cunha, where it has its nest—a natural hollow or a circle of earth
                    roughly scraped together—on the open ground. The early explorers of the great
                    Southern Sea cheered themselves with the companionship of the albatross in its
                    dreary solitudes; and the evil hap of him who shot with his cross-bow the bird
                    of good omen is familiar to readers of Coleridge’s <hi rend="italic">Dime of the
                    Ancient Mariner.</hi></p>
