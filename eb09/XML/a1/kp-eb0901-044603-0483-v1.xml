                <p><label type="entry">ALBANIA</label>, a country of considerable extent, which
                    though frequently ruled by turbulent and nearly independent chiefs, ranks as one
                    of the provinces of the Turkish empire. The tract of land to which this name is
                    now applied extends from 39° to 43° N. lat., and from 18° 24' to 21° 48' E.
                    long.; from the Gulf of Cattaro in the north to the Gulf of Arta in the south,
                    and from the coast of the Adriatic Sea and Ionian Sea on the west to an
                    irregular ill-defined line inland towards the east, roughly indicated in its
                    northern part by the Tchar Dagh, the ancient <hi rend="italic">Scardus,</hi> a
                    part of the Haemus or Balkan range, and southwards by the Pindus chain, or
                    rather the portions of it now called the mountains of Sagori, Metzovo, and Suh.
                    Within these limits is included the ancient <hi rend="italic">Epirus,</hi>
                    corresponding to the southern part of the country now comprehended under the
                    general name of Albania, and divided from Albania, properly so called, by the
                    river Voyutza or Viosa, which enters the Adriatic a few miles north of Avlona.
                    Albania, therefore, is bounded on the N. by Dalmatia, Montenegro (from which it
                    is separated by the river Moroka), and Bosnia; on the E. by Servia and the
                    Turkish province of Rum-ih, in which Macedonia, or the greater part of it, is
                    included; and on the S. by Hellas or Northern Greece, which was the Turkish
                    province of Livadia before Greece regained its independence, and from which it
                    is separated by the river Garla or Suli. The superficial area of Albania is
                    estimated at about 18,944 square miles, and it has a coast-line of about 280
                    miles from north to south, without reckoning indentations, &amp;c. It nowhere
                    extends more than 100 miles from the sea, and in the southern part not more than
                    30 miles.</p>
                <p>According to the most recent division of the Turkish empire into eyalets,
                    sanjaks, and Evas, Albania is comprehended in three eyalets, namely, Uskub or
                    Uskup in the north; Roumelia, which also includes part of Macedonia, in the
                    centre; and Yania, corresponding pretty nearly to the ancient <hi rend="italic"
                        >Epirus,</hi> in the south. The chief towns of these eyalets are
                    respectively Scutari, Monastir, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n484/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0901-0484-0447"/> and Joannina, sometimes written Janina or
                    Yanina; and these divisions are therefore spoken of by some writers as the
                    pashaliks of Scutari, Monastir, and Joannina. The divisions chiefly recognised
                    by the Albanians themselves are those formed by the varieties of the native
                    tribes. Colonel Leake, who is considered one of the best informed authorities on
                    this head, divides them into the Ngege or Ghegides, whose principal towns are
                    Dulcigno, Scutari, and Durazzo; the Toske or Toskides, who occupy Berat and
                    Elbasan; the Liape, a poor and predatory race, who inhabit the mountains between
                    the Toske and Delvino; and the Tsami, who inhabit the most southerly district,
                    and whose principal towns are Suli and Paramithia. The country is mountainous,
                    the interior being traversed by a range which forms a prolongation of the
                    Dinaric Alps, and which is continued southwards in the Pindus range. These
                    mountains, from which numerous spurs are thrown out to the east and west, run in
                    a direction from north to south, parallel to the course of the Tchar Dagh. Along
                    the southern part of the coast-line, and parallel with it, run the Khimara
                    mountains, known to the ancients as the <hi rend="italic">Acro-ceraunian</hi>
                    range, terminating northwards in the bold headland of Cape Glossa. There are
                    three lakes of great size in Albania—Scutari in the north, Okhrida in the
                    centre, and Joannina in the south. The rivers for the most part are short, and
                    run, generally speaking, from east to west, or in a north-westerly direction.
                    The Moroka and Zenta enter the lake of Scutari, which is connected with the sea
                    by the Boyana, that flows into the Adriatic near Dulcigno. The White Drin,
                    flowing in a southerly direction, and the Black Drin, running northwards from
                    Lake Okhrida, form the head streams of the Drin. The principal streams in
                    addition to these are the Skombia, Voyutza, Calamas, Arta, and Gurla (the
                    ancient <hi rend="italic">Acheron),</hi> with its tributary the Vuvó (the
                    ancient <hi rend="italic">Cocytus).</hi> The climate is generally healthy,
                    though cold and bleak in the highlands; the warmer regions along the coast are
                    also frequently visited by cold northerly winds.</p>
                <p>Albania includes not only the ancient <hi rend="italic">Epirus,</hi> but also
                    part of the ancient <hi rend="italic">Macedonia, Illyria,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Chaonia.</hi> This country was in early times, as now,
                    distinguished by the rude valour of its inhabitants. Its remote situation, and
                    the want of union among its tribes, generally prevented it from acting any
                    conspicuous part in Grecian politics. The only remarkable exception occurs in
                    the reign of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus (296-272 B.c.), who was justly ranked among
                    the greatest captains of antiquity. After his death the country was again split
                    into a number of petty states, which were unable to resist the united strength
                    of Macedon; and to that kingdom Epirus continued subject till both were alike
                    subdued by the Roman arms (167 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi></p>
                <p>It was during the time of the Greek empire that the name of Albania was first
                    given to this district. During the decline of the empire the Albanians gradually
                    rose to distinction, and at last to independence. Their valour enabled them to
                    maintain their ground against the Bulgarians, who had occupied all the
                    neighbouring districts of Greece. Nor were they less successful against the
                    Turks, a more formidable enemy. Under the command of the celebrated George
                    Castriot, called by the Turks Scanderbeg, they baffled all the efforts of
                    Mahomet II., the conqueror of Constantinople. That powerful monarch entered
                    Albania only to experience a succession of defeats, and was at length compelled
                    to acknowledge its independence by a formal treaty. On the death of Scanderbeg,
                    the Turks redoubled their efforts against Albania, which was at length reduced
                    to a state of nominal subjection. The siege of Scutari, in 1478, formed the
                    termination of this memorable struggle. The subjection, however, was always the
                    imperfect; revolts were frequent, and the inhabitants of mountainous districts
                    still preserved their independence. It was the motives of pay and plunder,
                    rather than compulsion, that brought these hardy soldiers into the Turkish
                    ranks. In proportion as the Ottoman empire declined in vigour, its hold of
                    Albania became less firm; and the vigorous and enterprising genius of Ali Pasha
                    again converted this dependency into what might almost be called a separate
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>In the grand insurrection of Greece (1821-1829), the Albanians, accustomed to
                    view with disdain the Ottoman yoke, showed a considerable disposition to make
                    common cause with the Greeks, and their co-operation would have almost ensured
                    success. But the Greeks, imprudently and unhappily, could not divest themselves
                    of the feelings of enmity cherished during the long series of wars which Ali had
                    waged against them. At the siege of Tripolizza (October 5, 1821) overtures were
                    made to them by a corps of 3000 Albanians, who formed part of the garrison; but
                    the Greeks, having succeeded in entering the place, began a dreadful and
                    indiscriminate massacre, in which the Albanians were not spared. At the siege of
                    Arta, although the capture was much facilitated by the coming over of a corps of
                    Albanians, the Greeks treated them extremely ill. The Albanian nation was thus
                    forcibly thrown into the arms of the Porte, to which it has since continued
                    nominally subject. The allegiance of the Albanians, however, to Turkey rests on
                    a very precarious basis even at the present day, and, it will be remembered, in
                    the Crimean war many Albanian chiefs fought under the Russian flag against the
                    combined forces of England, France, and Turkey.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Albania are estimated at 1,200,000, of whom a considerable
                    proportion are Turks and Greeks; but the basis of the population consists of the
                    original race, called Arnauts. About half of the entire population are
                    Mahometans; of the other moiety, about 520,000 belong to the Greek Church, and
                    the remainder to the Latin Church. The conversion of those who profess
                    Mahometanism has been, however, very imperfect, and chiefly induced by political
                    motives. In every family the males usually go to the mosque, the females to
                    church; and some members of a family are seen in the most amicable manner eating
                    from the same table, and even from the same plate, meats forbidden to the
                    others. With the Turks, accordingly, infidel and Albanian are terms nearly
                    synonymous. The native Albanian is of middle stature; his face is oval, with
                    high cheek-bones; his neck long; his chest full and broad. His air is erect and
                    majestic to a degree which never fails to strike the traveller. He holds in
                    utter contempt that dissimulation which is characteristic of the Greek, and,
                    unlike the Turk, he is gay, lively, and active. Averse, however, to regular
                    industry, his whole delight is in arms and plunder. He goes constantly armed;
                    and there are few Albanians who have not, in the prime of their life, belonged
                    to some of the numerous bands of robbers who infest the mountains of their
                    native country, of Thessaly, and of Macedonia. This occupation carries with it
                    no disgrace: it is common for the Albanian to mention circumstances which
                    occurred “when he was a robber.” In proportion as the trade of robbing becomes
                    overstocked, part of those engaged in it seek employment in the service of the
                    sultan and the different pashas throughout the Turkish empire, by all of whom
                    the Alba nians are regarded as the most valuable of their troops.</p>
                <p>This fierce and haughty race display a greater degree of contempt for the female
                    sex than is usual even among the most barbarous nations. The females are
                    literally regarded as inferior animals, and treated accordingly; but in the
                    country districts they are not confined or veiled, as is customary in Mahometan
                    countries.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n485/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0485-0448"/>
                <p>The national costume of the Albanians is handsome in appearance, and bears some
                    resemblance to the Highland dress. It consists of a cotton shirt; a white
                    woollen <hi rend="italic">fustanella</hi> or kilt, which reaches to the knees; a
                    jacket; a sash round the waist, in which pistols and a yataghan are commonly
                    carried; coloured leggings; sandals; and a red cap, round which some twist a
                    shawl or scarf. The chiefs and wealthy Albanians generally wear a jacket and
                    vest of velvet, richly embroidered with gold, and metal greaves over their
                    leggings, which are usually made of fine scarlet cloth. The poorer classes,
                    though picturesque in appearance, are extremely dirty in their habits, and
                    seldom change their clothes. As a protection from the weather, every Albanian
                    has a <hi rend="italic">capote,</hi> or rough shaggy mantle with a hood
                    attached, and usually made of horse-hair stuff or coarse woollen cloth. The
                    dress of the females is more various, and often fantastical. A singular custom
                    prevails among the girls of stringing together the pieces of money which they
                    have collected for their portion, and wearing them upon their heads. Some of
                    them have their hair hanging down in braids to a great length, loaded with this
                    species of ornament.</p>
                <p>Scutari, on the lake of that name, is now considered the chief town of Albania.
                    It is the centre of a large inland trade, and contains about 40,000 inhabitants.
                    Prisrend, in the north-east, is noted for its manufactures of fire-arms and
                    cutlery, and has a population of 25,000. Monastir, or Bitolia, although the
                    capital of the eyalet of Roumelia, is not, strictly speaking, within the
                    confines of Albania. It has a large transit trade between eastern and western
                    Turkey. Joannina, with 36,000 inhabitants, situated on the south-west shore of a
                    lake of the same name, was the capital of Albania in the time of Ali Pasha, and
                    was his stronghold as well as the seat of his government. The other important
                    towns of the interior are Jacova, Tirana, Okhrida, Elbasan, Delvino, and
                    Metzovo. The principal seaports and river-ports are Dulcigno, Durazzo, Parga,
                    Prevesa, and Arta.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Albania is chiefly carried on through Arta and Prevesa, on the
                    north side of the entrance to the Gulf of Arta. The principal merchants,
                    however, are Greeks residing at Joannina, among whom a very active commercial
                    spirit appears to prevail. The exports consist almost entirely of unmanufactured
                    produce, live stock, and provisions, and comprise valonia (the cup of the acorn
                    of the Valonia oak, used in tanning), raw silk, cheese, raw hides, drugs,
                    dye-woods, sheep, horses, and salted meats. Notwithstanding its mountainous
                    character, the fertility of its plains affords a surplus of grain, of which a
                    considerable quantity is sent to Italy, the Ionian Isles, Malta, and other
                    places. The vine, olive, pomegranate, orange, lemon, mulberry, and fig are also
                    cultivated. Wool is exported, chiefly unmanufactured, but partly also wrought
                    into coarse cloth. Other important articles of export are oil, tobacco of good
                    quality, cotton, and cotton yarn. Some cargoes of wood for building and firewood
                    are annually sent to Malta. The chief imports consist of woollen cloths, used
                    for winter coverings. For this purpose the preference is given to a coarser and
                    cheaper kind than any that is usually manufactured in Great Britain. This is
                    supplied from Germany. Fire-arms, cutlery, gunpowder, hardware, coffee, and
                    sugar are also imported. The manufactures of Albania are few and unimportant,
                    being almost entirely confined to <hi rend="italic">capotes,</hi> embroidery on
                    cloth and velvet, fire-arms and cutlery to a limited extent, and gun aud pistol
                    stocks—all for home consumption.</p>
