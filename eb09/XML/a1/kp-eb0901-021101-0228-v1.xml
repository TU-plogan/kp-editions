                <p><label type="entry">AESOP</label>, the fabulist, is supposed to have been born
                    about the year 620 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but the place of his birth is
                    uncertain, that honour being claimed alike by Samos, Sardis, Mesembria in
                    Thrace, and Cotiaeum in Phrygia. He was brought, while young, to Athens as a
                    slave, and having served several masters, was eventually enfranchised by Iadmon
                    the Samian. He thereupon visited Croesus, king of Lydia, at whose court he is
                    represented by Plutarch as reproving Solon for his discourteous manner towards
                    the king. During the usurpation of Pisistratus he is said to have visited
                    Athens, and composed the fable of <hi rend="italic">Jupiter and the Frogs</hi>
                    for the instruction of the citizens (Phaedrus, i 2). As the ambassador of
                    Croesus at Delphi he was charged with the payment of the large sum of four minae
                    to each of the citizens; but in consequence of some dispute, he declined to
                    distribute the money. The Delphians, incensed at his conduct, accused him of
                    sacrilege, and threw him headlong from a precipice, about 564 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> A pestilence which ensued being attributed to
                    this crime, the people declared their willingness to make compensation for his
                    death; which, in default of a nearer connection, was claimed and received by
                    Iadmon, the grandson of his old master (Plut. <hi rend="italic">de sera Num.
                        Vind.,</hi> p. 556, Herodot. ii. 134). None of Aesop’s works are extant. The
                    popular stories regarding him are derived from a life prefixed to a book of
                    fables purporting to be his, collected by Maximus Planudes, a monk of the 14th
                    century, in which he is represented as a monster of ugliness and deformity, a
                    notion utterly without foundation, and doubtless intended to heighten his wit by
                    the contrast. That this life, however, was in existence a century before
                    Planudes’s time, appears by a manuscript of it found at Florence, and published
                    in 1809. In Plutarch’s <hi rend="italic">Convivium,</hi> where Aesop is a guest,
                    though there are many jests on his original servile condition, there are none on
                    his appearance; and it would seem that the ancients were not usually restrained
                    by delicacy in this point, since the personal defects of Socrates, and his
                    resemblance to old Silenus, afford ample matter for merriment and raillery in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi> of Plato. We are told, besides, that the
                    Athenians erected in honour of Aesop a noble statue by the famous sculptor
                    Lysippus, a circumstance which alone would be sufficient to confute the absurd
                    fiction of his deformity; but more to the point is the statement of Pliny
                    (xxxvi. 12), that he was the <hi rend="italic">Contubernalis</hi> of Rhodopis,
                    his fellow-slave, whose extraordinary beauty passed into a proverb:</p>
                <p>῞A <hi rend="italic">π</hi><hi rend="italic">αv</hi><hi rend="italic">θ</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">'</hi><hi rend="italic">ὅ</hi><hi rend="italic">μοια,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">καὶ '</hi> P <hi rend="italic">οδωπιs η κaλή</hi></p>
                <p>The obscurity in which the history of Aesop is involved has induced some to deny
                    his existence altogether; and Giambattista Vico, in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Scienza Nuova,</hi> chooses rather to consider him as an abstraction, an
                    excess of scepticism which is quite unreasonable. Whether Aesop left any written
                    fables has been more justly disputed, and Bentley inclines to the negative. Thus
                    Aristophanes (<hi rend="italic">Vespoe,</hi> V. 1259) represents Philocleon as
                    learning his fables in conversation, and not from a book; and Socrates essayed
                    to versify such as he remembered (Plat. <hi rend="italic">Phoed.</hi> p. 61).
                    Others, again, are of opinion that a collection had been made of them before the
                    time of Socrates <hi rend="italic">lfMus. Crit.</hi> i. 408). It is, however,
                    certain that fables bearing Aesop’s name were popular at Athens during the most
                    brilliant period of its literary history; though the discrepancies of authors in
                    quoting the same fables seem in favour of Bentley’s hypothesis. (Compare
                    Aristot. <hi rend="italic">De Part. Anim.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n229/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0229-0212"/>
                <p>iii. 2; and Lucian, <hi rend="italic">Nigr.</hi> 32). The original fables were in
                    prose, and were turned into verse by several writers; the first, after the
                    example of Socrates, being Demetrius Phalereus. Next appeared an edition in
                    elegiac verse, often cited by Suidas, but the author’s name is unknown; then
                    Babrius, an excellent Greek poet, turned them into choliambics (i.e. <hi
                        rend="italic">limping</hi> iambics); but of ten books, a few fables only are
                    preserved entire. Of the Latin writers of Aesopean fables, Phaedrus is the most
                    celebrated.</p>
                <lg>
                    <l> “Aesopus auctor quam materiam reperit, </l>
                    <l> Hanc ego polivi versibus senariis." </l>
                </lg>
                <bibl><title><hi rend="smallcaps">Phaed.</hi></title></bibl>
                <p>The fables now extant in prose under Aesop’s name are entirely spurious, as is
                    proved by Bentley in his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the Fables of</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Aesop,</hi> and have been assigned an oriental origin. The
                    identification of Aesop with the Arabian philosopher and fabulist Lokman (who is
                    made by some traditions the contemporary of the psalmist David) has frequently
                    been attempted; and the Persian accounts of Lokman, which among other things
                    describe him as an ugly black slave, appear to have been blended by the author
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> published by Planudes, with the classical
                    stories respecting Aesop. The similarity of the fables ascribed to each renders
                    it probable that they were derived from the same Indo-Persian source, or from
                    the Chinese, who appear to have possessed such fables in very remote antiquity.
                    A complete collection of the Aesopean fables, 231 in number, was published at
                    Breslau by J. G. Schneider in 1810.</p>
