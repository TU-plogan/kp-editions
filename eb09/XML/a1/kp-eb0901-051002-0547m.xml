                    Moslem theologian who met the heretical philosophers on their own ground. He was
                    born in 1058, and belonged to the sect of the Ascharites, or extreme right of
                    the Motecallemin, who (and not the philosophers) were the real Arabian
                    schoolmen. At thirty-three he became the head of a theological college at
                    Baghdad, where his professor’s chair was surrounded by eager crowds, including
                    all the imams of the country. It was a time of keen speculation, when
                    philosophic scepticism was encouraged in high places; and the premature
                    convictions of Al-Gazali gave way under a violent reaction against the orthodox
                    creed. Driven by mental inquietude, he escaped from Baghdad on the plea of
                    making a pilgrimage to Mecca, but went to Syria, and (after visiting, though a
                    Mahometan, the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem) settled at Damascus, where he spent
                    ten years in seclusion and meditation. Recalled by his private affairs as he was
                    on his way to Egypt, he returned to Baghdad, reluctantly resumed teaching (which
                    he continued for fifteen years), then retired to Tous, his native town, and
                    devoted his remaining years to the contemplative life of the Sufis, who had been
                    his earliest instractors. He died in 1111. His outer life, so restless and
                    unquiet, was the reflex of a mental history disturbed by prolonged agitation.
                    Revolting, in the height of his success, against the current creed, he began to
                    examine the foundations of knowledge. Where could certainty be found? In the
                    perceptions of the senses? But these are contradicted by one another, and
                    disproved by reason. In the notions of reason? Reason, indeed, professes to
                    furnish us with necessary truths; but what assurance have we that the verdicts
                    of reason may not be reversed by some higher authority? Al-Gazali then
                    interrogated all the sects in succession to learn their criterion of truth. He
                    first applied to the theological schoolmen, who grounded their religion on
                    reason; but their aim was only to preserve the faith from heresy. He turned to
                    the philosophers, and examined the accepted Aristotelianism in a treatise which
                    has come down to us— <hi rend="italic">The Destruction of the Philosophers.</hi>
                    He assails them on twenty points of their mixed physical and metaphysical
                    peripateticism, from the statement of which, in spite of his pretended
                    scepticism, we can deduce some very positive metaphysical opinions of his own.
                    He claims to have shown that the dogmas of the eternity of matter and the
                    permanence of the world are false; that their description of the Deity as the
                    demiurgos is unspiritual; that they fail to prove the existence, the unity, the
                    simplicity, the incorporeality, or the knowledge (both of species and accidents)
                    of God; that their ascription of souls to the celestial spheres is unproved;
                    that their theory of causation, which attributes effects to the very natures of
                    the causes, is false, for that all actions and events are to be ascribed to the
                    Deity; and, finally, that they cannot establish the spirituality of the soul,
                    nor prove its mortality. These criticisms disclose nothing like a sceptical
                    state of mind, but rather a reversion from the metaphysical to the theological
                    stage of thought. He denies the intrinsic tendencies, or souls, by which the
                    Aristotelians explained the motion of the spheres, because he ascribes their
                    motion to God. The sceptic would have denied both. Mr Lewes rightly censures Μ.
                    Renan for asserting of Al-Gazali’s theory of causation—“<hi rend="italic"
                    >Hume</hi><hi rend="italic">n'a</hi><hi rend="italic">rien dit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">plus.”</hi> It is true that Al-Gazali maintains that the natural
                    law according to which effects proceed inevitably from their causes is only
                    custom, and that there is no <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> connection between
                    them. So far the Eastern and the European sceptic are on the same ground. But
                    while Hume absolutely denies the necessity, Al-Gazali merely removes it one
                    stage further back, and plants it in the mind of the Deity. This, of course, is
                    not metaphysics, but theology. Having, as he believed, refuted the opinions of
                    the philosophers, he next investigated the pretensions of the Alle-gorists, who
                    derived their doctrines from an imam. These Arabian ultramontanes had no word
                    for the doubter. Did he ask for the proof of their doctrine, they could only
                    answer that “thus it was written.” They could not, he says, even understand the
                    problems they sought to resolve by the assumption of infallibility, and he
                    turned again, in his despair, to the instructors of his youth—the Sufis. In
                    their mystical intuition of the laws of life, and absorption in the immanent
                    Deity, he at last found peace. This pathetic close of his stormy career
                    negatives the idea that he ever wrote the philosophical work he once
                    contemplated on <hi rend="italic">The Bases of Belief,</hi> and at the same time
                    shows the true character of the treatise which, alike in mediaeval and modern
                    times, has been quoted as containing an exposition of his opinions. The work
                    called <hi rend="italic">The Tendencies of the Philosophers,</hi> and which was
                    translated in 1506, with the title <hi rend="italic">Logica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et Philosophia</hi><hi rend="italic">Algazelis Arabis,</hi>
                    contains neither the logic nor the philosophy of Al-Gazali. It is a mere
                    abstract or statement of the Peripatetic systems, and was made preliminary to
                    that <hi rend="italic">Destruction</hi> of which we have already spoken. With
                    this work Arabian philosophy in the East came to an end; but it revived in the
                    new Arabia which had been planted in the West— in Mahometan Spain. If,
                    therefore, Al-Gazali was the Oriental Descartes in being the first destructive
                    sceptic of the old, he was its Descartes no less in being the initiator of the
                    new philosophy.</p>
