                <p><label type="entry">ALEXANDRIAN SCHOOL</label>. Under this title are generally
                    included certain strongly-marked tendencies in literature and science which took
                    their rise in the city of Alexandria. That city, founded by Alexander the Great
                    about the time when Greece, in losing her national independence, lost also her
                    intellectual supremacy, was in every way admirably adapted for becoming the new
                    centre of the world’s activity and thought. Its situation brought it into
                    commercial relations with all the nations lying around the Mediterranean, and at
                    the same time rendered it the one communicating link with the wealth and
                    civilisation of the East. The great natural advantages it thus enjoyed were
                    artificially increased to an enormous extent by the care of the sovereigns of
                    Egypt. Ptolemy Soter (reigned 306-285 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), to whom,
                    in the general distribution of Alexander’s conquests, this kingdom had fallen,
                    began to draw around him from various parts of Greece a circle of men eminent in
                    literature and philosophy. To these he gave every facility for the prosecution
                    of their learned researches. Under the inspiration of his friend Demetrius
                    Phalereus, the Athenian orator, this Ptolemy laid the foundations of the great
                    library, and originated the keen search for all written works, which resulted in
                    the formation of a collection such as the world has seldom seen. He also built,
                    for the convenience of his men of letters, the Museum, in which, maintained by
                    the royal bounty, they resided, studied, and taught. This Museum or academy of
                    science was in many respects not unlike a modem university. The work thus begun
                    by Ptolemy Soter was carried on vigorously by his descendants, in particular by
                    his two immediate successors, Ptolemy Philadelphus and Ptolemy Euergetes.
                    Philadelphus (285-247 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), whose librarian was the
                    celebrated Callimachus, bought up all Aristotle’s collection of books, and also
                    introduced a number of Jewish and Egyptian works. Among these appears to have
                    been a portion of the Septuagint. Euergetes (247-222 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> largely increased the library by seizing on the original editions of
                    the dramatists laid up in the Athenian archives, and by compelling all
                    travellers who arrived in Alexandria to leave a copy of any work they
                    possessed.</p>
                <p>The intellectual movement so originated extended over a long period of years. If
                    we date its rise from the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> at the
                    time of the fall of Greece and the foundation of the Graeco-Macedonian empire,
                    we must look for its final dissolution in the 7th century of the Christian era,
                    at the time of the fall of Alexandria and the rise of the Mahometan power. But
                    this very long period falls into two divisions. The first, extending from about
                    306 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to about 30 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    includes the time from the foundation of the Ptolemaic dynasty to its final
                    subjugation by the Romans; the second extends from 30 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> to 640 A.D. The characteristic features of these divisions are very
                    clearly marked, and their difference affords an explanation of the variety and
                    vagueness of meaning attaching to the term Alexandrian School. In the first of
                    the two periods the intellectual activity was of a purely literary and
                    scientific nature. It was an attempt to continue and develop, under new
                    conditions, the old Hellenic culture. This direction of effort was particularly
                    noticeable under the early Ptolemies, Alexandria being then almost the only home
                    in the world for pure literature. During the last century and a half before the
                    Christian era, the school, as it might be called, began to break up and to lose
                    its individuality. This was due partly to the state of government under some of
                    the later Ptolemies, partly to the formation of new literary circles in Rhodes,
                    Syria, &amp;c., whose supporters, though retaining the Alexandrian
                    peculiarities, could scarcely be included in the Alexandrian school. The loss of
                    active life, consequent on this gradual dissolution, was much increased when
                    Alexandria fell under Roman sway. Then the influence of the school was extended
                    over the whole known world, but men of letters began to concentrate at Rome
                    rather than at Alexandria. In that city, however, there were new forces in
                    operation which produced a second grand outburst of intellectual life. The new
                    movement was not in the old direction—had, indeed, nothing in common with it.
                    With its character largely determined by Jewish elements, and even more by
                    contact with the dogmas of Christianity, this second Alexandrian school resulted
                    in the speculative philosophy of the Neo-Platonists and the religious philosophy
                    of the Gnostics and early church fathers.</p>
                <p>There appear, therefore, to be at least two definite significations of the title
                    Alexandrian School; or rather, there are two Alexandrian schools, distinct both
                    chronologically and in substance. The one is the Alexandrian school of poetry
                    and science, the other the Alexandrian school of philosophy. As regards the use
                    of the word “school” to denote these movements, it must be observed that the
                    term is misleading. It has not the same meaning as when applied to the Academics
                    or Peripatetics, the Stoics or Epicureans. These consisted of a company united
                    by holding in common certain speculative principles, by having the same theory
                    of things. There was nothing at all corresponding to this among the
                    Alexandrians. In literature their activities were directed to the most diverse
                    objects; they have only in common a certain spirit or form. There was among them
                    no definite system of philosophy. Even in the later schools of philosophy proper
                    there is found a community rather of tendency than of definite result or of
                    fixed principles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alexandrian School of Literature.—</hi> The general character
                    of the literature of the school appears as the necessary consequence of the
                    state of affairs brought about by the fall of Greek nationality and
                    independence. The great works of the Greek mind had formerly been the products
                    of a fresh life of nature and perfect freedom of thought. All their hymns,
                    epics, and histories were bound up with their individuality as a free people.
                    But the Macedonian conquest at Chaeronea brought about a complete dissolution of
                    this Greek life in all its relations, private and political. The full, genial
                    spirit of Greek thought vanished when freedom was lost, with which it was
                    inseparably united. A substitute for this originality was found at Alexandria in
                    learned research, extended and multifarious knowledge. Amply provided with means
                    for acquiring information, and under the watchful care of a great monarch, the
                    Alexandrians readily took this new direction in literature. With all the great
                    objects removed which could excite a true spirit of poetry, they devoted
                    themselves to minute researches in all sciences subordinate to literature
                    proper. They studied criticism, grammar, prosody and metre, antiquities and
                    mythology. The results of this study constantly appear in their productions.
                    Their works are never national, never addressed to a people, but to a circle of
                    learned men. Moreover, the very fact of being under the protection, and, as it
                    were, in the pay of an absolute monarch, was damaging to the character of their
                    literature. There was introduced into it a courtly element, clear traces of
                    which, with all its accompaniments, are found in the extant works of the school
                    One other fact, not to be forgotten in forming a general estimate of the
                    literary value of their productions, is, that the same writer was frequently or
                    almost always distinguished in several special sciences. The most renowned poets
                    were at the same time men of culture and science, critics, archaeologists,
                    astronomers, or physicians. To such writers the poetical form was merely a
                    convenient vehicle for the exposition of science.</p>
                <p>The forms of poetical composition chiefly cultivated by the Alexandrians were
                    epic and lyric or elegiac. Great <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n536/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0536-0499"/> epics are wanting; but in their place, as might
                    almost have been expected, are found the historical and the didactic or
                    expository epics. The subjects of the historical epics were generally some of
                    the well-known myths, in the exposition of which the writer could exhibit the
                    full extent of his learning and his perfect command of verse. These poems are in
                    a sense valuable as repertories of antiquities; but their style is on the whole
                    bad, and infinite patience is required to clear up their numerous and obscure
                    allusions. The best extant specimen is the <hi rend="italic">Argonautica</hi> of
                    Apollonius Rhodius; the most characteristic is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexandra</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cassandra</hi> of Lycophron, the obscurity
                    of which is almost proverbial.</p>
                <p>The subjects of didactic epics were very numerous; they seem to have depended on
                    the special knowledge possessed by the writers, who used verse as a form for
                    unfolding their information. Some, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the lost poem of
                    Callimachus, called Αίτια, were on the origin of myths and religious
                    observances; others were on special sciences. Thus we have two poems of Aratus,
                    who, though not resident at Alexandria, was so thoroughly imbued with the
                    Alexandrian spirit as to be with reason included in the school; the one is an
                    essay on astronomy, the other an account of the signs of the weather. Nicander
                    of Colophon has also left us two epics, one on remedies for poisons, the other
                    on the bites of venomous beasts. Of many other epic poets only the names are
                    known, as Dicaearchus, Euphorion, Rhianus, Dionysius, Oppianus. The spirit of
                    all their productions is the same, that of learned research. They are
                    distinguished by artistic form, purity of expression, and strict attention to
                    the laws of metre and prosody, qualities which, however good in themselves, do
                    not compensate for want of originality, freshness, and power.</p>
                <p>In their lyric and elegiac poetry there is much worthy of admiration. The
                    specimens we possess are not devoid of talent or of a certain happy art of
                    expression. Yet, for the most part they either relate to objects thoroughly
                    incapable of poetic treatment, where the writer’s endeavour is rather to expound
                    the matter fully than to render it poetically beautiful, or else expend
                    themselves on short isolated subjects, generally myths, and are erotic in
                    character. The earliest of the elegiac poets was Philetas, the sweet singer of
                    Cos. But the most distinguished was Callimachus, undoubtedly the greatest of the
                    Alexandrian poets. Of his numerous works there remain to us only a few hymns,
                    epigrams, and fragments of elegies. Other lyric poets were Phanocles,
                    Hermesianax, Alexander of Aetolia, and Lycophron.</p>
                <p>Some of the best productions of the school were their epigrams. Of these we have
                    several specimens, and the art of composing them seems to have been assiduously
                    cultivated, as might naturally be expected from the court life of the poets, and
                    their constant endeavours after terseness and neatness of expression. Of kindred
                    character were the parodies and satirical poems, of which the best examples were
                    the Σ <hi rend="italic">ί</hi><hi rend="italic">λλoι</hi> of Timon.</p>
                <p>Dramatic poetry appears to have flourished to some extent. There are still extant
                    three or four varying lists of the seven great dramatists who composed the
                    Pleiad of Alexandria. Their works, perhaps not unfortunately, have perished. A
                    ruder kind of drama, the amoebaean verse, or bucolic mime, developed into the
                    only pure stream of genial poetry found in the Alexandrian School, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Idylls</hi> of Theocritus. The name of these poems preserves their
                    original idea; they were <hi rend="italic">pictures</hi> of fresh country
                    life.</p>
                <p>The most interesting fact connected with this Alexandrian poetry is the powerful
                    influence it exercised on Roman literature. That literature, especially in the
                    Augustan age, is not to be thoroughly understood without due appreciation of the
                    character of the Alexandrian SchooL</p>
                <p>Before the Alexandrians had begun to produce original works, their researches
                    were directed towards the masterpieces of ancient Greek literature. If that
                    literature was to be a power in the world, it must be handed down to posterity
                    in a form capable of being understood. This was the task begun and carried out
                    by the Alexandrian critics. These men did not merely collect works, but sought
                    to arrange them, to subject the texts to criticism, and to explain any allusion
                    or reference in them which at a later date might become obscure. The complete
                    philological examination of any work consisted, according to them, of the
                    following processes :—διόρθωσις, arrangement of the text; άνάγνωσις, settlement
                    of accents; <hi rend="italic">τ</hi><hi rend="italic">έ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-χvτ</hi><hi rend="italic">η</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> theory of forms,
                    syntax; <hi rend="italic">έξήγησις</hi>, explanation either of words or things;
                    and finally, <hi rend="italic">κ</hi><hi rend="italic">ρί</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >σ</hi><hi rend="italic">ις</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> judgment on the author
                    and his work, including all questions as to authenticity and integrity. To
                    perform their task adequately required from the critics a wide circle of
                    knowledge; and from this requirement sprang the sciences of grammar, prosody,
                    lexicography, mythology, and archaeology. The service rendered by these critics
                    is invaluable. To them we owe not merely the possession of the greatest works of
                    Greek intellect, but the possession of them in a readable state. The most
                    celebrated critics were Zenodotus; Aristophanes of Byzantium, to whom we owe the
                    theory of Greek accents; and Aristarchus of Samothrace, confessedly the
                    Coryphaeus of criticism. Others were Alexander of Aetolia, Lycophron,
                    Callimachus, Eratosthenes, and many of a later age, for the critical school long
                    survived the literary. These philological labours were of great indirect
                    importance, for they led immediately to the study of the natural sciences, and
                    in particular to a more accurate knowledge of geography and history.
                    Considerable attention began to be paid to the ancient history of Greece, and to
                    all the myths relating to the foundation of states and cities. A large
                    collection of such curious information is contained in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliotheca</hi> of Apollodorus, a pupil of Aristarchus, who flourished in the
                    2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Eratosthenes was the first to write on
                    mathematical and physical geography; he also first attempted to draw up a
                    chronological table of the Egyptian kings, and of the historical events of
                    Greece. His Egyptian chronology, along with that' of Manetho, is still of great
                    interest to scholars; and Bunsen speaks with the highest admiration of his
                    researches in Greek history. The sciences of mathematics, astronomy, and
                    medicine were also cultivated with assiduity and success at Alexandria, but they
                    can scarcely be said to have their origin there, or in any strict sense to form
                    a part of the peculiarly Alexandrian literature. The founder of the mathematical
                    school was the celebrated Euclid: among its scholars were Archimedes; Apollonius
                    of Perga, author of a treatise on <hi rend="italic">Conic Sections;</hi>
                    Eratosthenes, to whom we owe the first measurement of the earth; and Hipparchus,
                    the founder of the epicyclical theory of the heavens, afterwards called the
                    Ptolemaic system, from its most famous expositor, Claudius Ptolemaeus.
                    Alexandria continued long after the Christian era to be celebrated as a school
                    of mathematics and science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alexandrian School of Philosophy.—</hi> Although it is not
                    possible to divide literatures with absolute rigidity by centuries, and although
                    the intellectual life of Alexandria, particularly as applied to science, long
                    survived the Roman conquest, yet at that period the school, which for some time
                    had been gradually breaking up, seems finally to have succumbed. The later
                    productions in the field of pure literature bear the stamp of Rome rather than
                    of Alexandria. But in that city, for some time past, there had been various
                    forces secretly working, and these coming in contact with great spiritual
                    changes occurring in the world around, produced a second outburst of
                    intellectual activity.</p>

                <p>Among the natives of foreign countries transplanted to Alexandria by its founder
                    had been a few Jews. These gradually increased in number, until, about the time
                    of the Christian era, they formed an influential part of the populace of Egypt,
                    inhabited two of the five quarters of the capital, and held high offices in the
                    state. They had been well treated by the Ptolemies, and for some time
                    experienced similar treatment from the Romans. The new movement of thought was
                    in great measure due to the presence of this Jewish element. The contact of free
                    Greek speculation with the peculiar Jewish ideas of the transcendence of God, of
                    a special revelation, and of a singular subjective ecstasy, the prophetic state,
                    could not fail to have a strong effect on the mode of thought of the most highly
                    cultured Jews. From many causes they were more than ordinarily open to receive
                    foreign ideas. Their isolated position had been broken in upon by their long
                    residence as a small minority in the midst of an atmosphere of Greek custom and
                    thought, and in the most highly cultivated city in the world. Their separation
                    from their native country had tended to broaden their views by weakening the
                    strong political convictions which united their destiny and their sacred
                    writings with a definite land. It was a necessary consequence that they should
                    endeavour so far as possible to assimilate their principles to Greek ideas. The
                    two systems were not, they found, in total contradiction; they had several
                    points in common. This was specially the case with the Platonic writings. There
                    thus arose among the Jews a constantly increasing tendency to modify or widen
                    their doctrines so as to admit of Greek conceptions, and then, with the aid of
                    these conceptions, to systematise their own somewhat vague religious views. In
                    this way philosophy and religion would be united or identified. There is truth
                    in all philosophy, for philosophy is but a mangled reproduction of the sacred
                    record in which all truth is contained. The Scriptures contain all philosophy,
                    but not explicitly <hi rend="italic">; they</hi> require to be interpreted. The
                    system thus developed has a philosophical aspect, yet never ceases to be
                    essentially Jewish, for the ultimate resort is always to a body of doctrine
                    expressly revealed. Progress in this direction was possible in two ways. First,
                    the pure Greek metaphysical thought rejected a body of truth said to have been
                    revealed to a special people, but retained the idea of revelation to the
                    individual thinker. A doctrine was thus evolved which contained most of the
                    oriental or Jewish theosophical ideas, but in logical sequence and based for the
                    most part on the earlier works of Greek thinkers. Religion was retained, but was
                    explained or had a meaning given by philosophy. To this powerful movement of
                    thought the name Neo-Platonism is given; its chief representatives were Ammonius
                    Saccas, Plotinus, Porphyry, Jamblichus, and Proclus. Second, the introduction of
                    the peculiar Christian dogmas could not fail to produce a lively effect on the
                    Alexandrian thinkers. These dogmas had to be reconciled with philosophy, or the
                    one must yield to and be absorbed by the other. The attempt to solve the problem
                    of their mutual relation gave rise to Gnosticism in all its phases, and was the
                    cause of the speculative element in the works of such fathers as Clement of
                    Alexandria and Origen.</p>
                <p>To the whole of this great movement the title Alexandrian philosophy must be
                    given, although that term is sometimes identified with Neo-Platonism. Of the
                    exact historical origin of it we have no certain notice. Some thinkers are of
                    opinion that even in the Septuagint traces of rationalism can be discovered.
                    (See Frankel, <hi rend="italic">Historisch-kritische</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Studien zur Septuaginta,</hi> 1841.) In Aristobulus (160 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>) is found a thoroughgoing attempt to show that early Greek
                    speculations were in harmony with the divine record, because they had been
                    borrowed from it. Traces of allegorical interpretation are also found in him,
                    but no conception of a theosophical system. In the peculiar tenets of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Therapeutae,</hi> so far as these can be known, may perhaps be
                    traced another stream of influence, the Neo-Pythagorean. The complete
                    representative of the Jewish religious philosophy was Philo, surnamed Judaeus,
                    who lived at Alexandria during the Christian era. In him are found a complete
                    and elaborate theosophy fusing together religious and metaphysical ideas, a firm
                    conviction that all truth is to be found in the sacred writings, and a constant
                    application to these writings of the principle of allegorical interpretation.
                    His system is a syncretism of Oriental mysticism and Greek metaphysics, and the
                    effort at such a combination from the Jewish side could go no further. After
                    Philo Judaeus there remained as possible courses either Neo-Platonism or
                    Gnosticism.</p>
                <p>Of Alexandrian literature there are notices in histories of Greek literature, as

                    histories of philosophy and of early Christianity. Special works, which,
                    however, devote most attention to the Neo-Platonists, are—</p>
