                <p><label type="entry">ALLIER</label>, a department in the centre of France, so
                    called from the river of the same name; bounded on the N. by the department of
                    Cher and Nièvre, on the E. by those of Saône-et-Loire and Loire, on the S. by
                    that of Puys de Dôme, and on the W. by those of Creuse and Cher; extending at
                    the widest points 82 miles from E. to W., and 55 from N. to S.; and containing
                    an area of 2821 square miles. Its surface is in general undulating, rising to
                    considerable elevations among the mountains of Forez on the south-east, and
                    among those of Auvergne towards the west. The river Allier flows northward
                    between these ranges, receiving the Andelot, the Sioule, and the Bioudre, all
                    from the left; east of the Allier is the Bèbre, which joins the Loire within the
                    limits of the department; and on the west the Cher, with its tributary the
                    Aumance. The soil is for the most part fertile, especially in the valleys of the
                    Allier, the Sioule, and the Bèbre, yielding wheat, oats, barley, rye, fruits,
                    and potatoes, in quantities exceeding what is required for home consumption, as
                    well as some red and white wines. Good timber is grown, and cattle, sheep,
                    goats, and horses are reared in large numbers; but agriculture is on the whole
                    in a backward condition, owing to the inhabitants’ aversion to change. The
                    mineral wealth of the department is very considerable, including iron, coal,
                    antimony, marble, and manganese—the coal mines of Commentry being among the most
                    important. The chief manufactures are of cutlery, earthenware, glass, cloth,
                    leather, and paper. The climate is healthy, but is liable to sudden variations
                    of temperature. The mineral waters at Vichy, Nèris, and Bourbon l’Archambault,
                    in the department, are in much repute. Allier comprehends the greater portion of
                    the old province of Bourbonnais, and is at present divided into four
                    arrondissements—Moulins, Gannat, La Palisse, and Montluçon, which are subdivided
                    into 28 cantons and 317 communes. Moulins is the capital, and the seat of a
                    bishop whose diocese is co-extensive with the department. The other important
                    towns are La Palisse, Cusset, Vichy, Gannat, Saint Pourçain, Montluçon, and
                    Commentry. Population in 1871, 390,812; of whom 196,831 were males, and 193,981
                    females. Of the total population, 223,374 could neither read nor write, and
                    36,786 could read but could not write.</p>

                    among the Margeride mountains, a few miles east of the town of Mende, and, after
                    traversing Haute Loire, Puys de Dôme, and Allier, forms the boundary between
                    Cher and Nièvre, until it falls into the Loire four miles west of Nevers. Its
                    length is 200 miles, for a considerable portion of which it is navigable, and
                    its chief tributaries are the Dore and the Sioule.</p>
