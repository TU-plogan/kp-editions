                    branded as a tax upon knowledge. It was certainly very unequal and oppressive,
                    being the same upon the sale of an estate worth £100,000 as on a servant’s

                    the duty on each advertisement was 3s. Gd. in Great Britain, and 2s. 6d. in
                    Ireland; in that year it was reduced to 1. 6d. in Great Britain, and 1s. in
                    Ireland. In 1832 (the last year of the high duty) the total number of newspaper
                    advertisements in the U. K. was 921,943: viz., 787,649 in England, 108,914 in
                    Scotland, and 125,380 in Ireland; the amount of duty paid in that year being
                    £172,570. In 1841 the number of advertisements had increased to 1,778,957: viz.,
                    1,386,625 for England, 188,189 for Scotland, and 204,143 for Ireland; and the
                    total duty paid amounted to £128,318. In 1851 the amount of duty rose to
                    £175,094, 10s. 8d.; being for England £142,365, 3s. 6d.; Scotland, £19,940,
                    11s.; Ireland, £12,788, 16s. 2d. In compliance with the all but unanimous voice
                    of the public, this duty was abolished in 1853; since which time the system of
                    advertising has increased to an unprecedented extent, in consequence of the low
                    rate at which short advertisements are now inserted. To advertise advantageously
                    requires both experience and judgment; without a knowledge of the character aud
                    circulation of the public journals, much expenditure may be wasted by
                    advertising in papers that have either a limited or inappropriate circulation.
                    The sale of some commodities (such as quack medicines) depends almost wholly on
                    advertising, of which it has been said that if the vender has the courage to
                    continue advertising to the extent of £20,000, he will make his fortune by a
                    drug thoroughly worthless. Advertising often falls disproportionately on books,
                    as it is necessary that new publications should be freely advertised. On small
                    low-priced books the expense is particularly heavy, an advertisement of a one
                    shilling book costing as much as one selling at twenty shillings. From this, and
                    their generally ephemeral character, it may be said that ninety-nine out of a
                    hundred pamphlets are published at a loss.</p>
                <p>Interesting information on the subject of advertisements will be found in an
                    article in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> for 1st Feb. 1843, “On
                    the Advertising System,” and in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> for
                    June 1855, “On the Rise and Progress of Advertisements, from the establishment
                    of the Newspaper Press of this Country till the Present Time.” In the latter
                    article it is stated that the first advertisement occurs in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mercurius Politicus</hi> for Jan. 1652, the subject of the
                    advertisement being a heroic poem of congratulation on Cromwell’s victories in
                    Ireland. A writer in <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries</hi> for July 6, 1872,
                    has found two examples of advertisements previous to that date, which occur in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mercurius</hi><hi rend="italic">Elencticus</hi> of Oct.
                    1648. See also <hi rend="italic">The Newspaper Press,</hi> by James Grant (2
