                    Evaristus in 108 or 109 A.D., and, according to Eusebius, suffered martyrdom
                    under Hadrian in the year 119. Catholic writers ascribe to him the introduction
                    of holy water, and of the custom of mixing sacramental wine with water.</p>

                    to 1073. He had previously, as bishop of Lucca, been an energetic coadjutor with
                    Hildebrand in endeavouring to suppress simony, and to enforce the celibacy of
                    the clergy; and his efforts to augment the influence of the Roman see prepared
                    the way for the complete ascendancy which was established by his celebrated
                    successor. The imperial sanction being withheld from Alexander’s election, a
                    council at Basle chose as anti-pope Cadolaus, bishop of Parma, who assumed the
                    name of Honorius II., and marched to Rome. He was deposed, however, by a council
                    held at Mantua, and Alexander’s position remained unchallenged. Alexander was
                    succeeded by his associate Hildebrand, who took the title of Gregory VII.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi> III. (<hi rend="italic">Rolando Ranuci</hi>
                    of Siena), cardinal and chancellor of the Roman church, was elected to the
                    popedom in 1159, and reigned until 1181. His career is of great historical
                    importance on account of the vigour and ultimate success with which he carried
                    out the ideas and policy of Hildebrand in opposition to Frederick Barbarossa and
                    Henry II. of England. Three anti-popes (Victor IV., 1159; Pascal III., 1164;
                    Calixtus III., 1168) were confirmed by the German emperor in succession.
                    Alexander, however, steadfastly maintained his rights, though compelled to take
                    refuge in France between the years 1162 and 1165. The contest between pope and
                    emperor was continued with varying fortune until, on the 29th May 1176,
                    Frederick was decisively defeated at Legnano, when he at once withdrew his
                    support from the anti-pope and submitted to Alexander. On the 1st August 1177
                    the emperor yielded the customary homage to the pope at Venice by kissing his
                    foot, and was freed from the ban of <pb break="no"

                    ten years previously. There seems to be no historical authority for the common
                    story that during the ceremony Alexander placed his foot upon the emperor’s
                    neck.</p>
                <p>In England the papal supremacy was strenuously maintained against Henry II. by
                    Thomas à Becket. Here, as in the case of Germany, the struggle was protracted
                    and severe, but in the end the victory lay with the pope. À Becket was canonised
                    soon after his assassination, and Henry II. was compelled to submit to a
                    humiliating penance. A contest with William the Lion of Scotland, who insisted
                    on instituting his chaplain Hugo, and not the papal nominee, into the see of St
                    Andrews, ended in the excommunication of the king in 1181.</p>
                <p>Alexander introduced several important changes in the organisation and
                    administration of the church. Chief among these were the restriction of the
                    right of canonisation to the pope alone, the still-existing law requiring the
                    votes of two-thirds of the cardinals for a valid papal election, and the
                    exemption of the clergy from civil control and of church lands from civil
                    burdens. Several of these measures were ratified by the third general council of
                    the Lateran, summoned by Alexander in 1179.</p>

                    chair from December 1254 till his death in May 1261. He seems to have been of a
                    weak character, and in the struggle against the house of Hohenstaufen, which he
                    inherited from his predecessors, he did little to strengthen the position of the
                    papacy. The opposition which he offered to Manfred, natural son of Frederick
                    II., proved unavailing, although he obtained the aid of England by promising the
                    disputed sovereignty of the Two Sicilies to the English Prince Edward. Manfred
                    was crowned king at Palermo in 1258, and in 1260 he invaded the States of the
                    Church, and compelled the pope to recognise him as legitimate sovereign. The
                    ecclesiastical administration of Alexander was signalised by his efforts to
                    unite the Greek and Latin churches, by the establishment of the Inquisition in
                    France (1255), and by the support he gave to the orders of Mendicant friars. The
                    last years of his pontificate were passed at Viterbo, where he was compelled to
                    take refuge on account of the violent struggles at Rome between the factions of
                    the Guelphs and the Ghibellines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi> V. (<hi rend="italic">Pietro Philargi),</hi>
                    a native of Candia, enjoyed the dignity of Pope for only ten months, from the
                    26th June 1409 to the 3d May 1410. Bom of poor parentage, he owed his admission
                    to a religious house to a Franciscan monk, who noticed him begging. He studied
                    at Paris and Oxford, where he acquired such reputation for scholarship, that on
                    his return to Italy he was rapidly promoted from dignity to dignity. In 1402 he
                    was appointed, through the influence of Galeazzo Visconti, to the archbishopric
                    of Milan, and in 1405 he was made a cardinal by Innocent VII. The council of
                    Pisa, after deposing Benedict XIII. and Gregory XII., elected him pope on the
                    understanding that he would set himself to reform the abuses of the church. The
                    weakness of his character and the shortness of his pontificate, however,
                    prevented anything effectual being done. He died, as was generally believed, of
                    poison administered by Balthasar Cossa, who became his successor under the title
                    of John XXIII.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi> VI. (<hi rend="italic">Rodrigo Borgia),</hi>
                    memorable as the most characteristic incarnation of the secular spirit of the
                    papacy of the 15th century, was born at Xativa in Valencia, 1st January 1431.
                    His biographers all but unanimously assert his patronymic to have been Lenzuoli
                    (in its original Valencian form, Llançol), and the name of Borgia (or more
                    properly Borja) to have been assumed on his adoption by his maternal uncle.
                    Francisco Escolano, however, a compatriot, positively affirms (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Cronica,</hi> lib. vi. cap. 33), that Llançol was his mother’s name, and that
                    his father was Giofré Borja. It is also disputed whether he originally followed
                    the legal or the military profession; the former appears more probable. In
                    either case, his career was determined by his uncle’s elevation to the papacy as
                    Calixtus III., 8th April 1455, and his own immediate summons to Rome, where he
                    was reserved <hi rend="italic">in petto</hi> as cardinal in the ensuing
                    February, publicly promoted in September, and by an unparalleled act of nepotism
                    elevated to the lucrative and dignified office of vice-chancellor in the
                    following July. He also succeeded his uncle as archbishop of Valencia. An elder
                    brother, Pedro Luis, was made generalissimo of the papal forces by land and sea.
                    The animosity created by so invidious an exaltation prepared Rodrigo’s
                    subsequent feud with the Roman patriciate. For the moment he was all-powerful,
                    and the letters of that dexterous courtier Aeneas Sylvius attest the importance
                    attached to his good word. We must here notice the ridiculous fiction concerning
                    the parentage of Borgia’s natural children, which owes its currency to the
                    uncritical credulity of Gordon, his first formal biographer. An anonymous MS.
                    romance, professing to record the secret history of the Borgia family, exists in
                    many Italian libraries; a copy is in the British Museum. Gordon fell in with
                    this fiction, and whether from lack of judgment or love of marvel, adopted it
                    into his narrative. According to this version, Rodrigo, when summoned to Rome,
                    was living with a beautiful Valencian courtesan, Rosa Vanozza, by whom he had
                    already had several children. Despatching his family to Venice under the care of
                    a major-domo, he entered upon a course of austere hypocrisy, designed to secure
                    his exaltation to the papacy, thus remaining apart from his mistress and
                    children for a period of nearly forty years! This legend, originally circulated
                    as a prime piece of scandal, has been accepted as a vindication by Rodrigo’s
                    apologists. Vanozza, they contend, was not his concubine but his wife, and her
                    decease must have preceded his ordination: Caesar and Lucretia were consequently
                    legitimate. The Abbé Ollivier goes a step further still, and disposes of two
                    scandals at a stroke by identifying Vanozza with Giulia Farnese, whose charms,
                    during Alexander’s pontificate forty years afterwards, notoriously procured her
                    brother’s elevation to the cardinalate. It is sufficient to reply that in this
                    case the beautiful Lucretia must have espoused the Duke of Ferrara at forty, and
                    have borne him children at sixty. The date of Caesar’s birth, moreover is known
                    to an hour, being fixed by the horoscope preserved in Junctinus (tom. i. p. 171)
                    at 18th September 1475. Nor is the history of Vanozza any longer a secret. It is
                    known that her family name was De’ Cattanei; that after bearing five children to
                    Alexander she was twice married, on each occasion to a petty official about the
                    papal court; that she possessed houses and other property in Rome; that she
                    survived Alexander many years, and made use of the name of Borgia (<hi
                    rend="italic">Reumont,</hi> Bd. 3, pp. 202, 203).</p>
                <p>The fortune of the Borgia brothers seemed menaced with eclipse on the death of
                    their uncle, 8th August 1458. Pedro Luis, who had incurred the bitter enmity of
                    the Orsini family, escaped under the escort of Cardinal Barbo to Cività Vecchia,
                    where a fever soon carried him off. Rodrigo remained for the conclave. No papal
                    election is more dramatically narrated in that edifying collection, <hi
                    rend="italic">Conclavi de' Pontefici Romani,</hi> than the one which resulted in
                    the choice of Aeneas Sylvius (Pius II.) Borgia’s share in it had earned Pius’s
                    gratitude; he was, nevertheless, compelled to submit to some diminution of the
                    authority and emoluments of the vice-chancellorship; and a subsequent
                    indiscretion in the too public indulgence of his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n525/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0525-0488"/> taste for female society while discharging a
                    legation at Siena procured him one of the severest reprimands ever addressed to
                    a cardinal by a pope. Pius’s reproof is preserved in Raynaldus (Append. ad ann.
                    1460, num. 31), and alone refutes the fiction of Borgia’s religious hypocrisy.
                    Cardinal Barbo, however, who succeeded as Paul II., was the same spirited
                    patrician who had befriended the Borgias in their hour of need, and his
                    ostentatious pontificate ushered in the era of Rodrigo’s unbroken prosperity.
                    “He is,” writes at this time Gaspar Veronensis (Muratori, tom. iii pt. 2, p.
                    1037), “a comely man of cheerful countenance and honeyed discourse, who gains
                    the affections of all the women he admires, and attracts them as the loadstone
                    does iron; it is indeed supposed that he proceeds no further.” A supposition
                    rather pious than probable.</p>
                <p>On the death of the jovial Paul (1471), Borgia is mentioned, along with Cardinals
                    Orsino and Gonzaga, as one of the three who chiefly contributed to place the
                    tiara on the brows of the then famous preacher and exemplary ascetic Sixtus ΓV.,
                    who immediately <hi rend="italic">(per fuggire l'i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ngratitudine)</hi> bestowed on him the opulent abbey of Subiaco, and raised him
                    to the dignity of cardinal-bishop. About the same time must have commenced his
                    intimacy with Vanozza. In 1473 he undertook a legation to Spain, avowedly with
                    the purpose of visiting his diocese and of composing differences between the
                    kings of Castile and Portugal, but in reality to display his magnificence to his
                    countrymen. His demeanour on this occasion is represented in the most
                    unfavourable light by the cardinal of Pavia, who had previously composed for him
                    that elegant oration to his Valencian flock which the Abbé Ollivier has the
                    simplicity to attribute to Borgia himself. The cardinal, however, is too much of
                    a time-server and a rhetorician for his account to be altogether trustworthy.
                    More certain is the occurrence of a tremendous tempest on Borgia’s return, in
                    which part of his retinue perished, while he himself narrowly escaped. Innocent
                    VIII., the successor of Sixtus, owed his election to Borgia’s coalition with the
                    late pope’s nephew, and the fortunes of the former remained unimpaired
                    throughout his tranquil pontificate. The long malady which terminated it
                    afforded scope for the intrigues of aspirants to the succession; and when the
                    cardinals entered into conclave (August 1492), already the rumour ran that a
                    Spaniard would be pope. The simoniacal character of the election is
                    indisputable. We need not believe that the opulent and high-spirited Cardinal
                    Ascanio Sforza was tempted with four mule-loads of silver, but his instant
                    elevation to the vice-chancellorship speaks for itself. Cardinal Orsino was
                    bought with Borgia’s palace in Rome; Cardinal Colonna with the abbey of Subiaco;
                    money gained the minor members of the Sacred College; five cardinals alone are
                    recorded as incorruptible. Borgia’s uneasiness was betrayed by his hasty
                    assumption of the pontifical vestments, and premature announcement of the
                    election to the expectant crowd. He assumed the name of Alexander VI. His
                    allocution to the cardinals breathed spirit and dignity: an admonitory discourse
                    to his son Caesar, which may be read in Gordon, is an invention of the anonymous
                    romancer. The pomp of his coronation far surpassed preceding examples, and the
                    compliments of foreign ambassadors on the majesty of his mien and the maturity
                    of his wisdom were echoed by a public accustomed to simony, relieved at their
                    deliverance from a period of anarchy, and sensible of their need of a firmer
                    hand. This hope Alexander justified and surpassed. Ere long he had divided Rome
                    into judicial districts, placed a magistrate at the head of each, and himself
                    established a weekly audience, at which, by the admission of the malcontent
                    Infessura, “he administered justice after a marvellous sort.”</p>
                <p>Alexander’s pontificate might have been less eventful but for a circumstance
                    beyond his control. The political system of Italy was on the eve of dissolution.
                    Ludovico the Moor, anxious to confirm himself in his ill-gotten duchy of Milan,
                    was already tempting the French monarch across the Alps by the bait of the
                    kingdom of Naples. As of old in Greece, so now dissensions and political
                    corruption were about to cast down the civilisation of Italy at the feet of the
                    stranger. The passion for family aggrandisement on this occasion impelled
                    Alexander to a patriotic course. His third son Giofré had espoused the
                    illegitimate daughter of the king of Naples, and received as dower the
                    principality of Squillace. When, therefore, the French envoys demanded the
                    investiture of Naples, they met with a flat refusal. This encouraged Alexander’s
                    enemies. Cardinal della Rovere (Julius II.) withdrew from the papal court,
                    seized upon Ostia, and from thence addressed urgent appeals to the French king
                    to march upon Rome, convene a council, and purge Christendom of the simoniacal
                    pope. On this side Alexander felt himself indeed vulnerable. Casting about for
                    alliances, he despatched an envoy to the Sultan; the ambassador was arrested as
                    he returned with a favourable reply; and the publication of his instructions
                    created a fresh scandal. Others still, had Roman manners been less lax, might
                    have arisen from the marriage of the pope’s acknowledged daughter Lucretia to
                    the Lord of Pesaro, under the auspices of the whole Sacred College, and from the
                    elevation of his second son Caesar to the cardinalate at the age of eighteen,
                    unblushing perjury being employed to conceal his illegitimate birth. Yet, at the
                    same period, the successor of Peter appeared for the last time in history as the
                    undisputed bestower of kingdoms and the ultimate tribunal of appeal for
                    Christian nations. Spain and Portugal resorted to him for the adjustment of
                    their claims to the New World; and by tracing a line upon a map he disposed of
                    three-fourths of the human race. Never, according to mediaeval ideas, had a pope
                    exerted his prerogative with equal grandeur; but the mediaeval conception of the
                    papacy was passing away, and no one’s faith in it was feebler than the
                    pope’s.</p>
                <p>Charles VIII. passed the Alps in the autumn of 1494; city after city fell before
                    him, and by the end of the year Rome was added to the number. Alexander had
                    retired into the castle of St Angelo. His-deposition was universally expected,
                    most of all by himself. But Charles's minister, Briçonnet, had been gained by
                    the promise of a cardinal’s hat. On 16th January the reconciliation of king and
                    pontiff was officially celebrated: they rode together through the city; but
                    distrust still prevailed between them. With really surprising firmness Alexander
                    continued to refuse the investiture of Naples, with which Charles may have
                    thought himself able to dispense. Nothing, indeed, could have been more rapid
                    than his conquest, except his loss of that kingdom. By March the triumph of the
                    French seemed complete: on 6th July their retreating army cut its way through
                    the Italian hosts at Taro in Upper Italy; on 7th July the King of Naples
                    re-entered his capital. Nothing remained of the French incursion except a fatal
                    contagion, and the more fatal revelation of the weakness of Italy.</p>
                <p>The retreat of the French left Alexander at liberty to pursue what must have been
                    the main object of any pope of intelligence and spirit in his place—the
                    extirpation of the petty feudal vassals of the church, and the establishment of
                    the temporal independence of the papacy. This was in truth but a phase of the
                    great struggle of the crown and the people against the aristocracy, universally
                    a characteristic of that age; but the pope’s principal motive was unquestionably
                    the insatiable appetite of family <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0526-0489"/> aggrandisement. The incurable vice, however, of
                    his policy was imposed upon him by the lack of men and money to carry it into
                    effect. To obtain the former, he was compelled to incline alternately to France
                    and Spain, degrading the majesty of the Holy See, and forfeiting his liberty of
                    action as a member of the Italian body politic. The finances had to be recruited
                    by the sale of offices and spiritual privileges of every kind. Such practices
                    had long been prevalent at Rome, but never had they attained the enormity, the
                    effrontery, or the method imparted to them by Alexander.</p>
                <p>His enterprise was at first unfortunate. After some petty successes the papal
                    forces were routed by the Orsini, January 1497. Spanish aid was invoked; the
                    Great Captain checked the Orsini and recovered Ostia. Alexander’s spirits rose;
                    on 7th June he alienated Benevento in favour of his eldest son, the Duke of
                    Gandia. That day week the duke disappeared; his body, pierced with wounds, was
                    soon found in the Tiber. The public voice attributed the murder to the pope’s
                    second son, the Cardinal Caesar Borgia, but on no other grounds than his
                    capability of any atrocity, and the gain that accrued to him by this. Some
                    historians know what he said to the pope in confessing his fratricide, and can
                    report the pope’s rejoinder; so is history written. Alexander secluded himself
                    in a passion of grief. He talked of abdication, and actually appointed a
                    commission to inquire into the abuses of the Church. While it ineffectually
                    deliberated on reforms, the stake was preparing for a real reformer. The history
                    of Savonarola must be related elsewhere; it can only be said here that Alexander
                    appears to have been most unwilling to proceed against him, and only to have
                    consented to do so when the Dominican’s hostile attitude rendered further
                    forbearance impossible.</p>
                <p>Caesar Borgia, meanwhile, was bent on improving the opportunity which he had
                    found or made. Three months after Savonarola’s death he propounded to the
                    assembled cardinals his desire to renounce ecclesiastical orders for his soul's
                    health, and was soon at liberty to contract a royal alliance. After encountering
                    a refusal from the daughter of the King of Naples he repaired to France, and
                    there (May 1499) espoused a princess of the house of Navarre, receiving the
                    title of Duke of Valentinois from the French king. Lucretia also benefited by
                    her family’s enlarged views; her alliance with the lord of Pesaro was dissolved
                    on a pretext of nullity, and she married the Duke of Bisceglia, a natural son of
                    the King of Naples. This had occurred a year previously, when Alexander still
                    attached weight to the Neapolitan alliance; but the political horizon was now
                    changed. In October 1499 a French army crossed the Alps and conquered Lombardy,
                    almost without resistance. The watchword was thus given for the papal campaign
                    in the Romagna. Caterina Sforza, regent of Imola and Forli, received a summons
                    to discharge certain arrears long owing to her suzerain. Caesar Borgia followed
                    with an army on the heels of the messenger, and although the intrepid princess
                    defended herself stoutly by sword and poison, she was compelled to succumb to
                    the “Gonfalonier of the Church.” The Borgias’ enterprise coincided fortunately
                    with the commencement (according to the then method of reckoning) of the new
                    century and the mighty concourse of pilgrims to Rome for the jubilee, each
                    representing some substantial contribution to the papal exchequer. France and
                    Spain, meanwhile, had concerted their secret arrangement for the dispossession
                    of the King of Naples, and Caesar Borgia prepared to remove the only obstacle to
                    his own participation in it. In July 1500 the Duke of Bisceglia, Lucretia’s
                    Neapolitan husband, was attacked by assassins in broad day, and left desperately
                    wounded. The pope placed guards over the prince; Lucretia and her sister-in-law
                    prepared his food to avoid poison; but none the less “quum ex vulneribus sibi
                    datis mori noluisset”—Alphonso of Bisceglia was strangled by men in masks. “All
                    Rome,” writes the Venetian ambassador, “trembles before the duke,” The worst
                    times of the empire seemed returned, even to the amusements of the amphitheatre,
                    where Caesar, whose tastes were those of a Spaniard, despatched six bulls
                    successively, severing the head of one from the shoulders at a stroke. The pope
                    looked on helplessly at the Frankenstein of his own creation; “he loves and
                    hugely fears his son,” reports the Venetian, who adds that Caesar had pursued
                    his father’s favourite secretary to his arms, and there butchered him, the
                    pope’s robe being saturated with the gushing blood. Alexander’s easy temper
                    stood him in good stead. “The pope,” according to the same authority, “grows
                    younger every day, and is extremely cheerful; his cares and troubles endure only
                    for a night; he thinks continually of aggrandising his children— <hi
                    rend="italic">ne d'</hi><hi rend="italic">altro ha cura."</hi> In his
                    conversations with foreign envoys he excused his son’s violence as the error of
                    youth. “The duke,” he said, “is really a good fellow; it is only a pity that he
                    cannot endure to be offended.” Lucretia is extolled by all as “lovely, discreet,
                    and bountiful.” Rumour, indeed, imputed to her an incestuous connection with her
                    brother; but this aspersion, like all others upon her, is to this day utterly
                    destitute of proof.</p>
                <p>“These devils cannot be cast out by holy water,” Cardinal Juan Borgia had
                    formerly reported of the turbulent occupants of the Romagna. The experiment of
                    casting out Satan by Beelzebub remained to be tried. In April 1501 Caesar
                    entered upon his second campaign, and by perfidy or force quickly added Pesaro,
                    Rimini, and Faenza to his former possessions. Attentive to the maxims of
                    sagacious tyranny, he governed with substantial justice. If his coffers had to
                    be filled by oppression, the odium would be cast on some subordinate agent,
                    whose body, his mission fulfilled, would be found dismembered in the
                    market-place. France and Spain, meanwhile, proceeded to the spoliation of the
                    defenceless king of Naples, and Caesar (July 1501) shared in the conquest and
                    the booty. In September Alexander himself undertook a campaign against the
                    Colonnas, and humbled those haughty patricians by the capture of all their
                    castles. Lucretia, to the general scandal, represented him in his absence. Worse
                    scandals were in store, could we implicitly credit the contemporary diarist’s
                    account of the scenes enacted in the apostolic palace after Alexander’s return,
                    but the passage is probably interpolated. At this period the papal court was
                    engrossed with preparations for Lucretia’s marriage to Alphonso, son of the Duke
                    of Ferrara, which was celebrated by proxy in December. The pope’s daughter,
                    cardinals and prelates in her train, undertook a stately progress through Italy
                    to Ferrara, where she was received with extraordinary splendour. Piombino was
                    reduced at this time, and in July Caesar treacherously rendered himself master
                    of Urbino. Immediately afterwards his power received a severe shock from the
                    defection of his principal <hi rend="italic">condottieri.</hi> Caesar temporised
                    until, to the admiration of Machiavelli, then Florentine envoy at his camp, his
                    adversaries were decoyed into his hands, seized, and executed (31st December
                    1502). The news gave the signal at Rome for the arrest of the Orsini and the
                    occupation of their castles; thus was the humiliation of the Roman aristocracy
                    completed. Cardinal Orsino was committed to Saint Angelo, where the services of
                    the papal master of the ceremonies were soon required for his interment. “But
                    I,” remarks Burcardus with quaint naïveté, “turned the business over to my
                    assistant, for I did not want to know more than was good for me.” It must be
                    owned that in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0527-0490"/> that age it would have been impossible to bring a
                    cardinal publicly to the block. This apology does not apply to the charges of
                    secret poisoning which have mainly given the Borgias their sinister celebrity,
                    and which became fearfully rife in Alexander’s latter years. They are unproved
                    as yet, but are certainly countenanced by the opulence of the supposed victims,
                    and the avidity with which the pope pounced upon their effects, especially in
                    the case of his rapacious datary, Cardinal Ferrari</p>
                <p>By May 1503 Spain had dispossessed France of her share of ill-gotten Naples. A
                    general war seemed imminent; Alexander and Caesar leaned to the side of Spain.
                    The Sacred College was already full of Spanish cardinals, docile instruments of
                    their countryman, and Alexander might well deem that he had fettered the Church
                    to the fortune of his house. Men looked for the proclamation of Caesar as king
                    of Romagna, and the division of the temporal and the spiritual power. The
                    ancient mutual relations of pope and emperor would have been revived, but on the
                    narrow area of Central Italy. But this was not to be. On the morning of 12th
                    August “Pope Alexander felt ill;” so did Caesar Borgia. Every one knows the
                    story of the supper given to the ten cardinals in the villa, and the fatal
                    exchange of the poisoned flask. This picturesque tale is almost certainly a
                    fiction. An attempt to destroy ten cardinals at once is inconceivable; it would
                    be easier to believe Cardinal Castellesi’s assertion that he was to have been
                    the victim, as his sickness at the time is confirmed from an independent source.
                    But his character does not stand high, and the symptoms of his disorder, as
                    described by himself, differ totally from Alexander’s, which were those of an
                    ordinary Roman fever. The progress of the pope’s malady may be minutely traced
                    in the diary of Burcardus and the despatches of the Ferrarese envoy. He expired
                    on the evening of 18th August, duly provided with all the needful sacraments of
                    the Church. From his own point of view his life probably appeared fortunate and
                    glorious; but the vicissitude of human affairs is ever dramatically illustrated
                    by the death of a pope. Ere the corpse was cold the pontifical apartments were
                    pillaged by the satellites of Caesar Borgia; at the funeral a brawl between
                    priests and soldiers left it exposed in the body of the church; when placed
                    before the altar, its shocking decomposition confirmed the surmise of poison;
                    finally, stripped of its cerements and wrapped in an old carpet, it was forced,
                    with blows and jeers, into a narrow coffin, and flung into an obscure vault. The
                    remains were subsequently transferred to the Spanish church of St Mary of
                    Montserrat, where they repose at this day.</p>
                <p>Alexander has become a myth, and his “acts” are in some respects almost as
                    legendary as those of the primitive saints and martyrs. The peculiar odium
                    attached to his memory rests partly on the charge of incest, of which he must be
                    acquitted; partly on that of secret poisoning, which is at least not
                    established; partly on the confusion between his actions and Caesar Borgia’s.
                    Nearly everything actually criminal in his pontificate is subsequent to the
                    preponderance of the latter. Profligate alike in public and private life, he was
                    no malignant tyrant,—affable, familiar, easy, he justly took credit for his
                    moderation towards notorious malcontents, and his indifference to personal
                    injuries. These virtues, however, as well as his family affection, were merely
                    constitutional with him,—as the many beneficial acts of his administration were
                    rather prompted by a sense of policy than a sense of duty. His ability as a
                    ruler is evinced by the tranquillity he maintained in Rome, his effectual
                    provision against dearth, the regular discharge of financial obligations, the
                    energetic prosecution of useful public works. As a statesman he ranks high in
                    the second class. He was too destitute of morality to have the least insight
                    into the tendencies of his times; but from the point of view of political
                    expediency, his policy was eminently sagacious and adroit He cannot be accused
                    of preparing the misfortunes of Italy, but he did not disdain to profit by them.
                    His licentiousness and contempt of ecclesiastical decorum are partly palliated
                    by the circumstances of his initiation into the Church. He was untrained to the
                    ecclesiastical profession, never felt himself a priest, and was wholly
                    regardless of the Church’s interest as such. In this respect he is almost unique
                    among the successors of St Peter. Were controversies regulated by reason rather
                    than by convenience, the parties to this would change sides,—Alexander’s
                    accusers would become his advocates, and his advocates his accusers. The Church
                    in her secret heart must rate him the lowest of her chiefs; the world must feel
                    that he deserves much better of it than many much better popes.</p>
                <p>The principal contemporary authority for the reign of Alexander is the diary of
                    the papal master of the ceremonies, Joannes Burcardus, a record replete with
                    trivialities and not exempt from interpolations, but containing indisputable
                    evidence of perfect candour. An excellent edition, commenced in 1855 by the Abbé
                    Gennarelli, was discontinued after the publication of a few parts. The
                    uncritical histories of Gordon and Tomasi are indebted to Burcardus for any
                    value they possess. The paltry productions of modern Roman Catholic apologists
                    (Jorry, Fave, Cerri, &amp;c.) are beneath contempt. The Abbé Ollivier <hi
                    rend="italic">(Alexandre VI.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">les
                    Borgia,</hi> tom. i., Paris, 1870) excites respect by his good faith and
                    amusement by his strange affiance of perverse ingenuity with infantine
                    unsuspiciousness. Of late years the archives of the Italian courts have become
                    accessible, and the transactions of Alexander’s reign have been sagaciously
                    investigated from this source by two German scholars, Von Reumont <hi
                    rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Stadt</hi><hi rend="italic">Rom,</hi>
                    Bd. 3, Abth. 1, Berlin, 1868) and Gregorovius <hi rend="italic">(Rom</hi><hi

                    1870). The latter is the more copious, but his general estimate of Alexander is
                    much too low. By far the ablest English contribution to the history of Alexander

                    born at Siena on. the 13th February 1599, and occupied the papal chair from the
                    7th April 1655 to the 22d May 1667. Before his elevation he had filled
                    successively the offices of inquisitor at Malta, vice-legate at Ferrara, and
                    nuncio to Germany at the conference of Munster. The conclave elected him in the
                    belief that he was strongly opposed to the nepotism and other abuses that had
                    characterised the reign of his immediate predecessor, Innocent X., and at the
                    beginning of his pontificate he went so far in this direction as to forbid his
                    relatives even to visit Rome. In a year, however, all was changed, and nepotism
                    prevailed to as great an extent as under any former pontiff. Alexander was a
                    patron of learning, and himself wrote a volume of Latin poems which appeared at
                    Paris in 1656 under the title <hi rend="italic">Philomathi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Labores</hi><hi rend="italic">Juveniles.</hi> He also encouraged architecture,
                    and in particular constructed the beautiful colonnade in the piazza of St
                    Peter’s. The most noteworthy events of his pontificate were the reception of the
                    ex-queen Christina of Sweden into the Catholic Church, the promulgation of a
                    bull against the Jansenists, and a protracted dispute with Louis XIV. of France,
                    during which the papal see lost possession of Avignon (1662). Alexander
                    canonised Francis of Sales in 1665.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi> VIII. <hi rend="italic">(Pietro
                    Ottoboni),</hi> born at Venice in 1610, was raised to the pontificate in October
                    1689 in succession to Innocent XI. He assisted his native state in its wars with
                    the Turks. Although an enemy of the Jansenists, he condemned certain doctrinal
                    errors of the Jesuits as advanced by Professor Bougot of Dijon. He carried
                    nepotism to such an extent that the salaries and gifts bestowed on his relatives
                    during his reign, short though it was, exhausted the papal treasury. He added
