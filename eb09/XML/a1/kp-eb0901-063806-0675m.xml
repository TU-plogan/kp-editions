                    was a solid base or pedestal on which supplication was made and sacrifice
                    offered to the gods and deified heroes. According to this difference in the
                    service for which they were employed, altars fell into two classes, of which the
                    one, smaller and lower so that the suppliant could kneel upon it, stood inside
                    temples, in front of the sacred image; while the other, destined for burnt
                    sacrifice, was placed in the open air, and, if connected with a temple, in front
                    of the entrance. Possibly altars of the former class were substitutes for, and
                    rendered the same service in historical times as, in an early age, the base of
                    the sacred image within a temple. In this case the altar of Apollo at Delphi, on
                    which Neoptolemus is frequently represented on the Greek vases as taking refuge
                    from Orestes, might be regarded as the pedestal of an invisible image of the
                    god, and as fulfilling the same function as did the base of the actual image of
                    Minerva in Troy, towards which Cassandra fled from Ajax. The other class of
                    altars, called <hi rend="italic">βωμοί</hi> by the Greeks and <hi rend="italic"
                    >altaria</hi> by the Romans, appear to have originated in such temporary
                    constructions as heaps of earth, turf, or stone, made as occasion offered for
                    kindling a fire for sacrifice. The next step was to allow the bones and ashes of
                    the victims sacrificed to accumulate, and upon this to kindle new fires. Altars
                    so raised were viewed with particular sanctity, the most remarkable recorded
                    instances of them being the altars of Juno at Samus and at Olympia (Pausanias,
                    v. 14, 5; V. 15, 6), of Apollo at Thebes (Pausanias, ix. 11, 5), and of Jupiter
                    at Olympia. The last-mentioned stood on a platform (πρόθυσις) measuring 125 feet
                    in circumference, and led up to by steps, the altar itself being 22 feet high.
                    Women were excluded from the platform. Where hecatombs were sacrificed, the <hi
                    rend="italic">πρόθυσιs</hi> necessarily assumed colossal proportions, as in the
                    case of the altar at Parion, where it measured on each side 600 feet. The altar
                    of Apollo at Delos (ό κεράτινος βωμός) was made of the horns of deer believed to
                    have been slain by Diana; while at Miletus was an altar composed of the blood of
                    victims sacrificed. The altar used at the festival in honour of Daedalus on
                    Mount Cithaeron was of wood, and was consumed along with the sacrifice
                    (Pausanias, ix. 3, 2). Others, of bronze, are mentioned; but while these were
                    exceptional, the usual material of an altar was marble, and its form, both among
                    the Greeks and Romans, either square or round; polygonal altars, of which
                    examples still exist, being exceptions. When sculptured decorations were added
                    they frequently took the form of imitations of the actual festoons with which it
                    was usual to ornament altars, or of symbols, such as crania and horns of oxen,
                    referring to the victims sacrificed.</p>
                <p>As a rule, the altars which existed apart from temples bore the name of the
                    person by whom they were dedicated, and the names of the deities in whose
                    service they were; or, if not the name, some obvious representation of the
                    deity. Such is the purpose of the figures of the Muses on an altar to them in
                    the British Museum. An altar was retained for the service of one particular god,
                    except where, through local tradition, two or more deities had become intimately
                    associated, as in the case of the altar at Olympia to Diana and Alpheus jointly,
                    or that of Neptune and Erechtheus in the Erechtheum at Athens, and others. Such
                    deities were styled <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0676-0639"/><hi rend="italic">σvμβωμoι,</hi> each having a
                    separate part of the altar, if we may judge from that at the Amphiareum at
                    Oropos (Pausanias, i. 34, 2). Deities of an inferior order, who were conceived
                    as working together— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the wind gods—had an altar in
                    common. In the same way, the “unknown gods” were regarded as a unit, and had in
                    Athens and at Olympia one altar for all (Pausanias, i. 1, 4; v. 14, 5; Acts of
                    Apostles, xvii. 18). An altar to all the gods is mentioned by Aeschylus (Suppl.
                    v. 225). Among the exceptional classes of altars are also to be mentioned those
                    on which fire could not be kindled (βωμoί <hi rend="italic">aπvρoι),</hi> and
                    those which were kept free from blood <hi rend="italic">(βωμοί αναίμακτοι),</hi>
                    of which in both respects the altar of Zeus Hypatos at Athens was an example.
                    The εστία was a round altar; the ∈σχαρα, one employed apparently for sacrifice
                    to inferior deities or heroes, or on comparatively unimportant occasions, as was
                    also the <hi rend="italic">ara</hi> among the Romans; though <hi rend="italic"
                    >ara</hi> is sometimes used with the same signification as <hi rend="italic"
                    >altare,</hi> and etymologically would have the same meaning if it is correctly
                    derived from άείρω, not from <hi rend="italic">ardere;</hi> while <hi
                    rend="italic">altare</hi> is connected with <hi rend="italic">altus,</hi>
                    “high.”</p>
                <p>Egyptian altars were monoliths, in the form of a truncated cone about four feet
                    in height. Some are extant, made of granite, others of green basalt; in almost
                    every case they bear hieroglyphical inscriptions. In the temple of Jupiter at
                    Babylon there was an altar of massive gold. Assyrian, Egyptian, and Persian
                    altars were either square or oblong.</p>
                <p>The most ancient altars of which any record has been preserved are those
                    mentioned in the Bible. As sacrifice implies an altar, there must have been
                    altars for those of Cain and Abel; but the first which is mentioned is that
                    which Noah after the flood “builded unto Jehovah” (Gen. viii. 20). The three
                    patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are repeatedly said to have built an
                    altar in the different parts of the land of Canaan in which they sojourned; and
                    though it is not stated expressly, yet it may be inferred from there having
                    evidently been a place where Abraham was accustomed to “stand before Jehovah”
                    <hi rend="italic">(ibid.</hi> xix. 27), that, once built, it remained during the
                    whole period of the encampment at the particular place, and was frequently used
                    for the purpose of sacrificing.</p>
                <p>But the most remarkable altar mentioned in the book of Genesis is that which
                    Abraham built for the sacrifice of his son Isaac, from which we glean several
                    particulars relative to the patriarchal worship. The altar was evidently
                    something distinct from the wood by whose fire the sacrifice was to be burnt,
                    for Abraham “built an altar and laid the wood in order,” which he had brought
                    with him from Beersheba, as if he could not count upon finding it at the place.
                    The victim also was bound, laid upon the wood, and there slain. This was
                    contrary to the practice under the Levitical dispensation, when the fire on the
                    top of the altar was kept continually burning, and the animal was killed before
                    being carried up to it; but it is probably alluded to in a verse of the Psalms,
                    which has given much trouble to commentators who have tried to reconcile it with
                    the precepts of the Mosaic law—“Bind the sacrifice with cords unto the horns of
                    the altar” (Ps. cxviii. 27). To this simple patriarchal ritual belong also the
                    rules about the construction of altars given to the Israelites shortly after
                    they left Egypt (Exod. xx. 24-26). While sojourning in that country they do not
                    seem to have offered any sacrifice to Jehovah, till, just as they were leaving
                    it, they were commanded to sacrifice the passover. It is not unlikely that they
                    might have despised the simple altars of their forefathers, and tried to imitate
                    those which they had seen in Egypt, as they so soon copied their late oppressors
                    in a still graver matter, the making a supposed likeness of the Deity. They were
                    therefore ordered to make their altars of earth. Stones might also be used, but
                    they were not to be hewn, nor were the altars to be so high as to require the
                    offerer to go up by steps to arrange the sacrifices upon them.</p>
                <p>The first altar that is mentioned as having been built after these directions
                    were given, was the one for the solemn covenanting sacrifice between God and the
                    Israelites (Ex. xxiv. 4-8). There it is mentioned that Moses “builded an altar
                    under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.”
                    Its being <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the hill may have been a significant
                    protest against the prevalent heathen error of localising the Deity in the sky,
                    and the twelve pillars or rough blocks of stone appear to have been a principal
                    part of the materials used in constructing it. They may be compared with the
                    “twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob,”
                    with which Elijah built his altar on Carmel (1 Kings xviii. 31). We seem to
                    learn from these examples that when an altar was to be constructed for a special
                    occasion, it was fitting that it should bear a symbolism of all in whose name
                    the sacrifice was offered. It is to be observed that this precept about making
                    altars of earth or of unhewn stones was anterior to the Levitical ceremonial,
                    and was superseded by it. After the sin of making the golden calf, the whole
                    ceremonial of the worship of the Israelites was altered. According to the new
                    ritual, two different altars were required, and they were permanent, being
                    carried about in the people’s wanderings, and replaced by others, similar, but
                    larger and more costly, when the ark was placed in the temple on Mount
                    Moriah.</p>
                <p>The first of these altars was that for <hi rend="italic">burnt offerings.</hi>
                    For the tabernacle this was hollow, made of boards of shittim-wood, covered with
                    brass. It was three cubits or about five feet high, and five cubits or eight
                    feet square. It had a horn at each corner, and was carried about by means of
                    staves. The corresponding altar in the temple was of greatly larger dimensions,
                    ten cubits or about 18 feet high, and in the first temple 20 cubits square, and
                    in the second 24 cubits. The tradition of the Jews is, that it was 32 cubits
                    (about 50 feet) square at the base, contracting to 24 at the top, by several
                    ledges round it at different heights. It must therefore have been an immense
                    structure, and though called “an altar of brass,” was probably built of stones,
                    and merely covered with plates of that metal. From the account of the building
                    of the altar in the second temple given in 1 Macc. iv. 45-47, it is probable
                    that it consisted merely of a mass of masonry of the proper form. Ezekiel, in
                    his vision of the temple, gives a description of the altar of burnt-offerings,
                    from which we learn that it was surrounded by several ledges or steps, each a
                    cubit broad. The uppermost of these was two cubits (about 3 feet) below the top
                    of the altar, so that, standing upon it, the priest was able to arrange the
                    sacrifice upon the fire, which was kept always burning, to supply it with fuel,
                    and to remove the ashes. The lower ledges were to enable him to sprinkle the
                    blood on the sides of the altar, which (according to the Levitical ritual) was
                    sometimes to be done on the upper part of the altar, and sometimes on the lower
                    part. The lowest step is said to have had a raised ledge on the outside, by
                    which the blood poured upon it was confined till it ran through a hole into a
                    subterranean pipe.</p>
                <p>One of the most difficult questions about the Levitical altars is their having
                    horns; for these do not seem to have been used in that ritual, yet they are
                    specially ordered to be made, not only in the altar of burnt-offerings, but also
                    in that of incense; and on certain solemn occasions they were sprinkled with
                    blood, as if they were not mere appendages or ornaments of the altar, but had a
                    special significance of their own. From the way they are spoken of in the book
                    of Exodus, we see that they must then have been <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n677/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0677-0640"/> well known, and it might almost be thought that
                    they were retained from the older ritual, according to which they were used to
                    bind the victim that was slain upon the altar.</p>
                <p>The second temple having suffered greatly in the wars between the kings of Syria
                    and Egypt, and been plundered by the Romans, was almost rebuilt by Herod, the
                    restoration occupying forty-six years. The altar of burnt-offering erected then
                    is thus described by Josephus <hi rend="italic">(De Bell. Jud.</hi> V. 5, 6)
                    :—“Before this temple stood the altar, 15 cubits high, and equal both in length
                    and breadth, each of which dimensions was 50 cubits. The figure it was built in
                    was a square: it had corners like horns, and the passage up to it was by an
                    insensible acclivity from the south. It was formed without any iron tool, nor
                    did any iron tool so much as touch it at any time.” A pipe was connected with
                    the south-west horn, through which the blood of the victims was discharged by a
                    subterraneous passage into the brook Kedron. Under the altar was a cavity to
                    receive the drink-offerings. This was covered with a marble slab, and cleansed
                    from time to time. On the north side of the altar several iron rings were fixed
                    to fasten the victims. Lastly, a red line was drawn round the middle of the
                    altar to distinguish between the blood that was to be sprinkled above and below
                    it.</p>
                <p>The second altar belonging to the Jewish worship was <hi rend="italic">the altar
                    of incense,</hi> the golden altar (Ex. xxx. 1). It was placed in the holy place,
                    between the table of shew-bread and the golden candlestick. This altar, in the
                    tabernacle, was made of shittim-wood overlaid with gold plates, 1 cubit in
                    length and breadth, and 2 cubits in height. It had horns of the same materials;
                    and round the flat surface was a border of wrought gold, underneath which were
                    the rings to receive “the staves, made of shittim-wood overlaid with gold, to
                    bear it withal;” (Exod. xxx. 1-5; Joseph. <hi rend="italic">Antiq.</hi> iii. 6,
                    8). The altar in Solomon’s temple was similar in form, but made of cedar
                    overlaid with gold (1 Kings vi. 20). It is a question whether it was hollow or
                    filled up with stones, the construction of the Hebrew being doubtful, but the
                    former supposition appears the more probable. The altar in the second temple was
                    taken away by Antiochus Epiphanes (1 Macc. i. 21), and restored by Judas
                    Maccabaeus (1 Macc. iv. 49). The archangel Gabriel stood at the right side of
                    this altar when he announced the birth of John the Baptist to Zacharias, who was
                    burning incense upon it (Luke i. 11); and it is alluded to in the vision shown
                    to St John (Rev. viii. 3), where it is immediately “before the throne,” the
                    veil, which under the Mosaic dispensation had separated it from the holy of
                    holies, having been rent asunder at the crucifixion.</p>
                <p>On this altar incense was offered twice every day, and this was the only use of
                    incense under the Levitical ritual; for though the word “censer” is repeatedly
                    used in our common translation of the Old Testament, neither in the Hebrew nor
                    the Greek has the word any connection with incense, but denotes the fire-pan in
                    which the burning charcoal was carried from the brazen altar to be emptied out
                    upon that of incense. The true equivalent for censer is only used of sinful or
                    heathen worship (2 Chron. xxvi. 14; Ezek. viii. 11, and perhaps 2 Chron. xxx.
                    14). The firepans used as censers in the story of Korah, and of the atonement
                    subsequently made by Aaron burning incense among the people, do not belong to
                    the Levitical ritual, but were to prove whether it was to be observed or
                    not.</p>
                <p>The single exception to the exclusive use of the golden altar for incense was on
                    the great day of atonement, when the high priest went into the holy of hohes,
                    carrying a fire-pan containing lighted charcoal from the great altar, and having
                    set it down, threw incense upon it, and left it for some time before the ark
                    while he went and came back once and again to sprinkle it with the blood of the
                    sacrifices. This fire-pan is accordingly called a golden censer by the author of
                    the Epistle to the Hebrews (ix. 4); but even this is no precedent for the
                    swinging censers which have been used for so many centuries in the Latin
                    churches. Incense, indeed, was put on the loaves of shew-bread; but it does not
                    appear that it was burned upon that table, which is nowhere called an altar.
                    More probably, when the loaves were taken away, the incense was burnt on the
                    proper altar. But the shew-bread was so completely special an appointment of the
                    Mosaic ritual that it is impossible to class it among sacrifices.</p>
                <p>Among the early Christians, alike in the East and West, that on which the bread
                    and wine were put in the celebration of the Eucharist appears to have been
                    regarded as an altar, and accordingly sacrificial words were used in connection
                    with it, such as “offering,” “unbloody sacrifice.” It should be observed,
                    however, that the Greek fathers scarcely ever apply the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >βωμός</hi> to Christian altars, confining themselves to <hi rend="italic"
                    >θυσιαστήριον</hi>; while in the West there seems to have been a preference for
                    <hi rend="italic">altare</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">ara,</hi> though the
                    latter term is often found. As the Christians generally shrunk from disclosing
                    to the heathen the details of their worship, their enemies used to taunt them
                    with having neither temples nor altars, and some of the apologists admit this;
                    but all they meant by this was that they had no such altars as the heathen had,
                    altars for slain beasts and for the burning of their bodies.</p>
                <p>From the privacy with which the early believers had to meet, their altars at
                    first would naturally be simple and unobtrusive. We have seen that the Levitical
                    altars were four-square, but Christian altars seem to have been always longer
                    than they were broad, and to have been placed “athwart” the length of the
                    basilica or church, so as to present one of the broad sides and both the sacred
                    vessels to the eyes of the great body of the worshippers.</p>
                <p>There does not seem to have been any rule as to the material of which altars
                    might be made. At first they appear to have been mostly of wood, as being easily
                    procured and fashioned. But when the persecutions ceased, and the Christians
                    began to erect churches for worship, there seems to have sprung up some
                    diversity of usage, each province following its own traditional custom, which
                    perhaps was affected in some degree by the nature of the building-stone found
                    there, and the use commonly made of it. It seems that in Egypt and the region
                    afterwards called Barbary the altars were of wood; and there is a tradition that
                    this was also the case originally at Rome. On the other hand, in the latter half
                    of the 4th century, they were made of stone in Asia Minor. Early in the 6th
                    century a council, held at Epaone in Burgundy, ordered that only altars made of
                    stone should be consecrated with the chrism, which shows that wooden altars also
                    were still made in that province. In England the change from wood to stone seems
                    to have taken place about the time of the Norman Conquest, Wulfstan, bishop of
                    Worcester, being mentioned as having introduced it in his diocese. No doctrinal
                    significance can be ascribed to the change, which was simply in keeping with the
                    greater costliness of the whole structure, when the cessation of the inroads of
                    the Scandinavian sea-kings allowed the nations of Western Europe to accumulate
                    wealth, of which a portion was dedicated to religion. A few exceptional
                    instances are mentioned of altars of silver, and they were sometimes even
                    covered in part with plates of gold; but the current set in steadily in favour
                    of stone as the most suitable material, and by degrees the legislation of the
                    Latin church on this point grew more definite. The altar could only be of stone;
                    not that it was necessary that the whole structure should be so, for it was
                    enough if there was a slab <hi rend="italic">of</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n678/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0678-0641"/> stone on the top large enough for the sacred
                    vessels to stand upon; the upper face of the altar must have five crosses
                    incised in the stone; before being used, it must have been consecrated by the
                    bishop with the chrism, according to the ritual prescribed in the pontificals,
                    which by degrees grew more elaborate; and at first a plain cross, and afterwards
                    a crucifix, was placed erect upon it.</p>
                <p>At the Reformation the altars in churches were looked upon as symbols of the old
                    Catholic doctrine, in those countries where the struggle lay between the
                    Catholics and the “Reformed” or Calvinists, who on this point went much further
                    than the Lutherans. In England the name “altar” was retained in the Communion
                    Office in English, printed in 1548, and in the complete English Prayer-book of
                    the following year, known to students as the First Book of Edward. But orders
                    were given soon after that the altars should be destroyed, and replaced by
                    movable wooden tables; while from the revised Prayer-book of 1552 the word
                    “altar” was carefully expunged. The short reign of Mary reversed all this, but
                    the work was resumed on the accession of Elizabeth, and has been carried out so
                    thoroughly that the industry of recent antiquaries has only been able to find
                    about thirty cases in all England where the old stone altar-slabs still exist,
                    and of these that at Arundel is almost the only one which is still used.</p>
                <p>The name “altar” has been all along retained in the Coronation Office of the
                    kings of England, where it Occurs frequently. It was also recognised in the
                    canons of 1640, and an important change was then made in the position of the
                    communion tables, which has become universal throughout the Church of England.
                    In primitive times the position of the Christian altar seems to have been such
                    that, like the Jewish and patriarchal altars, they could be surrounded on all
                    sides by the worshippers. The chair of the bishop or celebrant was on their west
                    side, and the assistant clergy were ranged on each side of him. But in the
                    Middle Ages the altars were placed against the east wall of the churches, or
                    else a screen, called a <hi rend="italic">reredos</hi> (generally much decorated
                    with carving), was erected close to the east of the altar, so as to cut off any
                    one on that side from joining in the worship, and the celebrant was brought
                    round to the west side, to stand between the people and the altar; while there
                    were often curtains on the north and south sides. When tables were substituted
                    for altars in the English churches, these were not merely movable, but at the
                    administration of the Lord’s Supper were actually moved into the body of the
                    church, and placed table-wise as it was called—that is, with the long sides
                    turned to the north and south, and the narrow ends to the east and west—the
                    officiating clergyman standing at the north side. In the time of Archbishop
                    Laud, however, the present practice of the Church of England was introduced. The
                    communion table, though still of wood and movable, is, as a matter of fact,
                    never moved; it is placed altar-wise— that is, with its longer axis running
                    north and south, and close against the east wall, with for the most part a <hi
                    rend="italic">reredos</hi> behind it; it is also fenced in by rails, within
                    which the laity do not enter.</p>
                <p>When, under the superintendence and partly at the charge of the Camden Society,
                    the church of Saint Sepulchre at Cambridge, founded 1101, was restored, a stone
                    altar, consisting of a flat slab resting upon three other upright slabs, was
                    presented to the parish, and set up in the church at the east wall of the
                    chancel. This circumstance was brought before the Court of Arches in 1845, and
                    Sir H. Jenner Fust (<hi rend="italic">Faulkner</hi> v. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lichfield and Steam)</hi> ordered it to be removed, on the ground that a stone
                    structure so weighty that it could not be moved, and seeming to be a mass of
                    solid masonry, was not a communion-table within the meaning of the Church of
                    England. No attempt has been made to obtain a reversal of this judgment; but
                    from other decisions some infer that only such altars as cannot also be
                    considered as tables are forbidden.</p>
                <p>Few particulars have come down to us regarding the construction of the wooden
                    altars used by the Christian Church in early times, except that several
                    circumstances indicate that they were hollow. Gregory of Tours applies the word
                    “arca” or “chest” to them; and in other cases they must have been simply like
                    ordinary tables supported by legs, since we read of persons taking refuge
                    beneath them. There is nothing, therefore, either in the matter or the form of
                    the ordinary English communion-tables, to prevent them serving as altars. The
                    stone altars at first were probably only one or more blocks of rough hewn stone;
                    but by degrees they were ornamented, and this produced two different types.
                    Either the altar remained a solid mass of masonry, but had its front richly
                    panelled (in later times it had figures in bas-relief), or the upper slab was
                    supported by from one to five columns, often of highly-polished stone. It was in
                    the 16th century that a new fashion was introduced in France, according to which
                    the altar was regarded as being itself a tomb or sarcophagus, and to which are
                    due the unsightly altars which now disfigure the wonderfully beautiful mediaeval
                    churches of that country. So complete was the change, that now, perhaps, there
                    are not more ancient altars in France than there are in England.</p>
                <p>In early times, before the altars were placed close to the east wall or to a
                    large <hi rend="italic">reredos,</hi> they were often surmounted by a canopy or
                    baldacchino, supported by four pillars rising from the ground just beyond the
                    corners of the altar.</p>
                <p>At first there was but one altar in a church; but for many centuries this rule
                    has been disregarded in the Latin churches, and almost every large church
                    contains several altars dedicated in honour of different saints, and sometimes
                    appropriated to the use of particular guilds, or endowed for a series of masses
                    for the repose of the founder. These, however, must not be confounded with the
                    principal altar, called the high altar or <hi rend="italic">maître autel,</hi>
                    situated towards the east end of the choir or chancel. A few cases occur where
                    there are two high altars, the second being placed near the west end of the
                    church.</p>
                <p>Altars are “vested” during service; that is, covered with cloths of various
                    kinds. There is often a frontal, richly embroidered, whose colour depends upon
                    the ecclesiastical season or the particular festival; but in all cases the
                    uppermost cloth on the top is of linen, to represent that in which the body of
                    the Lord was wrapped in the sepulchre.</p>
                <p>Since the age of Bede, portable altars have been used in the Latin Church; but
                    the East has never adopted them, and they quite put out of sight the symbolism
                    of the form of an altar. They consist simply of a small slab of stone, large
                    enough to support the chalice and paten. This must bear the incised crosses and
                    must have been consecrated by the bishop. They may be carried about on a journey
                    by a bishop or priest in a heathen or heretical country, as now it is not
                    allowed to say mass except on a duly consecrated altar, and they are also used
                    in oratories attached to private houses.</p>
                <p>Those who wish to investigate the matter further may be referred to the standard
                    works on church ritual and ecclesiastical architecture. For the altars of the
                    Israelites, much information will be found in Lightfoot’s two treatises on the
                    Temple Service, and in Carpzov’s notes to his translation of Godwin’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Moses and Aaron.</hi> Christian altars are described by Bona,
                    Martene, and Bingham; but the standard work on the subject is probably that by
                    the Lutheran Voigt, published after his death by J. A. Fabricius. Nearly twenty
                    years ago an Essay on Christian Altars, by Laib <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n679/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0679-0642"/> and Schwartz, appeared at Rottenburg; while for
                    France, the Abbé Thiers’ Dissertation on the subject is full of curious
                    information, like all his works. Drawings of mediaeval altars which have been
                    preserved will be found in many works on architecture. Parker’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Glossary</hi> gives the most noticeable preserved in England; but
                    the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire</hi><hi rend="italic">de l'Architecture</hi>
                    of Viollet le Duc is much superior, and, with its beautiful illustrations and
                    careful descriptions, has nearly exhausted the subject so far as regards French
                    examples, to which it is almost exclusively confined. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g.
