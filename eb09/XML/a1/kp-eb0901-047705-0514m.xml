                    is a place of great antiquity. After the destruction of Palmyra it speedily
                    became the great emporium of the trade between the Mediterranean and the
                    countries of the East. It was overwhelmed by the flood of Saracen invasion in
                    638; and in 1260, and again in 1401, it was plundered and laid waste by the
                    Tartars. It finally came into the possession of the Turks in 1517. To the east
                    of the modern city extensive remains of its ancient grandeur have been
                    discovered.</p>
                <p>Aleppo is built on eight low hillocks, and is encircled by limestone hills of
                    greater elevation, while beyond these stretches a fertile plain. The river
                    Koeik, the ancient <hi rend="italic">Chalus,</hi> flows through the town, and
                    loses itself in a morass 18 miles distant. It is subject to floods in winter,
                    when it overflows its banks, and inundates the neighbouring gardens. The city is
                    surrounded by a stone wall, 40 feet high and miles in circuit, erected by the
                    Saracens. This wall is flanked by frequent towers, but the ditch is partially
                    choked up; and the city, being commanded by the adjacent heights, is entirely
                    indefensible. The wall is pierced by seven gates, which are known by different
                    names. Outside the city there are large irregular suburbs, erected after the
                    great earthquakes of 1822 and 1830, and increasing the circuit of the place to 7
                    miles. The city suffered very severely by the earthquake of 1822; two-thirds of
                    the inhabitants were swallowed up, the citadel and many of the mosques were
                    overthrown, and a great part of the town was laid in ruins. Before the
                    occurrence of these disasters Aleppo was the fairest and cleanest of Turkish
                    cities; and although it has only partially recovered from their calamitous
                    effects, it has still an attractive appearance, especially when the white
                    minarets of its numerous mosques, and its houses, picturesquely placed on the
                    terraces of the hills, are viewed from a distance. The houses are built of
                    freestone, with flat roofs, and are generally of two or three storeys. One of
                    the mosques, that of Zacharias, is held in peculiar veneration by the Moslem
                    inhabitants. A new citadel has been erected in the N.W. part of the town; and
                    besides many mosques, warehouses, and bazaars, there are several Christian
                    churches and schools, and also Turkish schools, libraries, and hospitals. Aleppo
                    is the seat of a Greek and Armenian patriarch, and of a Maronite bishop. The
                    Mahometan, the Christian, and the Jewish portions of the population dwell in
                    separate quarters of the town. Water is brought to the city by an aqueduct from
                    a distance of 8 miles, and supplies upwards of 200 fountains, massive structures
                    standing in the streets. Among the chief attractions of Aleppo are its gardens,
                    which extend continuously for about 12 miles S.E. of the city. They are watered
                    by the Koeik, and produce abundance of fruit and culinary vegetables; but their
                    most celebrated production is the pistachio-nut, which is regularly
                    cultivated.</p>
                <p>Formerly Aleppo stood in the first rank among the cities of Asia Minor as a place
                    of trade; and it is still the emporium of Northern Syria, and has extensive
                    commercial relations with Diarbekir and the upper parts of Anatolia, and also
                    with Mosul and Baghdad. Large caravans resort to Aleppo from these and other
                    eastern places, and the imported foreign goods are brought by caravans from the
                    ports of Scanderoon or Alexandretta and Latakia. The construction of a
                    carriage-road between Aleppo and Alexandretta has been commenced, but no
                    progress whatever was made with it during 1872. Trade is conducted in Aleppo by
                    more than 100 mercantile houses, several of them British; but no commercial bank
                    has as yet been established in the province. The principal manufacture of the
                    city consists of various kinds of cloth, of silk, cotton, and wool, some
                    flowered and striped, others woven with gold and silver thread. These cloths
                    have long been famous throughout the East, and the manufacture of them employs
                    about 6400 looms. A large amount is invested in the manufacture of carpets,
                    cloaks, and girdles. There are, besides, numerous soap, dyeing, and print works,
                    and also rope-walks. In addition to cloths, the exports include wheat, sesame,
                    wool, cotton, oil, scammony, galls, pistachionuts, camels’ hair, &amp;c.; while
                    the imports chiefly consist of European manufactured goods and colonial produce.
                    The aggregate value of the trade of the province exceeded £1,500,000 in
                    1872.</p>
                <p>The air of Aleppo is dry and piercing, but not insalubrious. The city, however,
                    as well as the environs, is subject to a singular epidemic disorder called the
                    boil of Aleppo. It attacks the inhabitants chiefly in their childhood, and the
                    ulcers, which last for a year, commonly break out on the face. This malady is
                    seldom fatal, and does not leave any hurtful effects except the scars, by which
                    almost all the inhabitants are disfigured. The causes of the disease have not
                    been discovered, though some have supposed it due to the quality of the water.
                    Aleppo is also subject to the ravages of the plague, the recurrence of which is
                    anticipated by the inhabitants every ten years. Its effects are rendered the
                    more deadly by the blind fatalism of the Turks, who cannot be persuaded to take
                    any precautions against the progress of this dreadful disease. In the end of
                    last century about 60,000 of the inhabitants were swept off by one visitation;
                    and that of 1827 was also very severe.</p>
                <p>By the visitations of the plague, the earthquakes, the cholera of 1832, and the
                    oppression of the Egyptians while Syria was subject to Mehemet Ali, the
                    population of Aleppo has been much reduced. In the earlier part of the century
                    the inhabitants numbered over 200,000; but the population is now estimated at
                    less than 100,000, of whom 15,500 are Christians, 4000 Jews, and the remainder
                    mostly Mahometans. Although the Christians enjoy toleration at the hands of the
                    Turkish government, they have nevertheless been exposed to frequent persecution
                    through the jealousy of the turbulent Mahometan population. The tumults of 1850
                    and 1862 occasioned some bloodshed, and could only be suppressed by force of
                    arms. In the former, property to the amount of a million sterling was
                    destroyed.</p>
