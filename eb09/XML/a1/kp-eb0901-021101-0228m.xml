                    distribute the money. The Delphians, incensed at his conduct, accused him of
                    sacrilege, and threw him headlong from a precipice, about 564 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> A pestilence which ensued being attributed to this
                    crime, the people declared their willingness to make compensation for his death;
                    which, in default of a nearer connection, was claimed and received by Iadmon,
                    the grandson of his old master (Plut. <hi rend="italic">de sera Num. Vind.,</hi>
                    p. 556, Herodot. ii. 134). None of Aesop’s works are extant. The popular stories
                    regarding him are derived from a life prefixed to a book of fables purporting to
                    be his, collected by Maximus Planudes, a monk of the 14th century, in which he
                    is represented as a monster of ugliness and deformity, a notion utterly without
                    foundation, and doubtless intended to heighten his wit by the contrast. That
                    this life, however, was in existence a century before Planudes’s time, appears
                    by a manuscript of it found at Florence, and published in 1809. In Plutarch’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Convivium,</hi> where Aesop is a guest, though there are many
                    jests on his original servile condition, there are none on his appearance; and
                    it would seem that the ancients were not usually restrained by delicacy in this
                    point, since the personal defects of Socrates, and his resemblance to old
                    Silenus, afford ample matter for merriment and raillery in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Symposium</hi> of Plato. We are told, besides, that the Athenians erected in
                    honour of Aesop a noble statue by the famous sculptor Lysippus, a circumstance
                    which alone would be sufficient to confute the absurd fiction of his deformity;
                    but more to the point is the statement of Pliny (xxxvi. 12), that he was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Contubernalis</hi> of Rhodopis, his fellow-slave, whose
                    extraordinary beauty passed into a proverb:</p>
                <p>῞A <hi rend="italic">π</hi><hi rend="italic">αv</hi><hi rend="italic">θ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">'</hi><hi rend="italic">ὅ</hi><hi rend="italic">μοια,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">καὶ '</hi> P <hi rend="italic">οδωπιs η κaλή</hi></p>
                <p>The obscurity in which the history of Aesop is involved has induced some to deny
                    his existence altogether; and Giambattista Vico, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scienza Nuova,</hi> chooses rather to consider him as an abstraction, an excess
                    of scepticism which is quite unreasonable. Whether Aesop left any written fables
                    has been more justly disputed, and Bentley inclines to the negative. Thus
                    Aristophanes (<hi rend="italic">Vespoe,</hi> V. 1259) represents Philocleon as
                    learning his fables in conversation, and not from a book; and Socrates essayed
                    to versify such as he remembered (Plat. <hi rend="italic">Phoed.</hi> p. 61).
                    Others, again, are of opinion that a collection had been made of them before the
                    time of Socrates <hi rend="italic">lfMus. Crit.</hi> i. 408). It is, however,
                    certain that fables bearing Aesop’s name were popular at Athens during the most
                    brilliant period of its literary history; though the discrepancies of authors in
                    quoting the same fables seem in favour of Bentley’s hypothesis. (Compare
                    Aristot. <hi rend="italic">De Part. Anim.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n229/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0229-0212"/>
                <p>iii. 2; and Lucian, <hi rend="italic">Nigr.</hi> 32). The original fables were in
                    prose, and were turned into verse by several writers; the first, after the
                    example of Socrates, being Demetrius Phalereus. Next appeared an edition in
                    elegiac verse, often cited by Suidas, but the author’s name is unknown; then
                    Babrius, an excellent Greek poet, turned them into choliambics (i.e. <hi
                    rend="italic">limping</hi> iambics); but of ten books, a few fables only are
                    preserved entire. Of the Latin writers of Aesopean fables, Phaedrus is the most
                    celebrated.</p>

                <p>The fables now extant in prose under Aesop’s name are entirely spurious, as is
                    proved by Bentley in his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the Fables of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aesop,</hi> and have been assigned an oriental origin. The
                    identification of Aesop with the Arabian philosopher and fabulist Lokman (who is
                    made by some traditions the contemporary of the psalmist David) has frequently
                    been attempted; and the Persian accounts of Lokman, which among other things
                    describe him as an ugly black slave, appear to have been blended by the author
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> published by Planudes, with the classical
                    stories respecting Aesop. The similarity of the fables ascribed to each renders
                    it probable that they were derived from the same Indo-Persian source, or from
                    the Chinese, who appear to have possessed such fables in very remote antiquity.
                    A complete collection of the Aesopean fables, 231 in number, was published at
                    Breslau by J. G. Schneider in 1810.</p>
