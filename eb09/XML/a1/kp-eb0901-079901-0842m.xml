                    literal sense the dissection or separation of parts by cutting, but in its usual
                    acceptation it is employed to denote the science the province of which is to
                    determine the construction, the form, and the structure of organised bodies, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of bodies which either are or have been living. It is
                    therefore a department of the science of <hi rend="smallcaps">Biology.</hi> It
                    resolves itself into two great divisions— <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal
                    Anatomy</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Zootomy,</hi> the object of which is to
                    investigate the structure of animals; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Vegetable

                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Botany,</hi> it does not require to be
                    considered here. <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal Anatomy,</hi> again, naturally
                    resolves itself into two divisions: one in which the construction, form, and
                    structure of two or more animals are compared with each other, so as to bring
                    out their features of resemblance or dissimilarity,—this is called <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Comparative Anatomy;</hi> the other, in which the construction,
                    form, and structure of parts in a single animal are considered, which is termed
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Special Anatomy.</hi> The special anatomy of an animal may
                    be studied from various points of view: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> with
                    reference to the succession of forme which it exhibits at various periods from
                    its first appearance as an embryo to the assumption of its adult characters;
                    this is termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Developmental</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    applied the terms <hi rend="smallcaps">General Anatomy, Anatomy op Textures,
                    Histology,</hi> and, from the microscope being so largely employed in the

                    rend="smallcaps">Anatomy.</hi> From its manifold aspects anatomy forms the basis
                    of the Biological Sciences. As a knowledge of the laws of motion is essential,
                    and must be constantly recurred to at every step before any true progress can be
                    made in the investigation of the physical sciences, so must the structure of
                    animal bodies be constantly appealed to by the zoologist in all attempts at
                    classification; by the physiologist in all inquiries into the functions
                    performed by the organs and textures in a state of health, and into the special
                    adaptation of parts to particular uses; and by the physician in considering the
                    alterations or disturbance of the functions of parts in the course of disease.
                    To describe the anatomy of the multitudinous forms of animal life from these
                    different points of view would require, not one, but several voluminous
                    treatises, and would much exceed the compass of a single article. Moreover, it
                    is advisable that the anatomy of the different classes of the animal kingdom
                    should be considered under their respective heads,—e.y., that of the Crabs under
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Crustacea,</hi> that of Reptiles under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Reptilia,</hi><hi rend="italic                     smallcaps"> &amp;c.</hi> It
                    is intended to devote this article more particularly to the description of the
                    Special Anatomy of the Human Body in a state of health; in other words, to make
                    it a short treatise on <hi rend="smallcaps">Human Anatomy</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Anthro-potomy,</hi> which, as forming a department of the
                    general science of Comparative Anatomy, is interesting not only to men of
                    science generally, but, from its intimate connnection with the several divisions
                    of the art of healing, and with the study of the functions of the human body,
                    possesses the highest importance to the physician, surgeon, and
                    physiologist.</p>
                <p>Previous to entering on the consideration of the Anatomy of the Human Body, it
                    may be well to take a historical view of the progress of the science from its
                    origin to the present time.</p>
                <p>HISTORY OF ANATOMY.</p>
                <p>In tracing the history of the origin of anatomy, it may be justly said that more
                    learning than judgment has been displayed. Some writers claim for it the highest
                    antiquity, and pretend to find its first rudiments alternately in the animal
                    sacrifices of the shepherd kings, the Jews, and other ancient nations, and in
                    the art of embalming as practised by the Egyptian *priests, Even the
                    descriptions of wounds in the Iliad have been supposed adequate to prove that in
                    the time of Homer mankind had distinct notions of the structure of the human
                    body. Of the first it may be said that the rude information obtained by the
                    slaughter of animals for sacrifice does not imply profound anatomical knowledge;
                    and those who adduce the second as evidence are deceived by the language of the
                    poet of the Trojan war, which, distinguishing certain parts by their ordinary
                    Greek epithets, as afterwards used by Hippocrates, Galen, and all anatomists,
                    has been rather too easily supposed to prove that the poet had studied
                    systematically the structure of the human frame.</p>
                <p>With not much greater justice has the cultivation of anatomical knowledge been
                    ascribed to Hippocrates, who, because he is universally allowed to be the father
                    of medicine, has also been thought to be the creator of the science of anatomy.
                    Of the seven individuals of the family of the Heracleidae who bore this
                    celebrated name, the second, who was son of Heraclides and Phenarita, and
                    grandson of the first Hippocrates, was indeed distinguished as a <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> physician of great observation and experience, and
                    the first who appreciated the value of studying accurately the phenomena,
                    effects, and terminations of disease. It does not appear, however,
                    notwithstanding the vague and general panegyrics of Riolan, Bartholin, Le Clerc,
                    and Portal, that the anatomical knowledge of this illustrious person was either
                    accurate or profound. Of the works ascribed to Hippocrates, five only are
                    genuine. Most of them were written either by subsequent authors of the same
                    name, or by one or other of the numerous impostors who took advantage of the
                    zealous munificence of the Ptolemies, by fabricating works under that
                    illustrious name. Of the few which are genuine, there is none expressly devoted
                    to anatomy; and of his knowledge on this subject the only proofs are to be found
                    in the exposition of his physiological opinions, and his medical or surgical
                    instructions. From these it appears that Hippocrates had some accurate notions
                    on osteology, but that of the structure of the human body in general his ideas
                    were at once superficial and erroneous. In his book on injuries of the head, and
                    in that on fractures, he shows that he knew the sutures of the cranium and the
                    relative situation of the bones, and that he had some notion of the shape of the
                    bones in general, and of their mutual connections. Of the muscles, of the soft
                    parts in general, and of the internal organs, his ideas are confused,
                    indistinct, and erroneous. The term <hi rend="italic">φλeβ&lt;s</hi> he seems,
                    in imitation of the colloquial Greek, to have used generally <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n843/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0843-0800"/> to signify a blood-vessel, without being aware of
                    the distinction of vein and artery; and the term <hi rend="italic">αρτηρία,</hi>
                    or air-holder, is restricted to the windpipe. He appears to have been unaware of
                    the existence of the nervous chords; and the term <hi rend="italic">nerve</hi>
                    is used by him, as by Grecian authors in general, to signify a <hi rend="italic"
                    >sinew</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tendon.</hi> On other, points his views are so
                    much combined with peculiar physiological doctrines, that it is impossible to
                    assign them the character of anatomical facts; and even the works in which these
                    doctrines are contained are with little probability to be ascribed to the second
                    Hippocrates. If, however, we overlook this difficulty, and admit what is
                    contained in the genuine Hippocratic writings to represent at least the sum of
                    knowledge possessed by Hippocrates and his immediate descendants, we find that
                    he represents the brain as a gland, from which exudes a viscid fluid; that the
                    heart is muscular and of pyramidal shape, and has two ventricles separated by a
                    partition, the fountains of life—and two auricles, receptacles of air; that the
                    lungs consist of five ash-coloured lobes, the substance of which is cellular and
                    spongy, naturally dry, but refreshed by the air; and that the kidneys are
                    glands, but possess an attractive faculty, by virtue of which the moisture of
                    the drink is separated, and descends into the bladder. He distinguishes the
                    bowels into colon and rectum (ô αpχos).</p>
                <p>The knowledge possessed by the second Hippocrates was transmitted in various
                    degrees of purity to the descendants and pupils, chiefly of the family of the
                    Heracleidøe, who succeeded him. Several of these, with feelings of grateful
                    affection, appear to have studied to preserve the written memory of his
                    instructions, and in this manner to. have contributed to form part of that
                    collection of treatises which have long been known to the learned world under
                    the general name of the <hi rend="italic">Hippocratic writings.</hi> Though
                    composed, like the genuine remains of the physician of Cos, in the Ionian
                    dialect, all of them differ from these in being more diffuse in style, more
                    elaborate in form, and in studying to invest their anatomical and medical matter
                    with the fanciful ornaments of the Platonic philosophy. Hippocrates had the
                    merit of early recognising the value of facts apart from opinions, and of those
                    facts especially which lead to general results; and in the few genuine writings
                    which are now extant it is easy to perceive that he has recourse to the simplest
                    language, expresses himself in terms which, though short and pithy, are always
                    precise and perspicuous, and is averse to the introduction of philosophical
                    dogmas. Of the greater part of the writings collected under his name, on the
                    contrary, the general character is verboseness, prolixity, and a great tendency
                    to speculative opinions. For these reasons, as well as for others derived from
                    internal evidence, while the Aphorisms, the Epidemics, and the works above
                    mentioned, bear distinct marks of being the genuine remains of Hippocrates, it
                    is impossible to regard the book <hi rend="italic">πep</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∖</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Φwγlo&lt;s</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ανθρωπον</hi> as entirely the composition of that physician; and it appears
                    more reasonable to view it as the work of some one of the numerous disciples to
                    whom the author had communicated the results of his observation, which they
                    unwisely attempted to combine with the philosophy of the Platonic school and
                    their own mysterious opinions.</p>
                <p>Among those who aimed at this distinction, the most fortunate in the preservation
                    of his name is Polybus, the son-in-law of the physician of Cos. This person, who
                    must not be confounded with the monarch of Corinth immortalised by Sophocles in
                    the tragic story of Oedipus, is represented as a recluse, severed from the world
                    and its enjoyments, and devoting himself to the study of anatomy and physiology,
                    and to the composition of works on these subjects. To him has been ascribed the
                    whole of the book on the <hi rend="italic">Nature of the Child</hi> and most of
                    that <hi rend="italic">On Man;</hi> both physiological treatises interspersed
                    with anatomic^ sketches. His anatomical information, with which wt are specially
                    concerned, appears to have been rude and inaccurate, like that of his preceptor.
                    He represents the large vessels of the body as consisting of four pairs; the
                    first proceeding from the head by the back of the neck and spinal chord to the
                    hips, lower extremities, and outer ankle; the second, consisting of the jugular
                    vessels (αi σφaγiτιδες), proceeding to the loins, thighs, hams, and inner ankle;
                    the third proceeding from the temples by the neck to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scapula</hi> and lungs, and thence by mutual intercrossings to the spleen and
                    left kidney, and the liver and right kidney, and finally to the rectum; and the
                    fourth from the forepart of the neck to the upper extremities, the fore-part of
                    the trunk, and the organs of generation.</p>
                <p>This specimen of the anatomical knowledge of one of the most illustrious of the
                    Hippocratic disciples differs not essentially from that of Syennesis, the
                    physician of Cyprus, and Diogenes, the philosopher of Apollonia, two authors for
                    the preservation of whose opinions we are indebted to Aristotle. They may be
                    admitted as representing the state of anatomical knowledge among the most
                    enlightened men at that time, and they only show how rude and erroneous were
                    their ideas on the structure of the animal body. It may indeed, without
                    injustice, be said that the anatomy of the Hippocratic school is not only
                    erroneous, but fanciful and imaginary, in often substituting mere supposition
                    and assertion for what ought to be matter of fact. From this censure it is
                    impossible to exempt even the name of Plato himself, for whom some notices in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi> on the structure of the animal body, as
                    taught by Hippocrates and Polybus, have procured a place in the history of the
                    science.</p>
                <p>Amidst, the general obscurity in which the early history of anatomy is involved,
                    only two leading facts may be admitted with certainty. The first is, that
                    previous to the time of Aristotle there was no accurate knowledge of anatomy;
                    and the second, that all that was known was derived from the dissection of the
                    lower animals ’ only. By the appearance of Aristotle this species of knowledge,
                    which was hitherto acquired in a desultory and irregular manner, began to be
                    cultivated systematically and with a definite object; and among the services
                    which the philosopher of Stagira rendered to mankind, one of the greatest and
                    most substantial is, that he was the founder of Comparative Anatomy, and was the
                    first to apply its facts to the elucidation of zoology. The works of this ardent
                    and original naturalist show that his zootomical knowledge was extensive and
                    often accurate; and from several of his descriptions it is impossible to doubt
                    that they were derived from frequent personal dissection. Aristotle, who was
                    born 384 years before the Christian era, or in the first year of the 99th
                    Olympiad, was, at the age of 39, requested by Philip to undertake the education
                    of his son Alexander. During this period it is said he composed several works on
                    anatomy, which, however, are now lost. The military expedition of his royal
                    pupil into Asia, by laying open the animal stores of that vast and little known
                    continent, furnished Aristotle with the means of extending his knowledge, not
                    only of the animal tribes, but of their structure, and of communicating more
                    accurate and distinct notions than were yet accessible to the world. A sum of
                    800 talents, and the concurrent aid of numerous intelligent assistants in Greece
                    and Asia, were intended to facilitate his researches in composing a system of
                    zoological knowledge; but it has been observed that the number of instances in
                    which he was thus compelled to trust to the testimony of other observers led him
                    to commit errors in description which personal observation might have enabled
                    him to avoid.</p>

                <p>The first three books of the <hi rend="italic">History of Animals,</hi> a
                    treatise consisting of ten books, and the four books on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parts of Animals,</hi> constitute the great monument of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aristotelian Anatomy.</hi> From these we find that Aristotle was the first who
                    corrected the erroneous statements of Polybus, Syennesis, and Diogenes regarding
                    the bloodvessels, which they made, as we have seen, to arise from the head and
                    brain. These he represents to be two in number, placed before the spinal column,
                    the larger on the right, the smaller on the left, which, he also remarks, is by
                    some called αoriα <hi rend="italic">(αορτή),</hi> the first time we observe that
                    this epithet occurs in the history. Both he represents to arise from the heart,
                    the larger from the largest upper cavity, the smaller or aorta from the middle
                    cavity, but in a different manner and forming a narrower canal. He also
                    distinguishes the thick, firm, and more tendinous structure of the aorta from
                    the thin and membranous structure of vein. In describing the distribution of the
                    latter, however, he confounds the <hi rend="italic">vena cava</hi> and pulmonary
                    artery, and, as might be expected, he confounds the ramifications of the former
                    with those of the arterial tubes in general. While he represents the lung to be
                    liberally supplied with blood, he describes the brain as an organ almost
                    destitute of this fluid. His account of the distribution of the aorta is
                    wonderfully correct. Though he does not notice the coeliac, and remarks that the
                    aorta sends no direct branches to the liver and spleen, he had observed the
                    mesenteric, the renal, and the common iliac arteries. It is nevertheless
                    singular that though he remarks particularly that the renal branches of the
                    aorta go to the substance and not the <hi rend="italic">pelvis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(κοιλία)</hi> of the kidney, he appears to mistake the ureters for
                    branches of the aorta. Of the nerves <hi rend="italic">(νεύρα)</hi> he appears
                    to have the most confused notions. Making them arise from the heart, which he
                    says has nerves (tendons) in its largest cavity, he represents the aorta to be a
                    nervous or tendinous vein <hi rend="italic">(νευρώδης</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >φλεβς).</hi> By and by, afterwards saying that all the articulated bones are
                    connected by <hi rend="italic">nerves,</hi> he makes them the same as
                    ligaments.</p>
                <p>He distinguishes the windpipe or air-holder <hi rend="italic">(αρτηρία)</hi> from
                    the oesophagus, because it is placed before the latter, because food or drink
                    passing into it causes distressing cough and suffocation, and because there is
                    no passage from the lung to the stomach. He knew the situation and use of the
                    epiglottis, seems to have had some indistinct notions of the larynx, represents
                    the windpipe to be necessary to convey air to and from the lungs, and appears to
                    have a tolerable understanding of the structure of the lungs. He repeatedly
                    represents the heart, the shape and site of which he describes accurately, to be
                    the origin of the blood-vessels, in opposition to those who made them descend
                    from the head; yet, though he represents it as full of blood and the source and
                    fountain of that fluid, and even speaks of the blood flowing from the heart to
                    the veins, and thence to every part of the body, he says nothing of the circular
                    motion of the blood. The diaphragm he distinguishes by the name <hi
                    rend="italic">διάζωμα,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">υπόζωμα.</hi> With the liver
                    and spleen, and the whole alimentary canal, he seems well acquainted. The
                    several parts of the quadruple stomach of the ruminating animals are
                    distinguished and named; and he even traces the relations between the teeth and
                    the several forms of stomach, and the length or brevity, the simplicity or
                    complication, of the intestinal tube. Upon the same principle he distinguishes
                    the <hi rend="italic">jejunum (η vηστις),</hi> or the empty portion of the small
                    intestines in animals (το <hi rend="italic">εvτεpov</hi> λεπτόν), the <hi
                    rend="italic">caecum</hi><hi rend="italic">(τυφλόν τι και ογκώδες),</hi> the
                    colon <hi rend="smallcaps">(το</hi><hi rend="italic">κώλον),</hi> and the
                    sigmoid flexure (<hi rend="italic">στεvurτεpov</hi><hi rend="italic">καϊ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">εiλιγμεvov).</hi> The modern epithet of <hi rend="italic"
                    >rectum</hi> is the literal translation of his description of the straight
                    progress <hi rend="italic">(ευθύ)</hi> of the bowel to the anus <hi
                    rend="italic">(ποωκτός).</hi> He knew the nasal cavities and the passage from
                    the tympanal cavity of the ear to the palate, afterwards described by
                    Eustachius. He distinguishes as “partes similares” those structures, such as
                    bone, cartilage, vessels, sinews, blood, lymph, fat, flesh, which, not confined
                    to one locality, but distributed throughout the body generally, we now term the
                    tissues or textures, whilst he applies the term “partes dissimilares” to the
                    regions of the head, neck, trunk, and extremities.</p>
                <p>Next to Aristotle occur the names of Diodes of Carystus, and Praxagoras of Cos,
                    the last of the family of the Asclepiadae. The latter is remarkable for being
                    the first who distinguished the arteries from the veins, and the author of the
                    opinion that the former were air-vessels.</p>
                <p>Hitherto anatomical inquiry was confined to the examination of the bodies of
                    brute animals. We have, indeed, no testimony of the human body being submitted
                    to exam in a-tion previous to the time of Erasistratus and Herophilus; and it is
                    vain to look for authentic facts on this point before the foundation of the
                    Ptolemaic dynasty of sovereigns in Egypt. This event, which, as is generally
                    known, succeeded the death of Alexander, 320 years before the Christian era,
                    collected into one spot the scattered embers of literature and science, which
                    were beginning to languish in Greece under a weak and distracted government and
                    an unsettled state of society. The children of her divided states, whom domestic
                    discord and the uncertainties of war rendered unhappy at home, wandered into
                    Egypt, and found, under the fostering hand of the Alexandrian monarchs, the
                    means of cultivating the sciences, and repaying with interest to the country of
                    Thoth and Osiris the benefits which had been conferred on the infancy of Greece
                    by Thales and Pythagoras. Alexandria became in this manner the repository of all
                    the learning and knowledge of the civilised world; and while other nations were
                    sinking under the effects of internal animosities and mutual dissensions, or
                    ravaging the earth with the evils of war, the Egyptian Greeks kept alive the
                    sacred flame of science, and preserved mankind from relapsing into their
                    original barbarism. These happy effects are to be ascribed in an eminent degree
                    to the enlightened government and liberal opinions of Ptolemy Soter, and his
                    immediate successors Philadelphus and Euergetes. The two latter princes, whose
                    authority was equalled only by the zeal with which they patronised science and
                    its professors, were the first who enabled physicians to dissect the human body,
                    and prevented the prejudices of ignorance and superstition from compromising the
                    welfare of the human race. To this happy circumstance Herophilus and
                    Erasistratus are indebted for the distinction of being known to posterity as the
                    first anatomists who dissected and described the parts of the human body. Both
                    these physicians flourished under Ptolemy Soter, and probably Ptolemy
                    Philadelphus, and were indeed the principal supports of what has been named in
                    medical history the Alexandrian School, to which their reputation seems to have
                    attracted numerous pupils. But though the concurrent testimony of antiquity
                    assigns to these physicians the merit of dissecting the human body, time, which
                    wages endless war with the vanity and ambition of man, has dealt hardly with the
                    monuments of their labours. As the works of neither have been preserved, great
                    uncertainty prevails as to the respective merits of these ancient anatomists;
                    and all that is now known of their anatomical researches is obtained from the
                    occasional notices of Galen, Oribasius, and some other writers. From these it
                    appears that Erasistratus recognised the valves of the heart, and distinguished
                    them by the names of <hi rend="italic">tricuspid</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sigmoid;</hi> that he studied particularly the shape and structure of the
                    brain, and its divisions, and cavities, and membranes, and likened the
                    convolutions to the folds of the jejunum: that he first formed a distinct idea
                    of the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n845/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0845-0802"/> nature of the nerves, which he made issue from
                    the brain; and that he discovered lymphatic vessels in the mesentery, first in
                    brute animals, and afterwards, it is said, in man. He appears also to have
                    distinguished the nerves into those of sensation and those of motion.</p>
                <p>Of Herophilus it’is said that he had extensive anatomical knowledge, acquired by
                    dissecting not only brutes but human bodies. Of these he probably dissected more
                    than any of his predecessors or contemporaries. Devoted to the assiduous
                    cultivation of anatomy, he appears to have studied with particular attention
                    those parts which were least understood. He recognised the nature of the
                    pulmonary artery, which he denominates <hi rend="italic">arterious vein;</hi> he
                    knew the vessels of the mesentery, and showed that they did not go to the <hi
                    rend="italic">vena portae,</hi> but to certain glandular bodies; and he first
                    applied the name of <hi rend="italic">twelve-inch</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >duodenum,</hi><hi rend="italic">(δωδεκαδάκτυλο?)</hi><hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                    that part of the alimentary canal which is next to the stomach. Like
                    Erasistratus, he appears to have studied carefully the configuration of the
                    brain; and though, like him, he distinguishes the nerves into those of sensation
                    and those of voluntary motion, he adds to them the ligaments and tendons. A
                    tolerable description of the liver by this anatomist is preserved in the
                    writings of Galen. He first applied the name of choroid or vascular membrane to
                    that which is found in the cerebral ventricles; he knew the straight venous
                    sinus which still bears his name; and to him the linear furrow at the bottom of
                    the fourth ventricle is indebted for its name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >calamus</hi><hi rend="italic">scriptorius.</hi></p>
                <p>The celebrity of these two great anatomists appears to have thrown into the shade
                    for a long period the names of all other inquirers; for, among their numerous
                    and rather celebrated successors in the Alexandrian school, it is impossible to
                    recognise a name which is entitled to distinction in the history of anatomy. In
                    a chasm so wide it is not uninteresting to find, in one who combined the
                    characters of the greatest orator and philosopher of Home, the most distinct
                    traces of attention to anatomical knowledge. Cicero, in his treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">'De N^atura</hi><hi rend="italic">Deorum,</hi> in a short sketch
                    of physiology, such as it was taught by Aristotle and his disciples, introduces
                    various anatomical notices, from which the classical reader may form some idea
                    of the state of anatomy at that time. The Roman orator appears to have formed a
                    pretty distinct idea of the shape and connections of the windpipe and lungs; and
                    though he informs his readers that he knows the alimentary canal, he omits the
                    details through motives of delicacy, [n imitation of Aristotle, he talks of the
                    blood being conveyed by the veins <hi rend="italic">(venae),</hi> that is,
                    blood-vessels, through the body at large; and, like Praxagoras, of the air
                    inhaled by the lungs being conveyed through the arteries.</p>
                <p>Aretaeus, though chiefly known as a medical author, makes some observations on
                    the lung and the pleura, maintains the glandular structure of the kidney, and
                    describes the anastomosis or communications of the capillary extremities of the
                    <hi rend="italic">vena cava</hi> with those of the portal vein.</p>
                <p>The most valuable depository of the anatomical knowledge of these times is the
                    work of Celsus, one of the most judicious medical authors of antiquity. He left,
                    indeed, no express anatomical treatise; but from the introductions to the 4th
                    and 8th books of his work, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Medicina,</hi> with incidental remarks in the 7th, the modern reader may form
                    very just ideas of his anatomical attainments. From these it appears that Celsus
                    was well acquainted with the windpipe and lungs and the heart; with the
                    difference between the windpipe and oesophagus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(stomachus),</hi> which leads to the stomach <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ventri-cul·us);</hi> and with the shape, situation, and relations of the
                    diaphragm. He enumerates also the principal facts relating to the situation of
                    the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, and the stomach. He appears, however, to
                    have been unaware of the distinction of <hi rend="italic">duodenum</hi> or
                    twelve-inch bowel, already admitted by Herophilus, and represents the stomach as
                    directly connected by means of the <hi rend="italic">pylorus</hi> with the <hi
                    rend="italic">jejunum</hi> or upper part of the small intestine.</p>
                <p>The 7th and 8th books, which are devoted to the consideration of those diseases
                    which are treated by manual operation, contain sundry anatomical notices
                    necessary to explain the nature of the diseases or mode of treatment. Of these,
                    indeed, the merit is unequal; and it is not wonderful that the ignorance of the
                    day prevented Celsus from understanding rightly the mechanism of the pathology
                    of hernia. He appears, however, to have formed a tolerably just idea of the mode
                    of cutting into the urinary bladder; and even his obstetrical instructions show
                    that his knowledge of the uterus, vagina, and appendages was not contemptible.
                    It is in osteology, however, that the information of Celsus is chiefly
                    conspicuous. He enumerates the sutures and several of the holes of the cranium,
                    and describes at great length the superior and inferior maxillary bones and the
                    teeth. With a good deal of care he describes the vertebrae and the ribs, and
                    gives very briefly the situation and shape of the <hi rend="italic">scapula,
                    humerus, radius,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ulna,</hi> and even of the carpal
                    and metacarpal bones, and then of the diffèrent bones of the pelvis and lower
                    extremities. He had formed a just idea of the articular connections, and is
                    desirous to impress the fact that none is formed without cartilage. From his
                    mention of many minute holes <hi rend="italic">(multa et tenuia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">foramina),</hi> in the recess of the nasal cavities, it is evident
                    that he was acquainted with the perforated plate of the ethmoid bone; and from
                    saying that the straight part of the auditory canal becomes flexuous, and
                    terminates in numerous minute cavities <hi rend="italic">(multa et
                    tenuia</hi><hi rend="italic">foramina</hi><hi rend="italic">diducitur),</hi> it
                    is inferred by Portal that he knew the semicircular canals.</p>
                <p>Though the writings of Celsus show that he cultivated anatomical knowledge, it
                    does not appear that the science was much studied by the Romans; and there is
                    reason to believe that, after the decay of the school of Alexandria, it
                    languished in neglect and obscurity. It is at least certain that the appearance
                    of Marinus during the reign of Nero is mentioned by authors as an era remarkable
                    for anatomical inquiry, and that this person is distinguished by Galen as the
                    restorer of a branch of knowledge which had been before him suffered to fall
                    into undeserved neglect. From Galen also we learn that Marinus gave an accurate
                    account of the muscles, that he studied particularly the glands, and that he
                    discovered those of the.mesentery. He fixed the number of nerves at seven; he
                    observed the palatine nerves, which he rated as the fourth pair; and described
                    as the fifth the auditory and facial, which he regards as one pair, and the
                    hypoglossal as the sixth.</p>
                <p>Not long after Marinus appeared Ruffus of Ephesus, a Greek physician, who in the
                    reign of Trajan was much attached to physiology, and as a means of cultivating,
                    this science studied Comparative Anatomy, and made sundry experiments on living
                    animals. Of the anatomical writings of this author there remains only a list or
                    catalogue of names of different regions and parts of the animal body. He
                    appears, however, to' have directed attention particularly to the tortuous
                    course of the uterine vessels, and to have recognised even at this early period
                    the Fallopian tube. He distinguishes the nerves into those of sensation and
                    those of motion. He knew the recurrent nerve. His name is further associated
                    with the ancient experiment of compressing in the situation of the carotid
                    arteries the pneumogastric nerve, and thereby inducing insensibility and loss of
                    voice.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0846-0803"/> so just a claim to the title of anatomist as
                    Claudius Galenus, the celebrated physician of Pergamus, λvho was born about the
                    130th year of the Christian era, and lived under the reigns of Hadrian, the
                    Antonines, Commodus, and Severus. He° was trained by his father Nicon (whose
                    memory he embalms as an eminent mathematician, architect, and astronomer) in all
                    the learning of the day, and initiated particularly into the mysteries of the
                    Aristotelian philosophy. In an order somewhat whimsical he afterwards studied
                    philosophy successively in the schools of the Stoics, the Academics, the
                    Peripatetics, and the Epicureans. When he was seventeen years of age, his
                    father, he informs us, was admonished by a dream to devote his son to the study
                    of medicine; but it was fully two years after that Galen entered on this
                    pursuit, under the auspices of an instructor whose name he has thought proper to
                    conceal. Shortly after he betook himself to the study of anatomy under Satyrus,
                    a pupil of Quintus, and of medicine under Stra-tonicus, a Hippocratic physician,
                    and Aeschrion, an empiric. He had scarcely attained the age of twenty when he
                    had occasion to deplore the loss of the first and most affectionate guide of his
                    studies; and soon after he proceeded to Smyrna to obtain the anatomical
                    instructions of Pelops, who, though mystified by some of the errors of
                    Hippocrates, is commemorated by his pupil as a skilful anatomist. After this he
                    appears to have visited various cities distinguished for philosophical or
                    medical teachers; and, finally, to have gone to Alexandria with the view of
                    cultivating more accurately and intimately the study of anatomy under
                    Heraclianus. Here he remained till his twenty-eighth year, when he regarded
                    himself as possessed of all the knowledge then attainable through the medium of
                    teachers. He now returned to Pergamus to exercise the art which he had so
                    anxiously studied, and received, in his twenty-ninth year, an unequivocal
                    testimony of the confidence which his fellow-citizens reposed in his skill, by
                    being intrusted with the treatment of the wounded gladiators; and in this
                    capacity he is said to have treated wounds with success which were fatal under
                    former treatment. A seditious tumult appears to have caused him to form the
                    resolution of quitting Pergamus and proceeding to Rome, at the age of
                    thirty-two. Here, however, he remained only five years; and returning once more
                    to Pergamus, after travelling for some time, finally settled in Rome as
                    physician to the Emperor Commodus. The anatomical writings ascribed to Galen,
                    which are numerous, are to be viewed not merely as the result of personal
                    research and information, but as the common depository of the anatomical
                    knowledge of the day, and as combining all that he had learnt from the several
                    teachers under whom he successively studied with whatever personal investigation
                    enabled him to acquire. It is on this account not always easy to distinguish
                    what Galen had himself ascertained by personal research from that which was
                    known by other anatomists. This, however, though of moment to the history of
                    Galen as an anatomist, is of little consequence to the science itself; and from
                    the anatomical remains of this author a pretty just idea may be formed both of
                    the progress and of the actual state of the science at that time.</p>
                <p>The osteology of Galen is undoubtedly the most perfect of the departments of the
                    anatomy of the ancients. He names and distinguishes the bones and sutures of the
                    cranium nearly in the same manner as at present. Thus, he notices the
                    quadrilateral shape of the parietal bones; he distinguishes the squamous, the
                    styloid, the mastoid, and the petrous portions of the temporal bones; and he
                    remarks the peculiar situation and shape of the sphenoid bone. Of the ethmoid,
                    which he omits at first, he afterwards speaks more at large in another treatise.
                    The malar he notices under the name of zygomatic <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>
                    bone; and he describes at length the upper maxillary and nasal bones, and the
                    connection of the former with the sphenoid. He gives the first clear account of
                    the number and situation of the vertebrae, wh⅛h he divides into <hi
                    rend="italic">cervical, dorsal,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lumbar,</hi> and
                    distinguishes from the sacrum and coccyx. Under the head <hi rend="italic">Bones
                    of the Thorax,</hi> he enumerates the sternum, the ribs (αi 7rλ∈υpai), and the
                    dorsal vertebrae, the connection of which with the former he designates as a
                    variety of <hi rend="italic">diarthrosis.</hi> The description of the bones of
                    the extremities and their articulations concludes the treatise.</p>
                <p>Though in myology Galen appears to less advantage than in osteology, he
                    nevertheless had carried this part of anatomical knowledge to greater perfection
                    than any of his predecessors. He describes a frontal muscle, the six muscles of
                    the eye, and a seventh proper to animals; a muscle to each <hi rend="italic">ala
                    nasi,</hi> four muscles of the lips, the thin cutaneous muscle of the neck,
                    which he first termed <hi rend="italic">platysma myoides,</hi> or muscular
                    expansion, two muscles of the eyelids, and four pairs of muscles of the lower
                    jaw—the temporal to raise, the masseter to draw to one side, and two depressors,
                    corresponding to the digastric and internal pterygoid muscles. After speaking of
                    the muscles which move the head and the scapula, he adverts to those by which
                    the windpipe is opened and shut, and the intrinsic or proper muscles of the
                    larynx and hyoid bone. Then follow those of the tongue, pharynx, and neck, those
                    of the upper extremities, the trunk, and the lower extremities successively; and
                    in the course of this description he swerves so little from the actual facts
                    that most of the names by which he distinguishes the principal muscles have been
                    retained by the best modern anatomists. It is chiefly in the minute account of
                    these organs, and especially in reference to the minuter muscles, that he
                    appears inferior to the moderns.</p>
                <p>The angiological knowledge of Galen, though vitiated by the erroneous physiology
                    of the times and ignorance of the separate uses of the arteries and veins,
                    exhibits, nevertheless, some accurate facts which show the diligence of the
                    author in dissection. Though, in opposition to the opinions of Praxagoras and
                    Erasistratus, he proved that the arteries in the living animal contain not air
                    but blood, it does not appear to have occurred to him to determine in what
                    direction the blood flows, or whether it was movable or stationary. Representing
                    the left ventricle of the heart as the common origin of all the arteries, though
                    he is misled by the pulmonary artery, he nevertheless traces the distribution of
                    the branches of the aorta with some accuracy. The <hi rend="italic">vena
                    azygos</hi> also, and the jugular veins, have contributed to add to the
                    confusion of his description, and to render his angiology the most imperfect of
                    his works.</p>
                <p>In neurology we find him to be the author of the dogma that the brain is the
                    origin of the nerves of sensation, and the spinal chord of those of motion; and
                    he distinguishes the former from the latter by their greater softness or less
                    consistence. Though he admits only seven cerebral pairs, he has the merit of
                    distinguishing and tracing the distribution of the greater part of both classes
                    of nerves with great accuracy. His description of the brain is derived from
                    dissection of the lower animals, and his distinctions of the several parts of
                    the organ have been retained by modem anatomists. His mode of demonstrating this
                    organ, which indeed is clearly described, consists of five different steps. In
                    the first the bisecting membrane— <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the falx (∕riyvιγ^
                    διχοτομούσα)—and the connecting blood-vessels are removed; and the dissector,
                    commencing at the anterior extremity of the great fissure, separates the
                    hemispheres gently as far as the <hi rend="italic">torcular,</hi> and exposes a
                    smooth surface (τ⅛v χώραν τυλώδη πως oυσαv), the mesolobe of the moderns, or the
                    middle band. In the second he exposes by successive sections the ventricles, the
                    choroid plexus, and the middle partition.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n847/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0847-0804"/>
                <p>The third exhibits the pineal body (σώμα κωvoeιδ∈s) or conarium, concealed by a
                    membrane with numerous veins, meaning that part of the plexus which is now known
                    by the name of <hi rend="italic">velum</hi><hi rend="italic">interpositum,</hi>
                    and a complete view of the ventricles. The fourth unfolds the third ventricle
                    (τiς <hi rend="italic">aXkη</hi><hi rend="italic">τρίτη κοιλία),</hi> the
                    communication between the two lateral ones, the arch-like body (σώμα
                    t∕&lt;αλιδoαδ∈s) <hi rend="italic">fornix,</hi> and the passage from the third
                    to the fourth ventricle. In the fifth he gives an accurate description of the
                    relations of the third and fourth ventricle, of the situation of the two pairs
                    of eminences, <hi rend="italic">nates</hi> (γλoυτd) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >testes</hi><hi rend="italic">(8iδvμia</hi> or δpχαs), the scolecoid or
                    worm-like process, anterior and posterior, and lastly the linear furrow, called
                    by Herophilus <hi rend="italic">calamus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >scriptorius.</hi></p>
                <p>In the account of the thoracic organs equal accuracy may be recognised. He
                    distinguishes the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> by the name of inclosing
                    membrane <hi rend="italic">(fμηv υπεζωκως,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">succingens),</hi> and remarks its similitude in
                    structure to that of the peritoneum, and the covering which it affords to all
                    the organs. The pericardium also he describes as a membranous sac with a
                    circular basis corresponding to the base of the heart, and a conical apex; and
                    after an account of the tunics of the arteries and veins, he speaks shortly of
                    the lung, and more at length of the heart, which, however, he takes some pains
                    to prove not to be muscular, because it is harder, its fibres are differently
                    arranged, and its action is incessant, whereas that of muscle alternates with
                    the state of rest; he gives a good account of the valves and of the vessels; and
                    notices especially the bony ring formed in the heart of the horse, elephant, and
                    other large animals.</p>
                <p>The description of the abdominal organs, and of the kidneys and urinary
                    apparatus, is still more minute, and in general accurate. Our limits, however,
                    do not permit us to give any abstract of them; and it is sufficient in general
                    to say that Galen gives correct views of the arrangement of the peritoneum and
                    omentum, and distinguishes accurately the several divisions of the alimentary
                    canal and its component tissues. In the liver, which he allows to receive an
                    envelope from the peritoneum, he admits, in imitation of Erasistratus, a proper
                    substance or <hi rend="italic">parenchyma,</hi> interposed between the vessels,
                    and capable of removal by suitable dissection. His description of the organs of
                    generation is rather brief, and is, like most of his anatomical sketches, too
                    much blended with physiological dogmas.</p>
                <p>This short sketch may communicate some idea of the condition of anatomical
                    knowledge in the days of Galen, who indeed is justly entitled to the character
                    of rectifying and digesting, if not of creating, the science of anatomy among
                    the ancients. Though evidently confined, perhaps entirely by the circumstances
                    of the times, to the dissection of brute animals, so indefatigable and judicious
                    was he in the mode of acquiring knowledge, that many of his names and
                    distinctions are still retained with advantage in the writings of the moderns.
                    Galen was a practical anatomist, and not only describes the organs of the animal
                    body from actual dissection, but gives ample instructions for the proper mode of
                    exposition. His language is in general clear, his style as correct as in most of
                    the authors of the same period, and his manner is animated. Few passages in
                    early science are indeed so interesting as the description of the process for
                    demonstrating the brain and other internal organs which is given by this patient
                    and enthusiastic observer of nature. To some it may appear absurd to speak of
                    anything like good,anatomical description in an author who writes in the Greek
                    language, or anything like an ,interesting and correct manner in a writer who
                    flourished at à period when taste was depraved or extinct and literature
                    corrupted,—when the philosophy of Antoninus and the mild virtues of Aurelius
                    could do little to soften the iron sway of Lucius Verus and Com-modus; but the
                    habit of faithful observation in Galen seeme to have been so powerful that, in
                    the description of material objects, his genius invariably rises above the
                    circumstances of his age. Though not so directly connected with this subject, it
                    is nevertheless proper to mention that he appears to have been the first
                    anatomist who can be said, on authentic grounds, to have attempted to discover
                    the uses of organs by vivisection and experiments on living animals. In this
                    manner he ascertained the position and demonstrated the action of the heart; and
                    he mentions two instances in which, in consequence of disease or injury, he had
                    an opportunity of observing the motions of this organ in the human body. In
                    short, without eulogising an ancient author at the expense of critical justice,
                    or commending his anatomical descriptions as superior to those of the moderns,
                    it must be admitted that the anatomical writings of the physician of Pergamus
                    form a remarkable era in the history of the science; and that by diligence in
                    dissection and accuracy in description he gave the = science a degree of
                    importance and stability which it has retained through the lapse of many
                    centuries.</p>
                <p>The death of Galen, which took place at Pergamus in the ninetieth year of his age
                    and the 193d of the Christian era, may be regarded as the downfall of anatomy in
                    ancient times. After this period we recognise only two names of any celebrity in
                    the history of the science—those of Soranus and Oribasius, with the more obscure
                    ones of Meletius and Theophilus, the latter the chief of the imperial guard of
                    Heraclius.</p>
                <p>Soranus, who was an Ephesian, and flourished under the emperors Trajan and
                    Hadrian, distinguished himself by his researches on the female organs of
                    generation. He appears to have dissected the human subject; and this perhaps is
                    one reason why his descriptions of these parts are more copious and more
                    accurate than those of Galen, who derived his knowledge from the bodies of the
                    lower animals. He denies the existence of the hymen, but describes accurately
                    the clitoris. Soranus the anatomist must be distinguished from the physician of
                    that name, who was also a native of Ephesus.</p>
                <p>Oribasius, who was born at Pergamus, is said to have been at once the friend and
                    physician of the Emperor Julian, and to have contributed to the elevation of
                    that apostate to the imperial throne. For this he appears to have suffered the
                    punishment of a temporary exile under Valens and Valentinian; but was soon
                    recalled, and lived in great honour till the period of his death. By Le Clerc,
                    Oribasius is regarded as a compiler; and indeed his anatomical writings bear so
                    close a correspondence with those of Galen that the character is not altogether
                    groundless. In various points, nevertheless, he has rendered the Galenian
                    anatomy more accurate; and he has distinguished himself by a good account of the
                    salivary glands, which were overlooked by Galen.</p>
                <p>To the same period generally is referred the Anatomical Introduction of an
                    anonymous author, first published in 1618 by Lauremberg, and more recently by
                    Bernard. It is to be regarded as a compilation formed on the model of Galen and
                    Oribasius. The same character is applicable to the treatises of Meletius and
                    Theophilus.</p>
                <p>The decline indicated by these languid efforts soon sunk into a state of total
                    inactivity; and the unsettled state of society during the latter ages of the
                    Roman empire was extremely unfavourable, to the successful cultivation of
                    science. The sanguinary conflicts in which the southern countries of Europe were
                    repeatedly engaged with their northern neighbours, between the second and eighth
                    centuries, tended gradually to estrange their minds from scientific pursuits:
                    and the hordes of barbarians by which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n848/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0848-0805"/> the Roman empire was latterly overrun, while they
                    urged them to the necessity of making hostile resistance, and adopting means of
                    self-defence, introduced such habits of ignorance and barbarism, that science
                    was almost universally forgotten. While the art of healing was professed only by
                    some few ecclesiastics or by itinerant practitioners, anatomy was utterly
                    neglected; and no name of anatomical celebrity 0ccur3 to diversify the long and
                    uninteresting period commonly distinguished as the Dark Ages.</p>
                <p>Anatomical learning, thus neglected by'European nations, is believed to have
                    received a temporary cultivation from the Asiatics. Of these, several nomadic
                    tribes, known to Europeans under the general denomination of Arabs and Saracens,
                    had gradually coalesced under various leaders; and by their habits of endurance,
                    as well as of enthusiastic valour in successive expeditions against the eastern
                    division of the Roman empire, had acquired such military reputation as to render
                    them formidable wherever they appeared. After a century and a half of foreign
                    warfare or internal animosity, under the successive dynasties of the Ommiads and
                    Abbassides, in which the propagation of Islamism was the pretext for the.
                    extinction of learning and civilisation, and the most remorseless system of
                    rapine and destruction, the Saracens began, under the latter dynasty of princes,
                    to recognise the value of science, and especially of that which prolongs life,
                    heals disease, and alleviates the pain of wounds and injuries. The caliph
                    Almansor combined with his official knowledge of Moslem law the successful
                    cultivation of astronomy; but to his grandson Almamun, the seventh prince of the
                    line of the Abbassides, belongs the merit of undertaking to render his subjects
                    philosophers and physicians. By the directions of this prince the works of the
                    Greek and Roman authors were translated into Arabic; and the favour and
                    munificence with which literature and its professors were patronised speedily
                    raised a succession of learned Arabians. The residue of the rival family of the
                    Ommiads, already settled in Spain, was prompted by motives of rivalry or
                    honourable ambition to adopt the same course; and while the academy, hospitals,
                    and library of Baghdad bore testimony to the zeal and liberality of the
                    Abbassides, the munificence of the Ommiades was not less conspicuous in the
                    literary institutions of Cordova, Seville, and Toledo.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the efforts of the Arabian princes, however, and the diligence of
                    the Arabian physicians, little was done for anatomy, and the science made no
                    substantial acquisition. The Koran denounces as unclean the person who touches a
                    corpse; the rules of Islamism forbid dissection; and whatever their instructors
                    taught was borrowed from the Greeks. Abu-Bekr Al-Rasi, Abu-Ali Ibn-Sina,
                    Abul-Cassem, and Abu-Walid Ibn-Roshd, the Rhazès, Avicenna, Abulcasis, and
                    Averrhoes of European authors, are their most celebrated names in medicine; yet
                    to none of these can the historian with justice ascribe any anatomical merit.
                    Al-Rasi has indeed left descriptions of the eye, of the ear and its <hi
                    rend="italic">meatus,</hi> and of the heart; and Ibn-Sina, Abul-Cassem, and
                    Ibn-Roshd give anatomical descriptions of the parts of the human body. But of
                    these the general character is, that they are copies from Galen, sometimes not
                    very just, and in all instances mystified with a large proportion of the
                    fanciful and absurd imagery and inflated style of the Arabian writers. The chief
                    reason of their obtaining a place in anatomical history is, that by the
                    influence which their medical authority enabled them to exercise in the European
                    schools, the nomenclature which they employed was adopted by European
                    anatomists, and continued till the revival of ancient learning restored the
                    original nomenclature of the Greek physicians. Thus, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cervix,</hi> or nape of the neck, is <hi rend="italic">nucha;</hi> the
                    oesophagus is <hi rend="italic">meri;</hi> the umbilical region is <hi
                    rend="italic">sumen</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sumac;</hi> the abdomen is <hi
                    rend="italic">rnyrach;</hi> the peritoneum is <hi rend="italic">siphac;</hi> and
                    the omentum, <hi rend="italic">zirbus.</hi></p>
                <p>From the general character now given justice requires that we except Abdallatif,
                    the annalist of Egyptian affairs. This author, who maintains that it is
                    impossible to learn anatomy from books, and that the authority of Galen must
                    yield to personal inspection, informs us that the Moslem doctors did not neglect
                    opportunities of studying the bones of the human body imcemeteries; and that he
                    himself, by once examining a collection of bones in this manner, ascertained
                    that the lower jaw is formed of one piece; that the sacrum, though sometimes
                    composed of several, is most generally of one; and that Galen is mistaken when
                    he asserts that these bones are not single.</p>
                <p>The era of Saracen learning extends to the 13th century; and after this we begin
                    to approach happier times. The university of Bologna, which, as a school of
                    literature and law, was already celebrated in the twelfth century, became, in
                    the course of the following one, not less distinguished for its medical
                    teachers. Though the misgovernment of the municipal rulers of Bologna had
                    disgusted both teachers and students, and given rise to the foundation of
                    similar institutions in Padua and Naples,—and though the school of Salerno, in
                    the territory of the latter, was still in high repute,—it appears, from the
                    testimony of Sarti, that medicine was in the highest esteem in Bologna, and that
                    it was in such perfection as to require a division of its professors into
                    physicians, surgeons, physicians for wounds, barber-surgeons, oculists, and even
                    some others. Notwithstanding these indications of refinement, however, anatomy
                    was manifestly cultivated rather as an appendage of surgery than a branch of
                    medical science; and, according to the testimony of Guy de Chauliac, the
                    cultivation of anatomical knowledge was confined to Roger, Roland, Jamerio,
                    Bruno, and Lanfranc; and this they borrowed chiefly from Galen.</p>
                <p>In this state matters appear to have proceeded with the medical school of Bologna
                    till the commencement of the fourteenth century, when the circumstance of
                    possessing a teacher of originality enabled this university to be the agent of
                    as great an improvement in medical science as she had already effected in
                    jurisprudence. This era, indeed, is distinguished for the appearance of Mondino,
                    under whose zealous cultivation the science first began to rise from the ashes
                    in which it had been buried. This father of modern anatomy, who taught in
                    Bologna about the year 1315, quickly drew the curiosity of the medical
                    profession by well-ordered demonstrations of the different parts of the human
                    body. In 1315 he dissected and demonstrated the parts of the human body in two
                    female subjects; and in the course of the following year he accomplished the
                    same task on the person of a single female. But while he seems to have had
                    sufficient original force of intellect to direct his own route, Riolan accuses
                    him of copying Galen; and it is certain that his descriptions are corrupted by
                    the barbarous leaven of the Arabian schools, and his Latin defaced by the exotic
                    nomenclature of Ibn-Sina and AÎ-Rasi. He died, according to Tiraboschi, in
                    1325.</p>
                <p>Mondino divides the body into three cavities <hi rend="italic">(ventres),</hi>
                    the upper containing the animal members, as the head, the lower containing the
                    natural members, and the middle containing the spiritual members. He first
                    describes the anatomy of the lower cavity or the abdomen, then proceeds to the
                    middle or thoracic organs, and concludes with the upper, comprising the head and
                    its contents and appendages. His general manner is to notice shortly the
                    situation and shape or distribution of textures or membranes, and then to
                    mention the disorders to which they are subject. The peritoneum he describes
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">siphac,</hi> in imitation of the Arabians,
                    the omentum under that of <hi rend="italic">zirbus,</hi> and the mesentery or
                    <hi rend="italic">eucharus</hi> as distinct from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n849/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0849-0806"/> both. In speaking of the intestines he treats
                    first of the rectum, then the colon, the left or sigmoid flexure of which, as
                    well as the transverse arch and its connection with the stomach, he particularly
                    remarks; then the caecum or <hi rend="italic">monoculus,</hi> after this the
                    small intestines in general under the heads of ileum and jejunum, and latterly
                    the duodenum, making in all six bowels. The liver and its vessels are minutely,
                    if not accurately, examined; and the <hi rend="italic">cava,</hi> under the name
                    <hi rend="italic">chilis,</hi> a corruption from the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >κοίλη,</hi> is treated at length, with the emulgents and kidneys. His anatomy
                    of the heart is wonderfully accurate; and it is a remarkable fact, which seems
                    to be omitted by all subsequent authors, that his description contains the
                    rudiments of the circulation of the blood. “Postea vero versus pulmonem est
                    aliud orificium venae arterialis, quae <hi rend="italic">portat</hi> sanguinem
                    ad pulmonem a corde; quia cum pulmo deserviat cordi secundum modum dictum, ut ei
                    recompenset, cor ei <hi rend="italic">transmittit</hi> sanguinem per hanc venam,
                    quae vocatur vena arterialis; est vena, quia portat sanguinem, et arterialis,
                    quia habet duas tunicas; et habet duas tunicas, primo quia vadit ad membrum quod
                    existit in continuo motu, et secundo quia portat sanguinem valde subtilem et
                    choleri-cum.” The merit of these distinctions, however, he afterwards destroys
                    by repeating the old assertion that the left ventricle ought to contain spirit
                    or air, which it generates from the blood. His osteology of the skull is
                    erroneous. In his account of the cerebral membranes, though short, he notices
                    the principal characters of the <hi rend="italic">dura mater.</hi> He describes
                    shortly the lateral ventricles, with their anterior and posterior <hi
                    rend="italic">cornua,</hi> and the choroid plexus as a blood-red substance like
                    a long worm. He then speaks of the third or middle ventricle, and one posterior,
                    which seems to correspond with the fourth; and describes the infundibulum under
                    the names of <hi rend="italic">lacuna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">emboton.</hi>
                    In the base of the organ he remarks, first, two mammillary caruncles, the optic
                    nerves, which he reckons the first pair; the oculo-muscular, which he accounts
                    the second; the third, which appears to be the sixth of the modems; the fourth;
                    the fifth, evidently the seventh; a sixth, the <hi rend="italic">nervus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vagus;</hi> and a seventh, which is the ninth of the moderns.
                    Notwithstanding the misrepresentations into which this early anatomist was
                    betrayed, his book is valuable, and has been illustrated by the successive
                    commentaries of Achillini, Berenger, and Dryander.</p>
                <p>Matthew de Gradibus, a native of Gradi, a town in Friuli, near Milan,
                    distinguished himself by composing a series of treatises on the anatomy of
                    various parts of the human body. He is the first who represents the ovaries of
                    the female in the correct light in which they were subsequently regarded by
                    Steno.</p>
                <p>Objections similar to those already urged in speaking of Mondino apply to another
                    eminent anatomist of those times. Gabriel de Zerbis, who flourished at Verona
                    towards the conclusion of the 15th century, is celebrated as the author of a
                    system in which he is obviously more ,anxious to astonish his readers by the
                    wonders of a verbose ',and complicated style than to instruct by precise and
                    faithful ^description. In the vanity of his heart he assumed the;title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Medicus</hi><hi rend="italic">Theoricus;</hi> but though, like
                    Mondino, he ^derived his information from the dissection of the human <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi> subject, he is not entitled to the merit either of
                    describing truly or of adding to the knowledge previously acquired. He is
                    superior to Mondino, however, in knowing the olfactory nerves.</p>
                <p>Eminent in the history of the science, and more distinguished than any of this
                    age in the history of cerebral anatomy, Alexander Achillini of Bologna, the
                    pupil and commentator of Mondino, appeared at the close of the 15th century.
                    Though a follower of the Arabian school, the assiduity with which he cultivated
                    anatomy has rescued his name from the inglorious obscurity in which the Arabian
                    doctors have in general slumbered. He is known in the history of anatomical
                    discovery as the first who described the two tympanal bones, termed <hi
                    rend="italic">malleus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">incus.</hi> In 1503 he showed
                    that the tarsus consists of seven bones; he rediscovered the fornix and the
                    infundibulum; and he was fortunate enough to observe the course of the cerebral
                    cavities into the inferior <hi rend="italic">cornua,</hi> and to remark
                    peculiarities to which the anatomists of a future age did not advert. He
                    mentions the orifices of the ducts, afterwards described by Wharton. He knew the
                    ileo-caecal valve; and his description of the duodenum, ileum, and colon shows
                    that he was better acquainted -with the site and disposition of these bowels
                    than any of his predecessors or contemporaries.</p>
                <p>Not long after, the science boasts of one of its most distinguished founders.
                    James Berenger of Carpi, in the Modenese territory, flourished at Bologna at the
                    beginning of the 16th century. In the annals of medicine his name will be
                    remembered not only as the most zealous and eminent in cultivating the anatomy
                    of the human body, but as the first physician who was fortunate enough to calm
                    the alarms of Europe, suffering under the ravages of syphilis, then raging with
                    uncontrollable virulence. In the former character he surpassed both predecessors
                    and contemporaries; and it was long before the anatomists of the following age
                    could boast of equalling him. His assiduity was indefatigable; and he declares
                    that he dissected above one hundred human bodies. He is the author of a
                    compendium, of several treatises which he names Introductions <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Isagogce),</hi> and of commentaries or. the treatise of Mondino, in which he
                    not only rectifies the mistakes of that anatomist, but gives minute and in
                    general accurate anatomical descriptions.</p>
                <p>He is the first who undertakes a systematic view of the several textures of which
                    the human body ⅛ composed; and in a preliminary commentary he treats
                    successively of the anatomical characters and properties of fat, of membrane in
                    general <hi rend="italic">(panniculum),</hi> of flesh, of nerve, of <hi
                    rend="italic">villus</hi> or fibre (‰τn), of ligament, of sinew or tendon, and
                    of muscle in general. He then proceeds to describe with considerable precision
                    the muscles of the abdomen, and illustrates their site and connections by
                    woodcuts, which, though rude, are spirited, and show that anatomical drawing was
                    in that early age beginning to be understood. In his account of the peritoneum
                    he admits only the intestinal division of that membrane, and is at some pains to
                    prove that Gentilis, who justly admits the muscular division also, is in error.
                    In his account of the intestines he is the first who mentions Jhe vermiform
                    process of the caecum; he remarks the yellow tint communicated to the duodenum
                    by the gall-bladder; and he recognises the opening of the common biliary duct
                    into the duodenum <hi rend="italic">(quidam</hi><hi rend="italic">porus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">portans choleram).</hi> In the account of the stomach he describes
                    the several tissues of which that organ is composed, and which, after Alman-sor,
                    he represents to be three, and a fourth from the peritoneum; and afterwards
                    notices the <hi rend="italic">rugae</hi> of its villous surface. He is at
                    considerable pains to explain the organs of generation in both sexes, and gives
                    a long account of the anatomy of the foetus. He was the first who recognised the
                    larger proportional size of the chest in the male than in the female, and
                    conversely the greater capacity of the female than of the male pelvis. In the
                    larynx he discovered the two arytenoid cartilages. He gives the first good
                    description of the thymus; distinguishes the oblique situation of the heart;
                    describes the pericardium, and maintains the uniform presence of pericardial
                    liquor. He then describes the cavities of the heart; but perplexes himself, as
                    did all the anatomists of that age, about the spirit supposed to be contained.

                    himself with the <hi rend="italic">arteria venalis,</hi> the pulmonary vein, and

                    of the ventricles, remarks the <hi rend="italic">corpus striatum,</hi> and has
                    the sagacity to perceive that the choroid plexus consists of veins and arteries;
                    he then describes the middle or third ventricle, the infundibulum or <hi
                    rend="italic">lacuna</hi> of Mondino, and the pituitary gland; and lastly, the
                    passage to the fourth ventricle, the <hi rend="italic">conarium</hi> or pineal
                    gland, and the fourth or posterior ventricle itself, the relations of which he
                    had studied accurately. He rectifies the mistake of Mondino as to the olfactory
                    or first pair of nerves, gives a good account of the optic and others, and is
                    entitled to the praise of originality in being the first observer who
                    contradicts the fiction of the wonderful net, and indicates the principal
                    divisions of the carotid arteries. He enumerates the tunics and humours of the
                    eye, and gives an account of the internal ear, in which,he notices the <hi

                <p>Italy long retained the distinction of giving birth to the first eminent
                    anatomists in Europe, and the glory she acquired in the names of Mondino,
                    Achillini, Carpi, and Massa, was destined to become more conspicuous in the
                    labours of Columbus, Fallopius, and Eustachius. While Italy, however, was thus
                    advancing the progress of science, the other nations of Europe were either in
                    profound ignorance or in the most supine indifference to the brilliant career of
                    their zealous neighbours. The sixteenth century had commenced before France
                    began to acquire anatomical distinction in the names of Dubois, Fernel, and
                    Etienne; and even these celebrated teachers were less solicitous in the personal
                    study of the animal body than in the faithful explanation of the anatomical
                    writings of Galen. The infancy of the French school had to contend with other
                    difficulties. The small portion of knowledge which had been hitherto diffused in
                    the country was so inadequate to eradicate the prejudices of ignorance, that it
                    was either difficult or absolutely impossible to procure human bodies for the
                    purposes of science; and we are assured, on the testimony of Vesalius and other
                    competent authorities, that the practical part of anatomical instruction was
                    obtained entirely from the bodies of the lower animals. The works of the Italian
                    anatomists were unknown; and it is a proof of the tardy communication of
                    knowledge that, while the structure of the human body had been taught in Italy
                    for more than a century by Mondino and his followers, these anatomists are never
                    mentioned by Etienne, who flourished long after.</p>
                <p>Such was the aspect of the times at the appearance of Jacques Dubois, who, under
                    the Romanised name of Jacobus Sylvius, according to the fashion of the day, has
                    been fortunate in acquiring a reputation to which his researches do not entitle
                    him. For the name of Jacques Dubois the history of anatomy, it is said, is
                    indebted to his inordinate love of money. At the instance of his brother
                    Francis, who was professor of eloquence in the college of Tournay at Paris, he
                    devoted himself to the study of the learned languages and mathematics; but
                    discovering that these elegant accomplishments do not invariably reward their
                    cultivators with the goods of fortune, Dubois betook himself to medicine. After
                    the acquisition of a medical degree in the university of Montpellier, at the
                    ripe age of fifty-one Dubois returned to Paris to resume a course of anatomical
                    instruction. Here he taught anatomy to a numerous audience in the college of
                    Trinquet; and on the departure of Vidus Vidius for Italy was appointed to
                    succeed that physician as professor of surgery to the Royal College. His
                    character .is easily estimated. With greater coarseness in his manners and
                    language than even the rude state of society in his times can palliate, with
                    much varied learning and considerable eloquence, he was a blind, indiscriminate,
                    and irrational admirer of Galen, and interpreted the anatomical and
                    physiological writings of that author in preference to giving demonstrations
                    from the subject. Without talent for original research or discovery himself, his
                    envy and jealousy made him detest every one who gave proofs of either. We are
                    assured by Vesalius, who was some time his pupil, that his manner of teaching
                    was calculated neither to advance the science nor to rectify the mistakes of his
                    predecessors. A human body was never seen in the theatre of Dubois; the carcases
                    of dogs and other animals were the materials from which he taught; and so
                    difficult even was it to obtain human bones, that unless Vesalius and his
                    fellow-students had collected assiduously from the Innocents and other
                    cemeteries, they must have committed numerous errors in acquiring the first
                    principles. This assertion, however, is contradicted by Riolan, and afterwards
                    by Sprengel and Lauth, the last of whom decidedly censures Vesalius for this
                    ungrateful treatment of his instructor. It is certain that opportunities of
                    inspecting the human body were by no means so frequent as to facilitate the
                    study of the science. Though his mention of injections has led some to suppose
                    him the discoverer of that art, he appears to have made no substantial addition
                    to the information already acquired; and the first acknowledged professor of
                    anatomy to the university of Paris appears in history as one who lived without
                    true honour and died without just celebrity. He must not be confounded with
                    Franciscus Sylvius (De le Boe), who is mentioned by Ruysch and Malacame as the
                    author of a particular method of demonstrating the brain.</p>
                <p>Almost coeval may be placed Charles Etienne, a younger brother of the celebrated
                    printers, and son to Henry, who Hellenised the family name by the classical
                    appellation of Stephen (≤τε≠αvoς). It is uncertain whether he taught publicly.
                    But his tranquillity was disturbed, and his pursuits interrupted, by the
                    oppressive persecutions in which their religious opinions involved the family;
                    and Charles Etienne drew the last breath of a miserable life in a dungeon in
                    1564. Etienne, though sprung of a family whose classical taste has been their
                    principal glory, does not betray the same servile imitation Of the Galenian
                    anatomy with which Dubois is charged. He appears to have been the first to
                    detect valves in the orifice of the hepatic veins. He was ignorant, however, of
                    the researches of the Italian anatomists; and his description of the brain is
                    inferior to that given sixty years before by Achillini. His comparison of the
                    cerebral cavities to the human ear has persuaded Portal that he knew the
                    inferior <hi rend="italic">cornua,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">hippocampus,</hi>
                    and its prolongations; but this is no reason for giving him that honour to the
                    detriment of the reputation of Achillini, to whom, so far as historical
                    testimony goes, the first knowledge of this fact is due. The researches of
                    Etienne into the structure of the nervous system are, however, neither useless
                    nor inglorious; and the circumstance of demonstrating a canal through the entire
                    length of the spinal chord, which had neither been suspected by contemporaries
                    nor noticed by successors till Senac made it known, is sufficient to place him
                    high in the rank of anatomical discoverers.</p>
                <p>The French anatomy of the sixteenth century was distinguished by two
                    circumstances unfavourable to the advancement of the science,—extravagant
                    admiration of antiquity, with excessive confidence in the writings of Galen, and
                    the general practice of dissecting principally the bodies of the lower animals.
                    Both these errors were much amended, if not entirely removed, by the exertions
                    of a young Fleming, whose appearance forms a conspicuous era in the history of
                    anatomy. Andrew Vesalius, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0851-0808"/> a native of Brussels, after acquiring at Louvain
                    the ordinary classical attainments of the day, began at the age of fourteen to
                    study anatomy under the auspices of Dubois. Though the originality of his mind
                    soon led him to abandon the prejudices by which he was environed, and take the
                    most direct course for attaining a knowledge of the structure of the human
                    frame, he neither underrated the Galenian anatomy nor was indolent in the
                    dissection of brute animals. The difficulties, however, with which the practical
                    pursuit of human anatomy was beset in France, and the dangers with which he had
                    to contend, made him look to Italy as a suitable field for the cultivation of
                    the science; and in 1536 we find him at Venice, at once pursuing the study of
                    human anatomy with the utmost zeal, and requested, ere he had attained his
                    twenty-second year, to demonstrate publicly in the university of Padua. After
                    remaining here about seven years, Vesalius went by express invitation to
                    Bologna, and shortly afterwards to Pisa; and thus professor in three
                    universities, he appears to have carried on his anatomical investigations and
                    instructions alternately at Padua, Bologna, and Pisa, in the course of the same
                    winter. It is on this account that Vesalius, though a Fleming by birth and
                    trained originally in the French school, belongs, as an anatomist, to the
                    Italian, and may be viewed as the first of an illustrious line of teachers by
                    whom the anatomical reputation of that country was in the course of the
                    sixteenth century raised to the greatest eminence.</p>
                <p>Vesalius is known as the firet author of a comprehensive and systematic view of
                    human anatomy. The knowledge with which his dissections had furnished him proved
                    how many errors were daily taught and learned under the broad mantle of Galenian
                    authority; and he perceived the necessity of a new system of anatomical
                    instruction, divested of the omissions of ignorance and the misrepresentations
                    of prejudice and fancy. The early age at which he effected this object has been
                    to his biographers the theme of boundless commendation; and we are told that he
                    began at the age of twenty-five to arrange the materials he had collected, and
                    accomplished his task ere he had completed his 28th year.</p>
                <p>Soon after this period we find him invited as imperial physician to the court of
                    Charles V., where he was occupied in the duties of practice, and answering the
                    various charges which were unceasingly brought against him by the •disciples of
                    Galen. After the abdication of Charles he continued at court in great favour
                    with his son Philip II. To this he seems to have been led principally by the
                    troublesome controversies in which his anatomical writings had involved him. It
                    is painful to think, however, that even imperial patronage bestowed on eminent
                    talents does not insure immunity from popular prejudice; and the fate of
                    Vesalius will be a lasting example of the barbarism of the times, and of the
                    precarious tenure of the safety even of a great physician. On the preliminary
                    circumstances authors are not agreed; but the most general account states that
                    when Vesalius was inspecting, with the consent of his kinsmen, the body of a
                    Spanish grandee, it was observed that the heart still gave some feeble
                    palpitations when divided by the knife. The immediate effects of this outrage to
                    human feelings were the denunciation of the anatomist to the Inquisition; and
                    Vesalius escaped the severe treatment of that tribunal only by the influence of
                    the king, and by promising to perform a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He
                    forthwith proceeded to Venice, from which he sailed with the Venetian fleet,
                    under James Malatesta, for Cyprus. When he reached Jerusalem, he received from
                    the Venetian senate a message requesting him again to accept the Paduan
                    professorship, which had become vacant by the death of his friend and pupil
                    Fallopius. His destiny, however, which pursued him fast, suffered him not again
                    to breathe the Italian air. After struggling for many days with adverse winds in
                    the Ionian Sea, he was wrecked on the island of Zante, where he quickly breathed
                    his last in such penury that unless a liberal goldsmith had defrayed the funeral
                    charges, his remains must have been devoured by beasts of prey. At the time of
                    his death he was scarcely fifty years of age.</p>
                <p>To form a correct estimate of the character and merits of Vesalius, we must not
                    compare him, in the spirit of modern perfection, with the anatomical authors
                    either of later times or of the present day. Whoever would frame a just idea of
                    this anatomist must imagine, not a bold innovator without academical
                    learning,—not a genius coming from a foreign country, unused to the forms and
                    habits of Catholic Europe,—nor a wild reformer, blaming indiscriminately
                    everything which accorded not with his opinion; but a young student scarcely
                    emancipated from the authority of instructors, and whose intellect was still
                    influenced by the doctrines with which it had been originally imbued,—a scholar
                    strictly trained in the opinions of the time, living amidst men who venerated
                    Galen as the oracle of anatomy and the divinity of medicine,—exercising his
                    reason to estimate the soundness of the instructions then in use, and
                    proceeding, in the way least likely to offend authority and wound prejudice, to
                    rectify errors, and to establish on the solid basis of observation the true
                    elements of anatomical science. Vesalius has been denominated the founder of
                    human anatomy; and though we have seen that in this career he was preceded with
                    honour by Mondino and Berenger, still the small proportion of correct
                    observation which their reverence for Galen and Arabian doctrines allowed them
                    to communicate, will not in a material degree impair the original merits of
                    Vesalius. The errors which he rectified and the additions which he made are so
                    numerous, that it is impossible, in such a sketch as the present, to communicate
                    a just idea of them.</p>
                <p>Besides the first good description of the sphenoid bone, he showed that the
                    sternum consists of three portions and the sacrum of five or six; and described
                    accurately the vestibule in the interior of the temporal bone. He not only
                    verified the observation of Etienne on the valves of the hepatic veins, but he

                    good account of the mediastinum and pleura, and the fullest description of the
                    anatomy of the brain yet advanced. He appears, however, not to have understood
                    well the inferior recesses; and his account of the nerves is confused by
                    regarding the optic as the first pair, the third as the fifth, and the fi <hi

                <p>The labours of Vesalius were not limited to the immediate effect produced by his
                    own writings. His instructions and example produced a multitude of anatomical
                    inquirers of different characters and varied celebrity, by whom the science was
                    extended and rectified. Of these we cannot speak in detail; but historical
                    justice requires us to notice shortly those to whose exertions the science of
                    anatomy has been most indebted.</p>
                <p>The first tha <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> claims attention on this account is
                    Bartholomeo Eustachi of San Severino, near Salerno, who though greatly less
                    fortunate in reputation than Vesalius, divides with him the merit of creating
                    the science of human anatomy. He extended the knowledge of the internal ear by
                    rediscovering and describing correctly the <pb break="no"

                    Ingras-sias anticipated him in the knowledge of the third bone of the tympanal
                    cavity, the <hi rend="italic">stapes,</hi> he is still the first who described
                    the internal and anterior muscles of the <hi rend="italic">malleus,</hi> as also
                    the <hi rend="italic">stapedius,</hi> and the complicated figure of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cochlea.</hi> He is the first who studied accurately the anatomy
                    of the teeth, and the phenomena of the first and second dentition. The work,
                    however, which demonstrates at once the great merit and the unhappy fate of
                    Eustachius is his <hi rend="italic">Anatomical Engravings,</hi> which, though
                    completed in 1552, nine years after the impression of the work of Vesalius, the
                    author was unable to publish. First communicated to the world in 1714 by
                    Lancisi, afterwards in 1744 by Cajetan Petrioli, again in 1744 by Albinus, and
                    more recently at Bonn in 1790, the engravings show that Eustachius had dissected
                    with the greatest care and diligence, and taken the utmost pains to give just
                    views of the shape, size, and relative position of the organs of the human
                    body.</p>
                <p>The first seven plates illustrate the history of the kidneys, and some of the
                    facts relating to the structure of the ear. The eighth represents the heart, the
                    ramifications of the <hi rend="italic">vena azygos,</hi> and the valve of the
                    <hi rend="italic">vena cava,</hi> named from the author. In the seven subsequent
                    plates is given a succession of different views of the viscera of the chest and
                    abdomen. The seventeenth contains the brain and spinal chord; and the eighteenth
                    more accurate views of the origin, course, and distribution of the nerves than
                    had been given before. Fourteen plates are devoted to the muscles.</p>
                <p>Eustachius did not confine his researches to the study of relative anatomy. He
                    investigated the intimate structure of organs with assiduity and success. What
                    was too minute for unassisted vision he inspected by means of glasses. Structure
                    which could not be understood in the recent state, he unfolded by maceration in
                    different fluids, or rendered more distinct by injection and exsiccation. The
                    facts unfolded in these figures are so important that it is justly remarked by
                    Lauth, that if the author himself had been fortunate enough to publish them,
                    anatomy would have attained the perfection of the 18th century two centuries
                    earlier at least. Their seclusion for that period in the papal library has given
                    celebrity to many names which would have been known only in the verification of
                    the discoveries of Eustachius.</p>
                <p>Eustachius was the contemporary of Vesalius. Columbus and Fallopius were his
                    pupils. Columbus, as his immediate successor in Padua, and afterwards as
                    professor at Rome, distinguished himself by rectifying and improving the anatomy
                    of the bones; by giving correct accounts of the shape and cavities of the heart,
                    of the pulmonary artery and aorta and their valves, and tracing the course of
                    the blood from the right to the left side of the heart; by a good description of
                    the brain and its vessels, and by correct understanding of the internal ear, and
                    the first good account of the ventricles of the larynx.</p>
                <p>Fallopius, who, after being professor at Pisa in 1548, and at Padua in 1551, died
                    at the age of forty, studied the general anatomy of the bones; described better
                    than heretofore the internal ear, especially the tympanum and its osseous ring,
                    the two <hi rend="italic">fenestrae</hi> and their communication with the
                    vestibule and cochlea; and gave the first good account of the stylo-mastoid hole
                    and canal, of the ethmoid bone and cells, and of the lacrymal passages. In
                    myology he rectified several mistakes of Vesalius. He also devoted attention to
                    the organs of generation in both sexes, and discovered the utero-peritoneal
                    canal which still bears his name.</p>
                <p>Osteology nearly at the same time found an assiduous cultivator in John Philip
                    Ingrassias, a learned Sicilian physician, who, in a skilful commentary on the
                    osteology of Galen, corrected numerous mistakes. He gave the first distinct
                    account of the true configuration of the sphenoid and ethmoid bones, and has the
                    merit of first describing the third bone of the tympanum, called <hi
                    rend="italic">stapes,</hi> though this is also claimed by Eustachius and
                    Fallopius.</p>
                <p>The anatomical descriptions of Vesalius underwent the scrutiny of various
                    inquirers. Those moet distinguished by the importance and accuracy of their
                    researches, as well as the temperate tone of their observations, were Julius
                    Caesar Aranzi, anatomical professor for thirty-two years in the university of
                    Bologna, and Constantio Varoli, physician to Pope Gregory XIII. To the former we
                    are indebted for the first correct account of the anatomical peculiarities of
                    the foetus, and he was the first to show that the muscles of the eye do not, as
                    was falsely imagined, arise from the <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> but from
                    the margin of the optic hole. He also, after considering the anatomical
                    relations of the cavities of the heart, the valves, and the great vessels,
                    corroborates the views of Columbus regarding the course which the blood follows
                    in passing from the right to the left side of the heart. Aranzi is the first
                    anatomist who describes distinctly the inferior cornua of the ventricles of the
                    cerebrum, who recognises the objects by which they are distinguished, and who
                    gives them the name by which they are still known <hi rend="italic"
                    >{hippocampus);</hi> and his account is more minute and perspicuous than that of
                    the authors of the subsequent century. He speaks at large of the choroid plexus,
                    and gives a particular description of the fourth ventricle, under the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">cistern of the cerebellum,</hi> as a discovery of his own.</p>
                <p>Italy, though rich in anatomical talent, has probably few greater names than that
                    of Constantio Varoli of Bologna. Though he died at the early age of thirty-two,
                    he acquired a reputation not inferior to that of the most eminent of his
                    contemporaries. He is now known chiefly as the author of an epistle, inscribed
                    to Hieronymo Mercuriali, on the optic nerves, in which he describes a new method
                    of dissecting the brain, and communicates many interesting particulars relating
                    to the anatomy of the organ. He observes the threefold division of the inferior
                    surface or base, defines the limits of the anterior, middle, and posterior
                    eminences, as marked by the compartments of the skull, and justly remarks that
                    the cerebral cavities are capacious, communicate with each other, extending
                    first backward and then forward, near the angle of the pyramidal portion of the
                    temporal bone, and that they are .folded on themselves, and finally lost above
                    the middle and inferior eminence of the brain. He appears to have been aware
                    that at this point they communicate with the exterior or convoluted surface. He
                    recognised the impropriety of the term <hi rend="italic">corpus callosum,</hi>
                    seems to have known the communication called afterwards <hi rend="italic"
                    >foramen Monroianum,</hi> and describes the <hi rend="italic">hippocampus</hi>
                    more minutely than had been previously done.</p>
                <p>Among the anatomists of the Italian school, as a pupil of Fallopius, Eustachius,
                    and Aldrovandus, is generally enumerated Volcher Coiter of Groningen. He
                    distinguished himself by accurate researches on the cartilages, the bones, and
                    the nerves, recognised the value of morbid anatomy, and made experiments on
                    living animals to ascertain the action of the heart and the influence of the
                    brain.</p>

                    English works published at this time, are tolerable compilations from former
                    authors, much tinged by Galenian and Arabian distinctions. A more valuable
                    compendium than either is, however, that of John Banister (1578), entitled <hi

                    from the most approved Anathomistes in this Present Age.</hi></p>
                <p>The celebrity of the anatomical school of Italy was worthily maintained by
                    Hieronymo Fabricio of Acquapen-dente, who, in imitation of his master Fallopius,
                    laboured <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n853/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0853-0810"/> to render anatomical knowledge more precise by
                    repeated dissections, and to illustrate the obscure by researches on the
                    structure of animals in general. In this manner he investigated the formation of
                    the foetus, the structure of the oesophagus, stomach, and bowels, and the
                    peculiarities of the eye, the ear, and the larynx. The discovery, however, on
                    which his surest claims to eminence rest is that of the membranous folds, which
                    he names <hi rend="italic">valves,</hi> in the interior of veins. Several of
                    these folds had been observed by Fcmel, Sylvius, and Vesalius; and in 1547
                    Cannani observed those of the <hi rend="italic">vena azygos;</hi> but no one
                    appears to have offered any rational conjecture on their use, or to have traced
                    them through the venous system at large, until Fabricius in 1574, upon this
                    hypothesis, demonstrated the presence of these valvular folds in all the veins
                    of the extremities.</p>
                <p>Fabricius, though succeeded by his pupil Julius Casserius of Piacenza, may be
                    regarded as the last of that illustrious line of anatomical teachers by whom the
                    science was so successfully studied and taught in the universities of Italy. The
                    discoveries which each made, and the errors which their successive labours
                    rectified, tended gradually to give anatomy the character of a useful as well as
                    an accurate science, and to pave the way for a discovery which, though not
                    anatomical but physiological, is so intimately connected with correct knowledge
                    of the shape and situation of parts, that it exercised the most powerful
                    influence on the future progress of anatomical inquiry. This was the knowledge
                    of the circular motion of the blood,—a fact which, though obscurely conjectured
                    by Aristotle, Nemesius, Mondino, and Berenger, and partially taught by Servetus,
                    Columbus, Caesalpinus, and Fabricius, it was nevertheless reserved to William
                    Harvey fully and satisfactorily to demonstrate.</p>
                <p>Mondino believed that the blood proceeds from the heart to the lungs through the
                    <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic">arterialis</hi> or pulmonary
                    artery, and that the aorta conveys the spirit into the blood through all parts
                    of the body. This doctrine was adopted with little modification by Berenger, who
                    further demonstrated the existence and operation of the tricuspid valves in the
                    right ventricle, and of the sigmoid valves at the beginning of the pulmonary
                    artery and aorta, and that there were only two ventricles separated by a solid
                    impervious septum. These were afterwards described in greater detail by
                    Vesalius, who nevertheless appears not to have been aware of the important use
                    which might be made of this knowledge. It was the Spaniard Michael Servet or
                    Servetus (born in 1509; burnt in 1553), who in his treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Trinitatis Erroribus,</hi> published at Haguenau in
                    1531, first maintained the imperviousness of the septum, and the transition of
                    the blood by what he terms an unknown route, namely, from the right ventricle by
                    the <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic">arteriosa</hi> (pulmonary
                    artery) to the lungs, and thence into the <hi rend="italic">arteria venosa</hi>
                    or pulmonary vein and left auricle and ventricle, from which, he adds
                    afterwards, it is conveyed by the aorta to all parts of the body.<note

                    interesting that our readers may feel some curiosity in perusing it in the
                    language of the author; and it is not unimportant to remark that Servetus
                    appears to have been led to think of the course of the blood by the desire of
                    explaining the manner in which the animal spirits were supposed to be generated

                    Columbus formally and distinctly announced the circular course of the blood as a
                    discovery of his own; and maintained, in addition to the impeτviousness of the
                    septum, the fact that the <hi rend="italic">arteria venalis</hi> (pulmonary
                    vein) contains, not air, but blood mixed with air brought from the lungs to the
                    left ventricle of the heart, to be distributed through the body at large.</p>
                <p>Soon after, views still more complete of the small or pulmonary circulation were
                    given by Andrew Caesalpinus of Arezzo, who not only maintained the analogy
                    between the structure of the arterious vein or pulmonary artery and the aorta,
                    and that between the venous artery or pulmonary veins and veins in general, but
                    was the first to remark the swelling of veins below ligatures, and to infer from
                    it a refluent motion of blood in these vessels. The discoveries of Aranzi and
                    Eustachius in the vessels of the foetus tended at first to perplex and
                    afterwards to elucidate some of these notions. At length it happened that,
                    between the years 1598 and 1600, a young Englishman, William Harvey, pursuing
                    his anatomical studies at Padua under Fabricius of Acquapendente, learnt from
                    that anatomist the existence of the valves in the veins of the extremities, and
                    undertook to ascertain the use of these valves by experimental inquiry. It is
                    uncertain whether he learnt from the writings of Caesalpinus the fact observed
                    by that author, of the tumescence of a vein below the ligature, but he could not
                    fail to be aware, and indeed he shows that he was aware, of the small
                    circulation as taught by Servetus and Columbus. Combining these facts already
                    known, he, by a series of well-executed experiments, demonstrated clearly the
                    existence, not only of the small, but of a general circulation from the left
                    side of the heart by the aorta and its subdivisions, to the right side by the
                    veins. This memorable truth was first announced in the year 1619.</p>
                <p>It belongs not to this place either to consider the arguments and facts by which
                    Harvey defended his theory, or to notice the numerous assaults to which he was
                    exposed, and the controversies in which his opponents wished to involve him. It
                    is sufficient to say, that after the temporary ebullitions of spleen and envy
                    had subsided, the doctrine of the circular motion of the blood was admitted by
                    all enlightened and unprejudiced persons, and finally was universally adopted as
                    affording the most satisfactory explanation of many facts in anatomical
                    structure which were either misunderstood or entirely overlooked. The inquiries
                    to which the investigation of the doctrine gave rise produced numerous
                    researches on the shape and structure of the heart and its divisions, of the
                    lungs, and of the blood-vessels and their distribution. Of this description were
                    the researches of Nicolas Steno on the structure of the heart, the classical
                    work of Richard Lower, the dissertation of Pechlin, the treatise of Vieussens,
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n854/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0854-0811"/> work of Malpighi on the εtructuro of the lungs,
                    several sketches in the writings of Mayow, and other treatises of less moment.
                    Systematic treatises of anatomy began to assume a more instructive form, and to
                    breathe a more philosophical spirit. The great work of Adrian Spigelius, which
                    appeared in 1627, two years after the death of the author, contains indeed no
                    proof that he was aware of the valuable generalisation of Harvey; but in the
                    institutions of Caspar Bartholin, as republished and improved by his son Thomas
                    in 1651, the anatomical descriptions and explanations are given with reference
                    to the new doctrine. Λ still more unequivocal proof of the progress of correct
                    anatomical knowledge was given in the lectures delivered by Peter Dionis, at the
                    Jardin Royal of Paris, in 1673 and the seven following years, in which that
                    intelligent surgeon gave most accurate demonstrations of all the parts composing
                    the human frame, and especially of the heart, its auricles, ventricles, and
                    valves, and the large vessels connected with it and the lungs. These
                    demonstrations, first published in 1690, were so much esteemed that they passed
                    through seven editions in the space of thirty years, and were translated into
                    English.</p>
                <p>The progress of anatomical discovery continued in the meantime to advance. In the
                    course of the 16th century Eustachius, in studying minutely the structure of the
                    vena azygos had recognised in the horse a white vessel full of watery fluid,
                    connected with the internal jugular vein, on the left side of the vertebral
                    column, corresponding accurately with the vessel since named <hi rend="italic"
                    >thoracic duct.</hi> Fallopius also described vessels belonging to the Ever
                    distinct from arteries and veins; and similar vessels appear to have been
                    noticed by Nicolaus Massa. The nature and properties of these vessels were,
                    however, entirely unknown. On the 23d July 1622 Gaspar Asellius, professor of
                    anatomy at Pavia, while engaged in demonstrating the recurrent nerves in a
                    living dog, first observed numerous white delicate filaments crossing the
                    mesentery in all directions; and though he took them at first for nerves, the
                    opaque white fluid which they shed quickly convinced him that they were a new
                    order of vessels. The repetition of the experiment the following day showed that
                    these vessels were best seen in animals recently fed; and as he traced them from
                    the villous membrane of the intestines, and observed the valves vith which they
                    were EberaUy suppEed, he inferred that they were genuine chyliferous vessels. By
                    confounding them with the lymphatics, he made them proceed to the pancreas and
                    liver,—a mistake which appears to have been first rectified by Francis De le
                    Boe. The discovery of Asellius was announced in 1627; and the foUowing year, by
                    means of the zealous efforts of Nicolas Peiresc, a Eberal senator of Aix, the
                    vessels were seen in the person of a felon who had eaten copiously before
                    execution, and whose body was inspected an hour and a haff after. In 1629 they
                    were publicly demonstrated at Copenhagen by Simon Pauli, and the same year the
                    thoracic duct was observed by Mentel for the first time since it was described
                    by Eustachius. Five years after (1634), John WesEng, professor of anatomy and
                    surgery at Venice, gave the first deEneation of the lacteals from the human
                    subject, and evinced more accurate knowledge than his predecessors of the
                    thoracic duct and the lymphatics. Highmore in 1637 demonstrated unequivocally
                    the difference between the lacteals and the mesenteric veins; and though some
                    perplexity was occasioned by the discovery of the pancreatic duct by Wirsung,
                    this mistake was corrected by Thomas Bartholin; and the discovery by Pecquet in
                    .1647 of the common trunk of the lacteals and lymphatics, and of the course
                    which the chyle foUows to reach the blood, may be regarded as the last of the
                    series of isolated facts by the generalisation of which the extent,
                    distribution, and uses of the most important organs of the animal body were at
                    length developed.</p>
                <p>To complete the history of this part of anatomical science one step yet
                    remained,—the distinction between the lacteals and lymphatics, and the discovery
                    of the termination of the latter order of vessels. The honour of this discovery
                    is divided between Jolyffe, an English anatomist, and Olaus Rudbeck, a young
                    Swede. The former, according to the testimony of Glisson and Wharton, was aware
                    of the distinct existence of the lymphatics in 1650, and demonstrated them as
                    such in 1652. It is nevertheless doubtful whether he knew them much before the
                    latter period; and it is certain that Rudbeck observed the lymphatics of the
                    large intestines, and traced them to glands, on the 27th January 1651, after he
                    had, in the course of 1650, made various erroneous conjectures regarding them,
                    and, Eke others, attempted to trace them to the liver. The following year he
                    demonstrated them in presence of Queen Christina, and traced them to the
                    thoracic duct, and the latter to the subclavian vein. Their course and
                    distribution were still more fuUy investigated by Thomas BarthoEn, Wharton,
                    Swammerdam, and Blaes, the last two of whom recognised the existence of valves;
                    while Antony Nuck of Leyden, by rectifying various errors of his predecessors,
                    and adding several new and valuable observations, rendered this part of anatomy
                    much more precise than formerly.</p>
                <p>After this period anatomists began to study more minutely the organs and
                    textures. Francis GEsson distinguished himseif by a minute description of the
                    Ever, and a clearer account of the stomach and intestines, than had yet been
                    given. Thomas Wharton investigated the structure of the glands with particular
                    care; and though rather prone to indulge in fanciful generalisation, he
                    developed some interesting views of these organs; while Charleton, who appears
                    to have been a person of great genius, though addicted to hypothesis, made some
                    good remarks on the communication of the arteries with the veins, the foetal
                    circulation, and the course of the lymphatics. But the circumstance which
                    chiefly distinguished the history of anatomy at the beginning of the seventeenth
                    century was the appearance of Thomas Willis, who rendered himself eminent not
                    only by good researches on the brain and nerves, but by many judicious
                    observations on the structure of the lungs, the intestines, the blood-vessels,
                    and the glands. His anatomy of the brain and nerves is so minute and elaborate,
                    and abounds so much in new information, that the reader is struck by the immense
                    chasm between the vague and meagre notices of his predecessors, and the ample
                    and correct descriptions of WilEs. This exceUent work, however, is not the
                    result of his own personal and unaided exertions; and the character of WiUis
                    derives additional lustre from the candid avowal of his obligatione to Wren and
                    Millington, and, above all, to the diligent researches of his fellow-anatomist
                    Richard Lower.</p>
                <p>WiUis was the first who numbered the cranial nerves in the order in which they
                    are now usuaUy enumerated by anatomists. His observation of the connection of
                    the eighth pair with the slender nerve which issues from the beginning of the
                    spinal chord is known to aU. He remarked the paraUel lines of the mesolobe,
                    afterwards minutely described by Vicq d’Azyr. He seems to have recognised the
                    communication of the convoluted surface of the brain and that between the
                    lateral cavities beneath the fornix. He described the <hi rend="italic">corpora
                    striata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">optic</hi><hi rend="italic">thalami;</hi> the
                    four orbicular eminences, with the bridge, which he first named <hi
                    rend="italic">annular protuberance;</hi> and the white mammillary eminences,
                    behind the infundibulum. In the cerebellum he remarks the arborescent
                    arrangement of the white and grey matter, and gives a good account of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n855/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0855-0812"/> internal carotids, and the communications which
                    they make with the branches of the basilar artery.</p>
                <p>About the middle of the 17 th century Rt. Hooke and Nehemiah Grew employed the
                    simple microscope in the minute examination of plants and animals; and the Dutch
                    philosopher Leeuwenhoeck with great acuteness examined microscopically the
                    solids and fluids of the body, recognised the presence of scales in the cuticle,
                    and discovered the corpuscles in the blood and milk, and the spermatozoa in the
                    seminal fluid. The researches of Malpighi also tended greatly to improve the
                    knowledge of minute structure. He gave the first distinct ideas on the
                    organisation of the lung, and the mode in which the bronchial tubes and vessels
                    terminate in that organ. By the microscope he traced the transition of the
                    arteries into the veins, and saw the movements of the blood corpuscles in the
                    capillaries. He endeavoured to unfold, by dissection and microscopic
                    observation, the minute structure of the brain. He studied the structure of
                    bone, he traced the formation and explained the structure of the teeth; and his
                    name is to this day associated with the discovery of the deeper layer of the
                    cuticle and the Malpighian bodies in the spleen and kidney. In these difficult
                    inquiries the observations of Malpighi are in general faithful, and he may be
                    regarded as the founder of histological anatomy.</p>
                <p>Nicolas Steno described with accuracy the lacrymal gland and passages, and
                    rediscovered the parotid duct. Bellini studied the structure of the kidneys, and
                    described the tongue and tonsils with some care; and Drelincourt laboured to
                    investigate the changes effected on the uterus by impregnation, and to elucidate
                    the formation of the foetus. The science might have derived still greater
                    advantages from the genius of Regnier de Graaf, who investigated with accuracy
                    the structure of the pancreas and of the organs of generation in both sexes, had
                    he not been cut off at the early age of thirty-two. Lastly, Wepfer, though more
                    devoted to morbid anatomy, made, nevertheless, some just observations on the
                    anatomical disposition of the cerebral vessels, the glandular structure of the
                    liver, and the termination of the common duct in the duodenum.</p>
                <p>The appearance of Frederic Ruysch, who was born in 1638, and became professor of
                    anatomy at Amsterdam in 1665, gave a new impulse to anatomical research, and
                    tended not only to give the science greater precision, but to extend its limits
                    in every direction. The talents of Ruysch are said to have been developed by
                    accident. To repel the audacious and calumnious aspersions with which De Bils
                    attacked De le Boe and Van Horne, Ruysch i published his tract on the valves of
                    the lymphatics, which completely established his character as an anatomist of
                    originality and research. This, however, is the smallest of his services to the
                    science. The art of injecting, which had been originally attempted by Eustachi
                    and Varoli, and was afterwards rudely practised by Glisson, Bellini, and Willis,
                    was at length carried to greater perfection by De Graaf and Swammerdam, the
                    former of whom injected the spermatic vessels with mercury and variously -
                    coloured liquors; while the latter, by employing melted wax with other
                    ingredients, made the first approach to the refinements of modern anatomy. By
                    improving this idea of using substances which, though solid, may be rendered
                    fluid at the period of injecting, Ruysch carried this art to the highest
                    perfection.</p>
                <p>By the application of this happy contrivance he was enabled to demonstrate the
                    arrangement of minute vessels in the interior of organs which had escaped the
                    scrutiny of previous anatomists. Scarcely a part of the human body eluded the
                    penetration of his syringe; and his discoveries were proportionally great. His
                    account of the valves of the lymphatics, of the vessels of the lungs, and their
                    minute structure; his researches on the vascular structure of the skin, of the
                    bones, and their epiphyses, and their mode of growth and union; his observations
                    on the spleen, the glans penis, the clitoris, and the womb impregnated and
                    unimpregnated, were but a limited-part of his anatomical labours. He studied the
                    minute structure of the brain; he demonstrated the organisation of the choroid
                    plexus; he described the state of the hair when affected with Polish plait; he
                    proved the vascular structure of the teeth; he injected the dura mater, the
                    pleura, the pericardium, and peritoneum; he unfolded the minute structure of the
                    conglomerate glands; he investigated thatι of the synovial apparatus placed in
                    the interior of the joints; and he discovered several curious particulars
                    relating to the lacteals, the lymphatics, and the lymphatic glands.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Meibomius rediscovered the palpebral glands, which were known to
                    Casserius; Swammerdam studied the action of the lungs, described the structure
                    of the human uterus, and made numerous valuable observations on the coeca and
                    pancreatoid organs of fishes; and Kerck-ringius laid the foundation of a
                    knowledge of the process of ossification. John Conrad Brunner, in the course of
                    experiments on the pancreas, discovered the glands of the duodenum named after
                    him, and Conrad Peyer described the solitary and agminated glands of the
                    intestinal canal. Leonard Tassin, distinguished for original observation,
                    rendered the anatomical history of the brain more accurate than heretofore, and
                    gave particular accounts of the intestinal tube, the pancreatic duct, and the
                    hepatic ligaments.</p>
                <p>That France might not be without participation in the glory of advancing the
                    progress of anatomical knowledge, the names of Duverney and Vieussens are
                    commemorated with distinction. Duverney, born in 1648, and first introduced into
                    public life in 1676 in the Royal Academy of Sciences, decorated with the
                    honorary title of professor of anatomy to the Dauphin, and appointed in 1679
                    professor at the Jardin Royal, distinguished himself by the first accurate
                    account of the organ of hearing, and by his dissections of several animals at
                    the academy, supplied valuable materials for the anatomical details of the
                    natural history of animals published by that learned body. He appears to have
                    been the first who demonstrated the fact that the cerebral sinuses open into the
                    jugular veins, and to have been aware that the former receive the veins of the
                    brain, and are the venous receptacles of the organ. He understood the cerebral
                    cavities and their mode of communication; distinguishes the posterior pillars of
                    the vault from the pedes hippocampi; recognises the two plates of the septum
                    lucidum; and, what is still more remarkable, he first indicates distinctly the
                    decussation of the anterior pyramids of the medulla oblongata—a fact afterwards
                    verified by the researches of Mistichelli, Petit, and Santorini. He studied the
                    ganglions attentively, and gives the first distinct account of the formation,
                    connections, and distribution of the intercostal nerve. It is interesting to
                    remark that his statement that the veins or sinuses of the spinal chord
                    terminate in the vena azygos was verified by the more recent researches of
                    Dupuytren and Breschet, which show that the vertebral veins communicate by means
                    of the intercostal and superior lumbar veins with the azygos and demi-azygos.
                    His account of the structure of bones, and of the progress of ossification, is
                    valuable. He recognised the vascular structure of the spleen, and described the
                    excretory ducts of the pr03tate gland, the verumontanum, and the
                    anteprostates.</p>
                <p>One of the circumstances which at this time tended considerably to the
                    improvement of anatomical science was the attention with which Comparative
                    Anatomy was beginning to be cultivated. In ancient times, and at the revival of
                    letters the dissection of the lower animals <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n856/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0856-0813"/> was substituted for that of the human body; and
                    the descriptions of the organs of the latter were too often derived from the
                    former. The obloquy and contempt in τzhich this abuse involved the study of
                    animal anatomy caused it to be neglected, or pursued with indifference, for more
                    than two centuries, during which anatomists confined their descriptions, at
                    least very much, to the parts of the human body. At this period, however, the
                    prejudice against Comparative Anatomy began to subside; and animal dissection,
                    though not substituted for that of the human body, was employed, as it ought
                    always to have been, to illustrate obscurities, to determine doubts, and to
                    explain difficulties, and, in short, to enlarge and rectify the knowledge of the
                    structure of animal bodies generally.</p>
                <p>For this revolution in its favour, Comparative Anatomy was in a great measure
                    indebted to the learned societies which were established about this time in the
                    different countries of Europe. Among these, the Royal Society of London,
                    embodied by charter by Charles II. in 1663, and the Academy of Sciences of
                    Paris, founded in 1665 by Colbert, are undoubtedly entitled to the first rank.
                    Though later in establishment, the latter institution was distinguished by
                    making the first great efforts in favour of Comparative Anatomy; and Perrault,
                    Pecquet, Duverney, and Mery, by the dissections of rare animals obtained from
                    the royal menagerie, speedily supplied valuable materials for the anatomical
                    naturalist. In England, Nehemiah Grew, Edward Tyson, and Samuel Collins
                    cultivated the same department with diligence and success. Grew has left an
                    interesting account of the anatomical peculiarities of the intestinal canal in
                    various animals; Tyson in the dissection of a porpoise, an opossum, and an
                    ourang outang, adduces some valuable illustrations of the comparative
                    differences between the structure of the human body and that of the lower
                    animals; Collins has the merit of conceiving, and executing on an enlarged plan,
                    a comprehensive system, embodying all the information then extant. With the aid
                    of Tyson and his own researches, which were both extensive and accurate, he
                    composed a system of anatomical knowledge in which he not only gives ample and
                    accurate descriptions of the structure of the human body, and the various morbid
                    changes to which the organs are liable, but illustrates the whole by accurate
                    and interesting sketches of the peculiarities of the lower animals. The matter
                    of this work is so excellent that it can only be ascribed to ignorance that it
                    has received so little attention. Though regarded as a compilation, and though
                    indeed much of the human anatomy is derived from Vesalius, it has the advantage
                    of the works published on the Continent at that time, that it embodies most of
                    the valuable facts derived from Malpighi, Willis, and Vieussens. The Comparative
                    Anatomy is almost all original, the result of personal research and dissection;
                    and the pathological observations, though occasionally tinged with the spirit of
                    the times, show the author to have been endowed with the powers of observation
                    and judicious reflection in no ordinary degree.</p>
                <p>About this time also we recognise the first attempts to study the minute
                    constitution of the tissues, by the combination of the microscope and the
                    effects of chemical agents. Bone furnished the first instance in which this
                    method was put in use; and though Gagliardi, who undertook the inquiry, had
                    fallen into some mistakes which it required the observation of Malpighi to
                    rectify, this did not deter Clopton Havers and Nesbitt, in England, and
                    Courtial, Du Hamel, and Delasone, and afterwards Hérissant, in France, from
                    resuming (the same train of investigation. The mistakes into which these
                    anatomists fell belong to the imperfect method of inquiry. The facts which they
                    ascertained have been verified by recent experiment, and constitute no
                    unessential part of our knowledge of the structure of bone.</p>
                <p>Ten years after the publication of the work of Collins, Henry Ridley, another
                    English anatomist, distinguished himself by a monograph on the brain, which,
                    though not free from errors, contains, nevertheless, some valuable observations.
                    Ridley is the first who distinguishes by name the restiform processes, or the
                    posterior pyramidal eminences. He recognised the figure of the four eminences in
                    the human subject; he remarked the mammillary bodies; and he discovered the
                    sinus which passes under his name.</p>
                <p>Raymond Vieussens, by the publication of his great work on neurography in 1684,
                    threw new light on the configuration and structure of the brain, the spinal
                    chord, and the nerves; and gave a description of the arrangement and
                    distribution of the latter more precise than heretofore. Of the formation and
                    connections of the sympathetic nerve especially he gave viewe which have been
                    generally adopted by subsequent anatomists. His new arrangement of the vessels,
                    published in 1705, contains several curious opinions. His observations <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">oh</hi> the structure of the heart, published in 1706, and
                    enlarged in 1715, exhibit the first correct views of the intimate structure of
                    an organ which afterwards was most fully developed by the labours of Lancisi and
                    Senac.</p>
                <p>To the same period belong the rival publications of Godfrey Bidloo and William
                    Cowper, the latter of whom, however, stained a reputation otherwise good by
                    publishing as his own the engravings of the former. Cowper further distinguished
                    himself by a minute account of the urethral glands, already known to Columbus
                    and Mery; a good description of the intestinal glands, discovered by Brunner and
                    Peyer; and by demonstrating the communication of the arteries and veins of the
                    mesentery.</p>
                <p>The anatomical genius of Italy, which had slumbered since the death of Malpighi,
                    was destined once more to revive in Lancisi, Valsalva, and his illustrious
                    pupils Santorini and Morgagni Valsalva especially distinguished himself by his
                    description of the structure of the ear, which, in possessing still greater
                    precision and minuteness than that of Duverney, is valuable in setting the
                    example of rendering anatomy altogether a science of description. Santorini, who
                    was professor at Venice, was no unworthy friend of Valsalva and Morgagni. His
                    anatomical observations, which relate to the muscles of the face, the brain, and
                    several of the nerves, the ducts of the lacrymal gland, the nose and its
                    cavities, the larynx, the viscera of the chest and belly, and the organs of
                    generation in the two sexes, furnish beautiful models of essays, distinguished
                    for perspicuity, precision, and novelty, above anything which had then appeared.
                    These observations, indeed, which bear the impress of accurate observation and
                    clear conception, may be safely compared with any anatomical writings which have
                    appeared since. Those on the brain are particularly interesting. Morgagni,
                    though chiefly known as a pathological anatomist, did not neglect the healthy
                    structure. His <hi rend="italic">Adversaria,</hi> which appeared between 1706
                    and 1719, and his <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> published in 1728, contain a
                    series of observations to rectify the mistakes of previous anatomists, and to
                    determine the characters of the healthy structure of many parts of the human
                    body. Many parts he describes anew, and indicates facts not previously observed.
                    All his remarks show how well he knew what true anatomical description ought to
                    be. In this respect, indeed, the three anatomists now mentioned may be said to
                    have anticipated their contemporaries nearly a century; for, while other authors
                    were satisfied with giving loose and inaccurate or meagre notices of parts, with
                    much fanciful supposition, Valsalva, Santorini, and Morgagni laboured to
                    determine with precision the anatomical characters of the parts which they
                    describe.</p>

                <p>The same character is Sue to "Winslow, a native of Denmark, but, as pupil and
                    successor of Duverney, as well as a convert to Catholicism, naturalised in
                    France, and finally professor of anatomy at the Royal Gardens. His exposition of
                    the structure of the human body is distinguished for being not only the first
                    treatise of descriptive anatomy, divested of physiological details and
                    hypothetical explanations foreign to the subject, but for being a close
                    description derived from actual objects, without reference to the writings of
                    previous anatomists. About the same time Cheselden in London, the first Monro in
                    Edinburgh, and Albinus in Leyden, contributed by their several treatises to
                    render anatomy still more precise as a descriptive science. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Osteographia</hi> of the first-mentioned was of much use in
                    directing attention to the study of the skeleton and the morbid changes to which
                    it is liable. This work, however, magnificent as it was,, was excelled by that
                    of Albinus, who, in 1747, published engravings descriptive of the bones and
                    muscles, which perhaps will never be surpassed either in accuracy of outline or
                    beauty of execution. The several labours of this author, indeed, constitute an
                    important era in the history of the science. He was the first who classified and
                    exhibited the muscles in a proper arrangement, and applied to them a
                    nomenclature which is still retained by the consent of the best anatomists. He
                    gives a luminous account of the arteries and veins of the intestines, represents
                    with singular fidelity and beauty the bones of the foetus, inquires into the
                    structure of the skin and the cause of its colour in different races; represents
                    the changes incident to the womb in different periods of pregnancy, and
                    describes the relations of the thoracic duct and the vena azygos with the
                    contiguous parts. Besides these large and magnificent works, illustrated by the
                    most beautiful engravings, six books of Academical Annotations were the fruits
                    of his long and assiduous cultivation of anatomy. These contain valuable remarks
                    on the sound structure and morbid deviations of numerous parts of the human
                    body.</p>
                <p>Albinus found a worthy successor in his pupil Albert Von Haller, who, with a mind
                    imbued with every department of literature and science, directed his chief
                    attention, nevertheless, to the cultivation of anatomical and physiological
                    knowledge. Having undertaken at an early age (twenty-one) to illustrate, with
                    commentaries, the physiological prelections of his preceptor Boerhaave, he
                    devoted himself assiduously to the perusal of every work which could tend to
                    facilitate his purpose; and as he found numerous erroneous or imperfect
                    statements, and many deficiencies to supply, he undertook an extensive course of
                    dissection of human and animal bodies to obtain the requisite information.
                    During the seventeen years he was professor at Göttingen, he dissected 400
                    bodies, and inspected their organs with the utmost care. The result of these
                    assiduous labours appeared at intervals in the form of dissertations by himself,
                    or under the name of some one of his pupils, finally published in a collected
                    shape, between 1746 and 1751 <hi rend="italic">(Disputationes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Λnatomicce Selectiores</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                    beautiful engravings, representing the most important parts of the human body,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the diaphragm, the uterus, ovaries, and vagina, the
                    arteries of the different regions and organs, with learned and critical
                    explanatory observations. He verified the observations that in the foetus the
                    testicles lie in the abdomen, and showed that their descent into the scrotum may
                    be complicated with the formation of congenital hernia. Some years after, when
                    he had retired from his academical duties at Göttingen, he published, between
                    1757 and 1765, the large and elaborate work which, with singular modesty, he
                    styled <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi><hi rend="italic">of Physiology.</hi> This
                    work, though professedly devoted to physiology, rendered, nevertheless, the most
                    essential services to anatomy. Haller, drawing an accurate line of distinction
                    between the two, gave the most clear, precise, and complete descriptions of the
                    situation, position, figure, component parts, and minute structure of the
                    different organs and their appendages. The results of previous and coeval
                    inquiry, obtained by extensive reading, he sedulously verified by personal
                    observation; and though he never rejected facts stated on credible authorities,
                    he in all cases laboured to ascertain their real value by experiment. The
                    anatomical descriptions are on this account not only the most valuable part of
                    his work, but the most valuable that had then or for a long time after appeared.
                    It is painful, nevertheless, to think that the very form in which this work is
                    composed, with copious and scrupulous reference to authorities, made it be
                    regarded as a compila· tion only; and that the author was compelled to show, by
                    a list of his personal researches, that the most learned work ever given to the
                    physiologist was also the most abundant in original information.</p>
                <p>With the researches of Haller it is proper to notice those of his contemporaries,
                    John Frederick Meckel, J. FT. Lieberkühn, and his pupil John Godfrey Zinn. The
                    first, who was professor of anatomy at Berlin, described the Casserian ganglion,
                    the first pair of nerves and its distribution, and that of the facial nerves
                    generally, and discovered the spheno-palatine ganglion. He made some original
                    and judicious observations on the tissue of the skin and the mucous net; and
                    above all, he recognised the connection of the lymphatic vessels with the
                    veins,—a doctrine which, after long neglect, was revived by Fohmann and Lippi.
                    He also collected several valuable observations on the morbid states of the
                    heart and brain. Lieberkühn published in 1745 a dissertation on the villi and
                    glands of the small intestines. Zinn, who was professor of medicine at
                    Göttingen, published a classical treatise on the eye, which demonstrated at once
                    the defects of previous inquiries, and how much it was possible to elucidate, by
                    accurate research and precise description, the structure of one of the most
                    important organs of the human frame. It was republished after his death by
                    Wrisberg. About the same time Weitbrecht gave a copious and minute account of
                    the ligaments, and Μ. Lieutaud, who had already laboured to rectify many errors
                    in anatomy, described with care the structure and relations of the heart and its
                    cavities, and rendered the anatomy of the bladder very precise, by describing
                    the triangular space and the mammillary eminence at its neck.</p>
                <p>The study of the minute anatomy of the tissues, which had originally been
                    commenced by Leeuweπhoeck, Malpighi, and Ruysch, began at this period to attract
                    more general attention. De Bergen had already demonstrated the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi> general distribution of cellular membrane, and showed
                    that it not only incloses every part of the animal frame, but forms the basis of
                    every organ,—a doctrine which was adopted, and still more fully expanded, by his
                    friend Haller, in opposition to what was asserted by Albinus, who maintains that
                    each part has a proper tissue. William Hunter at the same time gave a clear and
                    ingenious statement of the difference between cellular membrane and adipose
                    tissue, in which he maintained the general distribution of the former, and
                    represented it as forming the serous membranes, and regulating their
                    physiological and pathological properties,—doctrines which were afterwards
                    confirmed by his brother John Hunter. A few years after, the department of
                    general anatomy first assumed a substantial form in the systematic view of the
                    membranes and their mutual con- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> nections traced by
                    Andrew Bonn of Amsterdam. In his inaugural dissertation <hi rend="italic"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0858-0815"/> published at Leyden in 1763, this author, after
                    some preliminary observations on membranes in general and their structure, and
                    an exposition of that of the skin, traces its transition into the mucous
                    membranes and their several divisions. He then explains the distribution of the
                    cellular membrane, the aponeurotic expansions, and the periosteum and
                    perichondrium, by either of which, he shows, every bone of the skeleton is
                    invested and connected. He finally gives a very distinct view of the arrangement
                    of the internal membranes of cavities, those named serous and fibro-serous, and
                    the manner of their distribution over the contained organs. This essay, which is
                    a happy example of generalisation, is remarkable for the interesting general
                    views of the structure of the animal body which it exhibits; and to Bonn belongs
                    the merit of sketching the first outlines of that system which it was reserved
                    for the genius of Bichat to complete and embellish. Lastly, Bordeu, in an
                    elaborate essay on the mucous tissue, or cellular organ, as he terms it, brought
                    forward some interesting views of the constitution, nature, and extent of the
                    cellular membrane.</p>
                <p>Though anatomy was hitherto cultivated with much success as illustrating the
                    natural history and morbid states of the human body, yet little had been done
                    for the elucidation of local diseases, and the surgical means by which they may
                    be successfully treated. The idea of applying anatomical knowledge directly to
                    this purpose appears to have originated with Bernardin Genga, a Roman surgeon,
                    who published in 1672, at Rome, a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Surgical
                    Anatomy, or the Anatomical History of the Bones and Muscles of the Human Body,
                    with the Description of the Bloodrvessels.</hi> This work, which reached a
                    second edition in 1687, is highly creditable to the author, who appears to have
                    studied intimately the mutual relations of different parts. It is not improbable
                    that the example of Genga led Palfyn, a surgeon at Ghent, to undertake a similar
                    task about thirty years after. For this, however, he was by no means well
                    qualified; and the work of Palfyn, though bearing the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Surgical Anatomy,</hi> is a miserable compilation, meagre in details,
                    inaccurate in description, and altogether unworthy of the honour of being
                    republished, as it afterwards was by Antony Petit.</p>
                <p>While these two authors, however, were usefully employed in showing what was
                    wanted for the surgeon, others were occupied in the collection of new and more
                    accurate facts. Albinus, indeed, ever assiduous, had, in his account of the
                    operations of Rau, given some good sketches of the relative anatomy of the
                    bladder and urethra; and Cheselden had already, in his mode of cutting into the
                    urinary bladder, shown the necessity of an exact knowledge of the relations of
                    contiguous parts. The first decided application, however, of this species of
                    anatomical research it was reserved for a Dutch anatomist of the 18th century to
                    make. Peter Camper, professor of anatomy at Amsterdam, published in 1760 and
                    1762 his anatomico-pathological demonstrations of the parts of the human arm and
                    pelvis, of the diseases incident to them, and the mode of relieving them by
                    operation, and explained with great clearness the situation of the
                    blood-vessels, nerves, and important muscles. His remarks on the lateral
                    operation of lithotomy, which contain all that was then known on the subject,
                    are exceedingly interesting and valuable to the surgeon. It appears, further,
                    that he was the first who examined anatomically the mechanism of ruptures, his
                    delineations of which were published in 1801 by Sδmmering. Camper also wrote
                    some important memoirs on Comparative Anatomy, and he was the author of a
                    well-known work on the <hi rend="italic">Relations of Anatomy to the Fine
                    Arts.</hi></p>
                <p>The attention of anatomists was now directed to the elucidation of the most
                    obscure and least explored parts of the human frame—the lymphatic vessels and
                    the nerves. Although, since the first discovery of the former by Asellius,
                    Rudbeck, and Pecquet, much had been done, especially by Ruysch, Nuck, Meckel,
                    and Haller, many points, notwithstanding, relating to their origin and
                    distribution in particular organs, and in the several classes of animals, were
                    imperfectly ascertained or entirely unknown. William Hunter investigated their
                    arrangement, and proposed the doctrine that they are absorbents; and John
                    Hunter, who undertook to demonstrate the truth of this hypothesis by experiment,
                    discovered, in 1758, lymphatics in the neck in birds. As the doctrine required
                    the existence of this order of vessels, not only in quadrupeds and birds, but in
                    reptiles and fishes, the inquiry attracted attention among the pupils of Hunter;
                    and William Hewson at length communicated, in December 1768, to the Royal
                    Society of London, an account of the lacteals and lymphatics in birds, fishes,
                    and reptiles, as he had discovered and demonstrated them. The subject was about
                    the same time investigated by the second Monro, who indeed claimed the merit of
                    discovering these vessels in the classes of animals now mentioned. But whatever
                    researches this anatomist may have instituted, Hewson, by communicating his
                    observations to the Royal Society, must be allowed to possess the strongest as
                    well as the clearest claim to discovery. The same author, in 1774, gave the
                    first complete account of the anatomical peculiarities of the lymphatic system
                    in man and other animals, and thereby supplied an important gap in this
                    department. Hewson is the first who distinguishes the lymphatics into two
                    orders—the superficial and the deep—both in the extremities and in the internal
                    organs. He also studied the structure of the intestinal villi, in which he
                    verified the observations of Lieberkühn; and he made many important observations
                    on the corpuscles of the lymph and blood. He finally applied his anatomical
                    discoveries to explain many of the physiological and pathological phenomena of
                    the animal body. Ten years after, John Sheldon, another pupil of Hunter, gave a
                    second history and description of the lymphatics, which, though divested of the
                    charm of novelty, contains many interesting anatomical facts. He also examined
                    the structure of the villi.</p>
                <p>Lastly, Cruikshank, in 1786, published a valuable history of the anatomy of the
                    lymphatic system, in which he maintains the accuracy of the Hunterian doctrine,
                    that the lymphatics are the only absorbents; gave a more minute account than
                    heretofore of these vessels, of their coats and valves; and explained the
                    structure of the lymphatic glands. He also injected the villi, and examined them
                    microscopically, verifying most of the observations of Lieberkühn. The origin of
                    the lymphatics he maintains rather by inference than direct demonstration. To
                    these three works, though in other respects very excellent, it is a considerable
                    objection that the anatomical descriptions are much mixed with hypothetical
                    speculation and reasonings on properties, and that the facts are by no means
                    always distinguished from mere matters of opinion. At the same time Haase
                    published an account of the lymphatics of the skin and intestines, and the
                    plexiform nets of the pelvis.</p>
                <p>To complete this sketch of the history of the anatomy of the lymphatic system, it
                    may be added that Mascagni, ’. who had been engaged from the year 1777 to 1781
                    in the same train of investigation, first demonstrated to his pupils several
                    curious facts relating to the anatomy of the lymphatic system. When at Florence
                    in 1782 he made several preparations, at the request of Peter Leopold, Grand
                    Duke of Tuscany; and when the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris announced the
                    anatomy of this system for their prize essay appointed for March 1784, Mascagni
                    resolved on communicating to the public the results of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n859/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0859-0816"/> his researches—the first part of his commentary,
                    with four engravings. Anxiety, however, to complete his preparations detained
                    him at Florence till the close of 1785; and from these causes his work did not
                    appear till 1787. These delays, however, unfavourable as they were to his claims
                    of priority to Sheldon and Cruikshank, were on the whole advantageous to the
                    perfection of his work, which is not only the most magnificent, but also the
                    most complete that ever was published on the lymphatics. In his account of the
                    vessels and their valves he confirms some of Hewson’s observations, and
                    rectifies others. Their origin he proves by inference much in the same manner as
                    Cruikshank; but he anticipates this author in the account of the glands, and he
                    gives the most minute description of the superficial and deep lymphatics, both
                    in the members and in the internal organs.</p>
                <p>General accounts of the nerves had been given with various degrees of accuracy by
                    Willis, Vieussens, Winslow, and the first Monro; and the subject had been much
                    rectified and improved by the indefatigable Haller. The first example of minute
                    descriptive neurography was given in 1748 by John Frederick Meckel, whose
                    account of the fifth pair, and of the nerves of the face, will long remain a
                    lasting proof of accuracy and research. The same subject was investigated in
                    1765 by Hirsch, and in 1777 by Wrisberg. In 1766 Metzger examined the origin,
                    distribution, and termination of the first pair, —a point which was afterwards
                    very minutely treated by Scarpa in his anatomical disquisitions, published in
                    1780; and the internal nerves of the nostrils were examined in 1791 by Haase.
                    The optic nerve, which had been studied originally by Varoli, and afterwards by
                    Mery, Duverney, Henkel, Moe∏er, Hein, and Kaldschmid, was examined with extreme
                    accuracy, with the other nerves of the organ of vision, by Zinn, in his
                    elaborate treatise. The phrenic nerves and the oesophageal branches of the
                    eighth pair were studied by Haase; the phrenic, the abdominal, and the
                    pharyngeal nerves, by Wrisberg; those of the heart most minutely by Andersch;
                    and the origins, formation, and distribution of the intercostal nerve, by
                    Iwanoff, Ludwig, and Girardi The labours of these anatomists, however, were
                    eclipsed by the splendid works of Walter on the nerves of the chest and belly;
                    and those of Scarpa on the distribution of the 8th pair, and splanchnic nerves
                    in general. In minuteness of description and in beauty of engraving these works
                    have not yet been equalled, and will never perhaps be surpassed. About the same
                    time, Scarpa, so distinguished in every branch of anatomical research,
                    investigated the minute structure of the ganglions and plexuses. The anatomy of
                    the brain itself was also studied with great attention by the second Monro,
                    Malacarne, and Vicq d’Azyr.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the anatomy of the gravid uterus, which had been originally studied by
                    Albinus, Roederer, and Smellie, was again illustrated most completely by William
                    Hunter, whose engravings will remain a lasting memorial of scientific zeal and
                    artistic talent.</p>
                <p>The perfection which anatomical science attained in the last ten years of the
                    eighteenth and during the present century is evinced not only in the improved
                    character of the systems published by anatomists, but in the enormous advance
                    which has taken place in the knowledge of the minute structure of the animal
                    tissues, of the development of the tissues and organs, and of the modifications
                    in form and structure exhibited by various groups of animals.</p>
                <p>The first who gave a good modern system was Sabatier; but his work was speedily
                    eclipsed by the superior merits of the treatises of Sömmering, Bichat, and
                    Portal. The excellent work by Samuel Thomas Sömmering, originally published in
                    the German language, between the years 1791 and 1796; then in the Latin
                    language, between the years 1794 and 1800; and in a second edition in the German
                    language in 1800 and 1801, maintaining the high character which it first
                    possessed for clear arrangement, accurate description, and general precision,
                    was, between the years 1841 and 1844, republished in eight volumes at Leipsic by
                    Bischoff, Henle, Huschke, Theile, Valentin, Vogel, and Wagner, with suitable
                    additions, and a large amount of new and accurate information. In this edition
                    Rudolph Wagner gives, in the first division of the first volume, the life,
                    correspondence, and literary writings of Sömmering; and in the second volume the
                    anatomy of the bones and ligaments. The third volume contains the anatomy of the
                    muscles and the vascular system by Theile. Valentin devotes one volume, the
                    fourth, to the minute anatomy of the nervous system and its parts, as disclosed
                    by careful examination by the microscope; and it must be allowed that the author
                    has been at great pains to present just views of the true anatomy of the brain,
                    the spinal cord, the nervous branches, and the ganglia. In the fifth volume,
                    Huschke of Jena gives the anatomical history of the viscera and the organs of
                    the senses, a department which had been left in some degree incomplete in the
                    original, but for one division of which the author had left useful materials in
                    his large figures already mentioned. In the sixth volume, an entire and complete
                    system of general anatomy, deduced from personal observation and that of other
                    careful observers, the materials being in general new, and in all instances
                    confirmed and rectified, is given by Prof. Henle. The seventh volume contains
                    the history of the process of development in mammalia and man, by Th. L. W.
                    Bischoff. The eighth volume treats of the pathological anatomy of the human
                    body, by Julius Vogel, but contains only the first division, relating to the
                    generalities of the subject. This, which is probably the most accurate as it is
                    the most elaborate system of anatomical knowledge up to the date of its
                    publication in 1844, was translated into the French language by Jourdan, and
                    published in 1846 under the name of <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie
                    Anatomique.</hi> The eighth volume was translated into English in the year
                    1847,</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Anatomie Générale</hi> of Bichat is a monument of his:
                    philosophical genius which will last as long as the structure and functions of
                    the human body are objects of interest. His <hi rend="italic">Anatomie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Descriptive</hi> is distinguished by clear and natural
                    arrangement, precise and accurate description, and the general ingenuity with
                    which the subject is treated. The physiological observations are in general
                    correct, often novel, and always highly interesting. It is unfortunate, however,
                    that the ingenious author was cut off prematurely during the preparation of the
                    third volume. The later volumes are, however, pervaded with the general spirit
                    by which the others are impressed, and are highly creditable to the learning,
                    the judgment, and the diligence of MM. Roux and Buisson. The system of Portal is

                    trusts not to the labours of his predecessors only. Boyer published in 1803 a
                    complete treatise on Descriptive Anatomy. Cloquet formed, on the model of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Anatomie</hi><hi rend="italic">Descriptive</hi> of Bichat, a
                    system in which he avails himself of the literature and precision of Sömmering
                    and the details of Portal. An English translation of this work was prepared by
                    Dr Knox. Cruveilhier published in 1834-35 a good general treatise on Descriptive
                    Anatomy, which was translated into English, and published as a part of <hi

                    same time Blandin published an elementary work on Descriptive Anatomy, and a
                    useful treatise on Topographical Anatomy. But the most elaborate system of human
                    anatomy which has proceeded from the French school is the great treatise of
                    Bourgery, illustrated by numerous large and beautifully-coloured plates of the
                    parts and organs. It consists of two divisions, one on Medical and Physiological
                    Anatomy; the other on Surgical Anatomy.</p>
                <p>J. F. Meckel published between 1815 and 1820 a manual of Descriptive Anatomy
                    which combines the philosophical generalisations of Bichat with the precise
                    description and pathological knowledge of Portal. During the succeeding thirty
                    years excellent systematic treatises in the German language were prepared by
                    Rosenmüller, C. F. P. Krause, Frederick Hildebrand (the 4th edition of which was
                    edited in 1830 by the eminent anatomist E. H. Weber), and Fred. Arnold. In 1846
                    Joseph Hyrtl published a system of Human Anatomy, and in the following year a
                    manual of Topographical and Surgical Anatomy, both of which, but more especially
                    the latter, have gone through several editions. Luschka, the professor of
                    anatomy in Tübingen, has prepared a valuable treatise on Regional Anatomy, in
                    which attention is particularly directed to the relations of the parts which are
                    of interest to the physician and surgeon. The text-book by Hermann Meyer of
                    Zurich is also worthy of mention as a work in which the mechanical construction
                    and uses of parts are described with great care. Henle’s treatise on Human
                    Anatomy, the pubheation of which was commenced in 1855, though the last volume
                    was not completed until 1873, is, however, the most complete work on the subject
                    which has as yet issued from the German press during the latter half of the
                    present century. It is remarkable not only for the elaborate description of the
                    organs and tissues of the body, and the ample references to the labours of other
                    observers, but for <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> the number and beauty of the

                <p>jj In Great Britain systematic treatises on Human Anatomy . were published in the
                    earlier part of the present century by Andrew Fyfe, John Bell, the third Monro,
                    and John <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Gordon, all of whom were teachers in the
                    Edinburgh school. In London, Jones Quain prepared an excellent text-book, which,
                    under a succession of editors, who have kept each new edition on a level with
                    the advancing tide of anatomical knowledge, has been much esteemed not only for
                    the clearness of its descriptions, but for the soundness of its information on
                    the various branches of human Systematic Anatomy. The 7th edition, under the
                    editorial superintendence of Professors Sharpey, Allen Thomson, and Cleland,
                    appeared between 1864 and 1867. The passing of the Anatomy Act in 1832, by
                    affording facilities for the pursuit of practical anatomy, gave a great stimulus
                    to its study in this country, and to facilitate the acquisition of a knowledge
                    of the subject many text-books have been published. The most important are
                    Harrison’s <hi rend="italic">Dublin Dissector,</hi> and the well-known <hi
                    rend="italic">Demonstrations of Anatomy</hi> by Prof. Ellis. The increased
                    importance attached by surgeons to a precise acquaintance with the knowledge of
                    those regions in which operations have most frequently to be performed, has led
                    to the production of valuable special works on their anatomy. The treatise of
                    Allen Burns on the head and neck, those of Sir Astley Cooper and Sir W. Lawrence
                    on hernia, Morton’s <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of the Surgical Regions,</hi> the
                    excellent plates on Surgical Anatomy by Joseph Maclise, and the beautiful
                    drawings by Ford from the dissections of Prof. Ellis, with descriptive
                    letterpress, are highly creditable to British anatomists; whilst the treatise on
                    hernia by Scarpa, and Cloquet’s and Hesselbach’s works on the same subject,
                    reflect credit on the Italian, French, and German schools.</p>
                <p>But special treatises have also been written on other departments of human
                    descriptive anatomy. Innes, Sandi-fort, and Barclay published works on the
                    muscles generally; and Sir Charles Bell, in his classical treatise on the
                    Anatomy of Expression, described with care the attachments and action of the
                    muscles of the face. Of late years the variations in the usually described
                    arrangements in the muscular system in man have been carefully inquired into,
                    and numerous memoirs have been written, more especially by M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> Whinnie, Hallett, W. Gruber, John Wood, W. Turner,
                    and M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Alister. F. 0. Ward published a work on
                    Human Osteology which is characterised by the minuteness and accuracy of its
                    description; G. Μ. Humphry, a treatise in which the physical, physiological, and
                    pathological aspects of the skeleton are dwelt upon; and Luther Holden, a
                    profusely-illustrated work on the same subject, in which the surfaces for
                    muscular attachments are carefully delineated. Sir Charles Bell’s engravings of
                    the arteries, Tiedemann’s more elaborate plates, and Harrison’s admirable
                    description of these vessels, all deserve notice. But the most complete work on
                    the Anatomy of the Arteries which has yet appeared is that by Richard Quain,
                    which consists of eighty-seven large plates, with 543 pages of descriptive
                    letterpress. It will long continue a standard work on the subject.</p>
                <p>Numerous treatises on the anatomy of the nervous system have been published. In
                    Germany the brothers Wenzel, Reil, Tiedemann, Gall and Spurzheim, Arnold, and
                    Reichert have prepared works on the descriptive anatomy of the great nerve
                    centres, not only in man but in various animals; and by Tiedemann, Reichert, and
                    Ecker, the development of the brain has been especially studied. In Italy the
                    memoirs of Rolando on the anatomy of the brain, and of Bellingeri on the spinal
                    cord and its nerves, are of importance. From the French school th⅛ writings of
                    Serres, of Foville, of Leuret and Gratiolet, have thrown much new light on the
                    structure of the brain. In Great Britain, Sir Charles Bell, in his great work on
                    the nervous system, developed and established the truth of the separate nature
                    of the nerves of sensation and motion. In 1836, and again in 1847, Samuel Solly
                    published an instructive treatise on the anatomy of the brain. Between 1830 and
                    1834 Joseph Swan published a valuable series of engravings in illustration of
                    the distribution of the nerves, and Robert Lee has especially investigated the
                    arrangement and distribution of the nerves of the heart and uterus. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology,</hi> under the editorial
                    superintendence of Dr Robert B. Todd, original memoirs, not only on human but
                    comparative anatomy, by eminent writers, have appeared, and have done much to
                    diffuse a knowledge of anatomical science.</p>
                <p>The improvement which has been effected in the construction of the compound
                    microscope during the fifty years subsequent to 1822, has contributed in no
                    small degree to enable anatomists to obtain more correct information on the
                    intimate structure of different organs and tissues of the animal body. For the
                    first twenty years of the nineteenth century, opticians and instrument-makers
                    had at intervals endeavoured to render the compound microscope at once an
                    instrument of greater power and more free from sources of error and optical
                    illusion than it had hitherto been possible to obtain it. Two defects, however,
                    still adhered to the compound microscope. The instrument was not achromatic; and
                    a considerable degree of spherical aberration uncorrected rendered the image
                    indistinct.</p>
                <p>Between 1812 and 1815 Professor Amici of Modena had attempted to construct an
                    achromatic object-glass of one single lens, but found that this was
                    impracticable. Μ. Selligues of Paris, in 1823, after various trials, found that
                    this could be done by making the object-glass consist of four achromatic
                    compound lenses, each of which was composed of two single lenses. This method
                    was carried <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n861/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0861-0818"/> into practice and improved by the two MM.
                    Chevalier of Paris. About the same time Dr Goring in London, with the aid of Mr
                    Tulley and Mr Pritchard, constructed compound microscopes upon a similar
                    principle.</p>
                <p>By the labours of these practical opticians, and the suggestions of various
                    scientific persons, as Sir John Herschel, Sir Richard Airy, Mr Barlow, one great
                    defect of the compound microscope was obviated. The effects of spherical
                    aberration were in the next place overcome in a very simple manner by the
                    experiments of Mr Joseph Jackson Lister, who had early observed that the
                    combined achromatic object-glasses devised by Selligues were fixed in their
                    cells with the convex side foremost, a most improper position, as it renders the
                    spherical errors very great. This gentleman found, after various trials, that.
                    by placing three or more achromatic glasses with their plane surfaces directed
                    foremost, it was possible to correct completely all spherical aberration.</p>
                <p>This fact was made known in the beginning of the year 1830; and by its
                    application the compound microscope was brought to a high degree of perfection
                    as an achromatic instrument in 1831 and 1832, and became the means of affording
                    valuable assistance in anatomical inquiries. The use of the microscope in
                    anatomy, which had in the times of Malpighi, Leeuwenhoeck, William Cowper,
                    Baker, Fontana, Hewson, and the second Monro, been much cultivated, but had
                    afterwards, from the imperfection of the instrument and the illusions to which
                    it not unfrequently gave rise, been neglected, now became so general and so
                    necessary, that since the year 1832 minute structural anatomy has been, if not
                    created anew, at least most thoroughly revised. The amount of knowledge has been
                    enormously increased; that which was already possessed has been rendered greatly
                    more accurate and precise.</p>
                <p>It is impossible in this place to name the authors of all the valuable monographs
                    which have appeared during the past forty years, but those who have especially
                    advanced the progress of our knowledge of the minute structure of the tissues
                    and organs may be referred to. Johannes Müller in 1830 published an elaborate
                    commentary on the minute structure of the glands, the first work in which the
                    anatomy of these organs was examined and elucidated in a comprehensive and
                    systematic manner. Ehrenberg explained the structure of numerous infusoria, and
                    disclosed the peculiarities of many other structures, animal, vegetable, and
                    mineral, which had previously eluded the most skilful researches. Francis
                    Kiernan, in 1833, gave the first correct account of the minute anatomy of the
                    liver. Schleiden in 1838, and Schwann in 1839, published most important
                    generalisations on the cellular structure of vegetable and animal organisms.
                    Martin Barry communicated new facts on the structure of the ovum and on the
                    structure of cells generally. John Goodsir laid great emphasis on the office of
                    the nucleus in the nutrition, growth, and reproduction of cells, and on the
                    arrangement of the cells within an organism into departments or territories.
                    Virchow, by his researches into the connective tissues, has still further
                    developed the idea of the cellular structure of the animal organism, and the
                    importance of cells in the performance of physiological and pathological
                    processes. Lionel Beale attributed both to the nucleus and to the substance of
                    the cell immediately surrounding it important functional properties. Max
                    Schultze showed the identity in nature between the sarcode substance of the
                    lower animal organisms and the contents of the cells in the higher animals, and
                    applied to these substances the common term protoplasm, which had previously
                    been introduced by Hugo von Mohl to designate a similar material in the
                    vegetable celL</p>
                <p>The minute structure and development of bone has been carefully investigated by
                    J. Goodsir, W. Sharpey, H. Müller, C. Gegenbaur, and A. Kölliker; that of muscle
                    by Bowman, Kölliker, and Sharpey; of nerve by Schwann, Remak, Stilling, Gerlach,
                    Lockhart Clarke, and Deiters; of cartilage by Schwann and Schultze; of thé blood
                    and blood-vessels by Henle, Gulliver, Quekett, Paget, and Wharton Jones; of the
                    mucous membranes by Bowman; of the serous membranes by Henle, Recklinghausen,
                    Ludwig, and Klein; of the teeth by Retzius, A. Nasmyth, J. Goodsir, J. Tomes, R.
                    Owen, Czermak, Huxley, and Waldeyer. The structure of the lungs has been
                    investigated by Addison, Rainey, and Rossignol; of the kidney by Bowman, Henle,
                    and Schweiggerseidel; of the liver by Beale and Hering; of the spleen by
                    Sanders, Gray, Billroth, and W. Müller; of the testicle by A. Cooper, Kölliker,
                    and Henle; of the ovary by Pflüger and Waldeyer; of the thymus by A. Cooper and
                    Simon; of the stomach and intestines by Kölliker, Brinton, and Frey; of the
                    placenta by Eschricht, Reid, Sharpey, Goodsir, Van der Kolk, Virchow, Farre,
                    Priestley, Rolleston, Ercolani, and Turner; of the organs of sense by Henle,
                    Bowman, His, H. Müller, Schultze, Corti, Reissner, and Deiters.</p>
                <p>The general results of the labours of these and other investigators have been
                    from time to time incorporated into systematic treatises on microscopic anatomy,
                    of which reference may more especially be made to those prepared by J. Berres,
                    F. Gerber, A. Hill Hassall, A. Kölliker, W. Sharpey, W. Bowman, F. Leydig, Frey,
                    and S. Stricker. Side by side with these inquiries into the structure and
                    development of the tissues, the evolution of the embryo out of the fertilised
                    ovum has been carried on. Purkinje, Von Baer, Coste, Wharton Jones, Valentin, R.
                    Wagner, Rathke, J. Müller, Prevost and Dumas, Martin Barry, Reichert, Bischoff,
                    Kölliker, Vogt, Allen Thomson, Owen, Von Siebold, Dujardin, Milne-Edwards,
                    Claparède, Agassiz, Huxley, Kitchen Parker, and Kowalevsky have all contri buted
                    important memoirs on various branches of embryology.</p>
                <p>Comparative Anatomy, which during the 18 th century was diligently cultivated by
                    Daubenton, Pallas, Haller, Buffon, John Hunter, and the second Monro, has become
                    during the present century a subject of increased interest, from its intimate
                    connection with the sciences of zoology, physiology, and geology. It has
                    consequently been studied with great zeal and assiduity, and multitudes of
                    monographs, as well as numerous systematic treatises on the anatomy both of the
                    vertebrata and Invertebrata, have been published.</p>
                <p>To name even a tithe of the workers and authors who have added to our knowledge
                    of the facts of comparative anatomy would occupy considerable space. It may
                    suffice to refer to those whose writings have contributed most materially to the
                    advance of the science. In France, Cuvier, Dumeril, the Saint-Hilaires,
                    Blanchard, De Blain-ville, H. and Alphonse Milne-Edwards, Gervais, and

                <p>The investigations into the form and structure of animals have led anatomists to
                    search for parts in one animal which correspond with parts in other animals in
                    their mode of development and arrangement, and to evolve from their researches
                    general doctrines of organic forms. The conception entertained by Goethe of the
                    presence of a pre-maxillary element in the human upper <pb break="no"

                    the announcement of the theory of the vertebrate nature of the skull by Goethe
                    and Oken, directed anatomists into a line of inquiry which has been productive
                    of fruitful results, and has exercised a great influence on the progress and
                    direction of biological science. Geoffroy St Hilaire and C. Martins in France;
                    Spix, Carus, Gegenbaur, and Haeckel in Germany; and Owen, Goodsir, Humphry,
                    Huxley, Parker, and Cleland in Great Britain, have all published important
                    memoirs in this department of anatomical research.</p>
                <p>The formation of anatomical museums in connection with universities, and
                    elsewhere, by enabling specimens to be accumulated for observation and
                    comparison, has contributed in no small degree to the progress of anatomical
                    science. Pre-eminent amongst these is the collection originally formed by the
                    genius, energy, and self-devoted-ness of John Hunter, which, under the fostering
                    care of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has been
                    materially augmented in all its departments by a succession of curators—Clift,
                    Owen, Quekett, and Flower. The aid which has been afforded to anatomists in the
                    publication of their researches, more especially in providing plates and other
                    expensive means of illustration, by the learned societies of Europe, and the
                    circulation which has been given to their memoirs through the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> of these societies,
                    and through the <hi rend="italic">Journals</hi> devoted to anatomical and
                    physiological science, have materially contributed to the diffusion of a
                    knowledge of discoveries, and to the general advance of the science.</p>
                <p> SPECIAL ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN BODY.</p>
                <p>Man, zoologically speaking, belongs to the Mammalian class of the Vertebrate
                    sub-kingdom, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> his young are brought forth alive, and
                    nourished during infancy on milk secreted in mammary or milk-forming glands. In
                    common with all vertebrate organisms, he possesses a spine or vertebral column
                    and a skull, in which are contained the brain and the spinal marrow, and on the
                    ventral surface of the spinal column are situated the several subdivisions of
                    the alimentary canal.</p>
                <p>But man possesses certain special or distinctive anatomical characters. The most
                    noticeable, as seen on an external inspection of his body, is his erect
                    position. He is, indeed, the only living creature that can walk or stand erect,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> with the axis of the spine vertical; with the hip
                    and knee joints capable of being fully extended, so that the leg is brought into
                    line with the thigh; with the foot so planted on the ground that it rests on the
                    heel behind and on the roots of the toes in front; with the upper limbs so
                    arranged as to act, not as instruments of progression, but of prehension; and
                    with the head so balanced on the top of the spine that the face and eyes look
                    directly to the front. His bones, joints, and muscles are constructed and
                    arranged so as to enable him to preserve the erect attitude without fatigue. In
                    other vertebrata the axis of the spine is oblique or horizontal, the hip and
                    knee joints are permanently bent at a more or less acute angle, the limbs
                    corresponding to the human upper extremities, are, in the form of legs, wings,
                    or fins, instruments of progression, and the head is articulated with the spine
                    at or near the hinder end of the skulL Owing to the oblique or horizontal
                    attitude of the body in the vertebrata generally, and its erect position in man,
                    the terms which are employed in describing the relative position of different
                    parts are. not used in the same sense by the human and comparative anatomist.
                    Thus, parts which are superior, or above other parts, in the human body, are
                    anterior, or in front, in other vertebrata; and parts which are posterior, or
                    behind other parts in man, are superior to them in other vertebrata. To obviate
                    the confusion which must necessarily arise when comparing the human body with
                    that of other vertebrates, certain descriptive terms have been recommended
                    which, may be employed whether the position of the body be erect or non-erect.
                    Thus,, the aspect of parts directed towards the region where the atlas or first
                    vertebra is situated is <hi rend="italic">atlantal,</hi> that directed towards
                    the sacrum is <hi rend="italic">sacral,</hi> that towards the back is <hi
                    rend="italic">dorsal,</hi> that towards the front is <hi rend="italic">ventral
                    or</hi><hi rend="italic">ûoemal.</hi> Quite recently the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >prae-axial</hi> has been introduced as equivalent to atlantal, and <hi
                    rend="italic">post-axial</hi> to sacral.</p>
                <p>The body may be considered as divided by an imaginary plane, the <hi
                    rend="italic">mesial plane,</hi> into two lateral and similar halves, a right
                    and left, so that it exhibits a bilateral symmetry; and the constituent parts
                    are described as being <hi rend="italic">external</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >internal</hi> to each other, according to their relative position to this
                    plane. For descriptive purposes, also, we may subdivide the body into <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Axial</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Appendiculas</hi> portions.
                    The <hi rend="smallcaps">Axial</hi> part is the stock or stem of the body, and
                    consists of the Head, the Neck, and the Trunk. The trunk is again subdivided
                    into the chest or Thorax, and the belly or Abdomen; and the abdomen is again
                    subdivided into the abdomen proper and the Pelvis. The axial part contains the
                    organs essential to the preservation of life. In the head is lodged the brain,
                    from which the spinal marrow is prolonged down the spinal canal At the sides of
                    the head are the ears, and opening on to the face are the eyes, nostrils, and
                    mouth. Prolonged down the neck are the gullet and windpipe, with the latter of
                    which is associated the organ of voice. Within the chest lie the heart, lungs,
                    and gullet; and in the abdomen are contained the stomach, intestine, liver,
                    spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and other organs concerned in the urinary and
                    generative functions. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Appendicular</hi> part forms the
                    limbs, whieh do not contain organs essential to life. In man the limbs are
                    called Upper and Lower—the former are instruments of prehension, the latter of
                    progression. The subdivisions of the body are not homogeneous in structure, but
                    are built up of several systems of organs, each system being characterised <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n863/mode/1up"

                    and structure, but by possessing special functions and uses. Thus the bones
                    collectively form the Osseous system; the joints the Articulatory system; the
                    muscles, which move the bones at the joints, the Muscular system; and these
                    several systems collectively constitute the organs of Locomotion. The blood and
                    lymph vessels form the Vascular system; the brain, spinal marrow, and nerves,
                    the Nervous system, with which is intimately associated the organs of Sense; the
                    lungs and windpipe, the Respiratory system; the alimentary canal, with the
                    glands opening into it, the Digestive system; the kidneys, bladder, and urethra,
                    the Urinary system; the testicles, spermatic ducts, and penis in the male, with
                    the ovaries, uterus, and clitoris in the female, the Generative or Reproductive
                    system; the skin, with the hair and nails, the Tegumentary system. These various
                    systems are so arrangé with reference to each other as to form an organic
                    whole.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy of the Organs of Locomotion.</hi></p>
                <p>The organs of locomotion consist of the muscles or active organs, and the bones
                    and joints or passive organs. The anatomy of the bones will first attract our
                    attention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">' Osseous System—Osteology—Skeleton.</hi> —The word Skeleton
                    (from σκελλω, <hi rend="italic">to dry)</hi> signifies literally the dry or hard
                    parts of the body. When used in a limited sense it is applied merely to the
                    bones, but when used in a wider and more philosophic sense it comprises not only
                    the bones or osseous skeleton, but the cartilages and fibrous membranes which
                    complete the framework of the body. The first evidence of a skeleton in the
                    embryo is the appearance of membranes in many parts of which cartilage is
                    developed, and in course of time this cartilage is converted into bone. In some
                    animals, however, as in the cartilaginous fish, the osseous conversion does not
                    take place, and the skeleton remains permanently cartilaginous; and in the very
                    remarkable fish called Lancelet, or <hi rend="italic">Λmphioxus,</hi> the
                    skeleton consists almost entirely of fibrous membrane.</p>
                <p>The skeleton serves as a basis of support for the soft parts, as affording
                    surfaces of attachment for muscles and as a protection for many delicate organs.
                    In the vertebrata the osseous skeleton is clothed by the muscles and skin, and
                    is technically called an <hi rend="italic">endo-skeleton.</hi> In Invertebrata
                    the skeleton is not unfrequently on the surface of the body, and is termed an
                    <hi rend="italic">exo-</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dermo-skeleton.</hi> In some
                    vertebrates <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> the armadillo, tortoise, and
                    sturgeon), in addition to the proper endo-skeleton, skeletal plates are
                    developed in connection with the integument, so that they possess a
                    dermo-skeleton likewise. In some vertebrates, also, a partial skeleton is formed
                    within the substance of some of the viscera— <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> y</hi> in ruminant animals a bone is situated in the
                    heart; in the walrus and other carnivora, in rodents, bats, and some monkeys, a
                    bone lies in the penis; and in the leopard, jackal, and other carnivora, a
                    cartilaginous style lies in the middle of the tongue. These parts form a <hi
                    rend="italic">splanchno-</hi> or visceral skeleton. By some anatomists the
                    teeth, which are unquestionably hard parts of the body, are also referred to the
                    splanchno-skeleton, though they are special modifications of the papillae of the
                    mucous membrane of the gum. In man, the teeth being excluded, there is neither
                    exo-nor splanchno-skeleton, but only an endo-skeleton.</p>
                <p>In each of the great subdivisions of the body an endo-skeleton exists, so that we
                    may speak of an Axial Skeleton and an Appendicular Skeleton. The Axial Skeleton
                    consists of the bones of the spine and head, the ribs, and the breastbone; the
                    Appendicular Skeleton, of the bones of the limbs. The number of bones in the
                    skeleton varies at different periods of life. In the adult there are about 200,
                    but in the child they are more numerous; for in the pro cess of consolidation of
                    the skeleton certain bones originally distinct become fused together. In Plates
                    XII., XIII., and XIV., front, back, and side views of the entire skeleton are
                    given, together with figures of the skull and several of its constituent
                    bones.</p>
                <p>We shall commence the description of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Axial Skele</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ton</hi> by giving an account of the bones of the spine.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Spine, Spinal</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Vertebral
                    Column,</hi> chine, or backbone, consists of a number of superimposed bones
                    which are named Vertebrae, because they can move or turn somewhat on each other.
                    It lies in the middle of the back of the neck and trunk; has the cranium at its
                    summit; the ribs at its sides, which in their turn support the upper limbs;
                    whilst the pelvis, with the lower limbs, is jointed to its lower end. The spine
                    consists in an adult Of twenty-six bones, in a young child of thirty-three,
                    certain of the bones in the spine of the child becoming ankylosed or blended
                    with each other in the adult. These blended bones lose their mobility, and are
                    called <hi rend="italic">false</hi> vertebrae; whilst those which retain their
                    mobility are the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> vertebrae. In the vertebrata the
                    bones of the spine are arranged in groups, which may be named from their
                    position — vertebrae of the neck or cervical; of the chest, dorsal or thoracic;
                    of the loins, lumbar; of the pelvis, sacral; and of the tail, coccygeal or
                    caudal; and the number of vertebrae in each group maybe expressed in a formula.
                    In man the formula is as follows:—C7D12L5S <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> C0c4 =
                    33 bones, as seen in the child; but the five sacral vertebrae fuse together into
                    a single bone— the sacrum—and the four coccygeal into the single coccyx. Hence
                    the sacrum and coccyx of the adult are the false, whilst the lumbar, dorsal, and
                    cervical are the true vertebrae.</p>
                <p>The vertebrae are irregularly-shaped bones, but as a rule have certain characters
                    in common. Each possesses a body and an arch, which enclose a ring, with certain
                    processes and notches. The Body, or Centrum, is a short cylinder, which by its
                    upper and lower surfaces is connected by means of fibro-cartilage with the
                    bodies of the vertebrae immediately above and below. The collective series of
                    vertebral bodies forms the great column of the spine. The Arch, also called
                    Neural Arch, because it encloses the spinal marrow or nervous axis, springs from
                    the back of the body, and consists of two symmetrical halves united behind in
                    the middle line. Each half consists of an anterior part or pedicle, and a
                    posterior part or lamina. The Rings collectively form the spinal canal. The
                    Processes usually spring from the arch. The spinous process projects backwards
                    from the junction of the two laminae, and the collective series of these
                    processes gives to the entire column the spiny character from which has arisen
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n870/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0870-0821"/> term Spine, applied to it. The transverse
                    processes project outwards, one from each side of the arch. The articular
                    processes project, two upwards and two downwards, and are for connecting
                    adjacent vertebrae together. The Notches, situated on the upper and lower
                    borders of the pedicles, form in the articulated spine the intervertebral
                    foramina through which the nerves pass out of the spinal canal.</p>
                <p>The vertebrae in each group have characters which specially distinguish them. In
                    man and all mammals, with few exceptions, whatever be the length of the neck,
                    the Cervical Vertebrae are seven in number. The exceptions are the three-toed
                    sloth, which has nine, and Hoffmann’s sloth and the manatee, in which there are
                    only six. In many whales the seven cervicals are fused in the adult into a
                    single bone. In man the body of a cervical vertebra is comparatively small, and
                    its upper surface is transversely concave; the arch has long and obliquely
                    sloping laminae; the ring is large and triangular; the spine is short, bifid,
                    and horizontal; the transverse process consists of two bars of bone, the
                    anterior springing from the side of the body, the posterior from the arch, and
                    uniting externally to enclose a foramen, through which, as a rule, the vertebral
                    artery passes; the articular processes are flat and oblique, and the upper pair
                    of notches are deeper than the lower. The first, second, and seventh cervical
                    vertebrae have characters which specially distinguish them. The first, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Atlas,</hi> has no body or spine: its ring is very large, and on
                    each side of the ring is a thick mass of bone, the <hi rend="italic">lateral
                    mass,</hi> by which it articulates with the occipital bone above and the second
                    vertebra below. The second vertebra, <hi rend="italic">Axis,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebra</hi><hi rend="italic">dentata,</hi> has its body
                    surmounted by a thick tooth-like <hi rend="italic">odontoid</hi> process, which
                    is regarded as the body of the atlas displaced from its proper vertebra and
                    fused with the axis. This process forms a pivot round which the atlas and head
                    move in turning the head from one side to the other; the spine is large, thick,
                    and deeply bifid. The seventh, called <hi rend="italic">Vertebra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">prominens,</hi> is distinguished by its long prominent spine,
                    which is not bifid, and by the small size of the foramen at the root of the
                    transverse process. In the human spine the distinguishing character of all the
                    cervical vertebrae is the foramen at the root of the transverse process, but
                    amongst mammals this is not an invariable character, for in the cetacea the
                    transverse process of the atlas is imperforate, and in the horse, ruminants, and
                    many quadrumana, the seventh cervical vertebra has no foramen at the root of its
                    transverse process.</p>
                <p>The Dorsal Vertebrae, more appropriately called costal or thoracic, are twelve in
                    number in the human spine; but amongst mammals they range from eleven in the
                    armadillo to twenty-two in the Cape hyrax and Hoffmann’s sloth. They are
                    intermediate in size and position to the cervical and lumbar vertebrae, and are
                    all distinguished by having one or two smooth surfaces on each side of the body
                    for articulation with the head of one or two ribs. . The arch is short and with
                    imbricated laminae; the ring is nearly circular; the spine is oblique,
                    elongated, and bayonet-shaped; the transverse processes are directed back and
                    out, not bifid, and with an articular surface in front for the tubercle of a
                    rib; and the articular processes are flat and nearly vertical. The first,
                    twelfth, eleventh, tenth, and sometimes the ninth, dorsal vertebrae are
                    distinguished from the rest. The first is in shape like the seventh cervical,
                    but has no foramen at the root of the transverse process, and has two articular
                    facets on each side of the body; the ninth has sometimes only one facet at the
                    side of the body; the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth have invariably only a single
                    facet on the side of the body, but the eleventh and twelfth have stunted
                    transverse processes, and the twelfth has its lower articular processes shaped
                    like those of a lumbar vertebra.</p>
                <p>The Lumbar Vertebrae in man are five in number, but amongst mammals they range
                    from two in the platypus to eight in the hyrax or agouti. They are the lowest of
                    the true vertebrae, and also the largest, especially in the body. The arch has
                    short and deep laminae; the ring is triangular; the spine is massive and
                    hatchet-shaped; the transverse processes are long and pointed; the articular are
                    thick and strong, the superior pair concave, the inferior convex, and the
                    inferior notches, as in the dorsal vertebrae, are-deeper than the superior. In
                    the lumbar vertebrae and in the lower dorsal an accessory process projects from
                    the base of each transverse process, and a mammillary tubercle from each
                    superior articular process. In man these are small and rudimentary; but in some
                    mammals, as the kangaroo, armadillo, and scaly ant-eater, the mammillary
                    tubercles are large, and in the baboon, dog, cat, and beaver, the accessory
                    processes are well developed. The fifth lumbar vertebra has its body much
                    thicker in front than behind; its spine is less massive, and its lower articular
                    processes are flat.</p>
                <p>The Sacrum is composed of five originally separate vertebrae fused into a single
                    bone. In the bandicoot it consists of a single vertebra, whilst it has as many
                    as eight in the armadillo. The relative size and completeness of the sacrum are
                    associated with the development of the haunch bones and of the lower limbs. In
                    whales, where the pelvic bones are rudimentary and there are no hind limbs,
                    there is no sacrum. It forms the posterior wall of the pelvis, is triangular in
                    form, and possesses two surfaces, two borders, a base, and an apex. The anterior
                    or pelvic surface is concave, and is marked by four transverse lines, which
                    indicate its original subdivision into five bones, and by four pairs of
                    foramina, through which are transmitted the anterior sacral nerves. Its
                    posterior surface is convex; in the middle line are tubercles or rudimentary
                    spines, and on each side of these are two rows of tubercles, the inner of which
                    are the conjoined articular and mammillary processes, the outer the transverse
                    processes of the originally distinct vertebrae; in addition, four pairs of
                    foramina are found which transmit the posterior sacral nerves from the sacral
                    canal, which extends through the bone from base to apex, and forms the lower end
                    of the spinal canal. By its borders the sacrum is articulated with the
                    haunch-bones— by its base with the last lumbar vertebra, by its apex with the
                    coccyx. The human sacrum is broader in proportion to its length than in other
                    mammals; this great breadth gives solidity to the lower part of the spine, and,
                    conjoined with the size of the lateral articular surfaces, it permits a more
                    perfect junction with the haunch-bones, and is correlated with the erect
                    position. Owing to the need in woman for a wide pelvis, the sacrum is broader
                    than in man.</p>
                <p>The Coccyx consists of only four vertebrae in the human spine. It is the
                    rudimentary tail, but instead of projecting back, as in mammals generally, is
                    curved forwards, and is not visible externally, an arrangement which is also
                    found in the anthropoid apes and in Hoffmann’s sloth. In the spider monkeys as
                    many as thirty-three vertebrae are found in the tail, and in the long-tailed
                    pangolin the number reaches forty-six. Not only is the tail itself rudimentary
                    in man, but the vertebrae of which it is composed are small, and represent
                    merely the bodies of the true vertebrae. As there are no arches, the ring is not
                    formed, and thβ spinal canal does not extend, therefore, beyond the apex of the
                    sacrum. The first coccygeal vertebra, in addition to a body, possesses two
                    processes or horns, which are jointed with two corresponding processes from the
                    last sacral vertebra.</p>

                <p>The Human Spine is more uniform in length in persons of the same race than might
                    be supposed from the individual differences in stature, the variation in the
                    height of the body in adults being due chiefly to differences in the length of
                    the lower limbs. The average length of the spine is 28 inches; its widest part
                    is at the base of the sacrum, from which it tapers down to the tip of the
                    coccyx. It diminishes also in breadth from the base of the sacrum upwards to the
                    region of the neck. Owing to the projection of the spines behind and the
                    transverse processes on each side, it presents an irregular outline on those
                    aspects; but in front it is more uniformly rounded, owing to the convex form of
                    the antero-lateral surfaces of the bodies of its respective vertebrae. In its
                    general contour two series of curves may be seen, an antero-posterior and a
                    lateral. The antero-posterior is the more important. In the infant at the time
                    of birth the sacro-coccygeal part of the spine is concave forwards, but the rest
                    of the spine, except a slight forward concavity in the series of dorsal
                    vertebrae is almost straight. When the infant begins to sit up in the arms of
                    its nurse, a convexity forwards in the region of the neck appears, and
                    subsequently, as the child learns to walk, a convexity forwards in the region of
                    the loins. Hence in the adult spine a series of convexo-concave curves are
                    found, which are alternate and mutually dependent, and are associared with the
                    erect attitude of man. In the human spine alone are the lumbar vertebrae convex
                    forward. A lateral curve, convex to the right, opposite the third, fourth, and
                    fifth dorsal vertebrae, with compensatory curve convex to the left immediately
                    above and below, is due apparently to the much greater use of the muscles of the
                    right arm over those of the left, drawing the spine in that region somewhat to
                    the right. In disease of the spine its natural curvatures are much increased,
                    and the deformity known as humpback is produced. As the spine forms the central
                    part of the axial skeleton, it acts as a column to support not only the weight
                    of the body, but of all that can be carried on the head, back, and in the upper
                    limbs: by its transverse and spinous processes it serves also to give attachment
                    to numerous muscles, and the transverse processes of its dorsal vertebrae are
                    also for articulation with the ribs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Thorax, Pectus,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Chest</hi>
                    is a cavity or enclosure the walls of which are in part formed of bone and
                    cartilage. Its skeleton consists of the sternum in front, the twelve dorsal
                    vertebrae behind, and the twelve ribs, with their corresponding cartilages, on
                    each side.</p>
                <p>The Sternum or Breast Bone is an elongated bone which inclines downwards and
                    forwards in the front wall of the chest. It consists of three parts—an upper,
                    called manubrium or prae-sternum; a middle, the body or mesosternum; and a
                    lower, the ensiform process or xiphi-sternum. Its anterior and posterior
                    surfaces are marked by transverse lines, which indicate not only the subdivision
                    of the entire bone into three parts, but that of the mesosternum into four
                    originally distinct segments. Each lateral border of the bone is marked by seven
                    depressed surfaces for articulation with the seven upper ribs: at each side of
                    the upper border of the prae-sternum is a sinuous depression, where the
                    clavicle, a bone of the upper limb, articulates with this bone of the axial
                    skeleton. The xiphi-sternum remains cartilaginous up to a late period of life,
                    and from its pointed form has been named the ensiform cartilage.</p>
                <p>The Ribs or Costae, twenty-four in number, twelve on each side of the thorax,
                    consist not only of the bony ribs, but of a bar of cartilage continuous with the
                    anterior end of each bone, called a <hi rend="italic">costal cartilage,</hi> so
                    that they furnish examples of a cartilaginous skeleton in the adult human body;
                    in aged persons these cartilag33 usually become converted into bone. The upper
                    seven ribs are connected by their costal cartilages to the side of the sternum,
                    and are called <hi rend="italic">sternal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">true</hi>
                    ribs; the lower five do not reach the sternum, and are named <hi rend="italic"
                    >asternal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">false,</hi> and of these the two lowest,
                    from being comparatively unattached in front, are called <hi rend="italic">free
                    or floating.</hi> All the ribs are articulated behind to the dorsal vertebrae,
                    and as they are symmetrical on the two sides of the body, the ribs in any given
                    animal are always twice as numerous as the dorsal vertebrae in that animal. They
                    form a series of osseocartilaginous arches, which extend more or less perfectly
                    around the sides of the chest. A rib is an elongated bone, and as a rule
                    possesses a head, a neck, a tubercle, and a shaft. The head usually possesses
                    two articular surfaces, and is connected to the side of the body of two adjacent
                    dorsal vertebrae; the neck is a constricted part of the bone, uniting the head
                    to the shaft; the tubercle, close to the junction of the shaft and neck, is the
                    part which articulates with the transverse process of the vertebra. The shaft is
                    compressed, possesses an inner and outer surface, and an upper and lower border,
                    but from the shaft being somewhat twisted on itself, the direction of the
                    surfaces and borders is not uniform throughout the length of the bone. The ribs
                    slope from their attachments to the spine, at first outwards, downwards, and
                    backwards, then downwards and forwards, and where the curve changes from the
                    backward to the forward direction an <hi rend="italic">angle</hi> is formed on
                    the rib. The first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs articulate each with only
                    a single vertebra, so that only a single surface exists on the head: the
                    surfaces of the shaft of the first rib are almost horizontal; those of the
                    second very oblique; the eleventh and twelfth ribs are rudimentary, have neither
                    neck nor tubercle, and are pointed anteriorly. The ribs are by no means uniform
                    in length: they increase from the first to the seventh or eighth, and then
                    diminish to the twelfth; the first and twelfth are therefore the shortest ribs.
                    The first and second costal cartilages are almost horizontal, but the others are
                    directed upwards and inwards.</p>
                <p>In its general form the chest may be likened to a truncated cone. It is rounded
                    at the sides and flattened in front and behind, so that a man can lie either on
                    his back or his belly. Its truncated apex slopes downwards and forwards, is
                    small in size, and allows of the passage of the windpipe, gullet, large veins,
                    and nerves into the chest, and of several large arteries out of the chest into
                    the neck. The base or lower boundary of the cavity is much larger than the apex,
                    slopes downwards and backwards, and is occupied by the diaphragm, a muscle which
                    separates the chest from the cavity of the abdomen. The transverse diameter is
                    greater than the antero-posterior, and the anteroposterior is greater laterally,
                    where the lungs are lodged, than in the mesial plane, which is occupied by the
                    heart.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Head</hi> forms the summit of the axial part of the
                    body. It consists of two portions—the Cranium and the Face.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Skull,</hi> or skeleton of the head, is composed of 22
                    bones, 8 of which form the skeleton of the cranium, 14 that of the face. Except
                    the lower jaw, which is moveable, the bones are all firmly united by immovable
                    joints. The 8 bones of the cranium are so united together by their edges as to
                    form the walls of a box or cavity, the cranial cavity, in which the brain is
                    lodged. The box of the cranium possesses a base or floor, a vault or roof, an
                    anterior, a posterior, and two lateral walls. The posterior wall is formed by
                    the <hi rend="italic">occipital</hi> bone, which also extends for some distance
                    forwards along the middle of the base; in front of the basal part of the
                    occipital is the <hi rend="italic">sphenoid,</hi> which also sends a process

                    junction of the two parietal bones with each other.</p>
                <p>The fourteen bones of the face, which are situated below and in front of the
                    cranium, enter into the formation of the walls of cavities which open on the
                    front of the face; thus they complete, along with the frontal, sphenoid, and
                    ethmoid, the walls of the two orbits in which the eye-balls are lodged; along
                    with the ethmoid and sphenoid, the walls of the nostrils; and they form the
                    osseous walls of the mouth. As a general rule, the cranial bones are expanded,
                    and platelike in form. The <hi rend="italic">outer</hi> surface of each bone
                    assists in forming the exterior of the cranium, and not unfrequently is marked
                    by ridges or processes for the attachment of muscles. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >inner</hi> surface, again, is smooth, and pitted with depressions, in which the
                    convolutions of the brain are lodged, and also marked by grooves for the
                    lodgment of dilated veins called blood sinuses, and of arteries termed meningeal
                    The two surfaces of a cranial bone, dense in structure, are called its <hi
                    rend="italic">tables,</hi> outer and inner, and aro separated from each other by
                    bone, looser and more spongy in its texture, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >diploë.</hi> In some localities, more especially in certain of the bones which
                    form the walls of the nostrils, the diploë disappears, and comparatively wide
                    interspaces separate the two tables which contain air, and are called <hi
                    rend="italic">air-sinuses.</hi> The margins of the bones are denticulated, and
                    it is by the interlocking of the denticula-tions of adjacent bones that they are
                    jointed together, the joints being named <hi rend="italic">sutures.</hi> The
                    bones are pierced by holes or foramina, and similar holes exist between the
                    adjacent margins of some of the bones. These foramina are mostly situated in the
                    floor of the skull, and transmit arteries into the cranial cavity to supply the
                    brain and the inner table with blood, and veins and nerves out of the cavity.
                    The largest of these holes is called <hi rend="italic">foramen magnum.</hi> It
                    lies in the occipital bone, immediately above the ring of the atlas; through it
                    the spinal marrow becomes continuous with the brain, and the vertebral arteries
                    pass to supply the brain with blood.</p>
                <p>The Occipital, or bone of the Back of the Head (Figs. 6 and 7, and Plate XIII. ),
                    consists of four originally distinct pieces fused into a curved plate-like bone.
                    Its subdivisions are arranged around the foramen magnum—the basilar part,
                    basi-occipital, in front; the condyloid parts, ex-occipi-tals, one on each side;
                    and the tabular part, or supra-occipital, behind. The anterior surface of the
                    supra-occipital is sub <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> divided into four fossae,
                    in the two upper of which are lodged the occipital lobes of the cerebrum, in the
                    two lower the cerebellum; the upper and lower pairs of fossae are separated by a
                    groove for the lodgment of the lateral venous sinus. The posterior surface is
                    marked by a protuberance and by curved lines for the attachment of muscles; by
                    its margin the supra-occipital articulates wit⅛ the parietal and temporal bones.
                    Each ex-occipital has on its under surface a smooth condyle for articulation
                    with the atlas; in front of the condyle is a foramen which transmits the last or
                    ninth cranial nerve, called hypoglossal, and behind it a foramen for the
                    transmission of a vein sometimes exists. The basi-occipital articulates and, in
                    the adult skull, is fused with the body of the sphenoid (Fig. 7). The upper
                    surface of the basi-occipital is grooved for the lodgment of the medulla
                    oblongata.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the part of the supra-occipital situated above the protuberance and
                    upper curved line ossifies as an independent bone, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >interparietal.</hi> In some mammals, as the sheep, the existence of an
                    interparietal in the young skull is the rule and not the exception.</p>
                <p>The Sphenoid or Wedge-shaped bone (Fig. 7, and Plate XII.), lies at the base of
                    the skull; it articulates behind with the occipital; in front it is jointed to
                    the ethmoid and frontal, and by its lateral processes or wings to the frontal,
                    parietal, and temporal bones. From its position, therefore, it binds together
                    all the bones of the cranium, and, moreover, articulates with many of those of
                    the face. For constructive purposes it is the most important bone of the head.
                    It consists of a centrum or body, with which four pairs of processes are
                    connected. The body has a deep depression on its upper surface, compared in
                    shape to a Turkish saddle, in which is lodged the pituitary body; hence it is
                    called <hi rend="italic">pituitary fossa.</hi> In front of this fossa is a ridge
                    which marks the place of union of the <hi rend="italic">pre-</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">post-sphenoidal</hi> subdivisions of the body of this bone; the
                    body is grooved laterally for the internal carotid artery and the cavernous
                    blood sinuses, and it is hollowed out in its interior to form the sphenoidal
                    air-sinuses: these airsinuses<pb break="no"

                    bony plates called <hi rend="italic">sphenoidal spongy bones,</hi> or bones of
                    Bertin. Behind the pituitary fossa is a pair of processes called posterior
                    clinoid, from which the bone slopes back to the basi-occipital; this slope is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">dorsum</hi><hi rend="italic">selloe,</hi> and on it
                    rests the pons Varolii. From the posterior part of each side of the body the
                    great wings, or <hi rend="italic">ali-sphenoids,</hi> pass outwards and upwards
                    to the sides of the skull, and each sends off a plate-like process to enter into
                    the formation of the outer wall of the orbit. From the anterior part of each
                    side of the body the lesser wings, <hi rend="italic">orbito-sphenoids,</hi> pass
                    outwards, and assist in forming the roof of each orbit; each orbito-sphenoid
                    ends internally in a knob-Eke process caUed <hi rend="italic">anterior
                    clinoid,</hi> and at its root is a <hi rend="italic">foramen</hi> caUed <hi
                    rend="italic">optic,</hi> which transmits the second nerve, or nerve of sight,
                    into the orbit. From the great wings on each side, close to its junction with
                    the body, a pair of <hi rend="italic">pterygoid</hi> processes, called internal
                    and external, project downwards, and the internal process ends in a slender hook
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">hamτdar</hi> process. The aE-sphenoid is pierced by
                    foramina called <hi rend="italic">rotundum,</hi><hi rend="italic">ovale,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">spinosum,</hi> the two former of which transmit divisions
                    of the fifth cranial nerve, the last an artery to the membranes of the brain;
                    between the orbito-and ali-sphenoids is a fissure which transmits the third,
                    fourth, sixth, and first divisions of the fifth cranial nerve into the orbit;
                    and at the root of the pterygoid processes is the vidian canal, for the
                    transmission of a nerve of the same name.</p>
                <p>The Ethmoid, or Sieve-like bone (Fig. 7, and Plate XIII., fig. 5), is situated
                    between the two orbital plates of the frontal, and in front of the body of the
                    sphenoid. It is cuboidal in shape, and is composed of a central portion and two
                    lateral masses, which are connected together by a thin horizontal plate pierced
                    with holes like a sieve, and caUed <hi rend="italic">cribriform.</hi> This
                    cribriform plate forms a part of the floor of the cranial cavity; on it rest the
                    two olfactory bulbs, and the branches of the nerves of smeU, called olfactory or
                    first cranial nerves, pass from the bulbs through the holes in this plate into
                    the nose. The central portion of the bone is a mesial perpendicular plate, <hi
                    rend="italic">mes-ethmoid,</hi> and forms a part of the septum which subdivides
                    the nose into the right and left nostrils. Each lateral mass consists of an
                    external smooth plate, <hi rend="italic">os planum,</hi> which assists in
                    forming the inner waU of the orbit; and an internal convoluted part, caUed <hi
                    rend="italic">superior</hi> and <hi rend="italic">middle spongy</hi> bones or
                    <hi rend="italic">turbinals,</hi> which enter into the formation of the outer
                    waU of the nostril. These turbinals are associated with the distribution of the
                    nerves of smeU; in the toothed whales, where there are no olfactory nerves, the
                    turbinals are absent, whilst in some mammals, as the crested Seal, they assume a
                    highly convoluted form. The lateral masses are hoUowed out into air-sinuses,
                    caUed ethmoidal ceUs, which communicate with the nostrils and with corresponding
                    sinuses in the sphenoid and frontal bones.</p>
                <p>The Frontal, or bone of the Forehead (Figs. 6 and 7, and Plate XIII. ), consists
                    originally of a right and left lateral haff, united by the frontal suture in the
                    middle fine of the forehead. As a rule, this suture disappears in early life,
                    and a single greatly curved bone is formed. The bone is convex forwards, to form
                    the rounded forehead, and presents two <hi rend="italic">eminences,</hi> the
                    centres of ossification of the bone; at the root of the nose is an elevation
                    caUed <hi rend="italic">glabella,</hi> extending outwards, from which, on each
                    side, is the <hi rend="italic">supra-ciliary ridge,</hi> corresponding to the
                    position of the eyebrow. In the crania of some races, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the AustraEan, the forward projection of the glabella and
                    supra-ciliary ridges is considerable; and in the well-known skuU from the vaUey
                    of the Neander it has reached a remarkable size. These ridges and the glabella
                    mark the position of the air-sinuses iu the frontal bone. The upper border of
                    each orbit, which ends internaUy and externally in a process of bone called
                    angular, forms the lower boundary of the forehead. The cerebral surface of the
                    bone is deeply concave, for the reception of the frontal lobes of the brain; the
                    concavity is deepened by the backward projection of two thin plates of bone
                    which form the roofs of the orbits, which platée are separated from each other
                    by the deep notch in which the ethmoid bone is lodged; along the margins of this
                    notch may be seen the openings into the frontal air-sinuses.</p>
                <p>The Parietal bones, two in number (Figs. 6 and 7, and Plate XIV. ), form the
                    greater part of the side wall of the skuU, and mount upwards to the vertex,
                    where they unite together along the line of the <hi rend="italic">sagittal</hi>
                    suture. Each bone possesses about the centre of its outer surface an <hi
                    rend="italic">eminence,</hi> the centre of ossification of the bone, with which
                    a hollow on the cerebral surface, lodging a convolution of the parietal lobe of
                    the brain, corresponds. The bone is quadrilateral in form. Three of its margins
                    are strongly denticulated, for junction with the occipital, frontal, and
                    corresponding parietal; the fourth is scale-like, for union with the temporal,
                    and forms the <hi rend="italic">squamous</hi> suture; near the upper margin on
                    the cerebral surface is a groove for the lodgment of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >superior longitudinal</hi> venous <hi rend="italic">sinus.</hi> The anterior
                    inferior angle articulates with the ali-sphenoid, and is marked by a groove for
                    the meningeal artery; the posterior inferior is grooved for the <hi
                    rend="italic">lateral</hi> venous <hi rend="italic">sinus,</hi> and articulates
                    with the mastoid of the temporal.</p>
                <p>The Temporal bones, two in number (Figs. 6 and 7, and Plate XIV. ), are placed at
                    the side and base of the skull, and are remarkable for containing in their
                    interior the organs of hearing. Each bone consists originaUy of four
                    subdivisions—a squamoso-zygomatic, a tympanic, a petro-mastoid, and a
                    styloid—which in course of time fuse together to form an irregular-shaped bone.
                    The squamous part of the squamoso-zygomatic is a thin plate which forms that
                    part of the side of the skull familiarly known as the “temple.” The zygoma
                    extends horizontally forwards as a distinct arched process, to join the malar or
                    cheek-bone. At the root of the zygoma is a smooth fossa, caUed <hi rend="italic"
                    >glenoid,</hi> which receives the condyle of the lower jaw, and assists in
                    forming the temporo-maxiUary joint. The tympanic portion forms in the foetus a
                    ring, which enlarges subsequently into a curved plate that forms the waU of the
                    <hi rend="italic">external auditory meatus,</hi> or passage into the tympanum or
                    middle ear. The tympanic and squamoso-zygomatic parts of the bone fuse together;
                    but a fissure, called <hi rend="italic">Glaserian,</hi> situated behind the
                    glenoid fossa, marks their original separation; in this fissure the slender
                    process of the maUeus (one of the bones of the tympanum) is lodged. The
                    petro-mastoid or periotic part of the temporal contains the organ of hearing,
                    and is compEcated in its internal anatomy. It extends forwards and inwards along
                    the floor of the skull, and forms on the exterior of the skuU the large
                    nipple-shaped <hi rend="italic">mastoid</hi> process. This process is rough on
                    its outer surface, for the attachment of muscles, and is hoUowed out internaUy
                    into the mastoid cells or air-sinuses, which communicate with the tympanum or
                    middle ear. The petrous-temporal is distinguished by its stony hardness, and has
                    the form of a three-sided pyramid. Its apex lies in relation to the side of the
                    body of the sphenoid; its base corresponds to the tympanic cavity and external
                    meatus; its under surface is rough, and forms a part of the under surface of the
                    skuU; its anterior and posterior surfaces are smooth and in relation to certain
                    parts of the brain. The petrous part of the bone is traversed by a canal which
                    transmits the internal carotid artery and sympathetic nerve into the cranial
                    cavity; in its posterior surface is a passage, <hi rend="italic">internal
                    meatus,</hi> down which the seventh cranial nerve proceeds; at the bottom of the
                    meatus the auditory part of that nerve enters the internal ear, whüst the part
                    of the nerve <pb break="no"

                    canal in the bone, called <hi rend="italic">aqueduct of Fallopius,</hi> which
                    ends externally, between the styloid and mastoid processes, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">stylo-mastoid foramen.</hi> The styloid process is a slender part
                    of the bone which projects downwards from the tympanic plate, and is connected
                    with the small cornu of the hyoid bone by the stylo-hyoid ligament. It does not
                    unite with the rest of the bone until a comparatively late period. Between the
                    petrous-temporal and ex-occipital is the <hi rend="italic">jugular foramen,</hi>
                    which transmits out of the skull the eighth cranial nerve and the internal
                    jugular vein.</p>
                <p>The fourteen bones of the Face are, as a rule, much smaller than those of the
                    Cranium; some have the form of thin scales, others are more irregular in shape.
                    They are named as follows: — Two superior maxillary, two palate, two malar, two
                    nasal, two lachrymal, two inferior turbinal, a vomer, and an inferior
                    maxilla.</p>
                <p>The Superior Maxillae, or bones of the Upper Jaw (Figs. 6 and 7, and Plate XIV.
                    ), form the skeleton of a large part of the face, and enter into the formation
                    of the walls of the cavities of the nose, mouth, and orbit; around them the
                    other bones of the face are grouped. The facial surface of each bone presents in
                    front a large foramen for the transmission of the infra-orbital branch of the
                    fifth cranial nerve, and behind, several small foramina for the transmission of
                    nerves to the teeth in the upper jaw. On the same surface is a rough process for
                    articulation with the malar bone. The orbital surface is smooth, forms the floor
                    of the orbit, and possesses a canal in which the infraorbital nerve lies. The
                    nasal surface forms a part of the outer wall and floor of the nostril, and
                    presents a hole leading into a large hollow in the substance of the bone, called
                    the <hi rend="italic">antrum,</hi> or superior maxillary air-sinus. The nasal
                    surface articulates with the inferior turbinal and palate bones. The nasal and
                    facial surfaces become continuous with each other at the anterior aperture of
                    the nose, and from them a strong process ascends to join the frontal bone close
                    to the glabella; this process also articulates with the lachrymal and nasal
                    bones. The palatal surface forms a part of the bony roof of the mouth, and
                    presents in front a small hole (the <hi rend="italic">incisive foramen)</hi>
                    which communicates with the nose. In the sheep and many other mammals this hole
                    is of large size; the palatal surface is bounded externally by a thick elevated
                    border, in which are the sockets, or <hi rend="italic">alveoli,</hi> for the
                    lodgment of the fangs of the teeth; internally this surface articulates by a
                    narrow border with the other superior maxilla and with the vomer, and,
                    posteriorly, with the palate-bone.</p>
                <p>The Palate-bone (Fig. 7, and Plate XIV.) lies in contact with the inner surface
                    and posterior border of the superior maxilla, and separates it from the
                    sphenoid. It is in shape not unlike the capital letter L, the horizontal limb
                    forming the hinder part of the bony roof of the mouth by its lower surface, and
                    the back part of the floor -of the nose by its upper. The ascending limb assists
                    in 'forming the outer wall of the nose, and subdivides into an anterior, or <hi
                    rend="italic">orbital,</hi> and a posterior, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >sphenoidal,</hi> process. At the junction of the two limbs is the <hi
                    rend="italic">pyramidal</hi> process, which articulates with the lower ends of
                    the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid.</p>
                <p>The Vomer (Fig. 7), shaped like a ploughshare, lies vertically in the mesial
                    plane of the nose, and forms a large part of the partition which separates one
                    nostril from the other. It articulates above with the under surface of the body
                    of the sphenoid and the mes-ethmoid; below with the palatal processes of the
                    superior maxillae and palate-bones; in front with the septal cartilage of the
                    nose, whilst the posterior border is free, and forms the hinder edge of the
                    nasal septum.</p>
                <p>The Inferior Turbinated is a slightly convoluted bone situated on the outer wall
                    of the nose, where it articulates with the superior maxilla and palate a little
                    below the middle turbinal of the ethmoid.</p>
                <p>. The Lachrymal (Fig. 6) is a small scale-like bone, in shape not unlike a
                    finger-nail, placed at the inner wall of the orbit, and fitting between the
                    ethmoid, superior maxilla, and frontal bones. It has a groove on the outer
                    surface, in which is lodged the lachrymal sac.</p>
                <p>The Nasal (Fig. 6) is a thin, somewhat elongated bone, which, articulating with
                    its fellow in the middle line, forms with it the bony bridge of the nose; above,
                    it articulates with the frontal, and by its outer border with the ascending
                    process of the superior maxilla.</p>
                <p>The Malar bone (Fig. 6), irregular in shape, forms the prominence of the cheek,
                    and completes the outer wall of the orbit. It rests upon the superior maxilla;
                    by its orbital plate it articulates with the great wing of the sphenoid; by its
                    ascending process with the external angular process of the frontal; by its
                    posterior process with the zygomatic process of the temporal, so as to complete
                    the zygomatic arch.</p>
                <p>The Inferior Maxilla, Lower Jaw, or Mandible (Figs. 6 and 7, and Plate XIV, fig.
                    9), is a large horse-shoe shaped bone, which has the distinction of being the
                    only movable bone of the head. It consists originally of two separate halves,
                    which unite during the first year of life into a single bone at the <hi
                    rend="italic">symphysis</hi> or chin. A characteristic feature of the human
                    lower jaw is the forward slope of the bone at the chin, for in other mammals the
                    symphysis inclines backwards. In the upper border of this bone are the sockets
                    for the lower series of teeth. At the posterior end of the horse-shoe curve on
                    each side the bone ascends almost vertically, and terminates in two processes—an
                    anterior, or <hi rend="italic">coronoid,</hi> which is for the insertion of the
                    temporal muscle, and a posterior, or <hi rend="italic">condyle,</hi> which is
                    for articulation with the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone. Where the
                    ascending and horizontal limbs of the bone are continuous, it forms the <hi
                    rend="italic">angle,</hi> which is almost a right angle. On the inner surface of
                    the ascending limb is a large foramen, communicating with a canal which
                    traverses the bone below the sockets for the teeth. In this canal are lodged the
                    nerves and blood-vessels for these teeth.</p>
                <p>The Hyoid bone lies in the neck, on the same plane as the lower border of the
                    inferior maxilla (Figs. 6 and 7). It is shaped like the letter U, and consists
                    of a body, or <hi rend="italic">^basi-hyal,</hi> from which two long horns, or
                    <hi rend="italic">stylo-hyals,</hi> project backwards. At the junction of the
                    body and horns two smaller cornua, or <hi rend="italic">cerato-hyals,</hi>
                    project upwards, and are connected with the styloid processes of the temporal
                    bones, or <hi rend="italic">stylo-hyals,</hi> by the stylo-hyoid ligaments, or
                    <hi rend="italic">epi-hyals.</hi> The hyoid is the bone from which the muscles
                    of the tongue arise, and it is situated immediately above the thyroid cartilage
                    of the larynx, to which it is attached by ligaments.</p>
                <p>In its general form the Skull is ovoid, with the long axis extending
                    antero-posteriorly, the frontal and occipital ends rounded, and the sides
                    somewhat flattened. Its average length in the people of the British Islands is a
                    little more than 7 inches; its greatest breadth about 5∣ inches; and its height,
                    from the plane of the foramen magnum to the vertex, about 5∣ inches. Its
                    greatest circumference is about 21 inches. The breadth of the face across the
                    zygomatic arches is about 5 inches. The average capacity of the brain cavity is
                    92 cubic inches. The British skull is dolicho-cephalic and orthognathic. (See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthropology.)</hi></p>
                <p>The lateral regions of the skull are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >temporal</hi><hi rend="italic">fossoe,</hi> and give origin to the temporal
                    muscles. Under cover of each zygomatic arch is the <hi rend="italic">zygomatic
                    fossa.</hi> At the bottom of this is a hollow between the superior maxilla <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n875/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0875-0826"/> and sphenoid, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >spheno-maxillary fossa,</hi> from which the <hi rend="italic">pterygo-maxillary
                    fissure</hi> extends downwards between the pterygoid and superior maxillary; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">sphenomaxillary fissure</hi> extends upwards into the
                    orbit. The orbit is a four-walled pyramidal cavity, with the. base directed
                    forward to the face, and the apex backward to the brain cavity. At the apex are
                    the foramina in the sphenoid, through which the nerve of sight and other nerves
                    pass from the brain to the eyeball, muscles, and other soft structures within
                    the orbit.</p>
                <p>The nostrils open on the front of the face by a large opening situated between
                    the two superior maxillae, and bounded above by the two nasals. The sides of the
                    opening pass down almost vertically to join the floor, and are not rounded off
                    as in the ape’s skull; from the centre of the floor a sharp process, the <hi
                    rend="italic">nasal spine</hi> of the superior maxillae projects forwards, and
                    forms a characteristic feature of the human skull. Attached to the sides of the
                    opening are the lateral cartilages of the nose, which form the wings of the
                    nostrils, and so modify the position of their openings that in the face they
                    look downwards. The nostrils are separated from each other by a vertical mesial
                    partition composed of the mes-ethmoid, vomer, and triangular nasal cartilage,
                    the last-named of which projects forward beyond the anterior surface of the
                    upper jaw, and contributes materially to the prominence of the nose. The outer
                    wall of each nostril presents the convoluted turbinals, which are separated from
                    each other by horizontal passages extending antero-posteriorly; the <hi
                    rend="italic">superior</hi> passage or <hi rend="italic">meatus</hi> lies
                    between the superior and middle turbinals of the ethmoid, and is continued into
                    the sphenoidal and posterior ethmoidal air-sinuses; the <hi rend="italic">middle
                    meatus</hi> lies between the middle and inferior turbinals, and is continued
                    into the frontal, anterior ethmoidal, and maxillary air sinuses. These sinuses
                    are therefore extensions of the nasal chamber or respiratory passage, and
                    correspond with the air cavities which exist in so many of the bones of birds;
                    the <hi rend="italic">inferior meatus</hi> lies between the inferior turbinal
                    and floor of the nose; into its anterior part opens the nasal duct which conveys
                    the tears from the front of the eyeball. The posterior openings of the nose are
                    separated from each other by the hinder edge of the vomer, and are placed
                    between the internal pterygoid plates of the sphenoid.</p>
                <p>The skull varies in appearance at different periods of life. In infancy the face
                    is small, about ⅜th of the size of the entire head, for the teeth are still
                    rudimentary and the jaws are feeble; the centres of ossification of the cranial
                    bones are prominent; the forehead projects; the skull is widest at the parietal
                    eminences; the air-sinuses, and bony ridges corresponding to them, have not
                    formed. In the adult the face is about half the size of the head, and its
                    vertical diameter greatly elongated, from the growth of the antrum, the nose,
                    and the dental borders of the jaws; and the angle of the lower jaw is almost a
                    right angle. In old age the teeth fall out, the jaws shrink in, their dental
                    borders become absorbed, the angle of the lower jaw, as in infancy, is obtuse;
                    the vertex and floor of the skull also become flattened, and the sides bulge
                    outwards,—changes due to gravitation and the subsidence of the bones by their
                    own weight</p>
                <p>The skull of a woman is smaller and lighter, with the muscular ridges and
                    projections due to the air sinuses less strongly marked than in a man, but with
                    the eminences or centres of ossification more prominent. The more feeble air
                    sinuses imply a more restricted respiratory activity and a less active mode of
                    life than in a man. The internal capacity is about 10 per cent, less than that
                    of the male. The face is smaller in proportion to the cranium; the cranium is
                    more flattened at the vertex, and the height is consequently not so great in
                    proportion to the length as in the man. In the female skull, therefore, the
                    infantile characters are less departed from than is the caβe in the male.</p>
                <p>Turning now to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Appendicular Skeleton,</hi> we shall
                    consider first that of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Superior</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Thoracic</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Pectoral Extremity,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">Upper Limb.</hi> The Upper Limb may be subdivided into a
                    proximal part or shoulder, a distal part or hand, and an intermediate shaft,
                    which consists of an upper arm or <hi rend="italic">brachium,</hi> and a
                    fore-arm or <hi rend="italic">antibrachium.</hi> In each of these subdivisions
                    certain bones are found: in the shoulder, the clavicle and scapula; in the upper
                    arm, the humerus; in the fore-arm, the radius and ulna, the bone of the upper
                    arm in man being longer than the bones of the fore-arm; in the hand, the carpal
                    and metacarpal bones and the phalanges. The scapula and clavicle together form
                    an imperfect bony arch, the Scapular Arch or Shoulder Girdle; the shaft and hand
                    form a free divergent Appendage. The shoulder girdle is the direct medium of
                    connection between the axial skeleton and the divergent part of the limb; its
                    anterior segment, the clavicle, articulates with the upper end of the sternum,
                    whilst its posterior segment, the scapula, approaches, but does not reach, the
                    dorsal spines.</p>
                <p>The Clavicle, or Collar Bone (Fig. 9), is an elongated bone which extends from
                    the upper end of the sternum horizontally outwards, to articulate with the
                    acromion process of the scapula. It presents a strong sigmoidal curve, which is
                    associated with the transverse and horizontal direction of the axis of the human
                    shoulder. It is slender in the female, but powerful in muscular males; its
                    sternal end thick and somewhat triangular; its acromial end, flattened from
                    above downwards, has an oval articular surface for the acromion. Its shaft has
                    four surfaces for the attachment of muscles; and a strong ligament, connecting
                    it with the coracoid, is attached to the under surface, near the outer end,
                    whilst near the inner a strong ligament passes between it and the first rib. The
                    clavicle is absent in the hoofed quadrupeds, in the seals and whales, and is
                    feeble in the carnivora; but is well formed, not only in man, but in apes, bats,
                    and in many rodents and Insectivora.</p>
                <p>The Scapula, or Shoulder Blade (Fig. 9), is the most important bone of the
                    shoulder girdle, and is present in all mammals. It lies at the upper and back
                    part of the wall of the chest, reaching from the second to the seventh rib. Its
                    form is plate-like and triangular, with three surfaces, three borders, and three
                    angles. The fundamental form of the scapula, as seen in the mole, is that of a
                    three-sided prismatic rod, and its assumption of the plate or blade-like
                    character in man is in connection with the great development of the muscles
                    which rotate the humerus at the shoulder joint. Its costal or ventral surface is
                    in relation to the ribs, from which it is separated by certain muscles: one,
                    called subscapularis, arises from the surface itself, which is often termed <hi
                    rend="italic">subscapular fossa.</hi> The dorsum or back of the scapula is
                    traversed from behind forwards by a prominent <hi rend="italic">spine</hi> (Pl.
                    XIV., fig. 1, S), which lies in the proper axis of the scapula, and subdivides
                    this aspect of the bone into a surface above the spine, the <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">acromion,</hi> which has an oval articular surface for the
                    clavicle; both spine and acromion are largely developed in the human Bcapula in
                    correlation with the great size of the trapezius and deltoid muscles, which are
                    concerned in the elevation and abduction of the upper limb. The borders of the
                    scapula, directed upwards, backwards, and downwards, give attachment to several
                    muscles. The angles are inferior, supero-posterior, and supero-anterior. The
                    supero-anterior is the most important; it is truncated, and presents a large,
                    shallow, oval, smooth surface, the <hi rend="italic">glenoid fossa,</hi> for
                    articulation with the humerus, to form the shoulder joint. Overhanging the
                    glenoid fossa is a curved beak-like process, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >coracoid,</hi> which is of importance as corresponding with the separate
                    coracoid bone of birds and reptiles. The line of demarcation between it and the
                    scapula proper is marked on the upper border of the scapula by the
                    supra-scapular notch.</p>
                <p>The Humerus, or bone of the Upper Arm (Fig. 9), is a long bone, and consists of a
                    shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity of this bone possesses a convex
                    spheroidal smooth surface, the <hi rend="italic">head,</hi> for articulation
                    with the glenoid fossa of the scapula; it is surrounded by a narrow constricted
                    <hi rend="italic">neck,</hi> and where the neck and shaft become continuous with
                    each other, two processes or <hi rend="italic">tuberosities</hi> are found, to
                    which are attached the rotator muscles arising from the scapular fossae. Between
                    the tuberosities is a groove in which the long tendon of the biceps rests. A
                    line drawn through the head of the humerus perpendicular to the middle of its
                    articular surface, forms with the axis of the shaft of the bone an angle of 40°.
                    The shaft of the humerus is cylindriform above, but flattened and expanded
                    below; about midway down the outer surface is a rough ridge for the insertion of
                    the deltoid muscle, and on the inner surface another rough mark for the
                    insertion of the coraco-brachialis. The demarcation between the cylindriform and
                    expanded parts of the shaft is marked by a shallow groove winding round the back
                    of the bone, in which the musculo-spiral nerve is lodged. The lower extremity of
                    the humerus consists of an articular and a non-articular portion. The articular
                    presents a small head or <hi rend="italic">capitellum</hi> for the radius, and a
                    pulley or <hi rend="italic">trochlea</hi> for the movements of the ulna in
                    flexion and extension of the limb. The non-articular part consists of two
                    condyloid eminences, internal and external. From the external, or <hi
                    rend="italic">epicondyle,</hi> a ridge passes for some distance along the outer
                    border of the bone; it gives origin to the supinator and extensor muscles in the
                    fore-arm. From the internal pτninence, or <hi rend="italic">epitrochlea,</hi> a
                    ridge passes up the inner border of the shaft of the bone; this eminence gives
                    origin to the pronator and flexor muscles in the fore-arm. In nearly two per
                    cent of the bodies examined in the anatomy-rooms in the university of Edinburgh,
                    a hooked process has been seen projecting from the shaft of the bone, about 2
                    inches above the epi-trochlea; this process is connected to the epitrochlea by a
                    fibrous band, so as to form a foramen, which has been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >supτa-condyloid.</hi> In these cases the median nerve invariably passes through
                    the foramen, and not unfrequently is accompanied by the brachial artery. In the
                    feline carnivora and some other mammals a foramen constantly occurs in this part
                    of the humerus, through which, as a rule, both nerve and artery proceed, though
                    in the common seal it transmits only the nerve.</p>
                <p>Before describing the two bones of the fore-arm, the anatomist should note the
                    range of movement which can take place between them. In one position, which is
                    called <hi rend="italic">supine,</hi> they lie parallel to each other, the
                    radius being the more external bone, and the palm of the hand being directed
                    forwards; in the other or <hi rend="italic">prone</hi> position the radius
                    crosses obliquely in front of the ulna, and the palm of the hand is directed
                    backwards. Not only the bones of the fore-arm, but those of the hand are
                    supposed to be in the supine position when they are described.</p>
                <p>The Radius (Fig. 9) is the outer bone of the Fore-arm, and like all long bones
                    possesses a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity or <hi rend="italic"
                    >head</hi> has a shallow, smooth cup for moving on the capitellum of the
                    humerus; the outer margin of the cup is also smooth, for articulation with the
                    ulna and annular ligament; below the cup is a constricted <hi rend="italic"
                    >neck,</hi> and immediately below the neck a <hi rend="italic">tuberosity</hi>
                    for the insertion of the biceps. The shaft of the bone possesses three surfaces
                    for the attachment of muscles, and a sharp inner border for the interosseous
                    membrane. The lower end of the bone is much broader than the upper, and is
                    marked posteriorly by grooves for the lodgment of tendons passing to the back of
                    the hand: from its outer border a pointed <hi rend="italic">styloid</hi> process
                    projects downwards; its inner border has a smooth shallow fossa for articulation
                    with the ulna, and its broad lower surface is smooth and concave, for
                    articulation with the scaphoid and semilunar bones of the wrist.</p>
                <p>The Ulna (Fig. 9) is also a long bone. Its upper end is subdivided into two
                    strong processes by a deep fossa, the <hi rend="italic">greater sigmoid
                    cavity,</hi> which possesses a smooth surface for articulation with the trochlea
                    of the humerus. The anterior or <hi rend="italic">coronoid</hi> process is
                    marked by an oblique ridge for the insertion of the brachialis anticus, whilst
                    the posterior or <hi rend="italic">olecranon</hi> process gives insertion to the
                    large triceps muscle of the upper arm. Immediately below the outer border of the
                    great sigmoid cavity is the <hi rend="italic">small sigmoid cavity</hi> for
                    articulation with the side of the head of the radius. The shaft of the bone
                    possesses three surfaces for the attachment of muscles, and a sharp outer border
                    for the interosseous membrane. The lower end, much smaller than the upper, has a
                    pointed <hi rend="italic">styloid</hi> process and a smooth articular surface,
                    the outer portion of which is for the lower end of the radius, the lower part
                    for moving on a cartilage of the wrist joint called the triangular
                    fibro-cartilage.</p>
                <p>The Hand consists of the Carpus or wrist, of the Metacarpus or palm, and of the
                    free Digits, the thumb and four fingers. Anatomists describe it with the palm
                    turned to. the front, and with its axis in line with the axis of the
                    fore-arm.</p>
                <p>The Carpal or Wrist bones (Fig. 9) are eight in number and small in size: they
                    are arranged in two rows, a <hi rend="italic">proximal,—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.</hi> a row next the fore-arm,—consisting of the scaphoid, semilunar,
                    cuneiform, and pisiform; and a <hi rend="italic">distal,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> a row next the bones of the palm,—consisting
                    of a trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform; the bones in each row being
                    named in the order they are met with, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n877/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0877-0828"/> from the radial or outer to the ulnar or inner
                    side of the wrist. It is unnecessary to give a separate description of each
                    bone. Except the pisiform or pea-shaped bone, which articulates with the front
                    of the cuneiform, each carpal bone is short and irregularly cuboidal in shape;
                    its anterior (or palmar) surface and its posterior (or dorsal) being rough, for
                    the attachment of ligaments; its superior and inferior surfaces being invariably
                    smooth, for articulation with adjacent bones; whilst the inner and outer
                    surfaces are also smooth, for articulation, except the outer surfaces of the
                    scaphoid and trapezium (the two external bones of the carpus), and the inner
                    surfaces of the cuneiform and unciform (the two internal bones). Occasionally a
                    ninth or supernumerary bone may arise from the subdivision of the scaphoid,
                    semilunar, or trapezoid, into two pieces; more rarely a distinct bone is found
                    in the human wrist intercalated between the trapezoid, os magnum, semilunar, and
                    scaphoid, which corresponds in position to the os intermedium, found constantly
                    in the wrist of the orang, gibbon, the tailed apes, and many rodents and
                    Insectivora.</p>
                <p>s The Metacarpal bones, or bones of the Palm of the Hand, are five in number
                    (Fig. 9). They are miniature long bones, and each possesses a shaft and two
                    extremities. The metacarpal of the thumb is the shortest, and diverges outwards
                    from the rest: its carpal extremity is saddle-shaped, for articulation with the
                    trapezium; its shaft is somewhat compressed, and its phalangeal end is smooth
                    and rounded, for the first phalanx of the thumb. The four other metacarpal bones
                    belong to the four fingers: they are almost parallel to each other, and diminish
                    in size from the second to the fifth. Their carpal ends articulate with the
                    trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform: their shafts are three-sided: their
                    phalangeal ends articulate with the first phalanges of the fingers.</p>
                <p>! The number of Digits in the hand is five, which is the highest number found in
                    the mammalia. They are distinguished by the names of pollex or thumb, and index,
                    middle, ring, and little fingers. Their skeleton consists of fourteen bones,
                    named phalanges, of which the thumb possesses two, and each of the four fingers
                    three. The phalanx next the metacarpal bone is the first, that which carries the
                    nail is the terminal or ungual phalanx, whilst the intermediate bone is the
                    second phalanx. Each is a miniature long bone, with two articular extremities
                    and an intermediate shaft, except the terminal phalanges, which have an
                    articular surface only at their proximal ends, the distal end being rounded and
                    rough, to afford a surface for the lodgment of the nail.</p>
                <p>j The <hi rend="smallcaps">Inferior</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Pelvic
                    Extremity,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Lower Limb,</hi> consists of a proximal
                    part or haunch, a distal part or foot, and an intermediate shaft subdivided into
                    thigh and leg. Each part has its appropriate skeleton: in the haunch, the pelvic
                    or innominate bone; in the thigh, the femur; in the leg, the tibia and fibula
                    (the thigh-bone in man being</p>
                <p>'longer than the leg-bones); in front of the knee, the patella; in the foot, the
                    tarsal and metatarsal bones and phalanges. The bone of the haunch forms an arch
                    or Pelvic Girdle, which articulates behind with the side of the sacrum, and
                    arches forward to articulate with the opposite haunch-bone at the pubic
                    symphysis. It is the direct medium of connection between the axial skeleton and
                    the shaft and foot, which form a free divergent Appendage.</p>
                <p>The Os Innominatum, or Haunch-bone, is a large irre- ] gular plate-like bone,
                    which forms the lateral and anterior <hi rend="italic">l</hi> boundary of the
                    cavity of the pelvis. In early life it consists of three bones—ilium, ischium,
                    and pubis—which unite about the twenty-fifth year into a single bone. These
                    bones converge, and join to form a deep fossa or cup, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >acetabulum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cotyloid cavity,</hi> on the outer surface
                    of the bone, which lodges the head of the thigh-bone at the hip-joint. One-fifth
                    of this cup is formed by the pubes, and about two-fifths each by the ischium and
                    ilium. At the bottom of the acetabulum is a depression, to the sides of which
                    the <hi rend="italic">interarticular ligament</hi> of the hip-joint is attached.
                    From the acetabulum the ilium extends upwards and backwards, the ischium
                    downwards and backwards, the pubis forwards and inwards. In front of the
                    acetabulum is a large hole, the <hi rend="italic">obturator</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">thyroid foramen,</hi> which is bounded by the ischium and pubes;
                    behind the acetabulum is the deep <hi rend="italic">sciatic notch,</hi> which is
                    bounded by the ischium and ilium.</p>
                <p>The Ilium (Fig. 10) in man is a broad plate-like bone. In its most simple form,
                    as in the kangaroo, it is a three-sided, prismatic, rod-like bone, one end of
                    which enters into the formation of the acetabulum, whilst the other is free, and
                    forms the iliac crest. In man, notwithstanding its ex panded form, three
                    surfaces may also be recognised, corresponding to the surfaces in the ilium of
                    the kangaroo; and, as in that animal, the lower end aids in forming the
                    acetabulum, while the upper end forms the iliac crest, which, in man, in
                    conformity with the general expansion of the bone, is elongated into the sinuous
                    crest of the ilium. This crest is of great importance, for it affords attachment
                    to the broad muscles which form the wall of the abdominal cavity. One surface of
                    the ilium is <hi rend="italic">external,</hi> and marked by curved lines which
                    subdivide it into areas for the origin of the muscles of the buttock; another
                    surface is <hi rend="italic">anterior,</hi> and hollowed out to give origin to
                    the iliacus muscle; the third, or <hi rend="italic">internal,</hi> surface
                    articulates posteriorly with the sacrum, whilst anteriorly it forms a part of
                    the wall of the true pelvis. The external is separated from the anterior surface
                    by a border which joins the anterior end of the crest, where it forms a process,
                    the <hi rend="italic">anterior superior spine.</hi> About the middle of this
                    border is the <hi rend="italic">anterior inferior spine.</hi> Between the
                    external and internal surfaces is a border on which are found the <hi
                    rend="italic">posterior superior and inferior spines;</hi> between the anterior
                    and internal surfaces is the pectineal border, which forms part of the line of
                    separation between the true and false pelvis.</p>
                <p>The Pubis (Fig. 11) is also a three-sided, prismatic, rod-like<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0878-0829"/> bone, the fundamental form of which is obscured
                    by the modification in shape of its inner end. In human anatomy it is customary
                    to regard it as consisting of a <hi rend="italic">body</hi> and of two branches,
                    a <hi rend="italic">horizontal</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">descending
                    ramus.</hi> The body and horizontal ramus form the fundamental prismatic rod,
                    and the descending ramus is merely a special offshoot from the inner end of the
                    rod. The outer end of the rod takes a part in the formation of the acetabulum;
                    the inner end is expanded into the body of the pubis, and has a broad margin, or
                    <hi rend="italic">symphysis,</hi> for articulation with the corresponding bone
                    on the opposite side of the pelvis. The three surfaces are— <hi rend="italic">a,
                    superior,</hi> for the origin of the pectineus muscle; a <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior,</hi> which enters into the wall of the true pelvis; and an <hi
                    rend="italic">inferior,</hi> which forms the upper boundary of the obturator
                    foramen. The descending ramus is merely a downward prolongation of the inner end
                    of the bone which joins the ischium, and aids in forming the side of the pubic
                    arch. The junction of the outer end of the pubis with the ilium is marked by the
                    <hi rend="italic">pectineal eminence.</hi> The superior and posterior surfaces
                    are separated by the sharp <hi rend="italic">pectineal line,</hi> which,
                    starting from the <hi rend="italic">spine</hi> of the pubis, runs outwards to
                    aid in forming the brim of the true pelvis.</p>
                <p>The Ischium (Fig. 11), like the ilium and pubis, has the fundamental form of a
                    three-sided prismatic rod. One extremity (the upper) completes the acetabulum,
                    whilst the lower forms the large prominence, or <hi rend="italic">tuber</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ischii.</hi> The surfaces of the bone are <hi rend="italic"
                    >internal</hi> or pelvic, <hi rend="italic">external,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >anterior.</hi> The pelvic and external surfaces are separated from each other
                    by a sharp border, on which is seen the <hi rend="italic">ischial spine.</hi>
                    The pelvic and anterior surfaces are separated by a border, which forms a part
                    of the boundary of the obturator foramen; but the margin between the external
                    and anterior surfaces is feebly marked. The tuberosity, a thick, rough, and
                    strong process, gives origin to several powerful muscles: on it the body rests
                    in the sitting posture; an offshoot, or ramus, ascends from it to join the
                    descending ramus of the pubis, and completes both the pubic arch and the margin
                    of the obturator foramen.</p>
                <p>By the articulation of the two innominate bones with each other in front at the
                    pubic symphysis, and with the sides of the sacrum behind, the osseous walls of
                    the cavity of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pelvis</hi> are formed. This cavity is
                    subdivided into a false and a true pelvis. The false pelvis lies between the
                    expanded wing-like portions of the two ilia. The true pelvis lies below the two
                    pectineal lines and the base of the sacrum, which surround the upper orifice or
                    brim of the true pelvis, or pelvic inlet; whilst its lower orifice or outlet is
                    bounded behind by the coccyx, laterally by the ischial tuberosities, and in
                    front by the pubic arch. In the erect attitude the pelvis is so inclined that
                    the plane of the brim forms with the horizontal plane an angle of from 60° to
                    65°. The axis of the cavity is curved, and is represented by a line drawn
                    perpendicularly to the planes of the brim, the cavity, and the outlet; at the
                    brim it is directed upwards and forwards, at the outlet downwards and a little
                    forwards. Owing to the inclination of the pelvis, the base of the sacrum is
                    nearly 4 inches higher than the upper border of the pubic symphysis. The female
                    pelvis is distinguished from the male by certain sexual characters. The bones
                    are more slender, the ridges and processes for muscular attachment more feeble,
                    the breadth and capacity greater, the depth less, the ilia more expanded, giving
                    the greater breadth to the hips of a woman than a man; the inlet more nearly
                    circular, the pubic arch wider, the distance between the tuberosities greater,
                    and the obturator foramen more triangular in the female than in the male. The
                    greater capacity of the woman’s than the man’s pelvis is to afford greater room
                    for the expansion of the uterus during pregnancy, and for the expulsion of the
                    child at the time of birth.</p>
                <p>The Femur or Thigh-bone (Fig. 11) is the longest bone in the body, and consists
                    of a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity or <hi rend="italic"
                    >head</hi> possesses a smooth convex surface, in which an oval roughened fossa,
                    for the attachment of the inter-articular ligament of the hip, is found; from
                    the head a strong elongated <hi rend="italic">neck</hi> passes downwards and
                    outwards to join the upper end of the shaft; the place of junction is marked by
                    two processes or <hi rend="italic">trochanters:</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >external</hi> is of large size, and to it are attached many muscles; the <hi
                    rend="italic">internal</hi> is much smaller, and gives attachment to the psoas
                    and iliacus. A line drawn through the axis of the head and neck forms with a
                    vertical line drawn through the shaft an angle of 30°; in a woman this angle is
                    less obtuse than in a man, and the obliquity of the shaft of the femur is
                    greater in the former than in the latter. The shaft is almost cylindrical about
                    its centre, but expanded above and below; its front and sides give origin to the
                    extensor muscles of the leg; behind there is a rough ridge, which, though called
                    <hi rend="italic">linea aspera,</hi> is really a narrow surface and not a line;
                    it gives attachment to several muscles. The lower end of the bone presents a
                    large smooth articular surface for the knee-joint, the anterior portion of which
                    forms a <hi rend="italic">trochlea</hi> or pulley for the movements of the
                    patella, whilst the lower and posterior part is subdivided into two convex <hi
                    rend="italic">condyles</hi> by a deep fossa which gives attachment to the
                    crucial ligaments of the knee. The inner and outer surfaces of this end of the
                    bone are rough, for the attachment of muscles and the lateral ligaments of the
                    knee.</p>
                <p>The Patella or Knee-pan (Fig. 11) is a small triangular flattened bone developed
                    in the tendon of the great extensor muscles of the leg. Its anterior surface and
                    sides are rough, for the attachment of the fibres of that tendon; its posterior
                    surface is smooth, and enters into the formation of the knee-joint.</p>
                <p>Between the two bones of the leg there are no movements of pronation and
                    supination as between the two bones of the fore-arm. The tibia and fibula are
                    fixed in position; the fibula is always external, the tibia internal.</p>
                <p>The Tibia or Shin-bone (Fig. 11) is the larger and more important of the two
                    bones of the leg; the femur moves and rests upon its upper end, and down it the
                    weight of the body in the erect position is transmitted to the foot. Except the
                    femur, it is the longest bone of the skeleton, and consists of a shaft and two
                    extremities. The upper extremity is broad, and is expanded into two <hi
                    rend="italic">tuberosities,</hi> the external of which has a small articular
                    facet inferiorly, for the head of the fibula; superiorly, the tuberosities have
                    two smooth surfaces, for articulation with the condyles of the femur; they are
                    separated by an intermediate rough surface, from which a short <hi rend="italic"
                    >spine</hi> projects, which gives attachments to the inter-articular crucial
                    ligaments and semilunar cartilages of the knee, and lies opposite the
                    intercondyloid fossa of the femur. The shaft of the bone is three-sided; its
                    inner surface is subcutaneous, and forms the shin; its outer and posterior
                    surfaces are for the origin of muscles; the anterior border forms the sharp
                    ridge of the shin, and terminates superiorly in a tubercle for the inser-. tion
                    of the extensor tendon of the leg; the outer border, of the bone gives
                    attachment to the inter-osseous membrane of the leg. The lower end of the bone,
                    smaller than the upper, is prolonged into a broad process, <hi rend="italic"
                    >internal malleolus,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> which forms the
                    inner prominence of the ankle: its under <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> surface is
                    smooth for articulation with the astragalus; externally it articulates with the
                    lower end of the fibula. l <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>The Fibula, or Splint-bone of the leg (Fig. 11), is a slender long bone with a
                    shaft and two extremities. The upper end or <hi rend="italic">head</hi>
                    articulates with the outer tuberosity of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n879/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0879-0830"/> the tibia. The shaft is three-sided, and
                    roughened for the origins of muscles; along the inner surface is a slender ridge
                    for the attachment of the interosseous membrane. The lower end has a strong
                    process <hi rend="italic">(external malleolus')</hi> projecting downwards to
                    form the outer prominence of the anlde, and possesses a smooth inner surface for
                    articulation with the astragalus, above which is a rough surface for the
                    attachment of ligaments which bind together the tibia and fibula.</p>
                <p>The Foot consists of the Tarsus, the Metatarsus, and the five free Digits or
                    Toes, which is the maximum number found in mammals. The human foot is placed in
                    the prone position, with the sole or plantar surface in relation to the ground;
                    the dorsum or back of the foot directed upwards; the axis of the foot at about a
                    right angle to the axis of the leg; and the great toe or hallux, which is the
                    corresponding digit to the thumb, at the inner border of the foot. The human
                    foot, therefore, is a pentadactylous, plantigrade foot.</p>
                <p>The bones of the Tarsus, or Ankle (Fig. 11, Tr), are seven in number, and are
                    arranged in two transverse rows,—a proximal, next the bones of the leg,
                    consisting of the astragalus, os calcis, and scaphoid; a distal, next the
                    metatarsus, consisting of the cuboid, ecto-, meso-, and ento-cuneiform. If the
                    tarsal bones be looked at along with those of the metatarsus and toes, the bones
                    of the foot may be arranged in two longitudinal columns,—an outer, consisting of
                    the os calcis, cuboid, and the metatarsal bones and phalanges of the fourth and
                    fifth toes; an inner column consisting of the astragalus, scaphoid, three
                    cuneiform, and the metatarsal bones and phalanges of the first, second, and
                    third toes. The tarsal, like the carpal bones, are short and irregularly
                    cuboidal; the dorsal and plantar surfaces are as a rule rough for ligaments, but
                    as the astragalus is locked in between the bones of the leg and the os calcis,
                    its dorsal and plantar surfaces, as well as the dorsum of the os calcis, are
                    smooth for articulation; similarly, its lateral surfaces are smooth for
                    articulation with the two malleoli. The posterior surface of the os calcis
                    projects backwards to form the prominence of the heel. With this exception, the
                    bones have their anterior and posterior surfaces smooth for articulation. Their
                    lateral surfaces are also articular, except the outer surface of the os calcis
                    and cuboid, which form the outer border; and the inner surface of the os calcis,
                    scaphoid, and ento-cuneiform, which form the inner border of the tarsus. A
                    supernumerary bone is sometimes found in the human tarsus, from a subdivision of
                    either the ento-cunei-foπn, astragalus, os calcis, or cuboid into two parts. In
                    some rodents and other mammals eight is the normal number of bones in the
                    tarsus.</p>
                <p>The Metatarsal bones and the Phalanges of the toes agree in number and general
                    form with the metacarpal bones and the phalanges in the hand. The bones of the
                    great toe or hallux are more massive than those of the other digits, and this
                    digit, unlike the thumb or pollex, does not diverge from the other digits, but
                    lies almost parallel to them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Development and Homologies of the Skeleton.</hi></p>
                <p>It will now be advisable to consider briefly the mode of development of the
                    skeleton, and along with the study of its genesis to compare its several parts
                    with each other, in order to ascertain if correspondences in their arrangement
                    and mode of origin exist, even if they differ in the function or office which
                    they perform. When two or more parts or organs correspond with each other in
                    structure, relative position, and mode of origin, we say they are homologous
                    parts, or <hi rend="italic">homologues;</hi> whilst parts which have the same
                    function, but do not correspond in structure, relative position, and mode of
                    origin, are analogous parts, or <hi rend="italic">analogues.</hi> Homologous
                    parts have therefore a morphological identity with each other, whilst analogous
                    Krts have a physiological agreement. The same parts may be th homologous and
                    analogous, as the fore-limbs of a bat and a bird, both of which, with the same
                    fundamental type of structure, are subservient to flight. In other cases
                    analogous parts are not homologues, as is illustrated by the wing of the insect,
                    which, though subservient to flight, is fundamentally different in structure
                    from the wing of the bat or bird.</p>
                <p>In the germinal area of the fertilised vertebrate ovum a longitudinal groove
                    appears which marks the beginning of the cranial cavity and spinal canal of the
                    young embryo. At the bottom of this <hi rend="italic">craniospinal groove</hi> a
                    slender rod is formed, called <hi rend="italic">chorda dorsalis</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">notochord.</hi> Each side of the groove then becomes elevated as a
                    thin membrane, to meet behind to enclose a canal in which the brain and spinal
                    marrow are developed. Small dark masses, the primordial or <hi rend="italic"
                    >proto-</hi><hi rend="italic">vertebrae,</hi> next form on each side of the
                    chorda dorsalis. In these proto-vertebrae, about the sixth or seventh week of
                    intra-uterine life of the human ovum, little masses of cartilage appear, which
                    correspond in number and position to the future spinal vertebrae. The part of
                    the cartilage which forms the body of the future vertebra is developed around
                    the chorda dorsalis, which it encloses in its substance, whilst the
                    cartilaginous neural arch forms in the membrane which closes in the spinal
                    canal. The formation of these cartilaginous vertebrae is completed in the human
                    embryo about the fourth month of intra-uterine life. The bodies of the
                    cartilaginous vertebrae are connected together, by plates or discs of
                    intervening fibro-cartilage, which are also developed around the chorda
                    dorsalis. After the enclosure of the rod-like chorda by the cartilaginous
                    vertebrae and the inter-vertebral discs it disappears, no remains being found in
                    the adult human body, or in that of the higher vertebrates, except perhaps some
                    slight traces in the soft pulpy centres of the inter-vertebral discs; although
                    in the cartilaginous fish it remains as a more or less complete structure
                    throughout life.</p>
                <p>In each of the cartilaginous vertebrae bone begins to form and to spread beyond
                    its original point of formation, which is called a centre or nucleus of
                    ossification; the greater part of the body is formed from one of these centres,
                    and each half of the neural arch from another; whilst small ossifie centres
                    arise for the tips of the spinous, transverse, and mammillary processes, and a
                    special plate appears for both the upper and lower smfaces of the body; the
                    fusion of the various centres together to form a complete vertebra takes place
                    between the twentieth and twenty-fifth year. The atlas has a separate centre for
                    each lateral mass and one for the anterior boundary of the ring. The axis, in
                    addition to the ossifie centres found in the vertebrae generally, has one or two
                    for the odontoid process. The seventh cervical vertebra has the anterior bar of
                    its transverse process developed from a separate centre. Each coccygeal vertebra
                    possesses only a single centre, which represents the body of the bone.</p>
                <p>At the time when the cranio-spinal canal is being closed in by the development of
                    its membranous walls, the germinal layers of the young embryo grow towards its
                    anterior or ventral surface, and meet in the ventral mesial line, so as to
                    enclose the cavities in which the thoracic and abdominal viscera are developed.
                    In the membranous wall on each side of the thoracic cavity twelve cartilaginous
                    rods, the future ribs, are developed; and, connected with the anterior ends of
                    the seven pairs of upper ribs, the cartilaginous sternum is formed. Each rib
                    ossifies from one centre for its shaft, and one each for the head and tubercle.
                    The sternum ossifies in transverse segments,— one for the prae-stemum, one or
                    sometimes two for each of the four subdivisions of the meso-sternum, and one for
                    the xiphi-sternum. The complete ossification and fusion of the different parts
                    of the sternum into a single bone does not take place until an advanced age.</p>
                <p>The axial part of the skeleton, formed by the vertebrae, ribs, and sternum, is
                    built up of a series of thirty-three transverse segments, equal in number,
                    therefore, to the bones of the spine; so that each vertebra, according as it is,
                    or is not, articulated with a pair of ribs and a segment of the sternum,
                    constitutes a complete or incomplete transverse segment. These several segments
                    are serially homologous with each other, but the homology is not so complete in
                    some of the segments as in the others. In the coccygeal, sacral, and lumbar
                    regions of man and most vertebrates, only the vertebral portion of each skeletal
                    segment is represented, though in the abdominal wall of the crocodiles abdominal
                    ribs and a sternum are developed. In the thoracic region the five lowest dorsal
                    vertebrae have five pairs of ribs developed in connection with them; whilst the
                    seven highest vertebrae have not only their corresponding pairs of ribs, but
                    also a sternum, which bone, however, has only six transverse segments. In the
                    cervical region seven. vertebrae are found, but the anterior bar of the
                    transverse process, although fused with the vertebral body, is homologous with a
                    rib, for in man it sometimes develops as a distinct movable rib in connection
                    with the seventh cervical; and in the crocodiles small movable ribs are
                    regularly developed in connection with the different cervical vertebrae. The
                    bodies and neural aχches of the vertebrae are serially homologous with each
                    other; as a rule this is also the case with their processes, but the articular
                    processes of the atlas and the superior pair of the axis, although functionally
                    analogous, are not homologous with the articular processes of the other
                    vertebrae, but with the articular surfaces for the ribs on the bodies of the
                    dorsal <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n880/mode/1up"

                    The development of the odontoid process of the axis shows it to.be the body of
                    the atlas displaced from its proper bone and fused with the body of the
                    axis.</p>
                <p>The development and homology of the skull is a much more difficult problem to
                    solve than that of the spine. The chorda dorsalis extends along the floor of the
                    skull as far forward as the posterior wall of the pituitary fossa. Cartilage is
                    formed around it, without, however, the previous production of proto-vertebrae,
                    and ⅜l∏∙ s cartilage is prolonged forward on each side of the fossa, forming two
                    bars, the trabeculae cranii; these bars then unite, and form the mes-ethmoid
                    cartilage; at the same time the cartilage grows outwards for some distance in
                    the membranous wall of the skull, but it does not mount upwards so as to close
                    it in superiorly, so that the cartilage is limited to the floor of the skull;
                    moreover, the cartilage is not segmented. The roof, side walls, and anterior
                    wall of the cranium retain for a time their primordial membranous structure.
                    This membrane is prolonged downwards into the face proper, where it forms a pair
                    of maxillary lobes or processes, which pass forwards beneath the eyes to form
                    the side parts of the face, and a mid-or frontal-nasal process, into which the
                    cartilaginous mes-ethmoid extends. Immediately below each maxillary lobe four
                    arches, called <hi rend="italic">branchial</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >visceral,</hi> arise in the ventral aspect of the head, and in each of the
                    three first of these arches a rod of cartilage is formed. The arches on opposite
                    sides unite with each other in the ventral mesial line, but those on the same
                    side are separated from each other by intermediate branchial clefts; these
                    clefts all close up in course of time, except the upper part of the first, which
                    remains as the external meatus of the ear, the tympanum, and the Eustachian
                    tube; whilst the interval between the first visceral arch and the maxillary
                    lobes forms the cavity of the mouth. The conversion of the primordial
                    cartilaginous and membranous cranium into the bones of the head takes place by
                    the formation in it of numerous centres of ossification. The basi-, ex-, and so
                    much of the supra-occipital as lies below the superior curved line, are formed
                    from distinct centres in the cartilaginous floor of the skull; whilst the part
                    of the supra-occipital above the curved line arises from independent .centres in
                    the membranous cranium, the whole ultimately fusing together to form the
                    occipital bone. The basi-or post-sphenoid, the pre-with the orbito-sphenoids,
                    the ali-sphenoid with the external pterygoid and the internal pterygoid, also
                    arise in the cartilaginous floor, and they, together with the sphenoidal spongy
                    bones which are formed in the membranous cranium, fuse into the sphenoid bone.
                    The palate is apparently formed by ossification of cartilage continuous with the
                    bar in which the internal pterygoid arises. The central plate and each lateral
                    mass of the ethmoid also arise in the cartilage by distinct centres. The
                    inferior turbinal has also a distinct origin in cartilage. The petro-mastoid
                    part of the temporal arises in cartilage from at least three centres, peri-,
                    pro-, and opisth-otic, and soon blends with the squamous and tympanic elements
                    which arise in the membranous cranium; subsequently the styloid process, which
                    is ossified in the rod of cartilage in the second visceral arch, joins the
                    temporal. The lower end of this same rod forms the lesser cornu of the hyoid;
                    the upper end forms two small bones, the stapes and incus, situated within the
                    cavity of the tympanum. The cartilage of the third visceral arch forms the great
                    cornu and body of the hyoid bone. The name of Meckel’s cartilage is applied to
                    the rod found in the first visceral arch; its upper end is ossified into the
                    malleus, a small bone situated in the tympanic cavity; whilst in the membrane
                    surrounding the rest of the cartilage the lower jaw-bone is formed. The parietal
                    and frontal bones arise altogether in the membranous vault; and the nasal,
                    lachrymal, malar, and superior maxillae arise in connection with the bones which
                    form the face; the vomer is developed in the membrane investing the mes-ethmcid
                    cartilage. The human superior maxilla represents not only the superior maxilla
                    of other vertebrates, but the pre-maxillary bone also; but the two bones become
                    fused together at so very early a period that it is difficult to recognise their
                    original independence. In the deformity of hare-lip and cleft palate, they are
                    not unfrequently separated by a distinct fissure.</p>
                <p>Since the time when 0ken and Goethe propounded the theory that the skull was
                    built up of several vertebrae, the vertebral structure of the skull has led to
                    much discussion amongst anatomists. Every one admits that the skull is in series
                    with the spine, that the cranial cavity is continuous with the spinal canal, and
                    that the cranial vault is formed in the wall of the embryonic cerebro-spinal
                    canal. The skull also, like the spine, is transversely segmented, but whether we
                    regard these segments as vertebrae or not wiD depend upon the conception we
                    entertain of the meaning of the term vertebra. If with Owen we define a vertebra
                    to be “one of those segments of the endo-skeleton which constitute the axis of
                    the body and the protective canals of the nervous and vascular trunks,” then we
                    may support the vertebral nature of the cranial segments on the following
                    grounds :—lsi, The presence of a series of bones extending forwards from the
                    foramen magnum along the basis cranii, in series with the bodies of the spinal
                    vertebrae,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the basi-occipital, basi-sphenoid,
                    pre-sphenoid, mes-ethmoid (Fig. 7); 2d, The presence of a series of neural
                    arches which enclose and complete the wall of the cranial cavity, and lie in
                    series with the neural arches of the spinal vertebrae,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the ex-and supra-occi-pitals, which form the neural arches of the
                    basi-occipital segment; the ali-sphenoids and parietals, which form the neural
                    arches of the basi-sphenoid segment; the orbito-sphenoids and frontal, which
                    form the neural arches of the pre-sphenoid segment; 3d, The presence of a series
                    of visceral arches of which the mandibular and hyoidean enclose the alimentary
                    and vascular canals, just as the ribs enclose them in the thorax; and <hi
                    rend="italic">4th,</hi> The presence of foramina between the cranial segments
                    like the inter-vertebral foramina between the spinal vertebrae for the
                    transmission of nerves,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the sphenoidal fissure and
                    the jugular foramen.</p>
                <p>But if we are to regard a vertebra as a segment of the axial skeleton, which in
                    course of its formation passes through a definite series of developmental
                    changes, then the cranial segments cannot be regarded as vertebrae in the same
                    sense as the spinal segments; for, lsi, The chorda dorsalis is not co-equal in
                    length with the basis cranii, as with the bodies of the spinal vertebrae, so
                    that if the basi-occipital and basi-sphenoid segments, the bodies of which are
                    developed around it, were to be regarded as cranial vertebrae, the
                    pre-sphenoidal and ethmoido-nasal would not be morphologically the same, as they
                    are formed in front of the anterior end of the chorda. <hi rend="italic"
                    >2d,</hi> Proto-vertebrae are formed in the spine, but not in the basis cranii,
                    <hi rend="italic">⅛d,</hi> The spine is transversely segmented in its
                    cartilaginous stage of development, but the skull is not. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atlι,</hi> The transverse segmentation of the skull only appears when the bones
                    are formed, but the individuality of the segments becomes again concealed by the
                    fusion of the pre-and basi-sphenoids and the basi-occipital into a continuous
                    bar of bone, a condition which is not found in the spine except in the
                    sacro-coccygeal region, <hi rend="italic">ζ&gt;th,</hi> The neural arches in the
                    spine are, like the bodies, ossified in cartilage, but in the cranium they are
                    for the most part ossified in membrane. These differences in the mode of
                    development of the spine and basis cranii may be summarised as below :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spine.</hi><hi rend="italic">1st Stage, 2d Stage, ⅛d Stage, 4th

                    bones.</p>
                <p>It is evident, therefore, that, although both skull and spine are developed in
                    the walls of the cerebro-spinal groove, yet, to quote the words of Huxley,
                    “though they are identical in general plan of construction, the two begin to
                    diverge as soon as the one puts on the special character of a skull and the
                    other that of a vertebral column; the skull is no more a modified vertebral
                    column than the vertebral column is a modified skull.”</p>
                <p>The limbs, at their first appearance, sprout like little buds or lappets from the
                    sides of the trunk; cartilage forms within them, which assumes the shape of the
                    future bones, and as the limbs grow outwards, manifestations of joints appear,
                    and the subdivision of each limb into its several segments takes place. The
                    clavicle, which ossifies before any of the other bones, begins, to form,
                    however, in fibrous membrane; and at a much later period the ends of the bone,
                    which are formed in cartilage, unite with the intermediate shaft. The scapula
                    ossifies from one centre for its expanded plate and spine, two small centres
                    each for the acromion and vertebral border, and one for the coracoid. In many
                    vertebrates, more especially birds and reptiles, the coracoid is a distinct bone
                    from the scapula, but they articulate with each other to form the glenoitf
                    fossa. Each of the three rod-like bones of which the innomina⅛ bone is composed,
                    ossifies from one centre for the shaft of the bone, and one for each extremity;
                    in the ilium these terminal centres an situated at the crest and acetabulum; in
                    the ischium, at the tubeτ and acetabulum; and in the pubis, at the symphysis and
                    acetabulum. Each of the long bones of the shafts of the limbs ossifies from a
                    single centre for the shaft, and one or more centres for each articular
                    extremity. Each carpal and tarsal bone ossifies from a single centre, except the
                    os calcis, which possesses an independent centre for its posterior' surface. The
                    metacarpal and metatarsal bones and the phalanges ossify each from two centres,
                    one for the shaft and one for one of the extremities. In the metacarpal bones of
                    the fingers and the four outer metatarsals, the distal end is that which
                    ossifies independently; in the metacarpal of the thumb, in the metatarsal of the
                    great toe, and in all the phalanges, the proximal end is that which ossifies
                    independently. As the method of ossification oî the first metacarpal and first
                    metatarsal corresponds with that of the phalanges, some anatomists hold that
                    these bones are really the first phalanges of their respective digits, and that
                    the bone which is absent in these digits, when compared with the other digits,
                    is not a phalanx, but a meta-carpal or tarsal bone. When the extremity <pb

                    the centre from which the shaft arises, it 13 called an <hi rend="italic"
                    >epiphysis.</hi> The epiphysis is united to the shaft of the growing bone by an
                    intermediate plate of cartilage, and so long as any of this cartilage remains
                    unossified the bone can continue to grow in length. The ossification is not
                    completed in the different bones until from the twentieth to the twenty-fifth
                    year. In the case of the long bones, the epiphysis situated at the end of the
                    bone, towards which the canal in the shaft which transmits the nutrient artery
                    is directed, ossifies to the shaft before the epiphysis at the other end. In the
                    humerus, tibia, and fibula, where the canal is directed downwards, the epiphyses
                    at the lower ends of the bones first unite with the shaft; whilst in the femur,
                    radius, and ulna, where the canal is directed upwards, the ossification first
                    takes place between the upper epiphysis and the shaft.</p>
                <p>All anatomists hold that the bones of the shaft and distal part of a limb belong
                    to the appendicular part of the skeleton, but there is a difference of opinion
                    as to the place in the skeleton to which the bones of the shoulder girdle and
                    haunch are to be referred. Owen considers that the scapular and pelvic arches
                    belong to the axial skeleton, and are homologous with the ribs; the scapula and
                    coracoid as the visceral or rib-arch of the occipital vertebra, the clavicle of
                    the atlas, and the innominate bone of the upper sacral vertebra. Goodsir
                    objected to this conclusion of Owen’s on the ground that the shoulder girdle was
                    not in series with the visceral arches, but was developed outside the visceral
                    wall, at the junction of the cervical and thoracic regions, from which region
                    the upper limb receives its nerves, ana not from the occipito-atlantal region,
                    whence they would have proceeded had it been an appendage of the rib-arches of
                    those segments. Owen’s chief argument for regarding the scapula and coracoid as
                    the costal arch of the occipital vertebra is because in fish the scapula is
                    attached to the occipital bone by a bone which Cuvier called the supra-scapula,
                    and which he believed to be homologous with the supra-scapular cartilage of many
                    other vertebrates. Parker, however, has recently pointed out that the so-called
                    supra-scapula of a fish is not homologous with the supra-scapula of a reptile or
                    mammal, that it is not a cartilage bone, but is a splint or scale-like bone,
                    developed as a part of the dermo-skeleton. Between the scapula and coracoid and
                    the innominate bone, anatomists have long recognised homologies to exist; the
                    scapula is generally admitted to be the homotype of the ilium and the coracoid
                    of the ischium, so that if these elements of the shoulder girdle be not a costal
                    arch, neither can those of the pelvic girdle. The clavicle has by some been
                    regarded as the homotype of the pubis; but in all probability the pubis is
                    homologous with the procoracoid bone which is found in the amphibia and some
                    reptiles, but is absent in crocodiles, birds, and mammals; whilst the clavicle
                    is represented in the pelvic girdle, not by a bone, but by a fibrous band called
                    Poupart’s ligament. Between the bones of the shafts of the limbs homologies
                    exist: the humerus is the homotype of the femur, the radius of the tibia, the
                    ulna of the fibula; whilst the patella has no representative in the human upper
                    limb. The scaphoid and semilunar bones in the carpus are homotypes of the
                    astragalus in the tarsus, the cuneiform is the homotype of the os calcis, the
                    cuboid of the unciform; the trapezium of the ento-cuneiform, the trapezoid of
                    the meso-, and the os magnum of the ecto-cuneiform. The tarsal scaphoid is not,
                    as a rule, represented in the human carpus, but its homotype is the os
                    intermedium, found in many mammals. The carpal pisciform is a sesamoid bone
                    developed in the tendon of a muscle. The metacarpal bones and phalanges are
                    homologous with the metatarsal bones and phalanges; the thumb with the great
                    toe, and the fingers with the four outer toes. During the growth of the limbs
                    outward, and their change from the simple lappet-like form to their elongated
                    condition, a rotation of the proximal segment of the shaft takes place—that of
                    the upper limb a quarter of a circle backward, that of the lower limb a quarter
                    of a circle forward—to produce in the former case a supine position of the
                    fore-arm and hand, with the thumb as the outermost digit; in the latter case, a

                    The range of movement at the radio-ulnar joints enables us, however, to pronate
                    the hand and fore-arm by throwing the radius across the ulna, so as to make the
                    thumb the innermost digit. In many quadrupeds the fore-leg is fixed in this
                    position, so that these animals walk on the soles of both the fore and hind
                    feet.</p>

                <p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">Joint</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Articulation</hi> is
                    the junction or union of any two adjacent parts of the body. Most usually the
                    term is employed to signify the connection established between contiguous bones.
                    It is by the joints that the various bones are knit together to form the
                    skeleton. Joints may be either <hi rend="italic">immovable</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">movable.</hi></p>
                <p>The immovable joints are divided into the <hi rend="italic">synchondroses</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">sutures.</hi> A <hi rend="italic">synchondrosis</hi>
                    is the junction of two bones by the interposition of an intermediate plate of
                    cartilage, the fibrous membrane or periosteum which invests the bones being
                    prolonged from one bone to the other over the surface of the cartilage. A <hi
                    rend="italic">suture</hi> is the connection of two bones by the interlocking of
                    adjacent toothed margins; the periosteal fibrous membrane is prolonged from one
                    bone to the other, and is also interposed between their adjacent margins. In a
                    young skull the basi-occipital and basi-sphenoid are united by synchondrosis,
                    but junction by sutures is the mode of union which prevails in the bones of the
                    head. In old persons the sutures become obliterated by the ossification of the
                    intermediate fibrous membrane, and the bones are permanently fused together. The
                    cranial sutures may conveniently be arranged in three groups: <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> Median longitudinal, consisting of the frontal suture, which connects
                    the two halves of the frontal bone, and the sagittal suture, between the two
                    parietal bones; ⅛, Lateral longitudinal, consisting on each side of the head of
                    the fronto-nasal, fronto-maxillary, fronto-lachrymal, frontoethmoidal,
                    fronto-malar, fronto-sphenoidal, parieto-sphe-noidal, parieto-squamous,
                    parieto-mastoid sutures; ^Vertical transverse, consisting of the coronal or
                    fronto-parietal, the lambdoidal or parieto-occipital, the sphenoido-malar,
                    sphenoido-squamous and occipito-mastoid sutures. As the skull grows by
                    ossification of the cartilage of the base and the membranous vault, the
                    direction of growth is perpendicular to the margins of the bones and the sutures
                    and synchondroses which connect them together. The growth of the skull in length
                    is perpendicular, therefore, to the basi-cranial synchondrosis and the vertical
                    transverse group of sutures; its growth, in breadth, to the median longitudinal
                    group, and in height to the lateral longitudinal group. So long as any of the
                    cartilage or membrane between the margins of the bones remains unossified, bone
                    may continue to form, and the skull may increase in size. It sometimes happens
                    that the cartilage or membrane is prematurely ossified in a particular locality,
                    and the further growth of the skull put a stop to in that region; if the brain
                    is still growing, the skull must increase in other directions to permit of the
                    expansion of the cranial cavity, and deformities of the skull are thereby
                    occasioned. One of the most usual of these deformities is due to premature
                    closure of the sagittal suture, causing <pb break="no"

                    and, byway of compensation, great increase in its length, so as to produce a
                    very elongated and somewhat boat-shaped cranium.</p>
                <p>The movable joints are divided into the <hi rend="italic">amphiarthrodial</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">diarthrodial</hi> joints. An amphiarthrosis or
                    halfjoint has only a feeble range of movement. It consists of two bones, each of
                    which has its articular surface covered by a plate of cartilage, and which
                    plates are firmly connected together by an intermediate disc of fibro-cartilage.
                    The centre of this disc is soft, or may even be hollowed out into a cavity,
                    lined by a smooth synovial membrane, and containing a little fluid.</p>
                <p>Ligamentous bands, continuous with the periosteum investing the bones, invest the
                    fibro-cartilage, and assist in binding the bones together. The best examples of
                    amphiarthrodial joints are furnished by the articulations between the bodies of
                    the true vertebrae.</p>
                <p>A diarthrosis admits of more or less perfect movement. In it the two articular
                    surfaces are each covered by a plate of encrusting cartilage, the free surface
                    of which is smooth and polished; between these surfaces is a cavity containing a
                    glairy fluid, the <hi rend="italic">synovia,</hi> for lubricating the smooth
                    surfaces of the cartilage and facilitating the movements of the joint. This
                    cavity is enclosed by ligaments, which are attached to the bones, and the inner
                    surface of these ligaments is lined by a synovial membrane which secretes the
                    synovia. Sometimes a plate or meniscus of fibro-cartilage is interposed between,
                    without, however, being attached to the encrusting cartilages of a diarthrodial
                    joint, so as more or less perfectly to subdivide the cavity enclosed by the
                    ligaments into two spaces. The articular surfaces of diarthrodial joints are
                    retained in apposition with each other, sometimes by investing Hgaments, at
                    others by surrounding muscles and tendons; at others by atmospheric pressure,
                    aided by the adhesive character of the interposed synovia. The form of the
                    articular or movable surfaces varies very materially in different examples of
                    these joints, and the modifications in form determine the direction of the
                    movements of the joints. In some, as the carpal and tarsal joints, the surfaces
                    are almost flat, so that they glide on each other; the movement is comparatively
                    slight, and about an axis perpendicular to the moving surfaces: these are called
                    <hi rend="italic">planesurfaced</hi> joints. In other joints the articular
                    surfaces may be regarded as produced by the rotation of a straight or curved
                    line about an axis lying in the same plane; these are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >rotation joints,</hi> and they present various modifications according to the
                    direction and relation of the rotating line to the axis. One form of a rotation
                    joint is the <hi rend="italic">pivot joint,</hi> in which the movement takes
                    place about the axis of one of the bones, which is the axis of rotation of the
                    joint; examples of this joint are found in the joint between the atlas and
                    odontoid process of the axis and the radio-ulnar joint. Another form is the <hi
                    rend="italic">ginglymus</hi> oι <hi rend="italic">hinge joint,</hi> in which the
                    axis of rotation of the joint is perpendicular to the axis of the two bones; the
                    mover ments of the hinge are called flexion when the angle between the two bones
                    is diminished, and extension when the angle is increased. An important
                    modification of the ginglymus is the <hi rend="italic">screwed-surfaced
                    joint,</hi> examples of which are found in the elbow and ankle; here the plane
                    of flexion is not perpendicular, but oblique to the axis of the joint. The <hi
                    rend="italic">saddle-shaped</hi> and <hi rend="italic">oblong joints</hi> are
                    also modified hinges, but allow motion about two axes; in the oblong both axes
                    are on the same side of the joint; but in the saddle-shaped there is an axis of
                    rotation on each side of the joint. The best example of the saddle-shaped is
                    found between the metacarpal bone of the thumb and the trapeziam; of the oblong
                    between the fore-arm and the carpus. In the <hi rend="italic">ball-andrsocket
                    joint</hi> a spheroidal head fits into a cup, and rotation takes place about any
                    diameter of the sphere; the joint therefore is multi-axial; the hip and shoulder
                    joints are the best examples. Some joints, in which the forms of the articular
                    surfaces are more complex, are called <hi rend="italic">composite;</hi> in them
                    the movements of a hinge and of a ball-and-socket joint may be combined; the
                    knee may be cited as an example of this form of articulation. In a large number
                    of movable joints only portions of the opposite articular surfaces are in
                    contact with each other at a given time; but, as the joint describes its path of
                    movement, different parts of the surfaces come into contact with each other
                    successively, and it is not unusual to find the articular surface both of the
                    cartilage and the subjacent bone mapped out into distinct areas or facets, which
                    are adapted to corresponding facets on the opposite articular surface in
                    particular positions of the joint. When the corresponding facets on opposite
                    articular surfaces break contact with each other, the space between becomes
                    occupied by synovia, or in some joints, more especially the knee, by folds of
                    synovial membrane enclosing clumps of fat, which have been called synovial pads.
                    In the simple hinge, in that with screwed surfaces, in the oblong and composite
                    joints, the principal ligaments are situated at the sides of the joint, and are
                    called <hi rend="italic">lateral;</hi> they not only prevent lateral
                    displacement of the bones, but, by a tightening of their fibres, check excessive
                    movement forwards or backwards during flexion and extension. In the
                    saddle-shaped and ball-and-socket joints, the joint is included within a
                    bag-like ligament called <hi rend="italic">capsular.</hi> In the pivot joints
                    the cavity in which the pivot fits is completed by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >transverse</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">ring-shaped</hi> ligament.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Muscles</hi> are the organs which, by their contraction
                    or shortening, move the bones on each other at the joints. The muscles
                    constitute the flesh of the body. They are so arranged as to be capable not only
                    of moving the various bones on each other, but the entire body from place to
                    place. Hence the muscles are organs both of motion and locomotion. As they can
                    be brought into action at the <hi rend="italic">will</hi> of the individual,
                    they are called voluntary muscles. Some of the muscles are engaged in the
                    movement of other structures than the bones, such as the eye-ball, tongue,
                    cartilages of the larynx, &amp;c. About 400 muscles are usually enumerated, and
                    the names applied to them express either their position, or relative size, or
                    shape, or direction, or attachments, or mode of action. The word muscle is
                    itself derived from the Latin <hi rend="italic">musculus,</hi> a little mouse,
                    from a fancied resemblance between that animal and some of the most simply
                    formed muscles. It is customary to distinguish in a muscle a central part, or
                    <hi rend="italic">belly,</hi> and two extremities<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n883/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0883-0834"/>, one of which is the <hi rend="italic">head</hi>
                    or the <hi rend="italic">origin,</hi> the other the <hi rend="italic"
                    >insertion.</hi> The belly is the fleshy part of the muscle, and possesses a
                    deep-red characteristic colour; it is the active contractile structure, the
                    source of motor power. The two extremities are called the tendons of the muscle,
                    or sinews; the tendons are bluish-white in colour, possess no power of
                    contractility, and are merely, as it were, the ropes by which the belly of the
                    muscle is attached to the bone or other structure which is moved by its
                    contraction. The term tendon of origin, applied to one extremity of the muscle,
                    signifies the fixed end of the muscle, that to which it draws during its
                    contraction; as a rule this is the end nearest the trunk, the proximal end. The
                    term tendon of insertion is applied to the end which is moved by the
                    contraction; as a rule this is the end most removed from the trunk, the distal
                    end. Entering the substance of each muscle is at least one artery, which conveys
                    blood for its nutrition; this artery ends in a network of capillary
                    blood-vessels, from which a vein arises and conveys the blood out of the muscle
                    again; another small vessel, called a lymphatic, also arises within the muscle,
                    and conveys the fluid lymph out of the muscle. Each muscle also is penetrated by
                    a nerve, through which it is brought into connection with the brain, so as to be
                    subject to the influence of the will. The will is the natural stimulus for
                    exciting muscular action, which action is in many cases so rapid that scarcely
                    an appreciable interval of time intervenes between willing and doing the
                    action.</p>
                <p>The bones form a series of rod-like levers, and, in studying the mode of action
                    of the muscles, the place of insertion of the muscle into the bone—that is to
                    say, the point of application of the power which causes the movement— and its
                    relations to the joint, or fulcrum, or centre of motion, and to the weight or
                    resistance which is to be overcome, have to be kept in view. The relative
                    positions of fulcrum, point of application of power, and resistance, are not the
                    same in all the bony levers. As a rule, the muscles are inserted into bones
                    between the fulcrum and the moveable point of resistance, and nearer the fulcrum
                    than the movable point, as may be seen in the muscles which bend the fore-arm at
                    the elbow-joint. Although from the weightarm of the lever being in these cases
                    much longer than the power-arm, the muscles, as regards the application of the
                    power, act at a disadvantage, yet the movement gains in velocity. Sometimes the
                    muscle is inserted, as is the case in the great muscle which straightens or
                    extends the fore-arm, at one end of the lever, and the fulcrum or joint is
                    placed between it and the movable point. At other times, as in the case of the
                    chief depressor muscle of the lower jaw, whilst the muscle is attached to one
                    end of the lever, the fulcrum is at the opposite end. When a muscle is so placed
                    that its tendon of insertion is perpendicular to the bone to which it is
                    attached, it acts to great advantage; when placed obliquely or nearly parallel,
                    a loss of power occurs. Many muscles at the commencement of contraction lie
                    obliquely to the bones which they move, but as contraction goes on they become
                    more nearly perpendicular, so that they act with more advantage near the close
                    than at the commencement of contraction. If a muscle passes over only one joint,
                    it acts on that joint only: but if it passes over two or more joints, it acts on
                    them in succession, beginning with the joint next the point of insertion. A
                    given movement may be performed by the contraction of a single muscle, but as a
                    rule two or more muscles are associated together, and they are not unfrequently
                    so arranged that one muscle initiates the movement, which is then kept up and
                    completed by the rest. Muscles producing movement in one direction have opposed
                    to them muscles which by their contraction effect the opposite movement; w <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> hen both groups act simultaneously and with equal
                    force, they antagonise each other, and no motion is produced; when a muscle is
                    paralysed or divided, its antagonistic muscle draws and permanently retains the
                    part to its own side. The rapidity of action of a muscle is proportioned to the
                    length of its fasciculi, its power of contraction to their number.</p>
                <p>Each muscle is invested by a sheath formed of connective tissue. In the limbs and
                    in the neck not only has each muscle a sheath, but a strong fibrous membrane
                    envelopes the whole of the muscles, and assists materially in giving form and
                    compactness to the region. This membrane is called generally a <hi rend="italic"
                    >fascia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">aponeurosis,</hi> but special descriptive
                    names are given to it in the different regions— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    cervical fascia, brachial aponeurosis, fascia lata, or fascia of the thigh. In
                    some localities muscles arise from the fascia, and in others they are inserted
                    into it. The fascia is separated from the skin by a layer of subcutaneous fatty
                    tissue, and in this layer muscles are in some localities developed. In the fat

                    rend="italic">palmaris</hi><hi rend="italic">brevis,</hi> is found, which is
                    inserted into the skin covering the ball of the little finger; at each side of
                    the neck, also, lies a thin muscle called <hi rend="italic">platysma
                    myoides,</hi> and the muscles on the face and scalp which move the skin of the
                    face and head belong to the same category. These muscles form the group of
                    subcutaneous or dermal muscles which, except in the localities above referred
                    to, are not represented in the human body, but are well known in the bodies of
                    the mammalia generally as the <hi rend="italic">panniculus carnosus.</hi></p>
                <p>In arranging the muscles for descriptive purposes, either a morphological, a
                    topographical, or a physiological method may be pursued. The morphological
                    arrangement is to be preferred when the object is to compare the muscular system
                    in man with that in different animals, and the basis of the arrangement should
                    be into muscles of the axial, the appendicular, and the axi-appendicular
                    skeletons, and sub-cutaneous muscles; a topographical arrangement is most
                    suitable for the purposes of the practical surgeon; a physiological arrangement,
                    when the object is to study the action of the muscles in connection with the
                    movements of the joints. In Plates XV. and XVI., a front and back view of the
                    voluntary muscles of the body is given.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Intervertebral Joints</hi> are complex in construction. The
                    bodies of the true vertebrae are connected together by an amphiarthrodial joint:
                    the fibro-cartilaginous plate or intervertebral disc is tough and fibrous in its
                    peripheral part, but soft and pulpy within. (Fig. 15.) Remains of the chorda
                    dorsalis are said to occur in the soft pulp, and sometimes a distinct cavity,
                    lined by a synovial membrane, is found in the centre of the disc, which in the
                    finner whales is expanded into a large central cavity containing many ounces of
                    synovia. A diarthrodial joint connects the superior and inferior articular
                    processes of adjacent vertebrae on each side. Elastic yellow ligaments, the <hi

                    >Inter-</hi> and <hi rend="italic">supra-spinous</hi> ligaments connect
                    -adjacent spinous processes, and in the neck the supra-spinous ligament forms a
                    broad band, the <hi rend="italic">ligamentum,</hi><hi rend="italic">nuchoe.</hi>
                    In those mammals which possess big heads or heavy horns, this ligament of the
                    back of the neck forms a powerful elastic band for the support of the head. The
                    joints between the atlas and axis, and the atlas and occiput, are specially
                    modified in connection with the movements of the head on the top of the spine.
                    The intervertebral discs are absent, and the range of movement either from
                    before backward, as in nodding the head, or from side to side, as in looking
                    over the shoulder, are more extensive than between any of the other true
                    vertebrae. The head rotates along with the atlas around the odontoid or pivot
                    process of the axis, which is lodged between the anterior part of the atlas and
                    a strong transverse ligament which lies behind the odontoid. Too great movement
                    to one side or the other'is prevented by the check ligaments, which pass from
                    the top of the odontoid to the occipital bone, in front of the foramen magnum.
                    The nodding movements take place between the occiput and atlas, and are
                    permitted by the size and shape of the occipital condyles and hollow upper
                    articular surfaces of the atlas. These joints are all diarthrodial. The spine is
                    flexible and elastic; except in the joints above referred to, the range of
                    movement between any two true vertebrae is very small, but the sum of the
                    movement in the entire spine, owing to the number of bones, is considerable. The
                    elasticity of the spine is partly due to the numerous diarthrodial joints
                    between its articular processes, but more especially to the discs of
                    fibro-cartilage interposed between the bodies of the vertebrae, which act like
                    elastic pads or buffers to prevent shock. The spine and trunk may be bent either
                    forwards or backwards, or to the right and left side; or without being bent, the
                    spine may be screwed to the right or to the left, the screwing movement being
                    permitted by the oblique direction of the articular processes.</p>
                <p>The muscles which move the vertebrae on each other are principally situated on
                    the back of the trunk. In the hollow on each side of the vertebral spines lies
                    the great erector spin» muscle, the fibres of which pass longitudinally upwards.
                    When both muscles act together, the entire spine is bent back; but when the
                    muscle of one side only contracts, then the spine is bent to that side. These
                    muscles also act in raising the spine from the bent to the erect position, and
                    they are assisted by small inter-spinal muscles, situated between the spines in
                    the cervical and lumbar regions. The spine is bent forward by the psoae and
                    longi colli muscles; and the straight muscles of the abdomen, inserted into the
                    lower true ribs, assist in this movement. The screwing movements of the spine
                    are effected by a series of muscles, the fibres of which pass obliquely between
                    the laminae and spines of adjacent vertebrae, and are known as the semispinales,
                    multifidi, and rotatores spinae muscles.</p>
                <p>The head is balanced on the summit of the spine, and is maintained in a quiescent
                    position without any appreciable muscular action, but it can be moved in various
                    directions by the muscles inserted into its bones. The nodding movements of the
                    head on the atlas are due to the posterior recti, the two superior obliques, the
                    two splenii, and the two complexus muscles, which draw it backwards, and the
                    anterior recti and stemo-cleido-mastoid muscles, which draw it forwards. When
                    the right splenius and greater posterior rectus and inferior oblique act along
                    with the left complexus and sterno-mastoid, the head is rotated to the right
                    shoulder; the opposite rotation being due to the action of the corresponding
                    muscles on the other side of the body.</p>
                <p>In the formation of the walls of the abdomen proper, bones and joints play but a
                    small part. The lumbar vertebrae behind, the expanded wings of the iliac bones
                    below, and the false ribs above, are the only bones to be considered. Three
                    pairs of greatly expanded muscles— the external oblique, internal oblique, and
                    transverse—lie at the sides and in front, and two pairs of muscles tho recti and
                    pyramidales—are situated wholly in front. The internal oblique and the
                    transverse muscles are attached above to the ribs, behind to the lumbar spine,
                    below to the iliac crest and to a strong band, Poupart’s ligament, extending
                    from the crest of the ilium to the pubic spine; the external oblique has similar
                    connections above and below, but is not attached behind to the lumbar spine. The
                    muscles all terminate in front in strong expanded tendons, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">anterior abdominal aponeuroses,</hi> which blend together in the
                    middle line anteriorly to form the band called <hi rend="italic">linea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">alba,</hi> which stretches longitudinally from the xiphi-ternum to
                    the pubic symphysis. These expanded tendons enclose the recti muscles, which
                    pass from the pubis upwards to the cartilages of the lower true ribs, and the
                    pyramidal muscles, which pass from the pubis to be inserted into the hnea alba.
                    The entire arrangement is admirably adapted for completing the walls of the
                    great abdominal chamber, and for enabling the muscles to compress the abdominal
                    viscera, an action which takes place when the contents of the bowels and bladder
                    are being expelled during defecation and micturition.</p>
                <p>Bones and joints play a more important part in the formation of the walls of the
                    thoracic than of the abdominal cavity. Not only are there thoracic vertebrae
                    behind, and the sternum in front, but on each side the twelve ribs arch more or
                    less completely forward from the spine; each rib is articulated behind to one or
                    two vertebrae, and the seven upper ribs, through their costal cartilages,
                    articulate with the sternum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Costo-vertébral</hi><hi rend="italic">Joints</hi> are
                    situated between the head of the rib and the vertebral body; also, except in the
                    floating ribs, between the tubercle of the rib and the transverse process of the
                    vertebra, the joints being diarthrodial, and completed in the usual manner by
                    ligaments and synovial membrane. The <hi rend="italic">Costo-stèmal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Joints</hi> are also diarthrodial (except the first costal
                    cartilage, which is directly united to the prae-sternum), a capsular ligament,
                    lined by a synovial membrane, connecting the cartilages of the true ribs to the
                    sternum. The cartilages from the sixth to the ninth ribs are also united by
                    ligamentous fibres.</p>
                <p>The movements of the ribs and sternum at the costovertebral and costo-sternal
                    joints are of the utmost importance in the process of breathing. . Breathing or
                    respiration consists of two acts—breathing in, or inspiration, and breathing
                    out, or expiration. During inspiration, the air rushes through the nose or mouth
                    down the windpipe, and dilates the air-cells of the lungs; together with the
                    expansion of the lungs the walls of the chest rise, so that the capacity both of
                    lungs and chest at the end of a full inspiration is nearly doubled. During
                    inspiration the following changes occur in the walls of the chest: the ribs are
                    elevated and rotated, the lower borders of their shafts are everted, while their
                    surfaces are at the same time rendered more oblique, and the width of the
                    intercostal spaces is thereby increased; the elevation and rotation of the ribs
                    throw the sternum upwards and forwards, and make the thoracic part of the spinal
                    column straighter; the diaphragm is depressed, and the antero-lateral walls of
                    the abdomen are thrown forward. The muscles which cause these movements are as
                    follows:—In each of the spaces between the different ribs a pair of intercostal
                    muscles is situated; these elevate and rotate the ribs, and the movements are
                    assisted by the levatores costarum, and, in the case of the upper and lower
                    ribs, by the scaleni and serrati postici <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n887/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0887-0836"/> muscles; and by these agents the transverse and
                    antero- 'posterior diameter of the chest is increased. The increase in its
                    vertical diameter is due to the action of the diaphragm or midriff, the great
                    muscle which, arising by its circumference from the xiphi-sternum, six lower
                    ribs, and bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, forms the floor of the thoracic and
                    the roof of the abdominal cavity. It constitutes a great arch, with its
                    convexity directed to the cavity of the chest. By the contraction of its fibres
                    the arch is rendered less convex, and the floor of the chest is thereby
                    depressed. Under circumstances which require more powerful efforts of
                    inspiration, the muscles which pass from the walls of the chest to the upper
                    limbs may, by taking their fixed points at the limbs, act as elevators of the
                    ribs. During expiration the ribs are depressed, their lower borders inverted,
                    the width of the intercostal spaces diminished, the sternum depressed, the spine
                    more curved, and the diaphragm more convex. These movements are principally due
                    to the recoil of the elastic tissue of the lungs previously rendered tense by
                    the inflation of the air-cells, and to the untwisting of the ribs when the
                    inspiratory muscles cease to elevate and rotate them. Muscular action plays but
                    a small part in quiet expiration, but the expulsion of the air from the lungs
                    may be facilitated by contracting the abdominal muscles, which, pressing the
                    abdominal viscera against the under surface of the diaphragm, force that muscle
                    upwards.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Temporo-maxillary Joints</hi> are the only diarthrodial
                    articulations in the head. The condyle of the lower jaw on each side is received
                    into the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone; each joint is enclosed by a
                    capsular ligament, and between the articular surfaces is a meniscus, which
                    sub-dirides the interior of the joint into two cavities, each lined by a
                    synovial membrane. The movements of the lower jaw. take place simultaneously at
                    both its articulations during mastication and speech, through the action of the
                    several muscles which are inserted into it. This bone is elevated by the
                    temporal muscles, inserted into the coronoid processes; and by‘the masseterics,
                    inserted into the outer surface, and the internal pterygoids, into the inner
                    surface of each angle. It is depressed partly by its own weight and partly by
                    the action of the digastrics and genio-hyoids, inserted close to the symphysis;
                    by the platysma, inserted into the outer surface of each horizontal ramus; and
                    the mylo-hyoids, into their inner surfaces. The elevators of the jaw are much
                    more powerful than the depressors, for they not only have to overcome the weight
                    of the bone, but during mastication have to exercise force sufficient to cut or
                    break down the food between the teeth. In carnivorous animals, more especially
                    those which, like the tiger or hyaeua, crack the bones of their prey, these
                    muscles attain a great size. The lower jaw can be projected in front of the
                    upper by the external pterygoid muscles, inserted into the neck of the bone on
                    each side; but excessive movement forward is checked by the action of the
                    stylo-maxillary ligaments, which pass from the styloid processes to the angles
                    of the bone; when projected forward, the jaw is drawn back by the posterior
                    fibres of the temporal muscles. When the elevator, depressor, protractor, and
                    retractor muscles are successively brought into action, the lateral or grinding
                    movements of the bone, so important in mastication, are produced.</p>
                <p>Along with the movements of the lower jaw those of the hyoid bone and larynx must
                    be considered, for the digastrics, the genio-and mylo-hyoids, which depress the
                    lower jaw, act, when their action is reversed, along with the stylohyoid muscles
                    in elevating the hyoid bone and larynx, which structures can be depressed or
                    drawn downwards by the action of the sterno-hyoids, sterno-thyroids,
                    thyro-hyoids, and omo-hyoids; the elevation of the hyoid, when drawn down by its
                    depressor muscles, is effected by the elastic stylo-hyoid ligaments attached to
                    its small cornua, which, by their recoil when the depressor muscles have ceased
                    to contract, draw the bone up to its former position.</p>
                <p>Numerous muscles are situated immediately beneath the skin of the scalp and face.
                    They are not of so deep red a colour as the muscles of the trunk and limbs, and
                    whilst they arise from one or other of the bones of the head, they are inserted
                    into the deep surface of the skin itself. Hence when they contract they move the
                    skin of the scalp and face, and as they are the instruments through which the
                    various passions and emotions are expressed, they are grouped together as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Muscles of Expression</hi> (Plate XV., figs. 2 and 3). The
                    occipito-frontalis, or great muscle of the scalp, passes from the occipital bone
                    over the vertex to the forehead; when it contracts, the skin of the forehead is
                    wrinkled transversely, the eyebrows are elevated, and an expression of amazement
                    or surprise is produced. Some persons have a greater power over this muscle than
                    others, and by the alternate contraction of its occipital and frontal portions
                    can move the hairy scalp to and fro with great rapidity. A pair of muscles, the
                    corrugatores supercilii, arises from the supra-ciliary ridges, on the frontal
                    bone, to be inserted into the eyebrows: they draw the eyebrows downwards and
                    inwards, wrinkle the skin of the forehead longitudinally, and contract with
                    great rigour in the act of frowning. The auricle of the external ear has three
                    small muscles inserted into it, one behind, the posterior, one above, the
                    superior, one in front, the anterior auricular muscle: in man, as a rule, these
                    muscles are feeble, and have little action; but in many mammals they are large,
                    and by them the animal pricks its ears to detect the faintest sound of danger.
                    The eyelids are drawn together, so as to close the eye as in the act of sleep,
                    by the orbicularis palpebrarum, the fibres of which lie in the eyelids and on
                    the borders of the orbit, and surround the fissure between the eyolids. This
                    muscle is a characteristic specimen of the group of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sphincter</hi> muscles, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> muscles which surround
                    orifices, and by their contraction close them. When the upper fibres of the
                    muscle alone contract, the uoρer eyelid is depressed,— a movement which takes
                    place almost involuntarily and with great frequency during our waking hours, so
                    as to wash the tears over ehe exposed part of the eyeball and keep it moist. In

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0888-0837"/> lower fibres alone of the orbicularis contract,
                    and the lower lid is elevated. The elevation of the upper lid, as in opening the
                    eye, is due to the levator palpebrae superioris, Which, arising within the
                    orbit, is inserted into the upper eyelid. Muscles are inserted into the
                    framework of the nostrils so as to increase or diminish the size of their
                    orifices, and thus to promote or impede the passage of air into the nose. The
                    size of the orifice is increased by two elevator muscles inserted into the ala,
                    or side of the nostril; and when violent exercise is being performed, or
                    respiration is from any cause impeded, the nostrils are always widely dilated.
                    One of these elevator muscles, which also sends a slip down to the upper lip,
                    and is consequently called the common elevator, is the muscle by the contraction
                    of which a sneer is expressed. A partial closure of the nostril can be effected
                    by small muscles which depress and compress the alae of the nose: in man these
                    muscles are rudimentary as compared with the seal and other aquatic mammals, in
                    which a powerful sphincter muscle closes the nostrils in the act of diving. The
                    lips can be elevated or depressed so as to close or open the mouth; they can be
                    protruded or retracted, or the corners of the mouth can be drawn to one side or
                    the other, by the action of various muscles which are inserted into these
                    movable folds of the integument. The orbicularis oris is a sphincter muscle, the
                    fibres of which lie both in the upper and lower lips; by its contraction the
                    mouth is closed and the lips pressed against the teeth, as when a firm
                    resolution is intended to be expressed. The mouth is opened by the elevator
                    muscles of the upper and the depressors of the lower lip; it is transversely
                    elongated by the zygomatic and risorius muscles, which pass to its corners, and
                    which are brought into action in the acts of smiling and laughing. But the
                    muscles of the lips also play an important part in connection with the reception
                    of food into the mouth, and with the act of articulation.</p>
                <p>The cavity of the mouth forms the commencement of the alimentary canal, and is
                    lined by a soft mucous membrane. In it the teeth and tongue are situated, and
                    into it the secretion called saliva is poured. It opens behind into the pharynx.
                    The side walls of the mouth are called the cheeks, and into the formation of
                    each cheek a flattened quadrilateral muscle, the buccinator, enters. This muscle
                    is attached above and below to the upper and lower jawbones, behind to a fibrous
                    band, to which the upper constrictor muscle is also connected, so that the walls
                    of the mouth and pharynx are continuous with each other, whilst in front the
                    buccinator blends with the structures in the lips. It compresses the cheeks, and
                    drives the air out of the cavity of the mouth as in playing a wind instrument;
                    hence the name, “trumpeter’s muscle.”</p>
                <p>The aperture of communication between the mouth and pharynx is named the <hi
                    rend="italic">isthmus</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">fauces.</hi> It is bounded
                    below by the root of the tongue, on each side by the tonsils, and above by the
                    soft palate. The soft palate is a structure which hangs pendulous from the
                    posterior edge of the hard bony palate. From its centre depends an elongated
                    body, the <hi rend="italic">uvula,</hi> and from each of its sides two folds
                    extend, one downwards and forwards to the tongue, the other downwards and
                    backwards to the pharynx. These folds are called the anterior and posterior
                    pillars of the fauces or palate. Between the anterior and posterior pillar, on
                    each side, the tonsil is seated. The soft palate and its pillars are invested by
                    the mucous lining of the mouth and pharynx, and contain small but important
                    muscles. The muscles of the soft palate and uvula, termed the elevators and
                    tensors, raise and make them tense during the process of deglutition. The
                    muscles of the posterior pillars, or palato-pharyngei, by their contraction,
                    approximate the walls of the pharynx to the soft palate and uvula, whilst the
                    muscles of the anterior pillars, or palato-glossi, diminish the size of the
                    fauces.</p>
                <p>The pharynx is a tube with muscular walls, lined by a mucous membrane, which
                    communicates above and in front with the cavities of the nose, mouth, and
                    larynx, whilst below it is continuous with the oesophagus or gullet. It serves
                    as the chamber or passage down which the food goes from the mouth to the
                    oesophagus in the act of swallowing, and through which the air is transmitted
                    from the nose or mouth to the larynx in the act of breathing. It lies
                    immediately behind the nose, mouth, and larynx, and in front of the five upper
                    cervical vertebrae. Its length is from 4∣ to 5∣ inches; its widest part is
                    opposite the back of the mouth. The principal muscles in its walls are called
                    the constrictors, and are named, from above downwards, superior, middle, and
                    inferior. They are arranged in pairs, and arise from the cartilages of the
                    larynx, from the hyoid bone,lower jaw, and internal pterygoid process of the
                    sphenoid; whilst the superior also springs from the fibrous band to which the
                    buccinator is attached; their fasciculi curve backwards to the middle line of
                    the posterior wall of the pharynx, to be inserted into a tendinous band which
                    extends longitudinally along this wall of the tube.</p>
                <p>The action of the muscles of the mouth, palate, and pharynx may now be considered
                    in connection with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n889/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0889-0838"/> process of deglutition or swallowing. When the
                    food is received into the mouth, it is moistened by the secretion of the
                    salivary and other buccal glands, and is broken down by the grinding action of
                    thé molar teeth. The buccinator muscles press it from between the gums and the
                    cheek, and, along with the movements of the tongue, aid in collecting it into a
                    bolus on the surface of that organ. During the process of mastication the
                    palato-glossi contract so as to close the fauces. When the bolus is sufficiently
                    triturated and moistened, the palato-glossi relax, the tip of the tongue is
                    pressed against the roof of the mouth, and by a heave backward of that organ the
                    bolus is pressed through the posterior orifice of the mouth into the pharynx,
                    where it is grasped by the superior constrictor muscles, and forced downwards by
                    them and the other constrictor muscles into the oesophagus, and thence into the
                    stomach. As both the nose and larynx open into the pharynx, the one immediately
                    above, the other immediately below the orifice of the mouth, it is of great
                    importance that none of the food should enter into these chambers, and obstruct
                    the respiratory passages. To guard against any accident of this kind, two
                    valvular structures are provided,—viz., the soft palate and the
                    epiglottis,—which, whilst leaving the orifices into their respective chambers
                    open during breathing, may effectually close them when deglutition is being
                    performed. As the bolus is being projected through the fauces into the pharynx,
                    the soft palate and uvula are elevated and made tense, and at the same time the
                    wall of the pharynx is brought in contact with it by the contraction of the
                    palatopharyngei; the part of the pharynx into which the nose opens is thus
                    temporarily shut off from that into which the mouth opens. If laughter, however,
                    be excited at this time, the tension of the soft palate is destroyed, and part
                    of the food may find its way upwards into the nose. The closure of the larynx by
                    the epiglottis is due partly to the depression of that valve and partly to the
                    elevation of the larynx. The backward heave of the tongue relaxes the ligaments
                    which connect the front of the epiglottis to that organ, and enables the small
                    epiglottidean muscles to depress the valve. The elevation of the hyoid and
                    larynx is due to the action of the mylo-hyoid, digastric, and genio-hyoid
                    muscles, which pass from the lower jaw to the hyoid, and of the thyro-hyoid,
                    which pass from the hyoid to the thyroid cartilage of the larynx; preliminary to
                    their action, the lower jaw must be fixed, which is done by the closure of the
                    mouth prior to the act of swallowing. The aperture of the larynx is thus brought
                    into contact with the depressed epiglottis, which is adapted more exactly to the
                    opening by a change in its form due to the projection of a cushion-Hke pad from
                    its posterior surface. By these ingenious arrangements the adaptation of a
                    single chamber to the very different functions of breathing and swallowing is
                    effectually provided for.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Joints and Muscles of the Upper Limb.</hi></p>
                <p>The upper limb is jointed to the trunk at the <hi rend="italic">sternoclavicular
                    articulation.</hi> This is a diarthrodial joint: the bones are retained together
                    by investing ligaments; a meniscus is interposed between the articular surfaces,
                    so that the joint possesses two synovial membranes. A strong ligament, which
                    check&amp;Aoo great upward movement, connects the clavicle and first rib. The
                    two bones of the shoulder girdle articulate with each other at the diarthrodial
                    <hi rend="italic">acromio-clavicular joint;</hi> but, in addition, a strong
                    ligament, which checks too great displacement of the bones, passes between the
                    clavicle and coracoid. The movements of the upper limb on the trunk take place
                    at the sterno clavicular joint, and consist in the elevation, depression, and
                    forward and backward movement of the shoulder. The movements at the
                    acromio-clavicular joint occur when the scapula is rotated on the clavicle in
                    the act of elevating the arm above the head. The muscles which cause these
                    movements are inserted into the bones of the shoulder girdle; the trapezius into
                    the clavicle, acromion, and spine of the scapula; the rhomboid, levator anguli
                    scapulae, and serratus magnus into the vertebral border of the scapula; the
                    pectoralis minor into the coracoid; and the subclavius into the clavicle.
                    Elevation of the entire shoulder, as in shrugging the shoulders, is due to the
                    contraction of the trapezius, levator scapulae, and rhomboideus; depression
                    partly to the weight of the limb and partly to the action of the subclavius and
                    pectoralis minor; movement forward to the serratus and pectoralis; and backward
                    to the trapezius and rhomboid. In rotation of the scapula on the clavicle, the
                    inferior angle of the scapula is drawn forward by the serratus and lower fibres
                    of trapezius, and backward by the levator scapulae, rhomboid, and lesser
                    pectoral.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Shoulder Joint</hi> is a ball-and-socket joint, the ball
                    being the head of the humerus, the socket the glenoid fossa of the scapula. A
                    large capsular ligament, which is pierced by the long tendon of the biceps
                    muscle, and lined by a synovial membrane, encloses the articular ends of the two
                    bones, and is so loose as to permit a range of movement greater than takes place
                    in any other joint in the body. The muscles which cause these movements are
                    inserted into the humerus; the supra-spinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor
                    into the great tuberosity; the sub-scapularis into the small tuberosity; the
                    latissimus dorsi and teres major into the bottom of the bicipital groove; the
                    pectoralis major into its anterior border; the coraco-brachialis into the inner
                    aspect, and the deltoid, which forms the fleshy prominence of the shoulder, into
                    the outer aspect of the shaft. Abduction and elevation or extension of the arm
                    outwards at the shoulder joint are due to the supra-spinatus and deltoid;
                    adduction or depression, to the coraco-brachialis, latissimus, and teres major,
                    assisted by the weight of the limb; movement forwards and elevation, to the
                    anterior fibres of the deltoid, pectoralis, and subscapularis; backward movement
                    to the latissimus and teres; rotation outwards to the infra-spinatus and teres
                    minor; rotation inwards to the subscapularis, pectoralis, latissimus, and teres.
                    A combination of abduction, movement forwards, adduction, and movement
                    backwards, produces the movement of circumduction. Certain movements of the
                    upper limb, however, take place not only at the shoulder joint, but between the
                    two bones of the shoulder girdle; for in elevating the arm, whilst the
                    supra-spinatus and deltoid initiate the movement at the shoulder joint, the
                    farther elevation, as in raising the arm above the head, takes place by the
                    trapezius and serratus, which rotate the scapula and draw its inferior angle
                    forward. The free range of movement of the human shoulder is one of its most
                    striking characters, so that the arm can be moved in every direction through
                    space, and its efficiency as an instrument of prehension is thus greatly
                    increased. The movement of abduction, or extension, which elèvates the arm in
                    line with the axis of the scapula, is characteristically human, and a distinct
                    articular area is provided on the head of the humerus for this movement.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Elbow Joint</hi> is the articulation between the humerus,
                    radius, and ulna: the great sigmoid cavity of the ulna is adapted to the

                    which is subdivided into anterior, posterior, internal, and external bands of
                    fibres. Flexion and extension are the two movements of the joint, and the range
                    of movement is limited by the locking at the end of flexion of the coronoid
                    process into the coronoid fossa of the humerus, and at the end of extension of
                    the olecranon process into the olecranoid fossa. The elbow joint is a hinge with
                    screwed surfaces; the path described by the hand and fore-arm is a spiral, so
                    that during flexion they are thrown forwards and inwards. The muscles which
                    cause the movements are inserted into the bones of the fore-arm. The flexors are
                    the brachialis anticus, inserted into the coronoid of the ulna; the biceps,
                    which forms the fleshy mass on the front of the upper arm, into the tuberosity
                    of the radius; the supinator longus into the styloid process of the radius. The
                    only extensor is the triceps-anconeus, which forms the fleshy mass on the back
                    of the upper arm, and is inserted into the olecranon.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Radio-ulnar Joints</hi> are found between the two bones of
                    the fore-arm. · The head of the radius rolls in the lesser sigmoid cavity of the
                    ulna, and is retained in position by a ring-like ligament which surrounds it;
                    the shafts of the two bones are connected together by the interosseous membrane,
                    their lower ends by a capsular ligament and a triangular fibro-cartilage or
                    meniscus. The radius rotates round an axis drawn through the centre of its head
                    and the styloid process of the ulna; rotation of the fore-arm and hand forward
                    is called pronation,—rotation backwards, supination. The supinator and pronator
                    muscles are all inserted into the radius: the supinators are the longus and
                    brevis and the biceps; the pronators are the teres and quadratus. Where delicate
                    manipulation is required the fore-arm is semi-flexed on the upper arm, for the
                    cupshaped head of the radius is then brought into contact with the capitellum of

                    greater precision.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Wrist</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Radio-carpal Joint</hi> is
                    formed above by the lower end of the radius and the triangular meniscus, below
                    by the upper articular surfaces of the scaphoid, semi-lunar, and cuneiform
                    bones. An investing ligament, lined by a synovial membrane, and subdivided into
                    anterior, posterior, internal, and external bands of fibres, encloses the joint.
                    It is the oblong form of hinge-joint, and possesses two axes, a long and a
                    short; around the long axis movements occur which bend the hand forwards, or
                    bring it in line with the fore-arm, or bend it backwards; arouud the short axis
                    the hand may be moved towards the radial or ulnar margins of the fore-arm. The
                    flexors forward are the palmaris longus, inserted into the palmar fascia; the
                    flexor carpi radialis into the metacarpal bone of the index; the flexor carpi
                    ulnaris into the pisiform bone; the extensors and flexors backwards are the
                    longer and shorter radial extensors inserted into the metacarpal bones of the
                    index and middle fingers, and the ulnar extensor into the metacarpal bone of the
                    little finger; the flexors and extensors of the fingers have also a secondary
                    action on the wrist joint. The ulnar flexor and ulnar extensor of the wrist draw
                    the hand to the ulnar side, and the radial flexor and extensor, together with
                    the extensors of the thumb, draw the hand towards the radial border of the
                    fore-arm.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Carpal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Carpo-metacarpal
                    Joints</hi> are constructed thus :—The articular surfaces are retained in
                    contact by certain ligaments passing between the dorsal surfaces of adjacent
                    bones, by others between their palmar surfaces, and by interosseous ligaments
                    between the semi-lunar and cuneiform, semi-lunar and scaphoid, os magnum and
                    unciform, os magnum and trapezoid; lateral ligaments also attach the scaphoid to
                    the trapezium, and the cuneiform to the unciform. Similarly, the trapezoid, os
                    magnum, and unciform are connected to the metacarpal bones of the fingers by
                    dorsal, palmar, and interosseous ligaments, and the metacarpal bones of the
                    fingers have a like mode of union at their carpal ends; further, a transverse
                    ligament extends between the distal ends of the metacarpal bones of the fingers,
                    and checks too great lateral displacement. The range of movement at any one of
                    these carpal joints is very slight, but the multiplicity of joints in this
                    locality contributes to the mobility of the wrist, and makes the junction,
                    between the hand and fore-arm less rigid in its nature. The metacarpal bone of
                    the thumb is not jointed to the index, and has a distinct saddle-shaped
                    articulation with, the trapezium, invested by a capsular ligament, so that its
                    range of movement is extensive.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Metacarpophalangeal</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Interphalangea!</hi><hi rend="italic">Joints</hi> are connected by lateral
                    ligaments passing between the bones, and by an arrangement of fibres on their
                    dorsal and palmar surfaces.</p>
                <p>In studying the muscles which move the digits, it will be advisable, on account
                    of the freedom and importance of the movements of the thumb, to examine its
                    muscles independently. These muscles either pass from the fore-arm to the thumb,
                    or are grouped together at the outer part of the palm, and form the elevation
                    known as the ball of the thumb; they are inserted either into the metacarpal
                    bone or the phalanges. The thumb is extended and abducted, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> drawn away from the index, by three extensormuscles descending from
                    the fore-arm, and inserted one into each of its three bones, and a small muscle,
                    specially named abductor pollicis, inserted into the outer side of the first
                    phalanx: its bones are bent on each other by a long and short flexor muscle; it
                    is drawn back to the index by an adductor muscle; and the entire thumb is thrown
                    across the surface of the palm by the opponens pollicis, which is inserted into
                    the shaft of the metacarpal bone.</p>
                <p>The four fingers can be either bent, or extended, or drawn asunder, ⅛.e.,
                    abducted; or drawn together, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> adducted. The ungual

                <p>action of the deep flexor muscle, the four tendons of which are inserted into

                    tendons, one into each phalanx; these muscles descend from the front of the
                    forearm into the palm in front of the wrist, where they are <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">anterior annular ligament,</hi> and their surfaces are invested by
                    a synovial membrane, which facilitates their movements to and fro beneath that
                    ligament; as they pass downwards in front of the fingers they are enclosed in a
                    strong fibrous sheath lined by a synovial membrane, and the tendon of the
                    superficial flexor is pierced by the deep flexor, so that the latter may reach
                    the third phalanx into which it is inserted. Four rounded muscles, the
                    lumbricales, arise in the palm from the deep flexor tendons, turn round the
                    radial borders of the first phalanges, and are inserted one into the extensor
                    tendon on the dorsum of each finger; these muscles bend the first phalanges on
                    the metacarpal bones, but from their insertion into the extensor tendons they
                    also extend the second and third phalanges on the first; as they are much used
                    in playing stringed instruments, they have been called “fiddlers’ muscles.” The
                    fingers are extended or straightened by muscles inserted into the back of the
                    second and third phalanges; the extensor muscles descend from the back of the
                    fore-arm,—one, the common extensor, subdivides into four tendons, one for each
                    finger, but in addition the index and little have each a separate extensor
                    muscle, the tendon of which joins that of the common extensor. The index finger
                    possesses more independent movement than the other digits—hence its more
                    frequent use as a “pointer;” the extensor tendons of the little and ring fingers
                    are usually united together, so that these digits are associated in their
                    movements. Abduction and adduction of the fingers are caused by seven small
                    muscles situated in the intervals between the metacarpal bones,—hence called
                    interossei; four of these lie on the back of the hand, three on its palmar
                    surface; they are inserted into the sides of the first phalanges, and e^ιer pull
                    the fingers away from a line drawn through the middle finger or approximate them
                    to that line. Too great abduction is checked by the transverse metacarpal
                    ligament. The human hand is a perfect instrument of prehension; not only can the
                    individual fingers be bent into hooks, but the thumb can be thrown across the
                    front of the palm, so that it can be opposed to the several fingers, and objects
                    can therefore be grasped between it and them; but further, this power of
                    opposing the thumb permits objects to be held in the palm of the hand, which may
                    be hollowed into a cup or made to grasp a sphere. The movements of the joints
                    are indicated on the surface of the palm by tegumentary folds,—an oblique fold
                    for the thumb, and two oblique folds for the metacarpo-phalangeal joints of the
                    fingers; the joints of the second and third phalanges are also marked on the
                    surface by folds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Joints and Muscles of the Lower Limb.</hi></p>
                <p>The innominate bones are connected to the spinal column by the sacro-iliac joints
                    and the sacro-sciatic ligaments. The <hi rend="italic">Sacro-iliac Joint</hi> is
                    between the side of the sacrum and the internal surface of the ilium, the
                    articular surfaces of which bones are covered by cartilage, and connected
                    together by short, strong ligaments. The sacro-sciatic ligaments stretch from
                    the side of the sacrum and coccyx to the spine and tuberosity of the ischium.
                    The two innominate bones are also connected together at the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pubic symphysis,</hi> which is an amphiarthrodial joint. The sacroiliac joints
                    and pubic symphysis permit only slight movement; that at the former is around an
                    imaginary axis, drawn transversely through the second sacral vertebra, which
                    'allows the base of the sacrum to be thrown forward and its 'apex backward in
                    the stooping position of the body; but 'too great movement backward of the apex
                    is checked by the sacro-sciatic ligaments. As the weight of the trunk, or of
                    what may be carried in the arms or on the back, is transmitted through the
                    haαnch-bones to the lower limbs, the sacro-iliac ligaments require to be of
                    great strength, because the sacrum, and with it the entire trunk, are suspended
                    by them on the two innominate bones.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hip Joint</hi> is a ball-and-socket joint; the ball is the
                    head of the femur, and the socket the cup-shaped acetabulum in the haunch bone,
                    the depth of the cup being in-&lt; creased by a ligament which is attached
                    around the brim. A large capsular ligament, which is especially strong in front,
                    encloses the articular surfaces. The ligament is lined by a synovial membrane,
                    which also invests the neck of the thigh bone. Within the joint is the round or
                    suspensory ligament attached to the head of the thigh bone and to the sides of
                    the depression at the bottom of the acetabulum. Whilst the hip joint possesses
                    considerable mobility, it has much more stability than the shoulder, owing to
                    the acetabulum being deeper than the glenoid fossa, and the greater strength and
                    tension of the fibres of its capsular ligament. The muscles which move the thigh
                    at the hip joint are situated either behind the joint, where they form the
                    fleshy mass of the buttock, or at the front and the inner side of the thigh.
                    They are inserted either into the femur or fascia lata, and the great and small
                    trochanters serve as their principal surfaces of attachment. The thigh can be
                    bent on the abdomen by the action of the psoas, iliacus, and pectineus, which
                    lie in front of the joint; it can be extended or drawn into line with the trunk
                    by the glutaeus-maximus and medius; it can be abducted or drawn away from the
                    opposite thigh by the glutaeus maximus, medius, and minimus, which muscles are
                    of large size, and form the fleshy mass of the buttocks. It can be adducted or
                    drawn to touch its fellow, or, if slightly bent, drawn in front of its fellow,
                    by the adductor longus, brevis, and magnus, which muscles are inserted into the
                    linea aspera, and form the fleshy mass on the inner side of the thigh; and by
                    the pectineus and quadratus femoris. It can be rotated outwards by the obturator
                    and gemelli muscles, the glutaeus maximus, pyriformis, and quadratus femoris;
                    and rotated inwards by the glutaeus medius, minimus, and tensor fasciae femoris.
                    In standing erect the hip joints are fully extended, and the mechanical
                    arrangements in and around these articulations are such as to enable them to be
                    retained in the extended position with but a small expenditure of muscular
                    power. As the weight of the body in the erect attitude falls behind the joints,
                    the strong anterior fibres of their capsular ligaments are made tense, and the
                    extended position of the joints is preserved. So long as the centre of gravity
                    falls within the basis of support of the body, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the
                    space between the two feet when standing on both legs, the body will not fall.
                    If the body is made to lean forward, then the capsular ligament is no longer
                    tense, and the glutaeal muscles are put in action to re-extend the trunk on the
                    thigh, and prevent it from falling forward; if the body is made to lean to one
                    side or the other, the round ligament is made tense, or the strong ilio-tibial
                    band of the fascia lata of the thigh, which stretches from the ilium to the
                    tibia, is put on the stretch, and falling sideways is prevented. When, in
                    standing erect either on one or both feet, the balance of the body is disturbed,
                    then various muscles both of the trunk and lower limb are brought into action to
                    assist in preserving the erect position. In the erect position the weight of the
                    trunk is transmitted through the acetabula to the heads of the thigh-bones, but
                    the position and connections of the round ligament enable it to suspend that
                    portion of the trunk the weight of which is thrown upon it, and to distribute
                    the weight over the head of the femur. . , <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Knee</hi> is the largest and most complicated joint in the
                    body. It consists of the femur, tibia, and patella; The patella moves up and

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0894-0841"/> the femur, whilst the condyles of the femur roll
                    upon the semilunar cartilages and articular surfaces of the tibia. A powerful
                    investing ligament encloses the articular surfaces. This ligament is subdivided
                    into bands, one on each side of the joint—the internal and external lateral
                    ligaments—a posterior and an anterior. The anterior extends from the patella to
                    the anterior tubercle of the tibia, and serves both as a ligament and as the
                    tendon of insertion of the extensor muscles of the leg. Within the investing
                    ligament two interarticular or crucial ligaments pass from the inter-condyloid
                    fossa to the upper surface of the tibia; and interposed between the tibia and
                    femoral condyles are two menisci, which from their shape are called the
                    semilunar cartilages. The synovial membrane not only lines the investing
                    ligaments, biιt covers the front of the femur for some distance above the
                    trochlea, and forms folds or pads within the joint itself, which in certain
                    movements are interposed between the articular surfaces of the bones. The
                    movements at this joint are those of flexion and extension. The flexors are the
                    three great muscles on the back of the thigh, called the ham-strings; they all
                    arise from the ischial tuberosity, and are inserted—the biceps into the head of
                    the fibula, the semi-tendinosus and semi-mem-branosus into the upper end of the
                    tibia. The extensors form the fleshy mass on the front and outer side of the
                    thigh <hi rend="italic">; one</hi> muscle, the rectus, arises from the ilium—the
                    others, the vasti, from the shaft of the femur; and they are all inserted by a
                    powerful tendon into the patella, and through the anterior ligament of the knee
                    into the tibia. The patella is indeed a sesamoid bone, developed in the tendon
                    of these muscles (Fig. 18). The knee can be bent so that the calf can touch the
                    back of the thigh, and in this position the patella is drawn down in front of
                    the joint, as in kneeling. The articular surface of the patella is divided into
                    seven areas or facets, and in passing from the bent to the extended position of
                    the joint, these facets come successively into contact with the articular
                    surface of the femur, until, when the leg is fully extended on the thigh, the
                    whole of the patella is raised above the femoral trochlea, except the lowest
                    pair of narrow facets. It is in order to provide a smooth surface for the
                    patella in this position that the synovial membrane of the joint covers the
                    front of the lower end of the femur. At the commencement of flexion a slight
                    rotation inwards of the leg and foot takes place through the action of the
                    sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosus, which are inserted close together into
                    the tibia; whilst the extensor muscles cause, at the completion of extension, a
                    slight rotation outwards of the leg and foot. The movements of flexion and
                    extension are not simply in the antero-posterior plane, but along oblique paths
                    which are determined by the screwed configuration of the femoral condyles. In
                    complete extension of the leg the joint is “screwed home;” and as this position
                    is necessary for the preservation of the erect attitude, the lateral, the
                    posterior, and the anterior crucial ligaments are then all tense, to prevent
                    displacement of the bones. The muscles which rotate the leg and foot inwards
                    initiate the act of flexion by unlocking the joint.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tιbio-fibular Joints</hi> are found between the upper and
                    lower ends of the bones, and in addition a strong interosseous membrane fills up
                    the interval between their shafts. The movement between the two bones is almost
                    inappreciable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ankle Joint</hi> is formed by the convex upper and the
                    lateral surfaces of the astragalus fitting into the concavity formed by the
                    lower end of the tibia and the two malleoli. An investing Jigament, lined by
                    synovial membrane, encloses the joint; the lateral portions of this ligament
                    form distinct bands, and are much stronger than the anterior and posterior
                    fibres. A diarthrodial joint also exists between the astragalus and os calcis,
                    between which bones a powerful interosseous ligament passes. Between the
                    astragalus and scaphoid, and the os calcis and cuboid, important diarthrodial
                    joints are found, which are enclosed by ligamentous bands. The remaining tarsal
                    bones are connected together usually by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous
                    ligaments, and a similar mode of union is found between the distal row of tarsal
                    bones and the metatarsals, except between the great toe and ento-cuneiform,
                    where there is no interosseous ligament. The four outer metatarsals are also
                    connected at their proximal ends by distal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments;
                    and further, a transverse metatarsal ligament passes between the distal ends of
                    all the metatarsal bones. The metatarsal bones articulate with the phalanges,
                    and the phalanges with each other, in a similar manner to that described in the
                    corresponding bones of the hand.</p>
                <p>At the ankle joint movements of flexion and extension take place. The dorsum of
                    the foot is bent towards the front of the leg by the direct action of the
                    muscles on the front of the leg, more especially the tibialis anticus, inserted
                    into the ento-cuneiform and metatarsal of great toe, and the peroneus tertius,
                    inserted into the metatarsal of little toe; the opposite movement, the so-called
                    extension of the foot, is due to the action of the gastrocnemius and soleus, the
                    great muscles of the calf of the leg, which are inserted by the Tendo Achillis
                    into the posterior prominence of the os calcis or heel. This movement is made at
                    every step in walking or running, and the great size of the calf-muscles is in
                    relation to their use in the act of progression. The foot cannot, however, be
                    drawn so far back as to be brought into direct line with the leg. In standing
                    erect the foot is at right angles to the axis of the leg, the astragalus is
                    locked in between the two malleoli, and the fibres of the lateral ligaments are
                    tense, so as to check movement forwards or backwards, and prevent
                    displacement.</p>
                <p>Between the several bones of the tarsus a certain amount of gliding is permitted,
                    more especially between the os calcis and cuboid and the astragalus and
                    scaphoid, so that it is possible to invert or evert the foot, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> to raise its inner or outer borders from the ground. The inversion
                    is performed by the tibialis anticus and by the tibialis posticus, which latter
                    is inserted into the scaphoid bone; the eversion by the peroneus longus and
                    brevis muscles, situated on the outer side of the leg, the tendons of which pass
                    behind the outer malleolus,—the brevis to be inserted into the metatarsal bone
                    of the little toe, the longus into the plantar surface of the metatarsal bone of
                    the great toe. The individual toes are bent on the sole by the action of the
                    flexor muscles inserted into the plantar surface of the phalanges, and they are
                    straightened by the extensor muscles inserted into their dorsal surfaces; the
                    toes also can be drawn asunder or abducted, and drawn together or adducted,
                    chiefly by the action of the interossei muscles. The hallux or great toe is the
                    most important digit; a line prolonged backwards through it to the heel forms
                    the proper axis of the foot, and the sole chiefly rests upon the pads of
                    integument situated beneath its metatarso-phalangeal joint and the heel. The
                    hallux is much more restricted in its movements than the thumb: the
                    configuration of its tarso-metatarsal joint and the attachment of the transverse
                    metatarsal ligament prevent the great toe from being thrown across the surface
                    of the sole as the thumb is thrown across the palm in the movement of
                    opposition; an object can, however, be grasped between the hallux and second toe
                    by the action of its adductor muscles, and persons can be trained to write with
                    a pen or pencil held in this position.</p>
                <p>The act of walking consists in the movement forwards of the trunk by the
                    alternate advancement of the lower <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n895/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0895-0842"/> limbs. Suppose a person to be standing erect,
                    with one leg a little in advance of the other; the body, being inclined slightly
                    forwards, is pushed in advance by the extension of the hindmost limb, so that
                    the weight falls more and more upon the advanced leg, which at the same time is
                    shortened by bending the knee and ankle. The heel of the hindmost limb being
                    then raised by the action of the muscles of the calf, the toes press against the
                    ground so as to push the trunk so far in front of the advanced limb as to be no
                    longer safely supported by it; the hindmost limb is then raised from the ground
                    by muscular action, and allowed to swing forward by its own weight, but guided
                    by the muscles, until the toes touch the ground in front of the opposite limb. A
                    step has now been made, and the limbs are in a corresponding but opposite
                    position from that in which they were when the step commenced: a repetition of
                    the act constitutes another step, and so. the alternate action continues. At one
                    moment in each step both feet touch the ground at the same time, Z.e., when the
                    hind foot presses against the earth. The act of running consists in a repetition
                    of the movements of walking performed with so much greater rapidity that the
                    feet never touch the ground at the same moment; the heels also are never brought
                    to the ground. The propulsive action is also greatly increased by the extension
                    of the hip and knee joints, so that a succession of small leaps on to alternate
                    feet takes place. In leaping from the standing position the joints of both lower
                    limbs, previously flexed, are suddenly and simultaneously extended, and the body
                    is projected forwards with a rapid impulse.</p>

                    System.</hi></p>
                <p>The voluntary muscles, like the bones and joints with which they are so
                    intimately associated, are developed out of the middle of the three layers—the
                    <hi rend="italic">mcso-blast</hi> —into which the germinal area or <hi
                    rend="italic">blastoderm</hi> of the young embryo is divided. The muscles of the
                    axial skeleton are capable of subdivision into a group situated outside the
                    endo-skeleton, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> between it and the integument— which
                    muscles have recently been called <hi rend="italic">epi-skeletal—</hi> and a
                    group lying on the ventral surface of the vertebral bodies and within the rib
                    arches, which have been termed the haemal or <hi rend="italic"
                    >hypo-skeletal</hi> muscles. The epi-skeletal muscles, like the vertebrae
                    themselves, are developed within the <hi rend="italic">proto-vertebrae,</hi> but
                    it is not known if the hypo-skeletal group have the same origin. In fishes the
                    epi-skeletal muscles preserve their fundamental arrangement with but little
                    modification. They are disposed in transverse segments or <hi rend="italic"
                    >myotomes,</hi> which equal in number the vertebrae. These myotomes are
                    separated from each other by bands of fibrous tissue, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >intermuscular septa.</hi> In man and the higher vertebrates the simple
                    transversely segmented arrangement is to a large extent lost. Traces are
                    preserved, however, in the interspinales and intertransversales muscles,
                    situated in the intervals between the spines and transverse processes of some of
                    the vertebral segments; in the external intercostale and in the recti abdominis
                    muscles, in the last-named of which tendinous bands subdivide the muscle into
                    several transverse segments. More usually, the intermuscular septa either are
                    not formed or disappear, and adjacent myotomes become blended into a continuous
                    mass of muscle. In some instances the fibres of this muscle run longitudinally,
                    and the entire mass subdivides longitudinally into separate and distinct
                    parallel muscles, as is seen in the subdivision of the great erector spinae into
                    the sacro-lumbalis, musculus accessorius, cervicalis ascendens, longissimus
                    dorsi, transversalis cervicis, trachelo-mastoid, and spinalis dorsi muscles. In
                    other instances the muscles run obliquely; some on the back of the body pass
                    obliquely from below upwards and outwards, as the splenius and obliquus
                    inferior; others obliquely from below, upwards and inwards, as the complexus,
                    obliquus superior, semispinalis, multifidus and rotatores spinae; others again,
                    as the external and internal oblique muscles of the abdomen, extend obliquely
                    from behind forwards to the ventral mesial line.</p>
                <p>Of the hypo-skeletal group of muscles, the internal intercostals display the
                    transverse segmentation. As a rule, however, the muscles of this group extend
                    longitudinally, andform the prae-vertebra± group, named anterior recti, longi
                    colli, and psoae; though the diaphragm, triangulares sterni, transversi
                    abdominis, and levatores ani, which lie in relation to the inner surfaces of the
                    ribs and visceral cavities, are not longitudinal, but are specially modified in
                    arrangement for functional reasons. The plane of demarcation between the
                    hypo-and epi-skeletal groups of muscles, where they form together the walls of
                    the great visceral cnambers,—the thorax and abdomen,— is marked ofi' by the
                    position and course of the intercostal series of spinal nerves.</p>
                <p>The muscles of the appendicular skeleton are either limited to the limbs (purely
                    appendicular, therefore), or pass from the axial part of the body to the limb
                    (axi-appendicular). The axi-appen-dicular group are undoubtedly prolongations of
                    the axial system of muscles. They are in the upper limb derived from the
                    epi-skeletal subdivision, and form the trapezius, rhomboid, levator anguli
                    scapulae, latissimus dorsi, serratus magnus, greater and smaller pectorals, and
                    subclavius muscles of each superior extremity. In the lower limb they are in
                    part derived from the hypo-skeletal subdivision, and form the psoas and
                    pyriformis; and in part, as the glutaeus maximus, from the epi-skeletal
                    subdivision. It is not improbable that the purely appendicular muscles are also
                    prolongations of the axial system, and that as the limbs, in their development
                    from their fundamental bud-like lappets, undergo both a transverse and a
                    longitudinal segmentation, so the muscular mass, prolonged into them,
                    differentiates both transversely and longitudinally into a motor apparatus,
                    fitted for the performance of the special functions of each extremity.</p>

                    >Introductory.</hi></p>
                <p>Before proceeding to the description of the other organic systems of which the
                    human body is built up, it may be well to enter into the consideration of the
                    minute or microscopic structure of its constituent parts. These parts may
                    primarily be divided into fluids and solids. The fluids are the blood, the
                    lymph, the chyle, the secretions of the various glands, and of the serous and
                    synovial membranes. The solids form the framework of the several organic
                    systems, and assume different appearances in different localities. Sometimes
                    they are arranged in compact solid masses, as in cartilage; at others they are
                    elongated into fine threads or fibres, as in muscle, tendon, nerve; at others
                    they are expanded into thin membranes, as in the fasciae or aponeuroses, the
                    serous, synovial, and mucous membranes; at others they are hollowed out into
                    distinct tubes for the conveyance of fluids, as in the blood-vessels, the lymph
                    and chyle vessels, and the ducts of glands. To the solids of the body, whatever
                    their form may be, the general name of Tissues or Textures is applied. Each
                    organic system may be regarded as in the main composed of a tissue or texture
                    peculiar to and characteristic of itself. Thus, the bones are essentially
                    composed of the osseous tissue, the muscles of the muscular tissue, the nervous
                    system of the nervous tissue, fibrous membranes of the fibrous or connective
                    tissue, &amp;c. But though the essential constituent of each organic system is a
                    tissue peculiar to that system, yet in most localities certain other tissues are
                    mingled with that which is to be regarded as the characteristic texture of the
                    part. In a muscle, for example, not only is the muscular tissue present, but
                    mingled with it are connective tissue, nerve tissue, bloodvessels, and
                    lymph-vessels. A gland also not only consists of its proper tissue, the
                    secreting cells, but of more or less connective tissue, nerves, blood and lymph
                    vessels, and gland ducts. Indeed, there are few localities in which, along with
                    the proper tissue of the part, blood and lymph vessels, nerves and connective
                    tissue, are not found; and to a part built up of two or more tissues the name of
                    an Organ is applied. Thus the muscular system consists of the series of organs
                    which we call the muscles, the glandular system of the several organs called
                    glands, and so on. Each tissue and each organ, into the construction of which
                    that tissue enters as the characteristic· texture, possesses not only
                    distinctive structural, but also distinctive functional properties. Thus the
                    muscular tissue is characterised by the property of contractility, and the
                    muscles, of which it forms the essential texture, are organs of motion oι
                    locomotion; the osseous tissue is characterised by its <pb break="no"

                    forms the essential texture, are organs of protection and support.</p>
                <p>But the study of the textures embraces an inquiry not only into the special,
                    structural, and functional properties of each tissue, and organ—into the special
                    part which each plays in the animal economy—but the consideration of their
                    properties as living structures. It would be out of place in this article to
                    enter into a discussion of the meaning of the term <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Life,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Living,</hi> or to attempt an analysis of
                    the various definitions of the term which have been suggested from time to time
                    by different philosophers, which will naturally find a place in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Physiology.</hi> It will suflice for our present purpose to
                    adopt the old Aristotelian definition, and to speak of Life as the faculties of
                    self-nourishment, self-growth, and self-decay. All the tissues, over and above
                    the special properties which they possess, have the power of growing and of
                    maintaining themselves in full structural perfection and functional activity for
                    a given period of time. After a time they begin to exhibit signs of diminished
                    perfection and activity, they degenerate or decay; ultimately they die, and the
                    entire organism of which they form the constituent parts is resolved by the
                    υutrefactive υrocess into more simple forms of matter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Considerations on Cells.</hi></p>
                <p>The simplest form of organic matter capable of exhibiting the phenomena of life
                    is called Cyto-blastema or Protoplasm. It possesses a viscous or jelly-like
                    consistency. Under the highest powers of the microscope it seems to be
                    homogeneous, or dimly granulated, like a sheet of ground glass. Not only can it
                    assimilate nutriment and increase in size, but it possesses the power of
                    spontaneous movement and contractility. It enters in a very important manner
                    into the structure of the bodies of the lower animals. The elongated processes,
                    or pseudopodia, to which Dujardin applied the name of sarcode, which the
                    Rhizopoda can project from their surface into the surrounding medium, and again
                    withdraw into their substance, consist of protoplasm, and may be cited as
                    furnishing excellent examples of its motive and contractile power. From the
                    recent researches of Haeckel it would appear that protoplasm is capable of
                    forming, without the superaddition of any other structure, independent
                    organisms, which stand at the lowest grade of organisation, and from their
                    extreme simplicity are named by him Monera. To the group Monera belong the
                    genera Protamoeba, Protogenes, and Bathybius. Of these, Bathybius is that which
                    has attracted most attention. It has been regarded as a layer of soft slimy
                    undifferentiated protoplasm covering the bottom of the deep sea, and capable of
                    exhibiting the phenomena of contractility, growth, assimilation of food, and
                    reproduction, Doubts, however, have been expressed regarding the nature of this
                    Bathybius, so that it cannot now be cited as so definite an organism as the
                    freely-swimming Protamoeba and Protogenes. Haeckel has referred these simple
                    organisms to a subkingdom of <hi rend="smallcaps">Protistae,</hi> which he
                    considers to lie on the confines of both the animal and vegetable kingdoms. To a
                    mass of protoplasm, whether it forms, as in one of these <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Protistae,</hi> an independent organism, or is merely a portion of the
                    substance of the body of a higher organism, he has given the general name of a
                    Cytode. Sometimes a cytode is a naked clump of soft protoplasm, without a trace
                    of differentiation either on its surface or in its substance, as in the
                    freely-moving Monera; at others the peripheral part of the cytode hardens, and
                    differentiates into a more or less perfect envelope, as in the genera Protomonas
                    and Protomyxa. So far back as 1861, Lionel Beale had described, under the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">germinal matter (Bioplasm),</hi> minute living particles of
                    vegetable protoplasm, and in 1863 he demonstrated the presence of extremely
                    minute particles of living matter in the blood. More recently Stricker has also
                    called attention, in the bodies of the higher animals, to minute detached clumps
                    of protoplasm which exhibited the phenomena of life.</p>
                <p>As a rule, however, in both vegetable and animal organisms the specks or clumps
                    of protoplasm assume definite shapes, and show evidence of an internal
                    differentiation. In the midst of a minute clump of this substance a
                    sharply-defined body called a <hi rend="italic">nucleus</hi> is found, which
                    differs from the surrounding protoplasm in not being contractile; and sometimes
                    a minute speck, or <hi rend="italic">nucleolus,</hi> exists within the nucleus.
                    When a definite clump of protoplasm contains a nucleus in its interior, whether
                    a nucleolus be present or not, it is called a Nucleated Cell. Cells are definite
                    anatomical and physiological units, and exhibit all the phenomena of life. Some
                    of the lowest organisms consist merely of a single cell, others of two or more
                    cells united together, and these are called uni-or multi-cellular organisms.
                    Cells also enter in the most material manner into the constitution of the
                    textures of all the higher forms of plants and animals. Not unfrequently the
                    peripheral part of the protoplasm of the cell differentiates into a distinct
                    investing envelope, technically named a <hi rend="italic">cell uaU</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">cell</hi><hi rend="italic">membrane.</hi></p>
                <p>In the earlier periods of investigation into the minute structure of cells it was
                    believed that a cell wall was constantly present, and that each cell was a
                    minute microscopic vesicle or bladder, which in its typical shape was globular
                    or ovoid, but capable of undergoing various modifications both in form and
                    chemical composition. The material enclosed by the cell wall was termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">cell con</hi><hi rend="italic">tents,</hi> and either in the midst
                    of these contents or in contact with the cell wall was the nucleus, which might
                    or might not contain a nucleolus. Schwann believed that the cell wall was the
                    most active constituent of the cell, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> possessed the
                    power not only of producing chemical and physical changes in its own substance
                    and in the cell contents, but of separating materials from the surrounding
                    media,—of secreting them, as it were, into the interior of the cell. In this
                    manner he accounted for the formation in some cells of fat, in others of
                    pigment, in others of the characteristic secretion of glands, and so on.</p>
                <p>It was then maintained by John Goodsir that the nucleus was the part of a cell
                    which in all probability was concerned in separating and preparing its
                    characteristic cell contents, and in its nutrition. Martin Barry and Goodsir
                    also contended that the reproduction and multiplication of cells were due to
                    self-division of the nucleus, which was thus the source of successive broods of
                    young cells. They gave to the nucleus, therefore, an importance in the economy
                    of the cell greater than had previously been assigned to it.</p>
                <p>As the investigations into cell structure became more extended, it was
                    ascertained that a cell wall was by no means always present; that in many of the
                    cells in which it had been supposed to exist it could not satisfactorily be
                    demonstrated, and that in others, more especially in young actively-growing
                    cells, no trace of an investing envelope <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n897/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0897-0844"/> could be observed. Hence the importance of the
                    cell wall as an essential compc nent of a cell was still further diminished; and
                    Leydig then defined a cell to be a little mass composed of a soft substance
                    enclosing a central nucleus.</p>
                <p>But a most important advance in our conceptions of the essential structure of a
                    cell was made when Brücke pointed out that the contents of cells not
                    unfrequently possessed the property of spontaneous movement and contractility,
                    and when Max Schultze determined that the contractile substance termed sarcode,
                    which forms so large a part of the bodies of the lower animals, was analogous
                    and apparently homologous with the contents of young actively-growing animal and
                    vegetable cells, before a differentiation of these contents into special
                    secretions or other materials had taken place. As the term “protoplasm” had been
                    introduced by Von Mohl to express the contents of the vegetable cell, which
                    undergoes changes in the process of growth, it was adopted by the animal
                    histologist; and Max Schultze suggested that a cell should be defined to be a
                    nucleated mass of protoplasm,—a definition which is adopted in this article.
                    Now, as protoplasm, whether it occurs along with a nucleus in the form of a
                    cell, or in independent clumps or cytodes, exhibits not merely the property of
                    contractility, but the power of growing and maintaining itself, it is regarded
                    as the functionally active constituent of the cell. And thus our conceptions as
                    to the part of the cell in which its functional activity resides have passed
                    through three phases. In the first, the cell wall; in the second, the nucleus;
                    in the third, the protoplasm cell contents, or cell substance, has been regarded
                    as the active constituent, not only as regards its nutrition, but the
                    reproduction of young cells. But though the protoplasm can of itself perform
                    these offices, yet there can be no doubt, as Barry and Goodsir were the first to
                    show, that the nucleus of the cell plays a part not unfrequently in the
                    multiplication of cells by self-division.</p>
                <p>One of the most characteristic cells is the mammalian ovum. In it a cell wall
                    exists, known as the 20na pellucida or vitelline membrane; within this envelope
                    is the granular yelk or cell contents, in the midst of which is imbedded the
                    nucleus or germinal vesicle, which in its turn contains the nucleolus or
                    germinal spot. The granules of the yelk are a special metamorphosis of the
                    protoplasm cell substance.</p>
                <p>Schwann made the important generalisation that the tissues of the animal body are
                    composed of cells, or of materials derived from cells, “that there is one
                    universal principle of development for the elementary part of organisms, however
                    different, and that this principle is the formation of cells.” The ovum is the
                    primordial or fundamental cell, or germ-cell, from which, after being fertilised
                    by the male sperm, the tissues and organs of the animal body are derived. Within
                    the fertilised ovum multiplication of cells takes place with great rapidity. It
                    is as yet an unsettled question how far the original nucleus of the ovum
                    participates in this process of multiplication; but there can be no doubt that
                    the protoplasm cell contents divide, first into two, then four, then eight, then
                    sixteen segments, and so on. Each of these segments of protoplasm contains a
                    nucleus—is, in short, a nucleated cell, and the protoplasm of these cells
                    exhibits the property of contractility. The ovum or germ-cell is therefore the
                    immediate parent of all the new cells which are formed within it, and mediately
                    it is the parent of all the cells which, in the subsequent processes of
                    development and growth, are descended from those produced by tne segmentation of
                    the yelk. The process of development of young cells within a parent cell,
                    whether it occurs in the ovum or in a cell derived by descent from the ovum, is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">endogenous</hi> reproduction of cells. But cells
                    may multiply by a process of <hi rend="italic">fission—i.e.,</hi> a
                    constriction, gradually deepening, may take place in a cell until it is
                    subdivided into two; the -nucleus at the same time participating in the
                    constriction and subdivision. A third mode of multiplication of cells is by <hi
                    rend="italic">budding:</hi> little clumps of protoplasm bud out from the
                    protoplasm of the parent cell, become detached, and assume an independent
                    vitality. If a nucleus differentiates in the interior of such a clump, it
                    becomes a cell; if it remains as a mere clump of protoplasm, it is a cytode.</p>
                <p>These various methods of multiplication are all confirmatory of Schwann’s
                    generalisation of the descent or derivation of cells from pre-existing cells.
                    But as the nucleated cell, either with or without a cell wall, is not, in the
                    present state of science, regarded as the simplest and most elementary unit
                    capable of exhibiting vital phenomena, and as these phenomena can be displayed
                    by individual clumps of protoplasm, without the presence of a nucleus, some
                    modification of the doctrine, as regards the formation of the tissues from
                    nucleated cells, seems to be necessary. For, although there can be no doubt that
                    all the tissues are mediately derived from the ovum or fundamental cell, and
                    that most of the tissues are derived directly from nucleated cells, yet there is
                    reason to think that a differentiation of a cytode clump of protoplasm into
                    tissue may take place, so that the direct formation of such a tissue would be,
                    not from a nucleated cell, but from the more simple cytode. Hence a more
                    comprehensive generalisation, to which observers have gradually been led from
                    the consideration of numerous facts, has now been arrived at,—that the tissues
                    and organs of the body, whatever may be their form and composition, are formed
                    of protoplasm, or produced by its differentiation; and that the protoplasm
                    itself is derived by descent from the protoplasm substance of the primordial
                    germ-cell. Some, indeed, have contended that protoplasm, cells, and their
                    derivatives can arise by a process of precipitation or aggregation of minute
                    particles or molecules in an organic infusion, and that living matter may be
                    thus spontaneously generated. But the evidence which has been advanced in
                    support of this hypothesis is by no means satisfactory or conclusive, whilst the
                    correctness of the theory of the direct descent of protoplasm from pre-existing
                    living protoplasm is supported by thousands of observations made by the most
                    competent inquirers.</p>
                <p>In the process of conversion of protoplasm into the several tissues, there takes
                    place a differentiation of form and structure <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> a
                    morphological differentiation), and of composition <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi>
                    a chemical differentiation), as the result of which a physiological
                    differentiation is occasioned, whereby tissues and organs are adapted to the
                    performance of special functions. Hence arise the several forms of tissue which
                    occur in the human body and in the higher animals. Many of the tissues consist
                    exclusively of cells which present in different parts of the body characteristic
                    modifications in external configuration, in composition, and in properties, as
                    may be seen in the fatty tissue, pigmentary tissue, and epithelium. Other
                    tissues, again, consist partly of cells, and partly of an intermediate material
                    which separates the constituent cells from each other. Here also the cells
                    present various modifications; and the intermediate material, termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">matrix</hi> or <hi rend="italic">intercellular substance,</hi>
                    varies in structure, in composition, and in properties in the different
                    textures, as is seen in the connective, cartilaginous, osseous and muscular

                    classification of the tissues, based on their structural characters, which shall
                    be in all respects logically perfect; but a convenient basis of arrangement for
                    descriptive purposes may be found by dividing them into those which consist—1st,
                    of cells suspended in'fluids; 2d, of cells placed cn free surfaces; 3d, of cells

                <p>The fluids of the body which have cells or other minute solid particles suspended
                    in them are the blood, the lymph, and the chyle. Sometimes cells are found
                    floating in the secretions of glands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Blood.</hi> —The blood is the well-known red fluid which
                    circulates throughout the blood-vascular system. As its composition and general
                    properties will be described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Physiology,</hi> the solid particles only, which are suspended in the liquor
                    sanguinis, will be considered here. If a drop of human blood be examined under
                    the microscope, crowds of minute bodies, the blood corpuscles, or blood
                    globules, may be seen in it. These present two different appearances, and are
                    distinguished by the names of red and white blood corpuscles.</p>
                <p>The red corpuscles, which are by far the more numerous, are minute circular
                    discs, slightly concave on both surfaces. Their average diameter is about <hi
                    rend="subscript"> π3</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th of an inch, and
                    their thickness about ∣th of that measurement; hence they are not spheres, as
                    the old name blood globules would imply. They are non-nucleated. Single
                    corpuscles have a faint fawn-coloured hue, but collectively they give to the
                    blood its characteristic red colour. This colour is due to the presence in the
                    corpuscles of the substance termed <hi rend="italic">haemoglobin.</hi> It has
                    beèn estimated by Vierordt and Weicker that 5,000,000 red corpuscles are present
                    in every cubic millimetre of healthy human ¾lood, The red corpuscles in the
                    blood of all mammals, except the tribe of camels, are circular bi-concave discs;
                    but in these exceptional mammals they have an elliptical outline. In all mammals
                    the red corpuscles are non-nucleated, though appearances of nucleation have been
                    seen in exceptional individual cases; for Rolleston saw a nucleated appearance
                    in a small proportion of the dried red blood corpuscles of a two-toed sloth; and
                    Turner observed in a proportion of the red blood discs of a Hoffmann’s sloth an
                    appearance of a central nucleus.</p>
                <p>In all birds, reptiles, and amphibia the red corpuscles are oval or elliptical,
                    and in each corpuscle an oval or elliptical nucleus is situated. In all fishes
                    they are nucleated and also elliptical in form, except in some of the
                    Cyclostomata, which possess circular discs. In the elliptical nucleated
                    corpuscles the surfaces are not biconcave, but have central projections, which
                    correspond in position to the nucleus (2, 4, 5, Fig. 28). The red corpuscles
                    vary materially in size in different vertebrata, and these variations have been
                    especially studied by Gulliver. He has found them to vary in mammals from an

                <p>The white or colourless corpuscles are comparatively few in number in the healthy
                    human blood. Weicker has estimated the normal relative number as one white to
                    335 red; in pregnant and menstruating women the proportion is increased to about
                    1 to 280. In some forms of disease the proportion is so very materially
                    increased that they appear to be almost as numerous as the red. They are rounded
                    in form, finely granulated or mulberry-like in appearance, and nucleated—the
                    nucleus becoming more distinct after the addition of acetic acid; moreover, they
                    are larger than the red corpuscles, their average diameter being from ^⅛∙ <hi

                    Corpuscles of a similar form are found in the blood of all vertebrata. They do
                    not vary so much in size in different animals as do the red corpuscles. In <hi

                    they are therefore minute cells. It is very doubtful if they possess a cell
                    wall, the evidence being against rather than in favour of its presence.</p>
                <p>The red blood corpuscles in all vertebrata, except the mammalia, are nucleated
                    clumps of protoplasm; they are therefore minute cells. In mammals, owing to the
                    absence of a nucleus, they do not accord with the definition of a cell adopted
                    in this article, and they are not therefore morphologically identical with the
                    red corpuscles in other vertebrates. What their precise homology may be is
                    somewhat difficult to say, owing to the obscurity which prevails as to their
                    exact origin. If they are merely clumps of specially modified protoplasm, budded
                    off from the white corpuscles, then they are cytodes. If, as some have supposed,
                    they are the nuclei of the white corpuscles, specially modified in composition,
                    then they are free nuclei. If, again, they are the white corpuscles, the cell
                    substance of which has undergone a special differentiation, and the nucleus has
                    disappeared, then they are potentially cells, though no nucleus is visible.
                    Whatever may be their exact homology, there can be no doubt that the
                    non-nucleated mammalian red corpuscle, and that part of the nucleated red
                    corpuscle which lies outside the nucleus, are functionally identical with each
                    other; the protoplasm having undergone a special chemical differentiation into
                    haemo-globin, a proximate principle characterised by containing iron as its
                    essential constituent. The action of water, spirit, acids, alkalies, various
                    gases, heat, cold, and electrical currents, on the red corpuscles has been
                    studied by several observers, and the conclusion has been reached that the
                    corpuscles consist of a “stroma,” with which the colouring matter is blended,
                    but from which it may be separated without the stroma affording any evidence of
                    the presence of an investing envelope or membrane. When blood is drawn from the
                    vessels the red corpuscles, in about half a minute, run together into piles,
                    like <hi rend="italic">rouleaux</hi> of coins <pb break="no"

                    irregular meshes. In inflammatory diseases, and in the blood of pregnant women,
                    the piles of corpuscles form more readily, and at the same time sink rapidly
                    below the surface of the fluid, so as to cause the “buffy coat” seen in the
                    blood coagulum. In the healthy blood of horses a bufly coat is formed as a
                    natural condition of the coagulation.</p>
                <p>One of the most curious properties possessed by the living white blood corpuscle
                    is that of protruding delicate processes from its circumference, which processes
                    may change their shape, or be again withdrawn into the substance of the
                    corpuscle, which then resumes its former circular outline. These processes
                    resemble the sarcode prolongations which <hi rend="italic">Amoeba</hi> and other
                    Rhizopods can project from various parts of their circumference; and as a white
                    blood corpuscle, like an <hi rend="italic">Amoeba,</hi> can by the movements of
                    the processes change its position, the term “amoeboid movements” has been
                    applied to the phenomena in question. Like an <hi rend="italic">Amoeba,</hi>
                    also, a white corpuscle can by these movements include within its substance
                    minute particles of solid matter which it may come in contact with in its path.
                    Thirty years ago W. Addison stated that the white blood corpuscles could pass
                    through the walls of the blood-vessels into the surrounding tissue, where they
                    formed mucus corpuscles, and, under certain pathological conditions, the
                    corpuscles of pus or inflammatory lymph. The passage of white blood corpuscles
                    through the wall of the capillaries was seen in 1846 by A. Waller; and though
                    for many years his observations were ignored, yet the more recent inquiries of
                    Cohnheim and others into the subject have anew directed attention to them. It is
                    now generally admitted that the migration of these corpuscles from the blood
                    through the wall of the capillaries into the tissues does take place, and that
                    they may then “wander” to and fro, owing to the mobility of their contractile
                    protoplasm. These migrated corpuscles are also believed to play an important
                    part in many physiological and pathological processes.</p>
                <p>But the blood contains, in addition to the red and white corpuscles, still more
                    minute particles, which are, however, inconstant in number. Minute globules have
                    been described by Beale and Max Schultze, which are probably detached fragments
                    of protoplasm budded off from the white corpuscles; and Zimmermann has
                    described, as elementary corpuscles, minute particles, which are apparently
                    derived from broken-up red corpuscles.</p>
                <p>In the very young embryo the blood corpuscles, like the capillary blood-vessels
                    themselves, are formed by special differentiation of certain of the cells of the
                    embryo, and these young corpuscles seem to have the power of multiplying by
                    fission. At first they are colourless, but afterwards assume a red colour. Even
                    in mammals the earliest red blood corpuscles are nucleated and larger than the
                    future red discs, but as development goes on, non-nucleated red corpuscles
                    appear, and as their number increases, both absolutely and relatively with the
                    progress of the foetus, in course of time all the nucleated red corpuscles have
                    disappeared, and are replaced by the non-nucleated discs. In adults the red
                    corpuscles are believed to be derived from the white corpuscles, though the
                    exact process of metamorphosis has not been satisfactorily ascertained. It is
                    also believed that red corpuscles may be new-formed in the spleen, and Neumann
                    has recently stated that the red marrow of the bones may serve as a centre of
                    origin for the red blood corpuscles. In the foetus the liver apparently serves
                    as a centre of origin for the white corpuscles, but its blood corpuscle forming
                    function ceases at the time of birth. Throughout extra-uterine life the spleen
                    and the lymphatic glands are without doubt organs of formation of the colourless
                    corpuscles,— those produced in the lymphatic glands, under the name of lymph
                    corpuscles, being mingled with, the blood-stream where the fluid lymph flows
                    into the venous system. When mixed with the blood, the lymph corpuscles become
                    the white blood corpuscles.</p>
                <p>Corpuscles are also found in the blood of the Invertebrata. They are as a rule
                    colourless, but R. Wagner pointed out that in the Cephalopods they are coloured.
                    They are sometimes round, at others oval or fusiform, and in worms and insects
                    have even branched processes. They are always nucleated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Lymph and Chyle.</hi> —The lymph is the fluid found in a
                    subdivision of the vascular system named the lymph vascular system. It is
                    transparent and colourless, and contains numerous corpuscles floating in it,
                    which correspond, in appearance, structure, and the possession of the property
                    of amoeboid movements, to the white corpuscles of the blood. The lymph
                    corpuscles are formed in the glands situated in the course of the lymph vessels,
                    and are carried away from the glands by the stream of lymph which flows through
                    them.</p>
                <p>The chyle is a milky fluid found during the period of digestion in the delicate
                    lacteal vessels which pass from the walls of the intestine. The lacteals join
                    the lymphatics at the back of the abdomen to form the thoracic duct in which the
                    lymph and chyle become mingled together. The chyle contains corpuscles similar
                    to the lymph corpuscles, which are apparently derived from the lymph glands in
                    the mesentery, through which the chyle flows on its way to the thoracic duct.
                    The fluid of the lymph, the chyle, and the blood, in which the corpuscles are
                    suspended, is sometimes described as a fluid intercellular substance. Corpuscles
                    possessing the type of structure of the lymph corpuscles, are named lymphoid
                    cells or <hi rend="italic">leucocytes.</hi></p>
                <p>Cells are also met with floating free in the secretions formed in the interior of
                    some of the glands. They are more particularly found in the secretion of mucus
                    from the mucous glands, and of saliva from the salivary glands. They are round,
                    colourless, nucleated corpuscles, not unlike the white corpuscles of the blood,
                    and have been detached from their original position in the gland follicles.</p>

                <p>By the term free surface is meant a surface which is not blended with or attached
                    to adjacent structures, but is free or separable from them without dissection.
                    Every free surface is covered by one or more layers of cells. Sometimes these

                    are the skin and the membranes, named, from the character of their secretion,
                    mucous membranes. The Mucous Membranes line internal passages and canals, and
                    are continuous at certain orifices with the skin,—e.y., the mucous membrane of
                    the alimentary canal opens on the surface at the mouth and anus; the respiratory
                    mucous membrane opens on the surface at the nostrils, and is continuous in the
                    pharynx with the alimentary mucous membrane—it is also prolonged through the
                    Eustachian tube into the tympanum, and is continuous through the nasal duct with
                    the conjunctiva; the genito-urinary mucous membrane opens on the surface at the
                    orifice of the urethra and vagina. Mucous membranes also line the ducts of the
                    various glands which open on the surface either of the skin or the several
                    mucous membranes. The epithelial cells are as a rule arranged in layers or
                    strata, and the shape of the cells is by no means uniform in the different
                    layers. The cells of the deeper strata are usually smaller, softer, more
                    rounded, and more recently formed than those of the superficial strata, though
                    sometimes, as in the bladder, conjunctiva, and some other mucous surfaces, they
                    may be irregular in form and size, or even elongated into short columns. The
                    cells next the free surface have a tendency to be shed, and their place is then
                    taken by the cells of the deeper layers, which become modified in form as they
                    approach the surface. The form of the cells of the superficial layer varies in
                    different localities, which has led to a division of epithelium into groups
                    bearing appropriate names. Epithelium is distinguished further by being devoid
                    of bloodvessels, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it is non-vascular; and also, with
                    some exceptions, devoid of nerves, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>

                    modification of the fibrous form of connective tissue, to be subsequently
                    described, and in it the nerves and the blood and lymph vessels of the skin and
                    mucous membranes ramify; hence it is sometimes described as a fibro-vascular
                    tissue or <hi rend="italic">corium.</hi> It was for a long time believed that
                    between the deeper surface of the epithelium and the corium a homogeneous
                    continuous membrane, named by Bowman a basement membrane, intervened. Bowman,
                    however, himself admitted that in some of the localities where this membrane was
                    theoretically supposed to exist it could not satisfactorily be demonstrated; and
                    the general opinion of anatomists now is, that a distinct separable membrane
                    does not intervene between the epithelium and the fibro-vascular corium, but
                    that the cells of the former rest directly upon the surface of the latter. The
                    corium is also the seat of the numerous glands, with the blood and lymph vessels
                    and the nerves belonging to them, found in connection with both the skin and the
                    mucous membranes; and the epithelial lining of the g <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> ands is continuous at their orifices with the epithelial investment of
                    the corium. The surface both of the skin and mucous membranes is usually more or
                    less undulated—sometimes it is thrown into strong folds or rugae, at others it
                    is elevated into minute, frequently conical, processes, named in some localities
                    papillae, in others villi; but in all these cases the epithelium is prolonged as
                    a continuous covering over the undulating free surface. The free surface of all
                    mucous membranes is kept moist by the secretion or mucus which lubricates
                    it.</p>

                    name of the horny layer of the cuticle or epidermis, the superficial investment
                    of the skin. Its cells are nucleated flattened scales, varying in diameter from

                    tessellated, pavement-like arrangement, whilst the cells in adjacent layers have
                    their flattened surfaces in contact with each other. Sometimes the cells have
                    jagged, serrated edges, or fluted surfaces, and usually they contain scattered
                    granular particles. In the formation of this epithelium a morphological
                    differentiation of the protoplasm of the rounded cells of the deeper strata into
                    flattened scales, and at the same time a chemical differentiation of their soft
                    contents into a horny material, have occurred.</p>

                    the ducts of various glands which open on the alimentary mucous membrane; it
                    covers the mucous lining of the urethra and the mucous membrane of the gall
                    bladder. Its cells are elongated, cylindrical columns, about <hi

                    side by side like a row of palisades, and with their long axes perpendicular to
                    the surface on which the cells rest. Sometimes the cells are uniformly
                    cylindrical; at other times they are compressed at the sides; at others they
                    vary in circumference,—the broader end, lying next the surface, being rounded or
                    polygonal; the deeper extremity being narrower and more pointed. The nuclei are
                    distinct, and the cell contents are finely granular. Usually this epithelium
                    forms only a single layer of cells. The columnar cells which cover the intes <hi

                    ends, which is often streaked with fine parallel lines. Intermingled with the
                    cells of the columnar epithelium of the alimentary canal are small goblet-shaped
                    cells.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ciliated</hi> epithelium is situated on the free surface of the

                    each cilium, whilst the periphery possesses the firmer consistence of formed or

                    to be referred to the endothelial than the epithelial series of structures.
                    Cilia occasion currents in the fluid in which they move, and play an important
                    part in the economy of many animals; in some of the Invertebrata they serve as
                    organs of locomotion, in others they propel currents over respiratory surfaces,
                    and in others aid in bringing food within the animal’s reach.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spheroidal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">glandular</hi> epithelium
                    is situated on the free surface of the follicles or ultimate secreting apparatus
                    of glands, and the commencement of gland ducts. The cells are often spheroidal
                    in form, though not unfrequently they are polyhedral. Their contents are
                    specially differentiated into the secretion of the particular gland in which
                    they are situated.</p>
                <p>The epithelial cells of a Secreting Gland rest upon a sub-epithelial tissue. Not
                    unfrequently this tissue has the appearance of a membrane; it represents,
                    indeed, the basement membrane of Bowman, and is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">propria.</hi> Deeper than this apparent membrane
                    is a delicate connective tissue in which the blood and lymph vessels and the
                    nerves of the gland ramify. The anatomical structures necessary for secretion
                    are cells, blood-vessels, and nerves-The blood-vessels convey the blood from
                    which the secretion has to be derived; the cells, as Goodsir showed by a variety
                    of proofs, are the active agents in separating the secretion from the blood; the
                    nerves regulate the size of the blood-vessels, and therefore the amount of blood
                    which circulates through the gland, and perhaps also exercise some direct
                    influence on the activity of the cells. The connective tissue and the <hi

                    structures for the cells, vessels, and nerves. All secreting glands have the
                    same general type of structure, though they differ from each other, as will be
                    pointed out when the individual glands are described, in the degree of
                    complexity in which their constituent parts are arranged.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Transitional</hi> epithelium is the name applied to epithelial
                    cells, situated on some free surfaces, which possess transitional forms either
                    between the columnar and tessellated epithelia, or the columnar and spheroidal
                    The epithelium of the mucous lining of the bladder is transitional between the
                    columnar and scaly varieties; and in many glands the continuity of the
                    epithelial layer from the spheroidal epithelium of the gland follicles to the
                    columnar epithelium of the ducts is preserved by the interposition of
                    intermediate transitional forms of cells.</p>
                <p>The epithelial surfaces of the upper part of the mucous lining of the nose and of
                    the back of the tongue arc specially modified in connection with the senses of
                    smell and taste localised in those regions, as will afterwards be considered
                    when their anatomy is described.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Endothelium.</hi> —The free surfaces covered by an
                    endothelium are the serous membranes, the inner surface of the walls of the
                    lymph and blood vessels and of the heart, the synovial membranes of the joints
                    and of synovial bursae, the free surface of the osseous and membranous labyrinth
                    of the internal ear, and the free surface of the ventricular cavities of the
                    brain and central canal of the spinal cord. The tubes, canals, and cavities
                    lined by an endothelium are shut off from all communication with the external
                    atmosphere. The cells of the endothelium are arranged so as to give perfect
                    smoothness to the surface which they cover. In the blood and lymph vessels this
                    smoothness of surface is in order to facilitate the flow of the blood and lymph
                    in the course of .the circulation. The serous and synovial membranes are found
                    covering the surfaces oι parts which move on eacn other, and thθ smoothness of
                    their respective surfaces, by permitting freedom of movement, diminishes the
                    friction.</p>
                <p>Each Serous Membrane consists of a portion which invests the viscus or organ,
                    named the visceral layer, and a portion which lines the walls of the cavity in
                    which the organ is situated, named the parietal layer. Between these two layers
                    is the so-called serous cavity, the wall of which is formed by the smooth
                    surfaces of both the parietal and the visceral layers. The serous membranes are
                    as follows :—The two pleurae situated in the cavity of the chest, one investing
                    each lung, and lining the interior of that part of the thoracic cavity in which
                    the lung is situated; the pericar dium, which invests the heart, and lines the
                    bag in which the heart is contained; the peritoneum, which invests the abdominal
                    viscera, and lines the. abdominal cavity; and the arachnoid membrane, which
                    invests the brain and. spinal cord, and is regarded by many as lining the dura
                    mater, which encloses these important organs. The smooth free surfaces of the
                    serous membranes are moistened by a limpid fluid, or serum, which facilitates
                    their movement on each other, just as the free smooth surfaces of the synovial
                    membranes are lubricated by the viscid synovia which they secrete.</p>
                <p>Endothelial cells form usually only a single layer, and are, as a rule, flattened
                    scale-like cells, arranged after the manner of a tessellated epithelium.
                    Endothelium, like epithelium, is non-vascular, and, so far as is known,
                    non-nervous.</p>
                <p>The endothelial cells rest upon a sub-endothelial tissue, consisting of a
                    delicate modification of the fibrous form of connective tissue. Here, as in the
                    surfaces covered by epithelium, a basement membrane was at one time supposed to
                    intervene between the cells and the connective tissue; but it is now believed
                    that the cells are in direct contact, by their deeper surface, with the
                    connective tissue itself. In the serous membranes and in the coats of the larger
                    blood-vessels elastic fibres are present in considerable numbers in the
                    sub-endothelial tissue, which serves as the framework of support for the blood
                    and lymph vessels and the nerves of the part. In the serous membranes the
                    lymphvessels are very abundant in the sub-epithelial tissue, where they form a
                    layer parallel to the free surface of the membrane, from which short vessels
                    pass vertically to open by minute orifices into the serous cavity. The serous
                    membranes are attached by the sub-endothelial connective tissue to the organs
                    which they invest.</p>
                <p>The endothelium of the Serous Membranes consists of irregular and squamous cells,
                    the edges of which may be smooth or slightly serrated. The cells are closely
                    adapted to each other by their edges, so as to form a continuous smooth layer,
                    which forms the free surface of the serous membrane. Scattered irregularly over
                    this surface are the minute orifices, or <hi rend="italic">stomata,</hi> which
                    open into lymphatic vessels. The cells which surround the stomata differ in form
                    and appearance from the ordinary endothelium; they are smaller, and are
                    polyhedral, their contents are granular, and the nucleus is more distinct.</p>
                <p>The endothelium lining the Lymphatic Vessels consists of flattened cells, which,
                    instead of having an irregular shape, are elongated spindles, slightly sinuous
                    in outline. The endothelium of the lymphatics is continuous with that of the
                    serous membranes through the stomata, so that the cavities of the serous
                    membranes are now regarded as great lymph-sacs.</p>

                <p>The endothelial lining of the Blood Vessels corresponds in general characters
                    with that of the lymphatics. In the small blood capillaries the cells are
                    fusiform; in those of larger size, more irregular: in the veins they are
                    broader, more irregular, and less distinctly fusiform than in the arteries. The
                    endothelial covering of the endocardial lining of the heart consists of a layer
                    of flattened cells with irregular outlines. The endothelial lining of the
                    blood-vascular system is continuous with that of the lymph-vascular system,
                    where the thoracic duct and other large lymph-vessels open into the great veins,
                    and thus a continuity of surface is established between the serous membranes and
                    the lining membrane of the blood-vascular system through the lymphatics.</p>
                <p>( The endothelium of the Synovial Membranes is formed of roundish, or polygonal,
                    or tessellated cells, arranged after the manner of a stratified epithelium. Not
                    unfrequently processes of the sub-endothelial vascular connective tissue covered
                    by the endothelium project into the cavities of joints and synovial bursae. They
                    have been called synovial fringes, and contribute to the formation of the
                    synovia which lubricates the surfaces of a synovial membrane.</p>
                <p>The endothelium of the Cerebral Ventricles and Central Canal of the spinal cord
                    is, as already stated, formed of spheroidal or cylindrical cells, possessing
                    cilia on the free surface. The endothelial lining of the osseous labyrinth
                    consists of flattened scales, whilst the membranous laby rinth possesses a layer
                    of polygonal cells.</p>
                <p>3J <hi rend="italic">Group.—Cells imbedded in Solid Tissues.</hi></p>
                <p>The cells which are imbedded in the solid tissues are either grouped together in
                    considerable masses, or, as not unfrequently happens, are more or less separated
                    by an intermediate matrix or intercellular substance. The matrix substance
                    varies in its character in different tissues, and sometimes is so abundant as to
                    obscure the cells. The textures which are constructed on this plan are of great
                    importance, and constitute by far the larger proportion of the tissues not only
                    of the human body, but of the bodies of animals generally. Sometimes these
                    tissues are elongated into delicate threads or fibres, at other times they are
                    expanded into thin membranes, at others they form solid masses of considerable
                    thickness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Connective Tissue.</hi> —By the term connective tissue is
                    meant a group of tissues which, though the members of the group differ in
                    various respects from each other, both in naked eye and microscopic characters,
                    yet agree in the property of binding or connecting together other tissues or
                    parts of the body, and in serving as a supporting framework for more delicate
                    tissues. This group of tissues is the most extensively diffused of all the
                    textures, for there is no organ in the body which does not contain one or other
                    of its forms. The following varieties, based on modifications in their

                    applied by Virchow to the delicate tissue in the central organs of the nervous
                    system, and of the retina, which supports the nerve cells, nerve fibres, and
                    blood-vessels of those parts. Microscopically it consists of small round or
                    ovoid corpuscles, imbedded in a soft undifferentiated protoplasm. Λ form of
                    tumour, named Glioma, is sometimes produced by the excessive growth in the brain
                    or retina of this variety of connective tissue.</p>

                    supporting framework of the lymphatic and other glands which possess the adenoid
                    type of tissue. It also forms the middle subdivision of the enamel organ of the
                    teeth. It consists of stellate branching cells, the branches of which blend with
                    each other, and form a delicate anastomosing network or reticulum. In the lymph
                    glands, the colourless lymph corpuscles are set in the meshes of this network.

                    of the embryo, the vitreous humour of the eye-ball, and the jelly of Wharton,
                    which invests the blood-vessels of the umbilical cord. It is soft and jelly-like
                    in consistency. Microscopically it consists of rounded, or spindlelike, or
                    stellate cells, imbedded in a soft gelatinous intercellular substance. Sometimes
                    the intercellular substance is in part differentiated into short delicate
                    fibres. Under some pathological conditions, this form of tissue increases
                    largely in quantity in some parts of the body, and forms a kind of tumour named
                    Myxoma.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">d. Fibrous</hi> connective tissue presents four modifications
                    in appearance. It may be soft and delicate, with the fibres short and but
                    faintly marked, as in the sub-epithelial tissue of the skin and mucous
                    membranes. It may be loose, flocculent, and filamentous, and may contain small
                    spaces or areolae (when it is called <hi rend="italic">areolar tissue),</hi>
                    which is well seen in the subcutaneous tissue of the adult, and in the omenta.
                    It may be expanded in the form of a <hi rend="italic">fibrous membrane,</hi> as
                    in the fasciae or aponeuroses, and the threads or fibres, strong and well

                    may be collected into rounded or flattened bands, as in tendons and ligaments,
                    where it forms the <hi rend="italic">tendinous</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ligamentous</hi> tissues. Here also the threads or fibres may be distinctly

                    which the tendon or ligament passes.</p>
                <p>In the fibrous form of connective tissue, both cells and intercellular substance,
                    the latter of which is differentiated into fibres, may be recognised. The cells
                    are, as a rule, either elongated, or fusiform, or caudate, or stellate branched
                    cells, and are familiarly known as the <hi rend="italic">connective tissue
                    corpuscles.</hi> In these cells the nucleus is round or oval, and usually well
                    marked. It is surrounded by granular protoplasm, but it is very doubtful if the
                    protoplasm is invested by a cell wall. Not unfrequently, more especially where
                    the cells are stellate, the delicate branched protoplasm processes of adjacent
                    cells appear to blend at their extremities with each other, and form an
                    anastomosing network. In tendons the cells are arranged in linear rows, which
                    lie parallel to the long axis of the tendon itself. In adults these cells are
                    flattened, but in younger tendons they are more polygonal in form. There seems
                    reason to think, indeed, as Thin has shown, that the bundles of connective
                    tissue are invested by a layer of flattened cells. The wide diffusion of the
                    connective tissue throughout the body, and the great importance of its cellular
                    elements, have been especially dwelt on by Virchow as sources of origin of the
                    new cell forms which arise in various pathological processes.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">intercellular substance</hi> consists of fibres, which are
                    not uniform in shape, and are divided into the two groups of white and yellow
                    fibres.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">white fibres</hi> of connective tissue constitute the most
                    common form, and make up the great bulk of most ligaments, tendons, and fibrous
                    membranes. They consist of excessively delicate filaments, varying from ^ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> κ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> 7π</hi> th to <hi
                    rend="subscript"> κ</hi> &lt; <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 7</hi>)th inch in thickness, which are united together in
                    bundles or fasciculi of variable size. The bundles, as well as the filaments of
                    which they are composed, have a wavy course, and the filaments in each bundle
                    lie almost parallel to each other. The bundles also in some cases are parallel,
                    though in others they cross at various angles. Not only the filaments in each
                    bundle, but the bundles themselves, are cemented together; the firmness of the
                    adhesion varies in the different modifications of the fibrous connective tissue,
                    being much more decided in the tendons, ligaments, and fascise, than in the lax
                    areolar tissue.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">yellow fibres</hi> of connective tissue, named elastic
                    fibres, from their elasticity, make up the mass of the ligamentum nuchae, the
                    ligamenta sub-flava, and the yellow .elastic coat of the arteries. They are also
                    found, mingled with the white fibres, in the fibrous membranes, the skin, mucous
                    and serous membranes, the areolar tissue, in tendons, and some ligaments. In the
                    ligamenta sub-flava and nuchae the yellow fibres are arranged in bundles, the
                    individual fibres of which are comparatively broad, with a distinct dark
                    outline. They branch, and their branches readily break across, and the broken
                    end then curls upon itself. Their diameter is about ΓδW <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> h In the coats of the arteries the elastic fibres form an anastomosing
                    network. When mingled with the white fibres they are much finer, and sometimes
                    do not exceed <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> y⅜- <hi rend="subscript"> ff7</hi> th
                    inch in diameter. They possess, however, a distinct and definite outline; they
                    branch and occasionally anastomose; and the individual fibres, possessing a
                    ring-like, spiral, or twisted course, are wound around the bundles of the white
                    fibres. The white fibres yield gelatine on boiling, but the elastic fibres do
                    not. The white fibres swell up and become so transparent under the action of
                    acetic acid as to be no longer recognisable. The yellow fibres, again are not
                    affected by that reagent. Quekett pointed out that the elastic fibres of the
                    ligamentum nuchae of the giraffe were marked by transverse striae, and Μ. Watson
                    has seen a similar appearance in the elastic pericardiac ligament of the
                    elephant. These transverse striae are apparently cracks in the fibre; and, as
                    Beale has shown, are not unfrequently seen in the elastic fibres in beef and
                    mutton which have passed through the alimentary canal.</p>
                <p>Bearing on the mode of nutrition of the tendons, and other fibrous forms of
                    connective tissues, the existence of plasma, or juice, canals has been
                    described, along which, not blood, but the liquor sanguinis is supposed to flow.
                    Virchow conceived that the connective tissue corpuscles formed an anastomosing
                    network for this purpose. Brücke believed that delicate channels or lacunae
                    existed between the bundles of connective tissue, whilst Recklinghausen
                    maintained that serous canaliculi were situated in the homogeneous substance
                    which connects the fibrous fasciculi and lamellae of the connective tissue with
                    each other. These lacunae or canaliculi are, in all probability, the rootlets of
                    origin of the lymphatic system of vessels. There can indeed be no doubt, as the
                    recent injections of Ludwig and Schweigger-Seidel have shown, that tendons and
                    fasciae are well provided with lymph vessels, for they have injected in them a
                    minute network, consisting in part of polygonal meshes, and in part of vessels
                    running longitudinally and parallel to the connective tissue bundles, and the
                    walls of these vessels were formed of endothelial cells. Recklinghausen and
                    others have recently described corpuscles in the connective tissue which
                    resemble in size and appearance the white corpuscles of the blood and lymph.
                    These corpuscles are believed to move about in the juice canals already referred
                    to, and it is possible that they may have migrated into the tissue through the
                    walls of its nutrient blood-vessels.</p>
                <p>The vascularity of the connective tissue varies in different localities. The
                    periosteum and perichondrium are very vascular; but their numerous vessels are
                    concerned in the nutrition not merely of these fibrous membranes, but of the
                    bone and cartilage which they invest. The sheath of connective tissue which
                    invests a tendon is more vascular than the substance of the tendon itself. As a
                    rule, it may be stated that the fibrous connective tissues are not highly
                    vascular, and that the nutritive changes which take place in them after their
                    growth is completed are not very active.</p>
                <p>The mode of development of the connective tissue has been much discussed by
                    anatomists, and various views have been advanced as to the changes which lead to
                    its production. It is now, however, generally admitted that it arises from the
                    embryonic cells by a special morphological and chemical differentiation of their
                    protoplasm, but the degree to which this differentiation may proceed varies with
                    the particular form of the texture. In the neuroglia the. tissue is apparently a
                    simple nucleated protoplasm. In the retiform connective tissue the cells have
                    assumed a stellate shape, and their branches anastomose. In the gelatinous and
                    fibrous forms an intercellular matrix is extensively produced, and exhibits a
                    differentiation into fibres. In these' last-named forms, which are the most
                    characteristic varie-' ties of the tissue, the cells of the embryo change their
                    form, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n904/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0904-0851"/> and assume a fusiform, caudate, or stellate
                    shape; and, subsequently a delicate fibrillated structure appears between them,
                    which assumes the characters of the bundles of white fibrous tissue, and by
                    separating the cells from each other forms the fibrous intercellular matrix. It
                    has been much disputed whether these white fibres take their rise immediately
                    from the peripheral portion of the cells by a direct differentiation of their
                    protoplasm, or whether this protoplasm is not in the first instance converted
                    into a homogeneous matrix in which the fibrous differentiation then occurs.
                    There can be no doubt that the fibres are formed by a metamorphosis of the
                    protoplasm of the cells; whether the metamorphosis takes place directly, or
                    through the intermediate stage of a homogeneous matrix, is a secondary question,
                    and in all probability both modes of conversion take place at different times
                    and in different localities. As the differentiation into fibres progresses, the
                    tissue becomes firmer and tougher, and the proportion of the cellular to the
                    fibrous element diminishes. Hence, say in a young tendon, the rows of connective
                    tissue cells are not only closer together, but are much more readily seen than
                    in an adult tendon, in which the increased production of fibres obscures the
                    cellular element.</p>
                <p>The mode of origin of the yellow elastic fibres has also been much discussed. At
                    one time it was believed that they were derived from nuclei, and on this
                    supposition they were named nuclear fibres. But from more recent observations
                    there is reason to believe that they are produced, like the white fibres, by a
                    special differentiation of the protoplasm of the embryonic cells, or of a
                    homogeneous matrix derived from that protoplasm. In sαch localities as the
                    ligamentum nuchae, where the fibres are both large and numerous, the whole of
                    the cell protoplasm appears to become converted into elastic tissue. In tendons,
                    and those parts where these fibres are slender and scanty, and coil round the
                    bundles of white fibrous tissue, they apparently arise from a differentiation of
                    the protoplasm on the surface only of the formative embryonic ceÜs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adipose Tissue.</hi> —The adipose or fatty tissue varies in
                    its amount in different individuals. It is especially found in the marrow of the
                    bones; as a layer beneath the skin, differing in thickness in different
                    individuals; and collected in the cavity of the abdomen in the folds of
                    peritoneum, known as the mesentery and omenta, in which, and indeed in the other
                    localities where it occurs, it is intimately associated with the connective
                    tissue. It consists of cells, which vary in size from <hi rend="subscript">
                    5</hi> ⅜- <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>-th to ^⅜- <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>-th
                    inch, usually ovoid or spherical in form, though when collected into masses they
                    may be laterally compressed. These cells are sometimes isolated, though most
                    usually arranged in rows or clusters to form lobules of fat. The number of cells
                    in a given lobule varies with the size of the lobule. The distinctive contents
                    of these cells is a minute drop of oil, which, when examined by transmitted
                    light, presents a bright appearance; but when seen by reflected light, looks, as
                    Monro <hi rend="italic">primus</hi> described it long ago, like.</p>
                <p>a cluster of pearls. Each fat cell possesses a distinct wall, as can be readily
                    demonstrated by digesting these cells in ether, when the oil is dissolved out
                    and the membranous wall remains. The nucleus of the fat cell is more difficult
                    to demonstrate, and when seen is found attached to the inner surface of the cell
                    wall. In the fat of old persons, and in specimens of this tissue which have been
                    removed from the body for a length of time, a stellate group of acicular
                    crystals is not unfrequently to be seen in the interior of the cell, which
                    consists either of margarin or margaric acid, one of the constituents of human
                    fat. The lobules of fat cells are included between bundles of the areolar
                    variety of connective tissue, which form their supporting framework. But in
                    addition, they are more or less perfectly surrounded by a network of capillary
                    vessels, which not only serves to convey to them blood for their nutrition, but
                    aids in retaining them in position.</p>
                <p>The close anatomical relation between the adipose and the connective tissue
                    points to a genetic relationship between them. It has now been ascertained that
                    the first stage in the formation of a fat cell consists in the appearance of
                    extremely minute drops of oil in the protoplasm of the connective tissue
                    corpuscles of the part; as these run together larger drops are produced, a cell
                    wall at the same timo differentiates from the peripheral part of the protoplasm,
                    and as the cell becomes distended with oil, by the conversion into fat of its
                    substance, it swells out into a spherical or ovoid cell. Klein has recently
                    shown that the fatty tissue of the omentum and mesentery is formed by the
                    production of oil drops within the branched cells, which form the reticular
                    tissue that supports the lymphoid cells found so abundantly between these folds
                    of peritoneum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pigmentary Tissue.</hi> —In some parts of the body a yellow,
                    brown, or black pigment is found in the interior of cells, which gives to the
                    tissue and organ a characteristic colour. In the coloured races of mankind, and
                    in certain parts of the body of the white races, pigment is produced in the
                    cells of the cuticle or epidermis, more especially in the cells of the deeper
                    strata or rete Malpighi. In the connective tissue corpuscles, also, more
                    especially in the dermis of fish, amphibia, and reptiles, pigment is found in
                    considerable abundance. The choroid coat of the eyeball owes its dark brown or
                    black colour to the presence of pigment in the interior of the cells. The
                    pigment cells of the choroid are usually polyhedrons, 5 or 6-sided, and are
                    arranged to form a mosaic pattern. In the centre is a nucleus, and the cell
                    substance is occupied by numbers of minute brown granules. In the connective
                    tissue on the outer surface of the choroid, the pigment is contained in stellate
                    cells. In the skin of fishes and amphibia, the stellate pigment cells branch and
                    subdivide so as to form highly complex patterns, and the cells are crowded with
                    brown or yellow granules. The production of pigment, either in the interior of
                    epidermal cells, in the polyhedral cells of the choroid, or in the stellate
                    connective tissue corpuscles, is owing to a special metamorphosis or
                    differentiation of the protoplasm substance of these cells.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cartilaginous Tissue.</hi> —By the term cartilage, or
                    cartilaginous tissue, is meant a group of tissues which, though usually found in
                    the form of plates or bars, yet differ in various aspects from each other, both
                    in naked eye and microscopic characters. They agree, however, in forming solid
                    textures, opaque when seen in mass, but, in thin slices, translucent, pearly, or
                    bluish white, firm in consistence, but easily cut with a knife, endowed with
                    considerable elasticity, and yielding chondrine on boiling. Cartilage is of
                    greater importance in the foetus, and in the immature condition of the body than
                    in the adult, for in early life the bones are in a great measure formed of it.
                    As development and growth proceed, a considerable proportion of the cartilage
                    becomes converted into bone, and is called, therefore, <hi rend="italic"

                    Cartilage</hi> does not exist in the adult human body. It occurs, however, in
                    the human embryo, in the embryos of all the vertebrata, and in the larval stage
                    of development of the tunicata, as the slender rod named chorda dorsalis or
                    notochord. In all the higher vertebrata the chorda dorsalis disappears as
                    development advances, but in the lower vertebrates it persists throughout life
                    as a more or less perfect structure. In the lamprey and myxine it forms a
                    continuous rod in the vertebral region. In fish generally, but more especially
                    in the cartilaginous group, it forms a jelly-like mass, occupying the
                    concavities between the bodies of the vertebrae. The cells lie in contact with
                    each other. They are comparatively large in size, are sometimes rounded, but
                    more usually compressed late rally. The nucleus is often very distinct, though
                    at other times more difficult to detect, and the cell wall is well marked.
                    Sometimes a little intercellular substance is found. By some anatomists the
                    chorda dorsalis is regarded as a variety of connective tissue, and not of
                    cartilage</p>
                <p>The cartilaginous framework of the ear of some small mammals—as the mouse, the
                    bat, and the rat—is formed of cellular cartilage, the cells of which are smaller
                    in size than those of the chorda dorsalis, irregularly polygonal, and closely
                    packed together so as to form a solid tissue.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hyaline Cartilage</hi> consists of cells imbedded in a
                    pellucid or hyaline matrix, which, under some conditions, however, may assume a
                    dimly granulated appearance. The xiphoid and costal cartilages, the encrusting
                    cartilages at the articular ends of the bones, the cartilages of the nose, those
                    of the windpipe, except the epiglottis and cornicula laryngis, belong to this
                    variety, as also the temporary cartilages. In hyaline cartilage the cells are
                    ovoid or polygonal, or even fusiform, and sometimes flattened, the flattened
                    form of cell being found next the surface of the cartilage. They lie singly, or
                    in groups of two, or three, or four; sometimes they are arranged in linear
                    series, at other times they are irregularly grouped together. The cell contents
                    are dimly granular, with a well-defined nucleus containing a nucleolus. Not
                    unfrequently two or more nuclei are present in a cell; and in old cartilage the
                    contents are often coarsely granular, or even infiltrated with drops of oil.
                    Heidenhain has shown that powerful induction shocks cause contraction of the
                    protoplasm of the cells towards the central nucleus. The cells lie in cavities
                    in the matrix substance, and the part of the matrix which forms the immediate
                    wall of the hollow is named the capsule of the celL Two or more cells may
                    sometimes lie in the same hollow.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">matrix</hi> of hyaline cartilage is usually homogeneous. In
                    some animals the matrix appears to have a concentric arrangement around the
                    cells; and Rollett has stated that by the use of dilute sulphuric acid or
                    chromic acid the matrix may be made to split up into concentric layers.
                    Sometimes the matrix appears granulated, a change which is very apt to occur in
                    sections of cartilage which have been removed for some time from the body. In
                    the costal cartilages of old persons the matrix becomes fibrous; and it is by no
                    means uncommon to find in advanced age these bars of cartilage converted into
                    bone.</p>
                <p>In the articular or encrusting cartilages the arrangement of the cells is quite
                    distinctive. If a vertical section be made through a plate of this cartilage,
                    the cells next the bone are seen to be arranged in parallel rows perpendicular
                    to the surface of the bone on which the cartilage rests; the cells are smaller
                    than those of the costal cartilage, oblong in form, and the adjacent rows are
                    separated by intermediate hyaline matrix. Near the free surface of the cartilage
                    the cells are flattened, placed parallel to the plane of the surface, and so
                    closely packed together that the proportion of matrix is much reduced. In the
                    intermediate parts of the cartilage the cells lie irregularly in the matrix, and
                    are rounded in form. It was from the study of the changes which take place in
                    articular cartilage in disease that Goodsir was enabled to establish the
                    production of new cells by the multiplication of the normal pre-existing cells
                    of the cartilage,—an observation which formed the starting-point of the modern
                    doctrine of cellular pathology.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fibro-cartilages</hi> are divided into white and yellow. <hi
                    rend="italic">White</hi> fibro-cartilage may form the connecting medium between
                    the articular surfaces of an amphiarthrodial joint, as in the intervertebral
                    discs; or it may form plates in the interior of joints, as in the semilunar
                    cartilages of the knee and other menisci in diarthrodial joints; or it may
                    extend around the margin of the socket of a joint, as in the cotyloid ligament
                    of the hip; or it may invest the surfaces of bones over which tendons have to
                    play, as where the tendons of the peronei muscles play in the groove on the back
                    of the external malleolus. In the intervertebral discs, which give the best
                    illustrations of the structure of white fibro-cartilage, the cells are ovoid in
                    form and distinctly nucleated. Sometimes two or three are grouped together, but
                    not unfrequently they occur singly. They are separ rated from each other by
                    short fibres. In these discs the fibrous matrix is always stronger and more
                    distinct in the peripheral than in the central part. The other forms of white
                    fibro-cartilage are transitional between the true cartilage and connective
                    tissue, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the cells possess the characters of
                    cartilage cells, whilst the fibrous matrix approximates to the matrix of the
                    connective tissue.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">yellow elastic</hi> fibro-cartilages are the epiglottis,
                    the cornicula laryngis, the cartilaginous framework of the auricle of the human
                    ear, and the ears of mammalia generally, and the cartilaginous wall of the
                    Eustachian tube. The cells are rounded or ovoid, distinctly nucleated, and
                    usually arranged singly or in pairs. The matrix is distinctly fibrous; the
                    fibres, which form a close intersecting network<pb break="no"

                    action of acetic acid like the yellow fibres of connective tissue; and Donders
                    has described a continuity between them and the elastic fibres of the connective
                    tissue, which forms the investing perichondrium of this form of cartilage. The
                    yellow fibro-cartilage has no tendency to ossify.</p>
                <p>The bars and plates of cartilage,—except the encrusting hyaline cartilages, and
                    the interarticular, marginal, and investing white fibro-cartilages,—are
                    surrounded by a fibrous membrane or <hi rend="italic">perichondrium,.</hi> In
                    the adult human body cartilage is not penetrated by blood-vessels, but is
                    nourished by the vessels which ramify in its investing perichondrium. In the
                    foetus, however, and in the large masses of cartilage which are found in the
                    skeletons of the cetacea and of the cartilaginous fishes, the cartilage is
                    permeated by canals in which blood-vessels ramify. In the encrusting cartilages,
                    the cartilage is nourished by the blood-vessels of the synovial membrane of the
                    joint, which, in the case of the articular cartilage, form a vascular ring
                    around its margin; and, both in it and in the forms of white fibro-cartilage
                    that do not possess a perichondrium, by the vessels of the bone, to which these
                    cartilages are as a rule attached. In the movable joints, after the child has
                    begun to use its limbs, the synovial membrane is not continued over the free
                    surface of the articular cartilage, but stops at its margin along the line of
                    the vascular ring. In the foetus, however, it has been stated that both
                    blood-vessels and synovial membrane are prolonged over the free surface of the
                    articular cartilage.</p>
                <p>- In the development of hyaline cartilage the contents of the embryonic cells of
                    the part, where the cartilage is to be produced, become clear, and a cell wall
                    differentiates around the exterior of the cell. The nuclei in the cells divide
                    and subdivide, so that a multiplication of the cells by endogenous reproduction
                    takes place. Hyaline matrix substance then appears between the cells, and is
                    concentrically arranged around them; it is believed to be formed by a special
                    conversion of successive layers of the cell protoplasm into a substance which
                    yields chondrine on boiling. The fibro-cartilages, both white and yellow, but
                    especially the latter, yield but little chondrine on boiling, for the fibrous
                    matrix of the white fibro-cartilage is a gelatineyielding substance, like the
                    white fibres of connective tissue, whilst the fibres of the yellow
                    fibro-cartilage partake of the nature of elastic tissue. The fibro-cartilages,
                    therefore, form a group which links together the connective and cartilaginous
                    tissues.</p>
                <p>f. <hi rend="smallcaps">Osseous Tissue.</hi> —The osseous tissue, or bone, is
                    that .which constitutes the hard framework of the skeleton. <hi rend="subscript"
                    > i</hi> Each bone consists of a hard, more or less dense, tough, and but
                    slightly elastic material. The elasticity of the bones is more marked in young
                    than in adult and aged persons. From differences in their external
                    configuration, bones are divided into long or cylindrical, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> femur; short, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> carpal or tarsal bones;
                    flat or plate-like, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> scapula; irregular bones, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> vertebrae. These variations in shape do not, however,
                    involve differences either in composition or minute structure. Bone consists
                    chemically of an earthy and an animal substance intimately blended together. The
                    earthy matter forms about two-thirds of it, and consists chiefly of phosphate of
                    lime, which, from its abundance in bone, is frequently called “bone earth.”
                    Carbonate of lime and a small proportion of soda and magnesia salts are also
                    present. The hardness of bone is due to the presence of the earthy matter. The
                    animal matter forms the remaining third, and yields gelatine on boiling; it
                    imparts elasticity and toughness to the bone, and binds together the particles
                    of earthy matter.</p>
                <p>Bone presents two different structural characters to the naked eye. The outer
                    part of a bone is its hardest part, and forms a dense external shell,
                    technically called the <hi rend="italic">compact tissue.</hi> The interior of a
                    bone is much less firm, and is made up of thin delicate plates or bars, or
                    trabecles, which intersect each other at various angles, and form a lattice-like
                    arrangement, technically called the <hi rend="italic">spongy</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">cancellated tissue.</hi> The plates and bars of the spongy tissue
                    are continuous with the inner surface of the compact tissue. In the long bones
                    the interior of the shaft is hollowed into a canal, named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >medullary canal,</hi> the walls of which are formed by the compact tissue, and
                    the cancellated tissue is found only at the articular ends of these bones; the
                    thickness of the compact tissue in a long bone is always greater at the centre
                    of the shaft than at or near the articular ends. (</p>
                <p>If the outer surface of the compact tissue of a long bone and the wall of the
                    medullary canal be examined with a pocket lens, they will be seen to be riddled
                    by multitudes of minute orifices, which are the mouths of minute tubular
                    passages or canals that traverse the compact tissue. These passages are named
                    <hi rend="italic">Haversian canals,</hi> and their arrangement may be studied by
                    making thin sections through the compact tissue, and submitting these to
                    microscopic examination, when they will be seen to pass longitudinally or very
                    obliquely through its substance, so as to terminate by rounded orifices either
                    on its outer surface, or on the inner surface, which forms the wall of the
                    medullary canal. These canals are connected together at intervals by short
                    transverse or oblique canals. Owing to these communications the dense osseous
                    tissue is permeated by an anastomosing network of canals, which, as they contain
                    bloodvessels, may be named vascular canals. These canals are circular in
                    section, and vary in diameter from about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> π</hi> th to χδ⅛τyth inch. They not unfrequently are dilated
                    at the inner end, where they open into the spaces of the cancellated tissue. The
                    compact tissue of all bones possesses a system of canals similar to those found
                    in the long bones, but when bone occurs in the form of very thin plates the
                    canals may be absent. In addition to the Haversian canals, irregular spaces,
                    named <hi rend="italic">Haversian spaces</hi> by Tomes and De Morgan, may also
                    be seen in sections through the compact tissue. They are met with not only in
                    young but in adult bones, and are regarded as produced by absorption of the bone
                    in those particular localities. In thin sections through bone, more especially
                    when the Haversian canals are transversely divided, the dense tissue or matrix
                    of the bone which surrounds the canals is seen to be arranged in concentric
                    rings, as if it were built up of a series of <hi rend="italic">lamellce</hi>
                    superimposed on each other. These lamellae do not at all times form complete
                    circles, and the number which surround a canal may vary from two or three to
                    half a dozen; they are sometimes called the Haversian lamellae. Other lamellae
                    lie in relation to the periosteal surface of the bone, and are called peripheral
                    lamellae; whilst others again are, as it were, intercalated between adjacent
                    Haversian systems of lamellae, and are named intermediate or interstitial. It
                    has been pointed out by Sharpey that a bone lamella, after the earthy matter has
                    been dissolved out by the action of an acid, is made up of multitudes of fine
                    transparent fibres, which intersect each other and form a network. But he has
                    further shown that the lamellae are perforated by fibres, or bundles of fibres,
                    which pass through them either perpendicularly or obliquely, so as to bolt
                    adjacent lamellae together. With a little care, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >perforating fibres</hi> of Sharpey may be drawn out of the holes or sockets in

                <p>When thin sections through a macerated and dried bone are examined under the
                    higher powers of the microscope, the lamellated matrix is seen to exhibit a very

                    they surround, are sometimes named a Haversian system. From the ends and sides

                    anastomose with the canaliculi proceeding from adjacent lacunae, whilst the
                    canaliculi, springing from the sides of those lacunae which lie nearest to the
                    Haversian canal, open on the wall of the canal itself. The lacunae average in
                    length inch, and their transverse diameter is about <hi rend="subscript">
                    3κ</hi> ⅛- <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ∙th inch; the canaliculi vary from - <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r2</hi> ~¼- <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi> ∙th to ∙^⅜j∙ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ∙th inch in diameter. When examined in a dried bone by
                    transmitted light, the lacunae look like solid, black bodies, and the canaliculi
                    seem to be processes branching off from them, hence they were erroneously called
                    by the earlier observers bone-corpuscles. But if a little turpentine be added to
                    the section, the fluid displaces the air which the lacunae and canaliculi
                    contain in the dried bone, renders the part more transparent, and affords a
                    satisfactory demonstration that they are, in a macerated and dry bone, not solid
                    bodies, but a minute system of spaces and anastomosing little canals; and that
                    all those which lie in the same Haversian system not only freely communicate
                    with each other, but, either directly or indirectly, with the Haversian canal
                    which they surround.</p>
                <p>But a macerated and dried bone, such as one sees in museums and in articulated
                    skeletons, and the structure of which has just been described, is a bone which
                    has been deprived of several soft tissues by the process of putrefaction, which
                    tissues are of the utmost importance in the economy of the bone in the living
                    animal. A living bone is a complex organ, and a macerated bone is only the
                    skeleton of a living bone. It is essential, therefore, in studying the structure
                    of bone, that the attention should not be limited to the appearances presented
                    by the macerated bone, but that the arrangement and structure of its soft
                    tissues should be considered. The soft tissues of a bone are the periosteum and
                    its prolongations, the marrow, the minute masses of nucleated protoplasm which
                    occupy the lacunae of the bone, the blood and lymph vessels, and the nerves.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Periosteum</hi> is a strong fibrous membrane which invests
                    all the exterior of a bone, except where the encrusting cartilage is continuous
                    with its articular end. It is subdivided into two layers: <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> a firm external fibrous layer, consisting of bundles of connective
                    tissue, which decussate with each other in various directions, and amidst which
                    a network of small blood-vessels is freely distributed prior to their passage
                    into the Haversian canals; <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> a softer internal layer,
                    which is especially well marked in young growing bones. This soft layer partly
                    consists of very delicate connective tissue, in which rounded or oval cells are
                    found, which give off slender processes at various points of their periphery,
                    and partly of larger granular cells, which lie next the bone itself. Processes
                    of the soft inner layer are prolonged into the Haversian canals, in which, as
                    Goodsir pointed out, a layer of cellular substance lies between the wall of the
                    canal and its contained blood-vessel, so that these canals are not, as in
                    macerated bones, empty passages, but are filled up by the blood-vessels and the
                    cellular layer.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Marrow</hi> occupies the medullary canal of a long bone and
                    the spaces in the cancellated tissue of bones generally. It occurs in two forms,
                    red and yellow marrow. Red marrow is found in the bones of the foetus generally,
                    and in the cancelli of the plate-like, short, and irregular bones at a more
                    advanced period. It consists principally of large many-nucleated masses of
                    protoplasm, the <hi rend="italic">myeloid</hi> cells of KöUiker and Robin, lying
                    in a very delicate areolar tissue, and supplied by a network of capillary
                    blood-vessels. It contains little or no fat Yellow marrow, again, is composed of
                    fat cells lying in a delicate areolar tissue with accompanying blood-vessels.
                    The areolar tissue, which supports the marrow cells, lines the medullary canal
                    and cancelli, and is named the medullary membrane, or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >endosteum.</hi></p>
                <p>In the fresh bone the lacunae are not empty spaces as in the macerated bone. They
                    are filled up by nucleated clumps of protoplasm, and are therefore, as Goodsir
                    was the first to show, the seats of h’ttle masses of nucleated cells, which
                    cells are the true <hi rend="italic">bone-corpuscles.</hi> The protoplasm of
                    these cells is apparently prolonged into the canaliculi. Hence the hard part of
                    the osseous texture has within it a system of nucleated cells, some of which
                    occupy the lacunae and canaliculi, while others form a lining to the Haversian
                    canals.</p>
                <p>The blood-vessels of a bone are abundant. It receives its arteries partly from
                    the small arteries which ramify in the periosteum, the fine branches of which
                    enter the Haversian canals, and form within them an anastomosing network of
                    capillaries; partly through a special artery which enters the nutrient canal in
                    the bone, to be distributed chiefly to the marrow; partly through small arteries
                    which enter openings in the compact tissue near the articular extremities. The
                    veins of bones are also abundant. In the cancellated tissue they are large, and
                    leave the interior of the bone partly through foramina situated near the
                    articular ends, and partly by a vein which accompanies the artery that traverses
                    the nutrient canal. In the plate-like bones of the skull the veins lie in
                    distinct channels in the diploe, and in the bodies of the vertebrae the veins
                    pass out through large holes in the posterior surface. Bones possess
                    lymph-vessels, but their exact mode of arrangement has not yet been ascertained.
                    Fine nerves have been traced into bones accompanying the arteries which enter
                    the nutrient and Haversian canals.</p>
                <p>It is clear, therefore, that a bone, hard and dense though its texture seems to
                    be, is yet hollowed out by spaces, passages, and canals which, under the several
                    names of medullary canal, cancellated spaces, nutrient canal, Haversian canals,
                    Haversian spaces, lacunae, and canaliculi, are occupied by blood-vessels or
                    other soft tissues. By the penetration of blood-vessels into the bone, blood is
                    conveyed not only to the medulla, but into the very substance even of the
                    compact tissue; and there can be no doubt that the nucleated masses of
                    protoplasm which occupy the lacunae and canaliculi, and line the Haversian
                    canals, are, as Goodsir long ago pointed out, centres concerned in the nutrition
                    of the matrix substance of the bone in their immediate neighbourhood. These
                    cells.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n908/mode/1up"

                <p>together with the periosteum, the medulla, and their bloodvessels, are active
                    agents in the development, growth, and nutrition of the osseous tissue.</p>
                <p>In the description of the development of the skeleton, it was stated that the
                    bones are formed by ossification in cartilage and fibrous membrane, so that
                    bones are produced by secondary changes in a pre-existing material. The mode of
                    production of the osseous tissue in the cartilaginous and fibrous tissues will
                    now be considered, and it should be clearly understood at the outset that, in
                    normal ossification, bone is not formed by a mere calcification of the matrix of
                    the pre-existing tissue, and a conversion of the cartilage or connective tissue
                    corpuscles into bono corpuscles; but, as the researches of Sharpey, Bruch, H.
                    Müller, Lovén, and Gegenbaur have made known, is due to a development of new
                    corpuscles, which Gegenbaur has named <hi rend="italic">osteo-blasts,</hi>
                    accompanied by an abundant formation of blood-vessels.</p>
                <p>When the process of ossification in temporary cartilage begins, a change takes
                    place in the arrangement of its cells at the centre, or point, or nucleus of
                    ossification. The cells, instead of preserving their irregularly scattered
                    arrangement in the matrix, are now collected into longitudinal parallel rows,
                    not unlike what was described in a previous section, in the deeper cells of
                    encrusting cartilage. In each row the cells lie with their long axes transverse,
                    and apparently multiply by a process of fission. The cells at the end of the
                    rows which lie nearest the centre of ossifie change swell out and become more
                    rounded. Calcification of the matrix substance, which separates not only the
                    parallel rows of cells, but also the cells in the same row, from each other,
                    then takes place, which calcification includes also the capsules of the
                    cartilage cells. A general opacity of the cartilage is the result of this
                    calcification, and the further progress of ossification is rendered obscure. It
                    is necessary, therefore, to dissolve out by an acid the calcareous matter, in
                    order to follow the steps of the process, i Spaces or canals now form in the
                    ossifying cartilage, into which blood-vessels, continuous with the vessels of
                    the perichondrium, are prolonged. These spaces are lined by concentric layers of
                    small rounded cells, not unlike lymphoid cells in size and appearance, and form
                    the <hi rend="italic">medullary spaces</hi> of foetal cartilage, whilst the
                    cells and blood-vessels form the <hi rend="italic">medulla.</hi> Respecting the
                    source of origin of the cells of this medulla, there have been difficulties in
                    arriving at a correct conclusion. Some have believed them to be descended from
                    the cartilage cells, though no demonstration of their derivation from this
                    source has ever been obtained. Henke conceived that they might be blood
                    corpuscles migrated from the blood-vessels within the spaces. But the recent
                    observations of Stieda seem satisfactorily to show that the layers of medulla
                    cells are continuous with similar layers beneath the perichondrium, which layers
                    are prolonged along with the blood-vessels into the medullary spaces as they
                    form in the ossifying cartilage. But, whatever be their derivation, there can be
                    no doubt that these cells undergo certain modifications which are of the utmost
                    importance in the further stages of the ossifie process. A few become elongated
                    into fusiform or stellate corpuscles, like those of connective tissue; others
                    have oil drops forming in their interior, and become the cells of yellow marrow;
                    others become the corpuscles of red marrow; others, again, which form the
                    osteo-blasts, properly so-called, are the direct agents in the production of the
                    osseous tissue itself.</p>
                <p>The formation of the medullary spaces in cartilage is owing to an absorption of
                    the calcified cartilaginous tissue. Kölliker points out that the absorption is
                    effected through the agency of colossal, many-nucleated cells <hi rend="italic"
                    >(myeloplaxes</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> which he believes to be derived from
                    the osteo-blastic cells of the medulla already described, so that a destruction
                    of the calcified cartilage precedes the formation of the proper osseous tissue.
                    As the absorption of the cartilage goes on, an irregular series of medullary
                    spaces communicating more or less freely with each other is produced. But along
                    with the destructive changes in the cartilage the production of the new osseous
                    tissue takes place. Certain of the cells of the medulla are arranged in layers
                    around the walls of the medullary spaces, and undergo an important change both
                    in composition and shape. They become granular, their protoplasm hardens from
                    the periphery towards the nucleated centre of the cell, so as to give origin to
                    the dense matrix substance of a bone lamella; but the nucleus, and the
                    protoplasm immediately investing it, do not harden, —they form the soft contents
                    of the lacunae and canaliculi. A second layer of osteo-blastic medulla cells
                    then passes through a similar metamorphosis, and a second lamella is formed. By
                    a repetition of this process around the walls of the several medullary spaces,
                    the lamellae of the bone are produced. Hence it would appear that the dense
                    solid matrix of the osseous tissue is produced by a special hardening of the
                    protoplasm of the osteo-blastic cells in the medullary spaces, and as layer
                    after layer of these cells is ossified successive lamellae are produced. The
                    persistence, however, of the nucleus of each osteo-blast, and of a small portion
                    of its investing protoplasm, preserves within the hard matrix a certain amount
                    of soft material, which being destroyed when a bone is macerated, leaves the
                    lacunary and canalicular system already described. The formation of successive
                    lamellae diminishes the size of the medullary spaces, which then form the
                    Haversian canals. The vascular and cellular contents of these canals are
                    therefore the remains of the contents of the medullary spaces of the foetal
                    cartilage, and are continuous with the deeper layer of the periosteum.</p>
                <p>So long as any cartilage remains in a foetal or young bone the process of
                    replacement of the cartilaginous tissue by the proper osseous tissue goes on,
                    until none of the cartilage is left, except the thin layer of encrusting
                    cartilage at each articular extremity. Bones grow in length by an ossification
                    in cartilage; and a provision for their longitudinal increase is furnished up
                    to, and even beyond the age of puberty, by the plate of cartilage which
                    senar-rates the epiphysis from the shaft of a bone. The ossification of this
                    plate of cartilage marks the period when growth ceases in the long axis of the
                    bone. But bones also grow in thickness, and this addition to their girth takes
                    place by an ossification of material situated at their circumference. It has
                    already been pointed out that a bone is invested by a fibrous membrane, the
                    periosteum, which fulfils for it the same purpose as does the perichondrium for
                    the cartilage. On the deeper surface of the periosteum, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> next the bone itself, are osteo-blastic cells, similar to those
                    which lie in the medullary spaces of the foetal cartilage. These cells pass
                    through a similar series <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n909/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0909-0856"/> of changes, and produce successive layers of new
                    bone at the periphery. The importance of the periosteum as a centre of origin of
                    new bone has, indeed, long been recognised by both surgeons and pathologists.
                    The parts of this membrane in which the special bone-producing power resides is
                    the deep layer of osteo-blastic cells, whilst the blood-vessels furnish the
                    pabulum for their nutrition. If 6trips of periosteum be removed, along with the
                    cells of the deeper osteo-blastic layer, from a bone, and transplanted to other
                    parts of the living body, bone will continue to be produced by their agency.</p>
                <p>The intra-membranous ossification of bone was first recognised by Nesbitt, and
                    has been worked out in most of its details by Sharpey, Kölliker, and Gegenbaur.
                    The tabular bones of the skull offer the best illustration of this mode of
                    ossification. Sharpey has pointed out that a network of minute spicula of bone
                    forms in the membrane, and extends in radiating lines from the centre of
                    ossification towards the circumference of the bone. The ossifying tissue
                    consists of fibres, of multitudes of granular corpuscles or osteo-blasts, and of
                    blood-vessels. The osteo-blasts invest the fibres, but as the investing
                    osteo-blastic cells calcify, from the periphery towards the nucleus, they assume
                    a stellate configuration, and pass through a series of changes similar to those
                    described in the intra-cartilaginous mode of ossification. The fibres, which are
                    in the first instance soft, also calcify, and contribute to the formation of the
                    bone. Here, however, as in the intra-cartilaginous ossification, the active
                    agents in the ossifie process are the osteoblastic cells. The lamellated
                    structure is due to ossification of successive layers of these cells, and the
                    formation of the lacunae and canaliculi is owing to the persistence of their
                    nuclei with a small proportion of unossified investing protoplasm. The increase
                    in thickness of a membrane bone, like that of a cartilage bone, takes place
                    through ossification in a deep periosteal layer of osteo-blasts. Hence it
                    follows that, though the tissue which precedes the appearance of bone in the
                    skeleton is not uniformly the same, in some cases being membrane, in others
                    cartilage, there is an identity in the ossifie process in the two forms of
                    pre-existing tissue, in both of which the osteo-blastic cells are the active
                    agents in ossification. The chemical differentiation which takes place in the
                    protoplasm of the Osteo-blasts during bone-formation is not merely a
                    calcification, but a coincident production of a gelatine-yielding substance,
                    within which the minute calcareous particles are deposited.</p>
                <p>Stress has been laid by some anatomists, in discussing the homologies of the
                    several bones of the skeleton, on the differences met with in the place of their
                    formation. Thus, it has been supposed that a bone originally developed in
                    cartilage cannot be homologous with one originally developed in membrane, and
                    that a fundamental morphological distinction should be drawn between cartilage
                    bones and membrane bones. But when it is considered that, though the place of
                    formation may vary, the method of formation is the same in all localities, it
                    does not appear that so much importance should be attached to the distinction
                    between cartilage and membrane bones as it has sometimes received. Moreover, the
                    differences between these two varieties of bones are, during the growth of the
                    bone, still further diminished, for in both cases increase in thickness takes
                    place in the same kind of pre-existing tissue, and in the same way, viz., by
                    ossification of the deep periosteal layer of osteo-blasts.</p>
                <p>In the description of the development of bone in the foetus and young person, the
                    formation of medullary spaces was referred to. But the production of spaces in
                    bone is by no means limited to its early stages of growth. The medullary canal
                    in a long bone can scarcely be said to exist in the bones of an infant’s limbs.
                    The hollowing out of the shaft of a long bone into a large canal, and the
                    enlargement of the spaces of the cancellated tissue, goes on not only up to the
                    period of adult life, but even to advanced years; so that in an old person the
                    relative size of this canal is greater than in the prime of life. The Haversian
                    spaces also, as Tomes and De Morgan pointed out, are produced by the absorption
                    of the lamellae of the osseous tissue surrounding the Haversian canals, and the
                    production of these spaces is constantly going on during the life of the bone.
                    The air-sinuses in the cranial bones are also formed by the absorption of the
                    diploe, and consequent separation of the two tables of the skulL Bones,
                    therefore, are organs which are continually undergoing change. During growth
                    additions are being made to their length and thickness, and additional lamellae
                    are being formed in the walls of the Haversian canals. At the same time a
                    hollowing out of spaces in their interior is going on, so that an increase in
                    weight commensurate with their growth does not take place. The interstitial
                    absorptive changes, whether occurring during growth or after growth is
                    completed, are due, as Kölliker has shown, to the action of many-nucleated
                    colossal cells which line the walls of the spaces where absorption is going on,
                    which cells he has named <hi rend="italic">osteo-klasts.</hi> The development
                    and configuration of a bone is therefore, as has been well expressed by
                    Kölliker, the product of the formation of osseous tissue by the agency of the
                    osteo-blasts, and of its absorption or destruction by the action of the
                    osteo-klasts.</p>
                <p>From the fact that osseous tissue may be produced either in the cartilaginous or
                    in the fibrous tissues, and that all three contribute to the formation of the
                    skeleton, it is evident that these tissues are closely allied. To express this
                    alliance they have all been grouped together under the common term connective
                    substances. ι</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Muscular Tissue.</hi> —The muscular tissue is that which is
                    actively concerned either in the movement of parts of the body on each other, or
                    in the movement of the entire body from place to place; it is the active agent,
                    therefore, both in motion and locomotion. It forms a large proportion of the
                    general mass of the body, is the essential constituent of the muscles or flesh,
                    and enters into the formation of the walls of the hollow viscera. It consists
                    structurally of threads or fibres, some of which are distinguished by being
                    marked with transverse stripes or striae; others have no such markings. Hence it
                    is customary to divide the fibres of the muscular tissue into transversely
                    striped fibres and non-striped fibres. As a rule, the striped fibres are
                    collected together to form those muscles which are under the influence of the
                    will, so that both the muscles and the fibres of which they are composed are
                    called voluntary. One important exception to this rule is, however, met with,
                    for the muscular fibres of the heart, though transversely striped, are
                    involuntary; the will exercises no control over the action of the heart. The
                    non-striped fibres, and the muscles into the construction of which they enter,
                    are in no instance, however, subject to the influence of the will; so that,
                    without exception, they may be named involuntary.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Non-striped</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Involuntary</hi>
                    fibre, sometimes called pale or smooth muscular fibre, enters into the formation
                    of the walls of the hollow viscera— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> stomach,
                    intestines, bladder, uterus—of the walls of the air-tubes, gland-ducts, blood
                    and lymph vessels, of the skin, and various mucous membranes. The fibres are
                    usually collected into bundles or fasciculi, which are not aggregated together
                    into such compact red masses as in the voluntary muscles, but are of a paler red
                    colour, and are set farther apart, and often cross and interlace with each other
                    in the walls of the tubes and hollow viscera, in which this form <pb break="no"

                    from each other by a delicate, areolar connective tissue, <hi rend="italic">or
                    perimysium.</hi> The size of the fasciculi varies in different localities; in
                    the hollow viscera they are so large that their arrangement can be observed with
                    the naked eye; but in the skin, the walls of glandducts, &amp;c., they can only
                    be seen with the aid of the microscope. If a fasciculus be carefully torn up
                    with needles it can be resolved into its constituent fibres, and the number of
                    the fibres varies with the size of the fasciculus. The non-striped fibres are
                    pale and almost colourless, with soft, ill-defined outlines, from <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ιy</hi> ¼th to τ⅛jyth inch in diameter; they are rounded in
                    form or laterally compressed, and are so easily flattened by artificial
                    pressure, that they have erroneously been regarded as flat or ribbon-shaped
                    fibres. When digested for a few hours in dilute nitric or hydrochloric acid, and
                    sometimes even without any reagent, the fibres may be resolved into
                    elongatedfusiform cells—the <hi rend="italic">contractile fibro-cells</hi> of
                    Kölliker —which vary in length from <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅜- <hi
                    rend="subscript"> y</hi> th to <hi rend="subscript"> κ</hi> ⅜ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> th inch, and which taper off usually into attenuated
                    ends. In the middle of each cell is a characteristically elongated, rodshaped
                    nucleus, and sometimes the substance of the cell is finely granular, or even
                    faintly longitudinally striped. No tell wall or sarcolemma can be distinguished.
                    In some localities, as was pointed out by Lister in the minute arteries in the
                    web of the frog’s foot, isolated contractile fibro-cells are wound spirally
                    around the wall of the vessel.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Transversely Striped</hi> fibre is the characteristic
                    tissue of the voluntary muscular system, and is found wherever energetic
                    movements are to be performed. In these muscles the fibres are collected
                    together in fasciculi, which bundles usually lie parallel to each other, and
                    extend from the tendon of origin to the tendon of insertion. Each muscle is
                    invested by a membranous sheath formed of connective tissue, the <hi
                    rend="italic">perimysium externum,</hi> which sheath gives off processes that
                    dip into the substance of the muscle, so as to form delicate partitions between
                    the fasciculi, and from these partitions still more slender prolongations of
                    connective tissue, named <hi rend="italic">perimysium internum,</hi> pasβ
                    between the fibres. The number and size of the fasciculi vary with the size and
                    texture of the muscle; in some, as the deltoid and glutaeus maximus, the
                    fasciculi are large and coarse; whilst in others, as the gracilis and omo-hyoid,
                    they are much finer. The number of fibres in a fasciculus varies with its length
                    and thickness, and the fibres which are adjacent to each other in a fasciculus
                    lie parallel. The striped fibres are cylindrical or laterally compressed; they
                    usually taper off at their extremities, and apparently do not, even in muscles
                    with long fasciculi, exceed 1∣ inch in length. The transverse diameter of the
                    striped fibres varies, in different localities in the human body, from <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> ⅜- <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi> ∙th to 3y4⅛ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th inch, according to the measurements of Kölliker.
                    Much wider differences in diameter are found in the animal series, in insects
                    the fibres being of extreme minuteness, whilst in cold-blooded animals they are
                    much larger than in man and mammals.</p>
                <p>If a fibre be carefully separated from a fasciculus, and examined microscopically
                    by transmitted light, transverse stripes may be readily seen to extend across it
                    from side to side. These transverse striae are not mere surface marks, but, as
                    Bowman pointed out, pass through its entire thickness, and lie parallel to each
                    other. The striation is due to the structure of the fibre, which consists of
                    dark and light bands or discs, alternately dark and light. The discs differ in
                    optical properties, for, as Brücke’s observations show, the light discs refract
                    light singly—are isotropic; whilst the dark discs refract light doubly, and
                    consist of an anisotropic substance. Busk and Huxley described in 1853 a dark
                    line passing across the light disc, so as to subdivide it into two halves; and
                    this appearance has also been figured by Sharpey, Krause, and others. It is
                    believed to be due to the presence of a strongly refracting stripe in the middle
                    of the feebly refracting disc. More recently Hensen has directed attention to a
                    slender, feebly refracting stripe passing transversely across the strongly
                    refracting disc, so as to subdivide it also into two halves. In addition to the
                    transverse striae, the fibres not unfrequently show markings which extend
                    longitudinally, but these are irregular in position, do not correspond to the
                    whole length of the fibre, or necessarily pass through its entire thickness.</p>
                <p>The transverse and longitudinal markings indicate that a muscular fibre has a
                    disposition to split up transversely or longitudinally into smaller particles.
                    The transverse subdivision of the fibre is promoted by digesting a piece of
                    muscle for some hours in dilute hydrochloric acid. If the fibres be then
                    examined, gaps or fissures will be seen to extend transversely into the
                    substance of the fibre; and, if the digestion has been sufficiently prolonged,
                    the fissures have extended completely across the fibre, and have subdivided it
                    into a multitude of plate or disc-shaped bodies—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >muscular-fibre discs.</hi> These discs are the strongly and feebly refracting
                    discs already described, and the transverse diameter of each disc corresponds to
                    that of the fibre from which it has been derived. The longitudinal marks in the
                    fibre are best seen by digesting a piece of muscle in strong spirit of wine, or
                    in a solution of chromic» acid. If a fibre so treated be teased out with
                    needles, and the thin covering glass be smartly tapped, the fibre will split up
                    longitudinally into multitudes of minute, elongated threads—the <hi
                    rend="italic">muscular-fibre</hi><hi rend="italic">fibrilloe.</hi> A fibrilla
                    may be regarded as equalling in length the fibre of which it formed a part, and
                    like the fibre is transversely striped; but its breadth is not definite, and
                    depends upon the minuteness with which the fibre has been split up in the
                    longitudinal direction. If in the same fibre the processes of transverse and
                    longitudinal splitting were to go on simultaneously, then the fibre would be
                    resolved into an immense multitude of rectangular particles—the <hi
                    rend="italic">sarcous elements</hi> of Bowman. If these particles be regarded as
                    the ultimate subdivisions of the fibre, then the discs may be conceived to be
                    built up of a number of these particles, possessing similar optical properties,
                    arranged side by side, so as to occupy the entire diameter of the fibre in any
                    transverse plane: whilst the fibrillae are built up of the particles arranged
                    end to end, so as to correspond to the entire length of the fibre; but in this
                    longitudinal arrangement, particles with different optical properties, the one
                    singly refracting, the other doubly refracting, alternate with each other with
                    the utmost regularity.</p>
                <p>Another view of the structure of muscular fibre has just been advanced by E. A.
                    Schäfer. He describes the dark, or, as seen in a living fibre, the “dim discs,”
                    as traversed by multitudes of excessively fine, dark, rod-shaped particles
                    parallel in their direction to the fibre itself, which extend into the
                    contiguous bright discs, near the middle of which each <hi rend="italic">muscle
                    rod</hi> ends in a knob-like extremity, and the series of knobs form a line of
                    minute dark dots, passing transversely across each bright disc. The muscle rods
                    are <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n911/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0911-0858"/> imbedded in a “ground substance,” that forms the
                    alternating dim and bright discs, which substance he believes to be
                    anisotropous, whilst the muscle rods are isotropous. He regards the ground tabs
                    tance as the true contractile part of the fibre.</p>
                <p>Each transversely striped fibre is invested by a homogeneous membrane, the <hi
                    rend="italic">sarcolemma</hi> or <hi rend="italic">myolemma,</hi> which is so
                    transparent as to allow the characteristic transverse striae to be distinctly
                    seen through it. The sarcolemma is so closely incorporated with the periphery of
                    the fibre, that its isolation and demonstration as a distinct membrane are
                    attended with some difficulty, but when water is added to a living fibre it is
                    absorbed, and elevates the sarcolemma from the sarcous contractile particles. If
                    acetic acid be added to a muscular fibre the transverse striae become less
                    distinct, and a number of oval bodies come into view. These are especially to be
                    seen next the periphery of the fibre in relation to the inner surface of the
                    sarcolemma, though some apparently lie deeper in the substance of the fibre.
                    These bodies have long been known as the nuclei of the striped fibre. More
                    recent investigations have, however, shown that each nucleus lies in a little
                    finely-dotted protoplasm, which often extends in a fusiform manner beyond the
                    ends of the nucleus. These nuclei, with their investing protoplasm, have the
                    anatomical characters of nucleated cells, and are called the muscle <hi
                    rend="italic">corpuscles.</hi></p>
                <p>Some peculiar modifications of ’the striped muscular fibre are met with in
                    certain localities. As a rule, this form of fibre does not branch; but in the
                    muscles of the tongue and lip, and other muscles of the face, these fibres
                    usually branch prior to their insertion, and the branches taper off to finely
                    attenuated ends. In the heart also the fibres branch; and the branches of
                    adjacent fibres anastomose, so that the muscular wall of this organ consists of
                    a compact network of fibres. The individual fibres are smaller than those of the
                    voluntary muscles, the transverse striation is much less distinct, and it is
                    doubtful if an investing sarcolemma be present.</p>
                <p>Some difficulty has been experienced in determining the exact mode of connection
                    of the fibres of the belly of a muscle with those of its terminal tendons. By
                    some it has been supposed that the fibres of the one are directly continued into
                    those of the other; whilst Weismann has described the muscular fibre as
                    terminating in a sharply-defined, rounded, or pointed extremity, to which the
                    fibres of the tendons are closely apposed.</p>
                <p>Both the striped and non-striped forms of muscle are well provided with
                    blood-vessels, which ramify in the substance of the muscle lying in the areolar
                    connective tissue that separates the fasciculi and fibres from each other. The
                    capillaries form an elongated network, the principal strands of which ' lie
                    parallel to the muscular fibres, but never penetrate the sarcolemma. Hence,
                    though the belly of a muscle is a highly vascular organ, its individual fibres
                    are extra-vascular. The vascularity of the fleshy belly is much greater than
                    that of the terminal tendons of attachment, and the nutritive changes are much
                    more active in it than in them.</p>
                <p>The contractile fibro-cells of the non-striped muscular fibre are formed by the
                    gradual elongation of the rounded cells of the middle germinal layer of the
                    embryo into spindle-shaped cells, the oval nuclei at the same time becoming
                    elongated, so as to assume a rod-shaped form. Usually the spindle cells which
                    lie in the same linear series become cemented together into the smooth fibres of
                    this form of muscle.</p>
                <p>The mode of development of the striped fibre is more difficult to follow out, and
                    various statements have been made as to the successive stages of its formation.'
                    Schwann believed that a fibre was built uo of the embryonic cells of the part,
                    which arranged themselves in linear series, coalescing with each other at their
                    surfaces of contact; that the contents of the cells then became transversely
                    striated, and that the cell walls formed the sarcolemma. Savory and Lockhart
                    Clarke maintained that a formation of blastema took place around free nuclei,
                    and that this blastema gradually assumed the striated character. Remak,
                    Kölliker, Wilson Fox, and Frey have, however, by studying the earliest stages of
                    development in the very young embryo, established the fact that the striped
                    fibres are developed from the cells of the embryo, though not in the manner
                    described by Schwann. The process, briefly stated, is as follows: The embryonic
                    cells elongate, the nucleus may remain single, but more usually it divides and
                    subdivides, so that many nuclei appear in the interior of the elongated cell.
                    The nuclei lie in linear series, and may either be separated from each other, or
                    two or more may be in contact, and they may lie either near the periphery of the
                    elongated cell, or in its axis. With this multiplication of the nuclei, the cell
                    increases in length and assumes the form of a fibre. The cell protoplasm, both
                    in the single and many-nucleated fibres, then differentiates into the sarcous
                    particles of the transverse striae, and as this progresses the fibre assumes its
                    characteristic striped appearance. The whole amount of the protoplasm does not,
                    However, assume the transversely striped appearance, for a small quantity
                    remains around each nucleus and forms with it a muscle corpuscle. The
                    differentiation of the protoplasm occasions an anatomical and chemico-physical
                    change in the fibre, and confers on it the property of energetic contractility.
                    W. Engelmann has endeavoured to show that the opaque anisotropic discs of the
                    fibre are those in which the power of contractility resides, and that the clear
                    isotropic discs possess only elastic properties. The mode of development of the
                    sarcolemma is still somewhat obscure. By some it is regarded as the wall of the
                    embryonic cell, which has become metamorphosed into a muscular fibre; by others
                    it is regarded as a special differentiation of the protoplasm at the periphery
                    of the fibre taking place at the time when the transverse striae are being
                    formed; whilst by others it is considered to be a special modification of
                    connective tissue formed around the fibre. In the development of the muscular
                    fibres of the heart, the cells of the embryo heart branch and anastomose, and
                    the nuclei multiply. By the transverse striation of the protoplasm of these
                    cells the branched muscular fibres of the heart are produced.</p>
                <p>In the growth of a muscle the individual fibres increase in size, so that they
                    are bigger in the adult than at the time of birth. The observations of Budge,
                    Weismann, and Beale show that new fibres may also form in a muscle. Weismann
                    believes that this increase may be due to a longitudinal splitting of a
                    pre-existing fibre; but Beale maintains that the new fibres are produced in the
                    muscle in the same manner as the original fibres of the part.</p>

                <p>The Nervous System consists of a number of organs which are named respectively
                    Nerve Centres, Nerves, and Peripheral End-organs. The largest and most important
                    Nerve Centres are the brain and spinal cord, which together constitute the
                    cerebro-spinal nervous axis, and are lodged in the cranial cavity and spinal
                    canal. But, in addition, numerous small bodies, usually oval in form,
                    technically called ganglia, are situated in the axial part of the body, and form
                    smaller nerve centres. The Nerves are white cords which traverse the different
                    regions of the body, both axial and appendicular, for a greater or less
                    distance, for the purpose of connecting together the other sub-divisions of the
                    nervous system. Tire Peripheral End-organs are <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0912-0859"/> minute structures connected with the peripheral
                    extremities of the nerves. These end-organs are situated in the skin and other
                    organs of sense, in the glands, blood-vessels, and muscles. The nerves establish
                    communications and conduct nervous impulses, either between different nerve
                    centres, or between nerve centres and peripheral end-organs, so as to associate
                    together in their action parts of the nervous system often widely separated from
                    each other. Nerves, therefore, are internuncial structures. When a nerve
                    connects two nerve centres together it is intercentral. When a nerve connects a
                    nerve centre with a peripheral endorgan, and conducts impulses from the centre
                    to the end-organ, it is a centro-peripheral or centrifugal nerve. When a nerve
                    connects a peripheral end-organ with a centre, and conducts impulses from the
                    end-organ to the centre, it is a periphero-central or centripetal nerve. Owing
                    to the different directions in which impulses are conducted by nerves, the
                    varying nature of their endorgans, and the functional differentiation of the
                    nerve centres, or portions of the nerve centres in which their central
                    extremities terminate, nerves vary so in. their functions, that a classification
                    of the nerves, based upon their functional properties, has been proposed. Of the
                    centro-peripheral nerves, those which end in the muscles are motor nerves; those
                    which end in the muscular coat of the blood-vessels are vaso-motor nerves;
                    whilst some physiologists have named nerves which they believe to terminate in
                    connection with the secreting cells of a gland, secretory nerves; and others,
                    which they believe to terminate in the tissues and to be concerned in the
                    regulation of their nutrition, trophic nerves. It should be stated, however,
                    that it is not yet absolutely determined that the secreting cells of glands and
                    the cell elements of the tissues have special nerves terminating in connection
                    with them for the purpose of exercising a direct influence over secretion and
                    nutrition. Should these special nerves be non-existent, then the secretory and
                    nutritive functions would be influenced solely by the vaso-motor nerves, which
                    regulate the size of the blood-vessels and the amount of blood which flows
                    through a part in a given time. Of the periphero-central nerves, those which
                    arise in the end-organs in the skin, terminate in a nerve centre, and excite in
                    it the sense of touch, are nerves of common sensation; those which arise in the
                    end-organs in the eye, ear, nose, and tongue, and excite in their appropriate
                    nerve centres the sensations of sight, sound, smell, and taste, are nerves of
                    special sense; whilst nerves which conduct impulses from peripheral end-organs
                    to a nerve centre, and, instead of exciting in the latter a sensation, have the
                    impulses reflected to motor nerves, are reflex or excito-motory nerves.</p>
                <p>The nerve centres, nerves, and peripheral end-organs are arranged in two groups
                    or systems—a Cerebro-spinal and a Sympathetic. The Cerebro-spinal nervous system
                    consists of the brain and spinal cord, the nerves which arise from or terminate
                    in these large centres, the small ganglia connected with these nerves, and the
                    end-organs at their peripheral terminations. The Sympathetic nervous system
                    consists of the sympathetic ganglia, with their nerves and end-organs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Nervous Tissue.</hi> —The several parts of the nervous
                    system are not uniform in colour, some being white, others grey. The nerves, at
                    least those of the cerebrospinal system, are invariably white, and white masses,
                    variable in size, are met with in the brain and spinal cord; they constitute the
                    white matter of the nervous system. In the nerve centres, both of the
                    cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems, grey matter is found, sometimes in
                    considerable quantities. This grey colour is so characteristic, that it may be
                    regarded as marking the position of a nerve centre.</p>
                <p>The nervous system possesses a characteristic form of tissue—the nervous
                    tissue—which in part consists of fibres (Nerve Fibres), and in part of cells
                    (Nerve Cells). The nerve cells are found in the grey matter—that is, in the
                    nerve centres—and sometimes also in the peripheral end-organs. The nerve fibres
                    constitute the nerves, enter into the nerve centres, and pass into the
                    peripheral end-organs; they form the white matter. But in addition to the
                    characteristic nervous tissue, the nervous system also contains a considerable
                    quantity of connective tissue, numerous bloodvessels, and some lymph
                    vessels.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nerve Fibres.—</hi> Nerve fibres are of two kinds: α, the
                    white, medullated, or dark-bordered fibres, which are the characteristic fibres
                    of the cerebro-spinal nervous system, though they do also sparingly occur in the
                    sympathetic system; <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the pale, non-medullated, or
                    gelatinous nerve fibres, which are the characteristic fibres of the sympathetic
                    nervous system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Medullated Nerve Fibres.—</hi> To examine the structure of
                    these fibres, a portion of a cerebro-spinal nerve may be selected. In the first
                    place, it will be seen to be invested by a sheath of connective tissue, the
                    j9eππewr⅛jn, which gives off processes that pass into the nerve, and subdivide
                    it into fasciculi or funiculi. Each fasciculus is in its turn composed of nerve
                    fibres, which are separated from each other by bundles of delicate connective
                    tissue, prolonged from the perineurium, in which the nutrient bloodvessels of
                    the nerve ramify. The size of a nerve is in relation to the number and size of
                    its fasciculi, and the size of a fasciculus is in relation to the number of its
                    fibres. The fibres and the fasciculi lie parallel to each other in the same
                    nerve; but as nerves branch at intervals, the more external of the fasciculi
                    diverge from the main stem to form the branches. In the white matter of the
                    brain and spinal cord the nerve fibres are not arranged in such definite
                    fasciculi as in a distributory nerve, and the connective tissue between the
                    fibres is the soft, delicate form called neuroglia.</p>
                <p>A medullated nerve fibre is an elongated cylinder, which, when examined in the
                    body of a living animal, or immediately after removal from the living body,
                    consists apparently of a soft, homogeneous, or glassy-looking substance enclosed
                    within a limiting membrane. When examined some time after death, or after the
                    addition of reagents, such as water, spirit, ether, collodion, acetic acid,
                    &amp;c., it loses its homogeneous aspect, and the following structures can be
                    distinguished in it: A (Fig. 56), a delicate transparent investing membrane, —
                    the so-called tubular or <hi rend="italic">primitive membrane,</hi> or
                    neurilemma; C, a delicate thread, extending along the axis of the fibre,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">axial cylinder</hi> or central band of Remak; B, a substance which
                    lies between the primitive membrane and the axial cylinder,—the white substance
                    of Schwann, or the <hi rend="italic">medullary sheath.</hi> Within the external
                    outline of the fibre, formed by the investing membrane, is a second line, not
                    quite parallel to the first, and the presence of these two lines gives to the
                    fibre a characteristic double-contoured appearance. The investing membrane is a
                    perfectly pellucid, homogeneous structure, with nuclei arranged at intervals in
                    it. It is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n913/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0913-0860"/> believed to be absent from the nerve fibres in
                    the brain and spinal cord, as well as at the peripheral terminations of many
                    nerves. The medullary sheath is a fatty and albuminous substance, which refracts
                    the light strongly. Not unfrequently it collects into little ball-like masses,
                    and sometimes causes irregular bulgings on the fibre, and produces a knotted,
                    varicose appearance; at other times it becomes granular, and makes the fibre
                    opaque. By gentle pressure it can be squeezed out of the broken end of a fibre.
                    The axial cylinder is a pale, grey, cylindriform band, usually about one-third
                    or one-fourth the diameter of the fibre, which possesses more tenacity than the
                    medullary sheath, and not unfrequently, as in Fig. 56, 2, projects for some
                    distance beyond the broken end of a fibre. Max Schultze showed that it is not
                    homogeneous, but exhibits a very delicate longitudinal fibrillation, and at the
                    ends of the nerves these primitive fibrillae may separate from each other.</p>
                <p>Although from its great delicacy the axial cylinder cannot be seen in the living
                    fibre of a cerebro-spinal nerve, yet there are many reasons for regarding it as
                    a structure existing in the living nerve, and not the product of a <hi
                    rend="italic">post mortem,</hi> change. It is the part of a fibre which first
                    appears in the course of development, the medullary sheath and primitive
                    membrane being secondary investing structures, superadded as development
                    proceeds. It forms not unfrequently the only constituent of a nerve fibre at its
                    central and peripheral terminations, and is therefore the part of the fibre
                    which is anatomically continuous with the nerve cell, or with the peripheral
                    end-organ. As it is the sole constituent of many nerve fibres at their
                    terminations, and of all nerve fibres in the earlier stage of development, and
                    as it forms the medium of connection between them and the structures in which
                    they terminate, it is obviously of primary importance, both anatomically and
                    physiologically, and is believed to be the part of the fibre directly concerned
                    in the conduction of impulses; whilst the investing structures serve the purpose
                    of insulating materials. Lister and Turner pointed out, in 1859, that essential
                    differences in chemical composition existed between the axial cylinder and the
                    medullary sheath; the former being unaffected by chromic acid, though the latter
                    is rendered opaque and brown, and concentrically striated under its influence;
                    while, on the other hand, the axial cylinder is stained red by an ammoniacal
                    solution of carmine with great facility, although the medullary sheath is
                    unaffected by it. They further showed that these differences in the mode of
                    action of chromic acid and carmine might advantageously be employed in the
                    demonstration of the structure of nerve fibres. Ranke has subsequently stated
                    that the axial cylinder possesses an acid, and the medullary sheath an alkaline
                    reaction.</p>
                <p>Medullated nerve fibres vary materially in diameter in different parts of the
                    nervous system. In the brain, for instance, they are sometimes as fine as the
                    <hi rend="subscript"> τ2</hi>-⅜∙ <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi>-∙ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th inch; whilst, in the distributory nerves, fibres of

                    diameter may be seen; though it should be stated that, even in the nerves of
                    distribution, fibres of great minuteness are often placed in the same bundle
                    with those of the largest size. Nerve fibres do not branch in their course, but
                    only at their central or peripheral terminations, and much more frequently at
                    the latter than the former.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Non-medullated Nerve Fibres.—</hi> These fibres, which are
                    characterised by the absence of a medullary sheath, are chiefly found in the
                    sympathetic nervous system, but they occur also in the cerebro-spinal system.
                    The fibres of the olfactory nerve are non-medullated, so also are the peripheral
                    terminations of the cerebro-spinal nerves, and indeed all nerve fibres in the
                    first stage of their development. In <hi rend="italic">Petromyzon</hi> it has
                    been stated that all the nerve fibres are distinguished by the absence of a
                    medullary sheath.</p>
                <p>This form of nerve fibre consists of pale grey, translucent, flattened bands, the

                    homogeneous or faintly granular; but Schultze showed that, when carefully
                    examined, they present a delicate fibrillated appearance, like that seen in the
                    axial cylinder of a medullated nerve; so that, like that cylinder, they are
                    supposed to be composed of multitudes of extremely delicate primitive fibrillae
                    imbedded in a finely granulated material. Sometimes these fibres consist solely
                    of this fibrillated material, at other times they are invested by a sheath
                    similar to the primitive membrane of a medullated fibre. Nuclei are also found
                    both in the substance of the fibre and in relation with the primitive membrane.
                    The presence of multitudes of fibres in the sympathetic nervous system, formed
                    either entirely, or almost entirely, of a material precisely similar in
                    structure to the axial cylinder of a medullated fibre, and by which the proper
                    function of the fibre can alone, therefore, be exercised, is, of course, an
                    additional argument to those previously advanced, in favour of the existence of
                    the axial cylinder as a normal constituent of the fibre, and of its functional
                    importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nerve Cells.</hi> —Nerve cells constitute an important division
                    of the nervous tissue. They are the characteristic structures in the nerve
                    centres, are susceptible to impressions, or nervous impulses, and are the
                    texture in which the molecular changes occur that produce or disengage the
                    special form of energy named nerve energy, the evolution of which is the
                    distinctive mark of a nerve centre. The central extremities of the nerve fibres
                    lie in relation to, and are often directly con-tinous with, the nerve cells. It
                    was at one time thought that nerve cells were globular in form; but it is now
                    generally understood that, though the body of the cell is not unfrequently
                    globular, two or more processes or poles project from it, and are continuous
                    with its substance. Nerve cells are distinctly nucleated; the nuclei are usually
                    large, and contain one, and often two nucleoli. The cell substance is granular,
                    and not unfrequently brown or yellow pigment is co∏ected around the nucleus. A
                    cell wall is sometimes apparently present, though at others it cannot be
                    demonstrated. The nerve cells in the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord
                    are imbedded in the neuroglia. In the smaller nerve centres, as the sympathetic
                    ganglia and the ganglia on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, the nerve
                    cells are surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue. Fräntzel, Kölliker, and
                    others, have described this capsule as lined by an endothelium formed of
                    flattened cells; and it should be stated that Ranvier has described a similar
                    endothelium in relation to the connective tissue investment of the
                    cerebro-spinal nerves. It is not improbable that these endothelial cells form
                    the walls of delicate capillary rootlets of the lymphatic vascular system.</p>
                <p>Nerve cells from which two poles or processes proceed are called bipolar.
                    Characteristic specimens of these cells, as was first pointed out by Robin and
                    R. Wagner, may be recognised without difficulty in the ganglia on the posterior
                    roots of the spinal nerves of fishes, and it is probable that similar cells
                    exist in the corresponding centres in other vertebrates. These cells usually
                    possess a globular body, though sometimes it may be elongated; and from opposite
                    points <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n914/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0914-0861"/> of the surface of the body a strong process is
                    given off, which is directly continued into a nerve fibre. The axial cylinder of
                    the fibre is continuous with the cell substance, and Schultze has shown that
                    both exhibit a delicate fibril-lated structure. The medullary sheath and the
                    primitive membrane are also usually continued from the fibre over the nerve cell
                    Hence these bipolar cells seem to be, as Schultze expressed it, nucleated
                    enlargements of the axial cylinder.</p>
                <p>A remarkable modification of the bipolar nerve cell, carefully studied and
                    described by Lionel Beale, is found in the sympathetic ganglia of the frog. The
                    cells are pear-shaped, and from the narrow end of the pear two nerve fibres
                    arise, one of which, called the straight fibre, forms, as it were, the stalk of
                    the pear; whilst the other, or spiral fibre, winds spirally round the straight
                    fibre, and then passes away from the cell in the opposite direction. Both fibres
                    are nucleated, and at their origin consist, apparently, of axial cylinder
                    substance only; but in their course they may acquire both a medullary sheath and
                    a primitive membrane. The straight fibre passes into the interior of the cell
                    substance, and Arnold and Courvoisier believe that they have traced it into the
                    nucleus; but the spiral fibre apparently arises nearer the periphery of the
                    cell. The pyriform cells are invested by a distinct capsule of connective
                    tissue. The nerve fibres of these pyriform cells, although they both arise close
                    together from one end of the cell, represent its poles. Should one of the poles,
                    either in this, or in the bipolar form of nerve cell described in the preceding
                    paragraph, be from any cause removed or not developed, then the cell would be
                    unipolar; and if both poles were absent it would be apolar.</p>
                <p>In other localities, as in the sympathetic ganglia of man and many other
                    vertebrates, and in the several subdivisions of the cerebro-spinal nervous axis,
                    the nerve cells have more than two poles or processes projecting from them.
                    Cells of this kind are called multipolar, and in many localities they present
                    characteristic forms. In the grey matter of the spinal cord, more especially in
                    its anterior horn, they give rise to numerous processes, and have a stellate or
                    radiate form. In the grey matter on the surface of the convolutions of the
                    cerebrum they are pyramidal in shape. The apex is directed to the surface of the
                    convolution, the base towards the white matter. The processes arise from the
                    base, apex, and sides of the pyramid. In the grey matter on the surface of the
                    cerebellum the body of the cell is almost globular. From that aspect of the cell
                    which is directed towards the white matter a slender central process arises;
                    from the opposite or peripheral aspect of the cell two strong, many-branched
                    processes extend for a considerable distance. In the human sympathetic ganglia,
                    again, the stellate form of cell prevails, and the existence of a capsule of
                    connective tissue around the individual cells can be recognised. The processes
                    which arise from a multipolar nerve cell, as a rule, divide and subdivide as
                    they pass away from the body of the cell, until at last they give rise to
                    branches of extreme tenuity. These branching processes apparently consist
                    exclusively of cell protoplasm, and have been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >protoplasm, processes.</hi> Gerlach has described the protoplasm processes of
                    the multi-polar nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord as forming an
                    excessively minute network, from which minute medullated nerve fibres arise; and
                    F.</p>
                <p>Boll conceives that a similar arrangement occurs in the cells of the cerebellum.
                    One, at least, of the processes of a multipolar nerve cell does not branch, but
                    becomes directly continuous with a nerve fibre, and has been named the <hi
                    rend="italic">axial - cylinder process.</hi> This process was first recognised
                    by Deiters in the cells of the spinal cord; but Hadlich and Kosch-ennikoff have
                    since described the central process of the cells of the cerebellum as continuous
                    with a medullated nerve fibre; and the latter observer has pointed out, that
                    from the base of a pyramidal nerve cell in a cerebral convolution a process may
                    be traced directly into a nerve fibre. Hence it would appear that the multipolar
                    nerve cells may have two modes of union with nerve fibres—one directly through
                    the passage of the non-branched axial-cylinder process into a fibre, the other
                    through the origin of fibres from the minute network in which the branched
                    protoplasm processes terminate. The branched processes of adjacent nerve cells
                    may also blend with each other, so as to form an anastomosing cell network,
                    though these anastomoses are, in all probability, not so frequent as was at one
                    time supposed. Schultze has pointed out that not only the protoplasm substance
                    of the body of a multipolar nerve cell, but both the non-branched and branched
                    processes, possess a fibrillated structure similar to that described by him in
                    the axial cylinder of the nerve fibres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Peripheral Endrθrgans</hi> or <hi rend="italic">End
                    Bodies.—</hi> Nerve fibres at their peripheral extremities terminate in
                    connection with peculiar structures, named <hi rend="italic">end-bodies,
                    terminal bodies,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">peripheral end-organs,</hi> which are
                    situated in the several organs of the body. The motor nerves end in the
                    voluntary and involuntary muscles; the vaso-motor nerves end in the muscular
                    coat of the blood-vessels; the sensory nerves end in the skin, mucous membranes,
                    and organs of special sense; and it has been stated that secretory nerves
                    terminate in connection with the ultimate cell elements of the secreting glands.
                    These end-organs possess certain structural peculiarities, which are by no means
                    uniform in the different parts, so that the end-body connected with the
                    peripheral termination of a nerve is distinctive of the organ in which it is
                    situated. It will be a matter of convenience to defer the consideration of the
                    peripheral end-bodies in the skin, organs of special sense, coats of the
                    blood-vessels, and the several glands, until these parts are described. In this
                    place the mode of termination of the motor nerves in the voluntary and
                    involuntary muscles, of the sensory nerves in the mucous membranes, and of the
                    ending of the nerves in the remarkable bodies named Pacinian corpuscles, will
                    alone be examined.</p>
                <p>After a nerve has entered a voluntary muscle it ramifies in the connective
                    tissue, which lies between the fasciculi, and at the same time divides and
                    subdivides into smaller branches. These branches interlace with each other and
                    form plexuses, from which slender nervous twigs, often consisting of only a
                    single medullated nerve fibre, proceed, which ramify in the connective tissue,
                    separating the individual muscular fibres from each other. The single <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n915/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0915-0862"/> nerve fibres in their turn branch, accompanied by
                    a splitting of the axial cylinder, and these branches usually lose the
                    nιedullated character. The mode of termination of these very delicate branches
                    has been a subject of much dispute. Beale described them as forming a minute
                    network, situated on the exterior of the sarcolemma, but in contact with it, and
                    the fibres of this nervous network were distinctly nucleated. Other observers
                    have, however, described peculiar bodies, called motorial end-plates, at the
                    extremity of these nerves. These end-plates consist of a clump of richly
                    nucleated protoplasm, somewhat oval or perhaps irregular in form, into which the
                    axial cylinder of the nerve fibre penetrates. The exact position of these
                    end-plates in relation to the muscular fibres is difficult to determine. Krause
                    holds that they lie outside the sarcolemma, but adherent to it; whilst Kühne,
                    Margo, and Rouget maintain that the end-plate lies within the sarcolemma, and
                    that the nerve fibre has to pierce that membrane before it can enter the
                    end-plate. After the axial cylinder has entered the end-plate it subdivides into
                    very minute branches. Each muscular fibre has apparently only a single
                    end-plate, and consequently only a single axial cylinder in connection with
                    it.</p>
                <p>Tn flιe non-striped muscles the nerves are distributed in the connective tissue
                    which separates the fasciculi from each other. Here they form plexuses, which in
                    some localities, as in the myenteric plexus of Auerbach in the muscular coat of
                    the intestines, have collections of nerve cells, forming microscopic ganglia
                    lying in them. From these plexuses fibres arise which subdivide into delicate
                    non-medullated fibres possessing nuclei. These delicate fibres form still finer
                    plexuses, which in their turn give origin to minute fibres, which pass between
                    the muscιdar fibre cells to form a still more minute intra-muscular network.
                    Frankenhäuser maintains that the delicate nerve fibrils which arise from this
                    terminal network penetrate the muscular fibre cells, enter the nucleus, and
                    terminate in the nucleolus; but Arnold considers that, after having entered the
                    nucleus, the fibril again gives off a filament, which passes out of the cell to
                    join the intra-muscular plexus; the ending of the nerve, therefore, within the
                    nucleus is only apparent, and is rather to be regarded as the nodal point of a
                    fine intra-nuclear plexus.</p>
                <p>The termination of the sensory nerves in the mucous membranes has been especially
                    studied in the conjunctiva, the mucous membrane of the soft palate, and the
                    glans of the penis and clitoris. In these parts Krause discovered oval or
                    globular end-bodies, which consisted of a soft, homogeneous substance invested
                    by a nucleated capsule of connective tissue. A nerve fibre pierces the capsule
                    and terminates in the interior of the end-body, which forms a bulbous
                    enlargement at the end of the nerve, and is called the end-bulb. After the nerve
                    has entered the end-bulb, it may consist only of the axial cylinder and
                    terminate in a pointed extremity, or it may twist upon itself and form a coil
                    within the end-bulb. When the structure of the skin is described, it will be
                    seen that the ending of the nerves in the cutaneous papillae bears a general
                    resemblance to their termination in the end-bulbs of a mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>But in certain of the mucous membranes delicate nerves have been traced into the
                    layer of epithelium, situated on the free surface of the membrane. Petermöller
                    described nerve fibres continuous with the nerves of the cornea passing into the
                    layer of conjunctival epithelium on the front of the cornea. Klein recognised an
                    intra-epithelial nervous network in the same locality. Chrschtschonovitsch
                    traced non - medullated nerve fibres proceeding from a sub-epithelial network
                    into the deeper epithelial layers of the vaginal mucous membrane, and similar
                    nerve fibres have been seen by Elin to end in the epithelial investment of the
                    mucous membrane of the mouth.</p>
                <p>Connected with the sensory nerves in some localities are the remarkable bodies
                    named the Corpuscles of Pacini, which were the first terminal organs discovered
                    in connection with the peripheral distribution of the nerves. These corpuscles
                    have been found attached to the nerves which pass to the skin of the fingers and
                    toes, to the nerves which supply the skin of the neck and arm, to the
                    intercostal nerves, to the nerves of the joints, to the nerves of the
                    periosteum, to the nerves of the genital organs, and to the mesenteric nerves.
                    In cats they are often extremely abundant both in the mesentery and omenta. A
                    Pacinian corpuscle can be seen by the naked eye, and looks like a minute grain

                    sessile or attached to the nerve stem by a slender stalk. Examined
                    microscopically, it is seen to consist of numerous layers of connective tissue
                    concentrically arranged, which form its capsule, and surround a central core.
                    Numerous connective tissue cor puscles may be seen in the concentric layers, and
                    Hoyer has recently shown that an endothelial-like appearance exists on the inner
                    surface of the corpuscle. Entering one pole of the corpuscle is a nerve fibre
                    which extends along the axial core for a considerable distance, and usually
                    terminates<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n916/mode/1up"

                    parts with its perineurial sheath after it enters the Pacinian corpuscle; and as
                    it lies in the core it loses its medullary substance, so that its terminal part
                    consists only of the axial cylinder. Sometimes the nerve fibre divides into two
                    branches within the corpuscle. Capillary blood-vessels are distributed to the
                    concentric layers of the Pacinian corpuscle.</p>
                <p>The mode of origin of the nervous tissue in the course of development of the
                    embryo is still involved in some obscurity. It is, however, believed that the
                    nerve cells are derived from the embryo cells, which multiply, and tho young
                    cells then grow and assume characteristically granular and finely fibrillated
                    contents. Processes or poles then appear at the periphery of the cells, which,
                    according to the observations of Beale, connect adjacent cells together. As the
                    growth of the part goes on, the cells are more widely separated from each other,
                    and the anastomosing processes in consequence become considerably elongated, and
                    form the axial cylinder of the nerve fibre. In the course of time the medullary
                    sheath and the primitive membrane may form around this axial cylinder so as to
                    insulate it. The exact mode of formation of the medullary sheath is not properly
                    understood; but it is believed that the primitive membrane, and the perineurial
                    connective tissue, arc derived from those surrounding embryonic cells which
                    differentiate into connective tissue. Of the two originally contiguous cells
                    from which the nerve fibre is, as it were, spun out, one, as Hensen conceived,
                    may form a cell in a nerve centre, the other may differentiate into a peripheral
                    end-organ. In the tail of the tadpole the formation and growth of nerve fibres
                    have been studied by Kölliker and others, and it has been seen that the terminal
                    part of a fibre may have fusiform or tri-radiate cells connected with it, the
                    processes of which cells gradually differentiate into nerve fibres. The young
                    cerebro-spinal nerve fibres are distinctly nucleated, and correspond in
                    appearance and structural characters to the non-medullated nerve fibres of the
                    adult. If in a young or adult person a nerve be cut across, its conducting power
                    is destroyed; but after a time it reunites, and its function is restored. The
                    part of the nerve which lies between the place of section and its peripheral
                    extremity, undergoes, as Waller pointed out, degenerative changes. To how great
                    an extent the degeneration affects the various constituents of each fibre, it is
                    difficult to determine; for whilst some experiments would seem to show that only
                    the medullary sheath broke up into granular particles and was absorbed, in
                    others both it and the axial cylinder disappeared. In process of time, however,
                    these parts may be reproduced, and the nerve then recovers its functional
                    activity.</p>

                    System.</hi></p>
                <p>In this section the anatomy of the Brain and Spinal Cord, and of the numerous
                    distributory Nerves which arise from them, will be described. The brain and
                    spinal cord are the largest and most important of all the nerve centres. They
                    occupy the cranial cavity and spinal canal, and are continuous with each other
                    through the foramen magnum in the occipital bone. As the arrangement of the
                    structures which compose the brain and spinal cord is extremely complex, and as
                    the names applied to the several parts are numerous and often very arbitrary, it
                    may be well, before commencing a detailed description, to make a few general
                    observations on their mode of development.</p>

                    rend="italic">Spinal Nervous Axis.—</hi> The brain and spinal cord are developed
                    in the cranio-spinal groove of the embryo, and appear originally as a thin band
                    extending along the whole length of this groove. About the time when the walls
                    of the groove meet posteriorly to complete the cranio-spinal cavity, the margins
                    of this band become elevated, bend backwards, and meet, so that the originally
                    simple band becomes converted into a cylindri-form <hi rend="italic"
                    >cerebro-spinal tube.</hi> In the walls of this tube the nervous structures of
                    the brain and spinal cord are formed, whilst the axis of the tube forms a
                    central canaL In the part which becomes the Spinal Cord the central canal
                    persists as the <hi rend="italic">central canal</hi> of the spinal cord, and
                    around it a layer of ciliated cylindrical endothelium is developed. Outside this
                    layer a mass of grey matter containing nerve cells is formed, which is
                    subsequently divided into two lateral <hi rend="italic">crescent-shaped
                    masses.</hi> Outside the grey matter white matter is produced, which ultimately
                    becomes aιτanged in the form of <hi rend="italic">longitudinal columns</hi> of
                    nerve fibres. With the formation and growth of these columns and of the internal
                    grey matter, a longitudinal mesial fissure appears on the anterior and another
                    on the posterior surface of the cord, which gradually increase in depth until
                    the cord is almost completely divided into two lateral halves. At the bottom of
                    tho <hi rend="italic">anterior median fissure</hi> the nerve fibres of the <hi
                    rend="italic">anterior commissure</hi> are developed, and at the bottom of the
                    <hi rend="italic">posterior median fissure</hi> those of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior commissure.</hi> These commissures unite the two halves of the cord
                    together.</p>
                <p>The upper or cerebral end of the cerebro-spinal tube becomes the Encephalon, or
                    Brain. At first the cerebral part of the tube is uniform in appearance with the
                    spinal part, but it soon expands into three vesicular dilatations — the <hi
                    rend="italic">primary cerebral vesicles.</hi> These vesicles, named (from before
                    backwards) anterior, middle, and posterior, are separated from each other by
                    constrictions, and as the development progresses the vesicles bend on each other
                    and on the upper end of the spinal cord. As each vesicle is an expansion of the
                    cerebro-spinal tube, it is necessarily hollow, and the space in its interior is
                    continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord. In the walls of the
                    vesicles the nervous structures are produced, which form the several
                    subdivisions of the encephalon.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">posterior cerebral vesicle</hi> bends first forwards from
                    the upjier end of the spinal cord, and then backwards; the part which bends
                    forward becomes the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata;</hi> that which bends
                    backward the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum,</hi> whilst the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pons</hi> is developed at the angle where these two parts are continuous with
                    each other; the central hollow forms the <hi rend="italic">central canal</hi> of
                    the medulla oblongata and the dilated space called the <hi rend="italic">fourth
                    ventricle.</hi> In the medulla oblongata shallow anterior and posterior median
                    furrows then appear continuous with those in the cord, and each lateral half
                    differentiates into grey matter and into a longitudinal arrangement of nerve
                    fibres continuous with the corresponding structures in the cord. A large
                    proportion of these fibres are continued upwards through the pons as its
                    longitudinal fibres. The cerebellum consists at first of a central lobe, and in
                    the lower vertebrates its development does not proceed beyond this stage; but in
                    mammals, including man, a lateral lobe or hemisphere is superadded on each side,
                    and with the growth of these lateral lobes numerous transverse fibres, which
                    connect the two hemispheres together, are developed in the pons. The cerebellum
                    is also connected below with the medulla oblongata by the pair of restifoπn
                    bodies, or <hi rend="italic">inferior peduncles,</hi> and above with the corpora
                    quadrigemina by the pair of <hi rend="italic">superior peduncles.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">middle cerebral vesicle</hi> bends forwards from the
                    posterior vesicle. In its roof the <hi rend="italic">optic lobes</hi> are
                    formed; in its floor the <hi rend="italic">crura cerebri;</hi> whilst the
                    central hollow becomes the <hi rend="italic">aqueduct of Sylvius.</hi> At first
                    the optic lobes form a single structure, but about the sixth month of embryo
                    life a median furrow divides this structure into two lateral halves (the <hi
                    rend="italic">corpora bigemina),</hi> and in the lower vertebrates the
                    development does not proceed beyond this stage; but in the seventh month of
                    embryo life of the human foetus each lateral half is subdivided into two by a
                    transverse fissure, so that four bodies (the <hi rend="italic">corpora</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quadrigemina)</hi> are produced. The crura cerebri form the two
                    cerebral peduncles, which, diverging from each other, pass upwards to the
                    hemisphere of the cerebrum. They consist almost entirely of nerve fibres
                    continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the pons, a few of which go to the
                    corpora quadrigemina, but the greater number ascend to the cerebrum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">anterior cerebral vesicle</hi> bends downwards from the
                    middle vesicle. The posterior part of this vesicle forms at first a simple
                    hollow sac, but subsequently divides into the two <hi rend="italic"
                    >optic</hi><hi rend="italic">thalami,</hi> one on each side of the central
                    hollow, which hollow becomes the <hi rend="italic">third ventricle.</hi> This
                    ventricle is prolonged downwards into a funnel-shaped process, the <hi
                    rend="italic">infundibulum,</hi> which is connected with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pituitary body,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hypophysis cerebri,</hi> lodged in
                    the pituitary fossa in the sphenoid bone, whilst posteriorly it is continuous
                    with the aqueduct of Sylvius. In its upper and posterior wall the 2n'τιmZ <hi
                    rend="italic">body,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">epiphysis cerebri,</hi> is
                    developed, and from this body two white <hi rend="italic">peduncles</hi> run
                    forwards on the sides of the optic thalami. Immediately below these peduncles
                    the transverse fibres of the <hi rend="italic">posterior commissure</hi> are
                    developed, which pass between the two optic thalami. The anterior wall of this
                    ventricle is closed in by the <hi rend="italic">lamina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cinerea</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lamina</hi><hi rend="italic">terminalis,</hi>
                    and behind it are formed the transverse nerve fibres of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >anterior commissure,</hi> and the vertical fibres of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >anterior pillars</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">fornix.</hi> These fornix fibres
                    pass to the base of the brain, and form the <hi rend="italic">corpora</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">albicantia,</hi> prior to entering the optic thalami. The
                    posterior part of the anterior vesicle gives off from each side a flask-shaped

                <p>The antero-lateral part of the anterior cerebral vesicle is prolonged forward as
                    two hollow processes, the <hi rend="italic">hemisphere vesicles,</hi> which
                    become the <hi rend="italic">cerebral hemispheres,</hi> and are separated from
                    each other by a <hi rend="italic">median longitudinal fissure;</hi> whilst the
                    hollow in the interior of each forms the <hi rend="italic">lateral
                    ventricle.</hi> In the floor of each hemisphere vesicle is developed a large
                    grey mass, striated with bundles of nerve fibres, the corpus <hi rend="italic"
                    >striatum,</hi> which lies immediately in front and to the outer side of the
                    optic thalamus; a curved band, the <hi rend="italic">taenia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">semicircularis,</hi> is formed along the junction of the thalamus
                    with the corpus striatum, and at the inner and anterior end of this band,
                    immediately behind the anterior pillars of the fornix, the two lateral
                    ventricles become continuous with each other and with the third ventricle
                    through the <hi rend="italic">foramen of Monro.</hi> The roof and side walls of
                    each hemisphere vesicle form a grey expansion or <hi rend="italic">mantle,</hi>
                    which is at first smooth, but subsequently becomes divided into <hi

                    each other by fissures. A deep gap or fissure now appears on the inner wall of
                    each hemisphere vesicle, and is bounded above by a longitudinal band of fibres,
                    which, continuous anteriorly with the anterior pillar of the fornix, joins its
                    fellow in the middle line to form the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">fornix,</hi> and then again diverging from its fellow passes
                    backwards, downwards, and forwards as the <hi rend="italic">posterior
                    pillar</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">fornix</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >taenia</hi><hi rend="italic">hippocampi.</hi> A transverse arrangement of
                    fibres then forms in each hemisphere vesicle, above the plane of the fornix,
                    which, reaching the mesial plane, joins its fellow, connects the two hemispheres
                    together, and forms the <hi rend="italic">corpus callosum.</hi> In the hinder
                    part this <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi> rests upon the upper surface of the
                    fornix, but more anteriorly it lies some distance above the fornix, and then
                    bends down in front of it. Hence there is enclosed between the fornix and the
                    antero-inferior part of the corpus callosum two thin layers of grey matter, one
                    belonging to the inner surface of each hemisphere vesicle, and called the <hi
                    rend="italic">septum</hi><hi rend="italic">lucidum.</hi> Between these two
                    layers is a narrow space, the <hi rend="italic">fifth ventricle,</hi> which,
                    unlike the other ventricles, is not derived from the cerebro-spiual tube, but is
                    merely a portion of the longitudinal median fissure shut in by the development
                    of the corpus callosum and fornix. Each hemisphere vesicle also gives off from
                    its anterior part a hollow process, which expands in front into a bulbous
                    dilatation, named the <hi rend="italic">olfactory bulb,</hi> from which the
                    nerves of smell arise, whilst the stalk of the bulb solidifies and forms the <hi
                    rend="italic">olfactory peduncle. '-&gt;-m</hi></p>
                <p>Owing to the great development of the mantle of the hemisphere vesicles in the
                    human brain, and the size and complexity of the convolutions, these parts of the
                    hemispheres grow forward so as to overlap the olfactory bulbs and peduncles, and
                    backward, so as to conceal not only the corpora striata and optic thalami, but
                    also the corpora quadrigemina, crura cerebri, cerebellum, pons, and medulla
                    oblongata, so that when the human brain is looked at from above, none of these
                    structures can be seen. It is only when the brain is turned over and its base
                    exposed that the medulla, pons, cerebellum, and crura are visible; and before
                    the corpora quadrigemina, optic thalami, and corpora striata can be exposed,
                    portions of the hemisphere substance must be removed. The great growth of the
                    hemisphere vesicle leads also to a great expansion of the central hollow or <hi
                    rend="italic">lateral ventricle,</hi> which is prolonged forwards, backwards,
                    and downwards as the <hi rend="italic">anterior, posterior,</hi> and <hi

                    walls of the cranial cavity and spinal canal. The membranes are named dura
                    mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dura mater.—</hi> The most external membrane, named <hi
                    rend="italic">dura</hi> from its firmness, consists of a cranial and a spinal
                    subdivision. The cranial part is in contact with the inner table of the cranial
                    bones, and is adherent along the lines of the sutures and to the margins of the
                    foramina, which transmit the nerves, more especially to the foramen magnum. It
                    forms, therefore, for these bones an internal periosteum, and the meningeal
                    arteries which ramify in it are the nutrient arteries of the inner table. As the
                    growth of bone is more active in infancy and youth than in the adult, the
                    adhesion between the dura mater and the cranial bones is greater in early life
                    than at maturity. From the inner surface of the dura mater strong bands pass
                    into the cranial cavity, and form partitions between certain of the subdivisions
                    of the brain. A vertical longitudinal mesial band, named, from its sickle shape,
                    <hi rend="italic">falx cerebri,</hi> dips between the two hemispheres of the
                    cerebrum. A smaller sickleshaped vertical mesial band, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >falx</hi><hi rend="italic">cerebelli,</hi> attached to the internal occipital
                    crest, passes between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum. A large band arches
                    forward in the horizontal plane of the cavity, from the transverse groove in the
                    occipital bone to the clinoid processes of the sphenoid, and is attached
                    laterally to the upper border of the petrous part of each temporal bone. It
                    separates the cerebrum from the cerebellum, and, as it forms a tentlike covering
                    for the latter, is named <hi rend="italic">tentorium,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cerebelli.</hi> Along certain lines the cranial dura mater splits into two
                    layers, to form tubular passages for the transmission of venous blood. These
                    passages are named the <hi rend="italic">venous blood sinuses</hi> of the dura
                    mater, and they are lodged in the grooves on the inner surface of the skull
                    referred to in the description of the cranial bones. Opening into these sinuses
                    are numerous veins, which convey from the brain the blood that has been
                    circulating through it; and two of these sinuses, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cavernous,</hi> which lie at the sides of the body of the sphenoid bone,
                    receive the ophthalmic veins from the eyeballs situated in the orbital cavities.
                    These blood sinuses pass usually from before backwards: a <hi rend="italic"
                    >superior longitudinal</hi> along the upper border of the falx cerebri as far as
                    the internal occipital protuberance; an <hi rend="italic">inferior

                    the <hi rend="italic">straight sinus,</hi> which passes back as far as the same
                    protuberance. One or two small <hi rend="italic">occipital sinuses,</hi> which
                    lie in the falx cerebelli, also pass to join tho straight and longitudinal
                    sinuses opposite this protuberance; several currents of blood meet, therefore,
                    at this spot, and as Herophilus supposed that a sort of whirlpool was formed in
                    the blood, the name <hi rend="italic">torcular</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    which curve forwards and downwards to the jugular foramina to terminate in the
                    internal jugular veins. In its course each lateral sinus receives two <hi
                    rend="italic">petrosal</hi> sinuses, which pass from the cavernous sinus
                    backwards along the upper and lower borders of the petrous part of the temporal
                    bone.</p>
                <p>The spinal part of the dura mater hangs loosely in the spinal canal. It does not
                    form a periosteum for the vertebrae, but is separated from their bony rings by
                    loose fat and a plexus of veins. It gives off no bands from its inner surface,
                    and it does not split into two layers for the lodgment of venous blood sinuses.
                    The spinal dura mater forms a tubular envelope for the spinal cord and the
                    origins of the spinal nerves. It extends from the foramen magnum, where it is
                    continuous with the cranial dura mater, to the lower end of the sacral canal,
                    ends below in a funnel-shaped prolongation, and is pierced laterally by the
                    roots of the several spinal nerves in their passage outwards to the
                    intervertebral foramina.</p>
                <p>Both the cranial and the spinal parts of the dura mater consist of a tough,
                    fibrous membrane; somewhat flocculent externally, but smooth, glistening, and
                    free on its inner surface. The inner surface has the appearance of a serous
                    membrane, and when examined microscopically is seen to consist of a layer of
                    squamous endothelial cells, similar to those drawn in fig. 34. Hence the dura
                    mater, is sometimes called a fibro-serous membrane. The dura mater is well
                    provided with lymph vessels, which in all probability open by stomata on the
                    free inner surface. Between the dura mater and the subjacent arachnoid membrane
                    is a fine space containing a minute quantity of limpid serum, which moistens the
                    smooth inner surface of the dura and the corresponding smooth outer surface of
                    the arachnoid. It is regarded as equivalent to the cavity of a serous membrane,
                    and is named the <hi rend="italic">arachnoid cavity,</hi> or, more
                    appropriately, the <hi rend="italic">sub-dural space.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Arachnoid mater.—</hi> The arachnoid is a membrane of great delicacy and
                    transparency, which loosely envelopes both the brain and spinal cord. It is
                    separated from these organs by the pia mater; but between it and the latter
                    membrane is a distinct space, called <hi rend="italic">sub-arachnoid.</hi> The
                    sub-arachnoid space is more distinctly marked beneath the spinal than beneath
                    the cerebral parts of the membrane, which forms a looser investment for the cord
                    than for the brain. At the base of the brain, and opposite the fissures between
                    the convolutions of the cerebrum, the interval between the arachnoid and the pia
                    matter can, however, always be seen, for the arachnoid does not, like the pia
                    mater, clothe the sides of the fissures, but passes directly across between the
                    summits of adjacent convolutions. The sub-arachnoid space is subdivided into
                    numerous freely-communicating loculi by bundles of delicate areolar tissue,
                    which bundles are invested, as Key and Retzius have shown, by a layer of
                    squamous endothelium. The space contains a limpid cerebro-spinal fluid, which
                    varies in quantity from 2 drachms to 2 ounces. The fluid is alkaline, of sp. gr.
                    l ’ 005, contains a little albumen, and a substance which, as Turner pointed
                    out, reduces blue oxide of copper to the state of yellow sub-oxide. The
                    arachnoid membrane is made up of delicate connective tissue. The free surface
                    next the sub-dural space is smooth, like a serous membrane, and covered by a
                    layer of squamous endothelium. This layer is reflected on to the roots of the
                    spinal and cranial nerves, and, when they pierce the dura mater, it becomes
                    continuous with the endothelial lining of that membrane. As the arrangement and
                    structure so closely correspond with what is seen in the serous membranes, many
                    anatomists regard the arachnoid as the visceral layer of a serous membrane, and
                    the endothelial lining of the dura mater as the parietal layer, whilst the
                    sub-dural space is the intermediate cavity.</p>
                <p>When the skull cap is removed, clusters of granular bodies are usually to be seen
                    imbedded in the dura mater on each side of the superior longitudinal sinus;
                    these are named the <hi rend="italic">Pacchionian bodies.</hi> When traced
                    through the dura mater they are found to spring from the visceral or proper
                    cerebral arachnoid. The observations of Luschka and Cleland have proved that
                    villous processes invariably grow from the free surface of that membrane, and
                    that when these villi greatly increase in size they form the bodies in question.
                    Sometimes the Pacchionian bodies greatly hypertrophy, occasion absorption of the
                    bones of the cranial vault, and depressions on the upper surface of the
                    brain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pia mater.—</hi> This membrane closely invests the whole outer
                    surface of the brain. It dips into the fissures between the convolutions, and a
                    wide prolongation, named <hi rend="italic">velum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >interpositum,</hi> lies in the interior of the cerebrum. With a little care it
                    can be stripped off the brain without causing injury to its substance. The pia
                    mater invests the spinal cord, and is more intimately attached to it than to the
                    brain, for not only does it send prolongations into the anterior and posterior
                    fissures of the cord, but slender bands pass repeatedly from its inner surface
                    into the columns of the cord. Hence it cannot be stripped off the cord without
                    causing injury to its substance. The pia matter is prolonged on to the roots
                    both of the cranial and spinal nerves, and on to the filum terminale. This
                    membrane consists of a delicate connective tissue, in which the arteries of the
                    brain and spinal cord ramify and subdivide into small branches before they
                    penetrate the nervous substance, and in which the veins conveying the blood from
                    the nerve centres lie before they open into the blood sinuses of the cranial
                    dura mater and the extradural venous plexus of the spinal canal. The arteries
                    which pass from the pia mater into the brain and spinal cord are invested by a
                    loose sheath, which has been described as forming , the wall of a peri-vascular
                    lymphatic vessel; but Key and Retzius have shown that the space between the
                    blood-vessel and the sheath opens into the subarachnoid space, and contains
                    cerebro-spinal fluid. A network of lymph vessels ramifies freely in the pia
                    mater. It is also well provided with nerves, which arise from the posterior
                    roots of the spinal nerves, from some of the cranial nerves, and from the
                    carotid and vertebral plexuses of the sympathetic. The epi-cerebral and
                    epi-spinal spaces described by His as existing?between this membrane and the
                    brain and spinal cord are in all probability artificial productions.</p>
                <p>In the spinal canal a slender fibrous band projects from the pia mater covering
                    the side of the cord, and, pushing the arachnoid membrane in front of it, is
                    attached by about twenty-two pairs of denticulated processes to the inner
                    surface of the dura mater. It is named <hi rend="italic">ligamentum
                    denticulatum,</hi> and its teeth alternate with the successive pairs of spinal
                    nerves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Spinal Cord.</hi> —The <hi rend="smallcaps">Medulla
                    Spinalis,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Spinal Cord,</hi> occupies the spinal
                    canal, and extends from the foramen magnum to opposite the body of the first
                    lumbar vertebra. In the early foetus it equals in length the canal itself; but
                    as the spinal column grows at a greater proportional rate than the cord, the
                    latter, when growth has ceased, is several inches shorter than the column. The
                    cord is continuous above with the medulla oblongata, whilst it tapers off below
                    into a slender thread, the <hi rend="italic">filum terminale,</hi> which lies in
                    the axis of the sacral canal, and is attached below to the back of the coccyx,
                    or to the fibrous membrane which closes in below the sacral canal. The length of
                    the cord is from 15 to 18 inches. It approaches a cylinder in shape, but is
                    flattened on its anterior and posterior surfaces, and presents two enlargements
                    which have a greater girth than the rest of the cord. The upper, <pb break="no"

                    cervical to the first dorsal vertebra, and from it arise the nerves which supply
                    the upper limbs; the lower, called the <hi rend="italic">crural</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">lumbar enlargement,</hi> is opposite the last dorsal vertebra, and
                    supplies with nerves the lower limbs. The cord is almost completely divided into
                    right and left lateral halves by two fissures, named respectively <hi
                    rend="italic">anterior</hi> and <hi rend="italic">posterior median
                    fissures,</hi> which do not quite reach the centre of the cord, for at the
                    bottom of the anterior fissure are the transverse fibres of the <hi
                    rend="italic">anterior white commissure,</hi> and at the bottom of the posterior
                    fissure the fibres of the <hi rend="italic">posterior grey commissure.</hi> By
                    these commissures the two halves of the cord are united together. The fibres of
                    the posterior commissure surround a canal, called the <hi rend="italic">central
                    canal,</hi> which extends along the whole length of the cord, and even passes
                    into the upper end of the filum terminale. This canal is lined by a ciliated
                    columnar endothelium, and expands superiorly into the cavity of the fourth
                    ventricle. Each lateral half of the cord is subdivided into three columns by two
                    depressions, which mark the points of emergence of the roots of the spinal
                    nerves. The anterior nerve roots pass through the <hi rend="italic"
                    >antero-lateral depression</hi> or fissure, and between it and the antero-median
                    fissure is the <hi rend="italic">anterior column</hi> of the cord. The posterior
                    nerve roots pass through the <hi rend="italic">postero-lateral fissure,</hi> and
                    between it and the postero-median fissure is the <hi rend="italic">posterior
                    column,</hi> whilst between the anterior and posterior nerve roots lies the <hi

                    posterior column which lies next tue postero-median fissure is marked off by a
                    fissure into a small internal or <hi rend="italic">postero-median</hi> column.
                    The subdivision of each lateral half of the cord into the columns, and the
                    arrangement of its nervous tissues, are well seen in transverse sections through
                    its substance. The cord is composed of white and grey matter. The white matter
                    is external, and forms the columns of the cord.</p>
                <p>The grey matter is surrounded by the white, and has in each lateral half of the
                    cord a crescentic shape. The horns of the crescent are directed towards the
                    fissures of emergence of the nerve roots; the anterior horn is rounded; the
                    posterior long and narrow. The proportion of grey matter to the white varies in
                    different parts of the cord. At the commencement of the filum terminale there is
                    scarcely any white matter; but the white matter increases in amount from below
                    upwards, so that its absolute quantity is greatest in the cervical part of the
                    cord. The grey crescents are thicker in the upper and lower enlargements than in
                    the intermediate part.</p>
                <p>The cord contains both nerve fibres and nerve cells. The external, columnar,
                    white part of the cord consists of nerve fibres, with a supporting reticular
                    framework of connective tissue and blood-vessels derived from the pia mater.
                    Well-formed stellate connective tissue corpuscles lie in this supporting
                    framework. The nerve fibres of the various columns extend longitudinally, and
                    lie parallel to each other, so that in transverse sections through the columns
                    the fibres are transversely divided. The individual fibres vary much in
                    diameter, but in all the axial cylinder and medullary sheath can be distinctly
                    seen. Wherever the nerve roots enter into the cord, the fibres of these roots
                    pass transversely or obliquely in their course inwards to the grey matter.
                    Horizontal fibres are also found in the white anterior commissure, and a similar
                    appearance can be seen in the posterior commissure. Horizontal fibres have also
                    been traced from the lateral columns into the adjacent part of the grey matter.
                    .</p>
                <p>The grey crescentic portion of the cord contains connective tissue,
                    blood-vessels, nerve fibres, and nerve cells. The nerve fibres in the grey
                    matter are numerous; and whilst some possess a medullary sheath, others consist
                    only of the axial cylinder; they divide and subdivide, and, as Gerlach has
                    shown, form a narrow - meshed network of extremely minute fibres. The nerve
                    cells are multipolar, and are chiefly collected in the anterior and posterior
                    horns of each crescent. The cells of the anterior cornu are large, distinct, and
                    stellate, and form a well-defined group of nerve cells. Those of the posterior
                    cornu are smaller in size, more elongated in shape, but with stellate branched
                    processes. They are not so distinct as in the anterior horn, owing to the
                    connective tissue with its corpuscles being so abundant. This tissue is best
                    marked at the tip of the posterior horn, where it forms the <hi rend="italic"
                    >substantia</hi><hi rend="italic">gelatinosa</hi> of Rolando. Lockhart Clarke
                    has described an <hi rend="italic">intermedio-lateral</hi> group of nerve cells
                    situated at the outer side of the grey matter, about midway between the anterior
                    and posterior horns, in the upper part of the cervical portion of the cord, and
                    in the thoracic part between the brachial and crural enlargements.</p>
                <p>The course of the fibres in the cord and their relations to the nerve cells
                    should now be considered. There can be no doubt that of the longitudinal fibres
                    some ascend from below upwards, and conduct either excito-motory impulses to the
                    regions of the spinal cord itself, or sensory impulses to the brain. Other
                    longitudinal fibres again descend from the brain and higher regions of the cord
                    to the lower, and conduct motor and vaso-motor impulses from above downwards.
                    The horizontal and oblique fibres of an anterior or motor nerve root enter the
                    grey matter of the anterior cornu, and seem to have the following arrangement:
                    some become directly continuous with the axial cylindrical processes of the
                    nerve cells; others pass into the anterior commissure; others extend as far as
                    the grey matter of the posterior horn. The nerve cells of the anterior cornu
                    give origin, therefore, directly to nerve fibres by their unbranched processes.
                    Gerlach’s observations show that the branched processes of these cells become
                    continuous with the network of extremely minute fibres already described in the
                    grey matter; from this network medullated fibres appear to arise which leave the
                    grey matter; some enter the lateral column, and ascend as the fibres of this
                    structure; others pass as fibres of the anterior commissure to the opposite side
                    of the cord, and ascend as the anterior column of that side. The anterior and
                    lateral columns, therefore, are constantly receiving accessions of fibres from
                    the enclosed grey matter.</p>
                <p>The fibres of a posterior or sensory nerve root on entering the cord subdivide
                    into two bundles; one does not enter the grey matter, but applies itself to the
                    posterior column, of which it forms some of the vertical fibres. These fibres
                    may ascend to the brain, or they may at some higher point in the cord enter the
                    grey matter of the posterior horn. The other bundle of posterior root fibres at
                    once enters the posterior horn of grey matter. The connections and ultimate
                    arrangement of these fibres in the grey matter have not been satisfactorily made
                    out Gerlach states that, as they frequently subdivide on entering the grey
                    matter if <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n920/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0920-0867"/> is possible they may form the fine nerve fibre
                    plexus of the grey substance; but a direct continuity between them and the
                    axial-cylinder processes of the cells of the posterior horn does not seem to
                    have been observed. From the plexus, formed by the much subdivided processes of
                    these cells, fibres arise, which, forming the fibres of the posterior
                    commissure, pass both in front of and behind <hi rend="subscript"> jι</hi> the
                    central canal to the opposite side, where they ascend towards the brain, “partly
                    in the vertical fasciculi of the posterior cornua and partly in the posterior
                    columns.”</p>
                <p>The structure of the spinal cord shows it to be both a nerve centre and a
                    conductor of nervous impulses. The nerve cells in its grey matter give rise
                    either directly, or through the delicate plexus formed by their branching
                    processes, to nerve fibres, which may either pass out of the cord as the
                    anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves, or may ascend to the brain as
                    the columns of the cord. Hence the cord is anatomically continuous, on the one
                    hand, through the nerves which arise from it, with the peripheral end-organs in
                    the skin, and muscular system in which those nerves terminate; and, on the other
                    hand, it is continuous with the brain. It serves, therefore, to conduct the
                    impulses of touch-sensation from the skin upwards to the brain, and the motor
                    impulses from the brain downwards to the muscles. But further, the cord is the
                    great nerve centre concerned in reflex excito-motory actions. It must, also, be
                    remembered that the two halves of the cord are anatomically continuous with each
                    other through the nerve fibres of the commissures, so that it acts as a single
                    organ, and not as two organs. Experiments have shown that sensory impulses are
                    conducted upwards through the cord, not by that half from which the nerves arise
                    that have been excited, but by the opposite half of the cord, which is obviously
                    due to the crossing of the fibres of the posterior commissure. Motor impressions
                    are, however, conducted downwards by that half of the cord from which the nerves
                    arise that pass to supply the muscles to be moved.</p>
                <p>The spinal cord is well supplied with blood by numerous arteries, which terminate
                    in a diffused capillary network. The capillaries are much more numerous in the
                    grey matter of the cord than in the white columns.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Origin, Arrangement, and Distribution of the Spinal
                    Nerves.</hi> —The spinal cord gives origin to thirty-one pairs of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Spinal</hi> nerves, which pass out of the spinal canal through
                    the intervertebral foramina. These nerves are arranged in groups, according to
                    the region of the spine through the foramina in which they proceed. There are
                    eight pairs of cervical nerves; the first or <hi rend="italic"
                    >sub-occipital</hi> emerges between the occipital bone and the atlas, the eighth
                    between the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae. Twelve dorsal or
                    thoracic nerves pass out on each side in relation to the dorsal vertebrae: five
                    pairs of lumbar nerves in the region of the loins; five pairs of sacral nerves
                    through the sacral foramina; and one pair of coccygeal nerves through the lowest
                    openings in the spinal canaL Each spinal nerve arises by two <hi rend="italic"
                    >roots,</hi> an <hi rend="italic">anterior</hi> and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior,</hi> from the side of the cord. These roots are distinguished from
                    each other both anatomically and physiologically. The posterior root has a
                    swelling or <hi rend="italic">ganglion</hi> on it, whilst no ganglion exists on
                    the anterior root. The posterior root consists of sensory nerve fibres, t.e., of
                    fibres which conduct impulses from the periphery into the nerve centre; whilst
                    the anterior root is composed of motor nerve fibres, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,e.,</hi> of fibres which conduct impulses from the centre to the periphery.
                    The ganglion is situated on the posterior root, as a rule, in the intervertebral
                    foramen; but the lower sacral nerves have the ganglia. on their posterior roots
                    in the spinal canaL These ganglia contain bipolar nerve cells, and the nerve
                    fibres, as they pass through each ganglion, are apparently connected with the
                    poles of the cells. The roots of the spinal nerves vary in direction and length.
                    Those of the cervical nerves are short, and run almost horizontally outwards to
                    their respective intervertebral foramina; those of the dorsal are longer and
                    more oblique; whilst the roots of the lumbar and sacral nerves, owing to the
                    cord ending much above the foramina through which the nerves proceed, are very
                    long, and form a leash of nerves in the lower part of the spinal canal, which
                    surrounds the filum terminale, and, from its general resemblance in arrangement
                    to the hairs of a horse's tail, has been named <hi rend="italic">cauda</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">equina.</hi></p>
                <p>The anterior nerve root joins the posterior immediately outside the ganglion, and
                    by their junction a spinal nerve is formed. This nerve contains a mixture of
                    both motor and sensory fibres, and is compound therefore in function. Almost
                    immediately after its formation the nerve separates into two divisions, an
                    anterior and a posterior, and each division, like the nerve itself, contains
                    both motor and sensory fibres.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Posterior Primary</hi><hi rend="italic">Divisions</hi> of
                    the spinal nerves, smaller than the anterior, are distributed both to the
                    muscles and skin on the back of the axial part of the body. Their general
                    arrangement is as follows: each division, with some three or four exceptions,
                    subdivides into an internal and an external branch. In the back of the neck and
                    the back of the upper part of the chest, the external branches of these nerves
                    supply the deep muscles; the internal branches pierce the muscles close to the
                    spines of the vertebrae, and end in the skin; the internal branch of the second
                    nerve, called <hi rend="italic">great occipital,</hi> and that of the third
                    cervical, pass to the skin over the occipital bone. In the back of the lower
                    part of the chest and of the loins, the internal branches supply the deep
                    muscles, the external branches pass to the skin, those of some of the lumbar
                    nerves extending as far as the skin of the buttock.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Anterior</hi><hi rend="italic">Primary Divisions</hi> are
                    not so uniform either in arrangement or distribution as are the posterior. They
                    supply the front and sides of the axial part of the neck and trunk, and the
                    extremities. The anterior divisions of the twelve <hi rend="italic">thoracic
                    nerves</hi> have the most simple arrangement. Each nerve, called from its
                    position an <hi rend="italic">intercostal</hi> nerve, runs outwards, immediately
                    below the lower border of a rib, and gives origin to three series of branches,
                    named communicating, muscular, and cutaneous. By the <hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ommunicating</hi> branch each intercostal nerve is connected with
                    an adjacent ganglion on the thoracic portion of the sympathetic system. By the
                    <hi rend="italic">Muscular</hi> or motor branches these nerves supply the
                    intercostal muscles, the levatores costarum, and the triangularis sterni, whilst
                    the lower intercostal nerves run forwards and downwards into the wall of the
                    abdomen, and supply the two oblique, the transverse, rectus, and pyramidalis
                    muscles. The skin of the sides of the thorax and abdomen receives its nervous
                    supply from the <hi rend="italic">Lateral Cutaneous</hi> branches, whilst the
                    skin on the front of the trunk is supplied by the <hi rend="italic">Anterior
                    Cutaneous</hi> terminations of these nerves. The lateral cutaneous branches of
                    the second and third intercostal nerves are comparatively large in size, and
                    assist in the supply of the skin of the inner side of <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">intercosto-humeral</hi> nerves.</p>
                <p>In the regions of the neck, loins, and pelvis, the anterior divisions of the
                    spinal nerves do not pass simply outwards to their distribution. In each region
                    adjacent nerves interlace with each other, and form what is technically called a
                    <hi rend="italic">nervous plexus.</hi> When a branch arises from a thoracic
                    nerve, it contains fibres derived from that nerve only; but when a branch arises
                    from a plexus, it may contain, fibres, not of one only, but of two or more of
                    the nerves which, by their interlacement, form the plexus. Hence the parts which
                    are supplied by these branches are brought into connection with a greater number
                    of nerves, and consequently with a greater extent of the spinal cord or nerve
                    centre, than are the parts which receive branches from a single nerve only.
                    These plexuses are especially found in connection with the nerves which supply
                    the extremities, where, owing to the complexity of the muscular movements, the
                    co-ordination of these movements through the nervous system is rendered
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>The anterior divisions of the eight cervical nerves are arranged in two plexuses,
                    named cervical and brachial.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cervical plexus</hi> (Pl. XVII.) is formed of the four
                    upper cervical nerves, which make, by interlacement with each other, a series of
                    loops in front of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae. Arising
                    either directly from these nerves, or from the plexus which they form, are
                    communicating, muscular, and cutaneous branches. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Communicating</hi> branches connect these nerves with the large superior
                    cervical ganglion of the sympathetic system, also with the vagus, accessory, and
                    hypoglossal cranial nerves, and with the descending branch of the hypoglossal.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Muscular</hi> branches supply the anterior recti muscles
                    of the neck, the levator scapulae, the posterior scalenus, the diaphragm, and in
                    part the sterno-mastoid and trapezius. The branch to the diaphragm, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">phrenic</hi> nerve, is the most important (Pl. XVII. <hi
                    rend="italic">φ)</hi>; it springs from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical,
                    and passes down the lower part of the neck, and through the thorax, to supply
                    its own half of the diaphragm. The <hi rend="italic">Cutaneous</hi> branches are
                    as follows:—the <hi rend="italic">occipitalis minor,</hi> to the skin of the
                    occiput; the <hi rend="italic">auriculo-parotidean,</hi> to the skin over the
                    parotid gland and the adjacent part of the auricle; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >transversalis</hi><hi rend="italic">colli,</hi> to the skin of the front of the
                    side of the neck; the <hi rend="italic">supra-clavicular</hi> nerves, to the
                    skin of the lower part of the side of the neck, and upper part of the chest.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Brachial plexus</hi> (PL XVII. 1, 2, 3, 4) is formed of the
                    four lower cervical nerves, and of the larger portion of the first intercostal,
                    called also first dorsal nerve. It is of large size, and is principally for the
                    supply of the upper limb. Its exact mode of arrangement presents many
                    variations, but the following is not unfrequently found :—The fifth and sixth
                    nerves join to form a large nerve, which, after a short course, is joined by the
                    seventh; in this manner the <hi rend="italic">upper cord</hi> of the plexus is
                    formed. The eighth cervical and the first dorsal then join, to form the <hi
                    rend="italic">lower cord</hi> of the plexus. These cords then pass behind the
                    clavicle and subclavius muscle into the axilla, where they become modified in
                    arrangement. From each a large branch arises, and these two branches then join
                    to form a third cord. These three cords have special relations to the axillary
                    artery: the one which lies to its outer side is named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >outer cord;</hi> that to the inner, the <hi rend="italic">inner cord;</hi> that
                    behind, the <hi rend="italic">posterior cord.</hi> These nerves and the cords
                    formed by them give origin to communicating, muscular, cutaneous, and mixed
                    branches. The <hi rend="italic">Communicating</hi> branches join the middle and
                    inferior cervical and first thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic system. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Muscular</hi> branches supply the scaleni, longus colli, rhomboid,
                    and subclavius muscles; the supra and infra-spinatus muscles, through a branch
                    called <hi rend="italic">suprascapular;</hi> the serratus magnus, through the

                    supplies the skin of the inner side of the forearm, both on its anterior and
                    posterior surfaces. The <hi rend="italic">Mixed</hi> branches are large and very

                    through the forearm to the hand, and supplies the skin on the back of the thumb,
                    index and middle digits, and radial side of the ring digit. The <hi
                    rend="italic">posterior interosseous</hi> supplies the muscles on the back of

                    inner condyle and olecranon, where it supplies the elbow joint. Here it may
                    easily be compressed, when, a pricking sensation is experienced in the course of
                    its distribution. In this spot it is popularly called the “funny bone.” In the
                    forearm the ulnar nerve supplies the flexor carpi ulnaris and inner part of the
                    flexor profundus digitorum muscles. In the hand it supplies the muscles of the

                    and the adductor and deep part of the short flexor of the thumb. It also
                    supplies a <hi rend="italic">dorsal</hi> cutaneous branch to the back of the

                    the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. It gives origin to
                    communicating, muscular, cutaneous, and mixed branches. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Communicating</hi> branches join the four upper lumbar ganglia of the

                    XVIII.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Medulla Oblongata</hi> rests upon the basi-occipital. It
                    is somewhat pyramidal in form, about 1∣ inch long, and 1 inch broad in its
                    widest’part. It is a bilateral organ, and is divided into a right and a left
                    half by shallow anterior and posterior median fissures, continuous with the
                    corresponding fissures in the spinal cord; the posterior fissure ends above in
                    the 4th ventricle. Each half is subdivided into elongated tracts of nervous

                    >anterior pyramid</hi> (Pl. XVIII. figs. 1 and 2, P). This pyramid is continuous
                    below with the cord, and the place of continuity is marked by the passage across
                    the fissure of three or four bundles of nerve fibres, from each half of the cord

                    its fellow in the opposite half of the medulla oblongata. By this divergence the
                    central part of the medulla is opened up, and the lower half of the cavity of
                    the 4th ventricle is formed. Internal to the restiform body is the <hi

                    diverge outwards from the sides of the postero-median fissure. At the upper part
                    of the floor of the 4th ventricle a longitudinal tract of nerve fibres, the <hi

                <p>The medulla oblongata, like the spinal cord, with which it is continuous,
                    consists both of grey and white matter. But the exterior of the medulla is not
                    so exclusively formed of white matter as is the outer part of the cord, for the
                    divergence from each other of the restiform bodies and posterior pyramids of
                    opposite sides opens out the central part of the medulla, and allows the grey
                    matter to become superficial on the floor of the 4th ventricle. The nerve fibres
                    which enter into the formation of the pyramids and the other tracts just
                    described, are partly continuous below with the columns of the spinal cord, and
                    are prolonged upwards either to the pons and cerebrum, or to the cerebellum, or
                    they partly take their rise in the medulla oblongata itself from the cells of
                    its grey matter. As the medulla is a bilateral organ, its two halves are united
                    together by commissural fibres, which cross obliquely its mesial plane from one
                    side to the other, and as they decussate in that plane, they form a well-marked
                    mesial band or <hi rend="italic">raphé.</hi> Further, the medulla is a centre of
                    origin for several pairs of the more posterior encephalic nerves, and for the
                    vaso-motor nerves. In the passage upwards through the medulla of the columns of
                    the cord, a re-arrangement of their fibres takes place; just as in a great
                    central railway station, the rails, which enter it in one direction, intersect
                    and are rearranged before they emerge from it in the opposite direction. The
                    fibres of the posterior median column of the cord are prolonged upwards as the
                    posterior pyramid. The fibres of the posterior column of the cord are for the
                    most part prolonged upwards into the restiform body, though some fibres pass to
                    the front of the medulla to participate in the decussation of the anterior
                    pyramids. The lateral column of the cord divides into three parts: <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> the greater number of its fibres pass inwards across the
                    anterior median fissure, to assist in forming the anterior pyramid of the
                    opposite side, so as to produce the decussation already referred to; <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> others join the restiform body; <hi rend="italic">c,</hi>
                    ethers form the fasciculus teres situated on the floor of the 4th ventricle. The
                    anterior column of the cord also divides into three parts: <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> some fibres form the arcifoπn fibres and join the restiform body; <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> others assist in the formation of the olivary fasciculus;
                    c, others are prolonged upwards in the anterior pyramid of the same side (Fig.
                    67).</p>
                <p>The anterior pyramid consists partly of fibres of the anterior column of the cord
                    of the same side, partly of decussating fibres of the anterior commissure,
                    partly of decussating fibres from the posterior columns and posterior cornu of
                    grey matter, but principally of the decussating fibres of the lateral column of
                    the opposite side of the cord. The fibres of the anterior pyramid are prolonged
                    through the pons to the cerebrum. Owing to the decussation of the lateral
                    columns of the cord in the formation of the pyramids, the motor nerve fibres
                    from one-half of the brain are transmitted to the opposite side of the cord, so
                    that injuries affecting one side of the brain occasion paralysis of the motor
                    nerves arising from the opposite half of the cord. The olivary fasciculus is
                    formed partly of fibres of the anterior column of the same side, and partly of
                    fibres arising from the grey matter of the olive. It is continued upwards
                    through the pons to the cerebrum. The restiform body is formed principally of
                    fibres of the posterior column of the same side, but partly of fibres of the
                    lateral column, and also of the arciform fibres from the anterior column, and
                    from the grey matter of the superior and inferior olives. As the restiform body
                    is continued upwards to the cerebellum, and forms its inferior peduncles, the
                    arciform fibres have been called by Solly the <hi rend="italic">superficial
                    cerebellar fibres</hi> of the medulla. Through the restiform body the cerebellum
                    is connected with the posterior, lateral, and anterior columns of the cord as
                    well as with the olivary nuclei in the grey matter of the medulla oblongata. The
                    posterior pyramid consists of the posterior median column of the cord, and is
                    prolonged through the pons to the cerebrum. The fasciculus teres is formed of a
                    small part of the lateral column of the cord, and is also prolonged through the
                    pons to the cerebrum.</p>

                <p>The grey matter of the medulla oblongata, which contains numerous multipolar
                    nerve cells, is in part continuous with the grey matter of the Spinal cord, and
                    in part consists of independent masses. As the grey matter of the cord enters
                    the med∏11⅞ it loses its crescentic arrangement. The posterior cornua are thrown
                    outwards towards the surface, lose their pointed form, and dilate into rounded
                    masses named the grey tubercles of Rolando, whilst portions are prolonged into
                    both the posterior pyramid and the restiform body. The grey matter of the
                    anterior cornua and of the intermedio-lateral tracts loses its continuity, and
                    becomes subdivided into numerous small masses, owing to being traversed by
                    bundles of nerve fibres, which give rise to a network termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >formatio</hi><hi rend="italic">reticularis,</hi> in the meshes of which the
                    groups of nerve cells are contained. In the lower part of the medulla a central
                    canal continuous with that of the cord exists, but when the restiform bodies and
                    posterior pyramids on the opposite sides of the medulla diverge from each other,
                    the central canal loses its posterior boundary, and dilates into the cavity of
                    the 4th ventricle. The grey matter in the interior of the medulla appears,
                    therefore, on the floor of the ventricle; that which corresponds to the anterior
                    cornua being situated immediately on each side of the median furrow, whilst that
                    which is continuous with the grey tubercles of Rolando and the posterior cornua
                    is some distance external to it. This grey matter forms collections of nerve
                    cells, which are the centres of origin of several important encephalic
                    nerves.</p>
                <p>Of the independent masses of grey matter of the medulla, that which forms the <hi
                    rend="italic">corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">dentatum</hi> within the olivary body
                    is the most important, and constitutes the nucleus of the inferior olive. It is
                    folded on itself in a zig-zag or denticulated manner, and forms a sort of
                    capsule open on the inner aspect, through which openings a bundle of nerve
                    fibres from the interior of the capsule proceeds. These fibres aid in the
                    formation of the olivary fasciculus, and as Deiters and Meynert have pointed
                    out, in part arch across the mesial plane and join the restiform body on the
                    opposite side, whilst some apparently join the posterior pyramid. The nerve
                    cells of the olive are multipolar and flask-shaped, and in all probability give
                    origin to the nerve fibres proceeding from the interior of the capsule.
                    Separated from the inner part of the olive by a layer of reticular substance is
                    a smaller grey mass, called by Stilling <hi rend="italic">nucleus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">olivaris</hi><hi rend="italic">accessorius.</hi> Crossing the
                    anterior surface of the medulla oblongata, immediately below the pons, in the
                    majority of mammals is a transverse arrangement of fibres forming the <hi
                    rend="italic">trapezium,</hi> which contains a grey nucleus, named by Van der
                    Kolk the <hi rend="italic">superior olive.</hi> In the human brain the trapezium
                    is concealed by the lower transverse fibres of the pons, but when sections are
                    made through it, as L. Clarke pointed out, the grey matter of the superior olive
                    can be seen. Meynert states that its nerve cells give origin to some fibres,
                    which run straight backwards to the restiform body of the same side, and to
                    others which pass across the mesial plane to the opposite corpus restiforme.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Pons Varolii</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Bridge</hi>
                    (PL XVIII. figs. 1,2, 3,N) is cuboidal in form: its anterior surface rests upon
                    the dorsum sellae of the sphenoid, and is marked by a median longitudinal
                    groove; its inferior surface receives the pyramidal and olivary tracts of the
                    medulla oblongata; at its superior surface are the two crura cerebri; each
                    lateral surface is in relation to a hemisphere of the cerebellum, and a peduncle
                    passes from the pons into the interior of each hemisphere; the posterior surface
                    forms in part the upper portion of the floor of the 4th ventricle, and in part
                    is in contact with the corpora quadrigemina.</p>
                <p>The pons consists of white and grey matter: the nerve fibres of the white matter
                    pass through the substance of the pons, either in a transverse or a longitudinal
                    direction. The transverse fibres go from one hemisphere of the cerebellum to
                    that of the opposite side; some are situated on the anterior surface of the
                    pons, and form its superficial transverse fibres, whilst others pass through its
                    substance and form the deep transverse fibres. The transverse fibres of the pons
                    constitute, therefore, the commissural or connecting arrangement by which the
                    two hemispheres of the -cerebellum become anatomically continuous with each
                    other. The longitudinal fibres of the pons ascend or pass vertically upwards
                    from the medulla oblongata, and consist of the fibres of the anterior pyramids,
                    olivary fasciculi, fasciculi teretes, and posterior pyramids. They leave the
                    pons.by emerging from its upper surface as fibres of the two crura cerebri. The
                    pons possesses a median raphe continuous with that of the medulla oblongata, and
                    formed like it by a decussation of fibres in the mesial plane.</p>
                <p>The grey matter of the pons is scattered irregularly through its substance, and
                    appears on its posterior surface; but not on the anterior surface, which is
                    composed exclusively of the superficial transverse fibres. It is traversed both
                    by the longitudinal and deep transverse fibres, which form a well-defined <hi
                    rend="italic">formatio</hi><hi rend="italic">reticularis.</hi> To a portion of
                    grey matter, containing nerve cells charged with dark pigment, the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">locus</hi><hi rend="italic">caeruleus</hi> is apphed. The locus
                    lies on the floor of the 4th ventricle, close to the entrance to the aqueduct of
                    Sylvius, and serves as the origin of the sensory root of the 5 th, and perhaps
                    of the posterior root of the 4th cranial nerve. The nerve cells of the pons are
                    multipolar and stellate. The pons acts as a conductor of impressions through its
                    nerve fibres, and as a centre of origin of nerve fibres from nerve cells.
                    Meynert states that some of the fibres of the crura cerebri end in the nerve
                    cells of the pons, which cells again give origin to fibres that pass outwards to
                    the cerebellum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Cerebellum, Little Brain,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >After Brain</hi> (Pl. XVIII. fig. 2, c), occupies the inferior pair of
                    occipital fossae, and, along with the pons and medulla oblongata, lies below the
                    plane of the tentorium cerebelli. It consists of two hemispheres or lateral
                    lobes, and of a median or central lobe, which in human anatomy is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">vermiform process.</hi> It is connected below with the medulla
                    oblongata by the two restiform bodies which form its <hi rend="italic">inferior
                    peduncles,</hi> and above to the corpora quadrigemina of the cerebrum by two
                    bands, which form its <hi rend="italic">superior peduncles;</hi> whilst the two
                    hemispheres are connected together by the transverse fibres of the pons, which
                    form the <hi rend="italic">middle peduncles</hi> of the cerebellum. On the
                    superior or tentorial surface of the cerebellum the median or vermiform lobe is
                    a mere elevation, but on its inferior or occipital surface this lobe forms a
                    well-defined <hi rend="italic">inferior vermiform</hi> process, which lies at
                    the bottom of a deep fossa or <hi rend="italic">vallecula;</hi> this fossa is
                    prolonged to the posterior border of the cerebellum, and forms there a deep
                    notch which separates the two hemispheres from each other; in this notch the
                    falx cerebelli is lodged. Extending horizontally backwards from the middle
                    cerebral peduncle, along the outer border of each hemisphere is the <hi
                    rend="italic">great horizontal fissure,</hi> which divides the hemisphere into
                    its tentorial and occipital surfaces. Each of these surfaces is again subdivided
                    by fissures into smaller lobes, of which the most important are the <hi
                    rend="italic">amygdala</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tonsil,</hi> which forms the
                    lateral boundary of the anterior part of the vallecula, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">flocculus,</hi> which is situated immediately behind the middle
                    peduncle of the cerebellum. The inferior vermiform process is subdivided into a

                    rend="italic">uvula,</hi> situated between the two tonsils; and an anterior

                    due to its subdivision into multitudes of thin plates or lamellae by numerous
                    fissures. The cerebellum consists both of grey and white matter. The grey matter
                    forms the exterior or cortex of the lamellae, and passes from one to the other
                    across the bottoms of the several fissures. The white matter lies in the
                    interior of the organ, and extends into the core of each lamella. When a
                    vertical section is made through the organ, the prolongations of white matter
                    branching off into the interior of the several lamellae give to the section an
                    arborescent appearance, known by the fanciful name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >arbor</hi><hi rend="italic">vitoe</hi> (Pl. XVIII. fig. 3, c). Independent
                    masses of grey matter are, however, found in the interior of the cerebellum. If
                    the hemisphere be cut through a little to the outer side of the median lobe, a
                    zig-zag arrangement of grey matter, similar in appearance and structure to the
                    nucleus of the olivary body in the medulla oblongata, and known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">dentatum</hi> of the cerebellum, is
                    seen; it Ees in the midst of the white core of the hemisphere, and encloses
                    white fibres, which leave the interior of the corpus at its inner and lower
                    side. Stilling has described, in connection with the anterior end of the
                    inferior vermiform process, which projects forwards into the valve of Vieussens,
                    and aids in the formation of the roof of the 4th ventricle, two grey masses,
                    named <hi rend="italic">roof nuclei.</hi> They possess flask-shaped nerve cells
                    Eke those of the corpus dentatum. The white matter is more abundant in the
                    hemispheres than in the median lobe, and is for the most part directly
                    continuous with the fibres of the peduncles of the cerebellum. Thus the
                    restiform or inferior peduncles pass from below upwards through the white core,
                    to end in the grey matter of the tentorial surface of the cerebellum, more
                    especially in that of the central lobe; on their way they are connected both
                    with the grey matter of the corpus dentatum and of the roof nuclei. The superior
                    peduncles, which descend from the corpora quadrigemina of the cerebrum, reach
                    the grey cortical matter, more especially an the inferior surface of the
                    cerebellum, though they also form connections with the corpus dentatum. The
                    middle peduncles form a large proportion of the white core, and their fibres
                    terminate in the grey matter of the foliated cortex of the hemispheres. But, in
                    addition to these peduncular fibres, which connect the cerebellum to other
                    subdivisions of the encephalon, its white matter contains fibres proper to the
                    cerebellum itself. The <hi rend="italic">fibroe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >propriae</hi> have been especially described by Stilling; some, which he has
                    termed the median fasciculi, lie near the mesial plane, and connect the grey
                    matter on the tentorial aspect of the middle lobe with that of the inferior
                    vermiform process, whilst others cross directly the mesial plane to unite
                    opposite and symmetrical regions of the hemispheres. Further, the auditory nerve
                    was said by Foville to derive some of its fibres of origin from the cerebellum;
                    the connection of this nerve with the cerebellum has been strongly insisted on
                    by Meynert, and this anatomist has also ascribed a cerebellar origin to a
                    portion of the sensory root of the 5th cranial nerve.</p>
                <p>The grey matter of the cortex is divided into two well-defined layers, an
                    external grey, and an inner rust coloured layer of about equal thickness. The
                    rust coloured layer is distinguished by containing multitudes of so called
                    “granules,” the well-defined nucleus in which, as described by Strachan, is
                    invested by a small quantity of branched protoplasm. These “granules” are,
                    therefore, minute stellate cells. Where the rust coloured layer joins the grey
                    layer the characteristic nerve cells of the cerebellum, named the <hi
                    rend="italic">corpuscles of Purkinje,</hi> are situated. A slender central
                    process arising from each cell enters the rust coloured layer, and, as the
                    observations of Hadlich and Koschennikoff show, becomes continuous with the
                    axial cylinder of a medullated nerve fibre; for the nerve fibres of the white
                    core enter this layer, divide into minute fibres, and ramify amidst the
                    granules. From the opposite aspect of each cell two peripheral processes arise,
                    and ramify in an antler-like manner in the external grey layer. Obersteiner and
                    Hadlich maintain that the finer branches of these processes curve back towards
                    the rust coloured layer, where, according to Boll, they form a network of
                    extreme minuteness, from which it is believed that nerve fibres may arise. The
                    substratum of the grey layer, in which the branched processes of the cells of
                    Purkinje lie, consists of a very delicate neuroglia, in which scattered
                    corpuscles are imbedded; but, in the outer part of this layer, delicate
                    supporting connective tissue-like fibres are also met with.</p>

                    bottom of the fissure passing across the mesial plane from one hemisphere to the

                    the concavity of the inner table of the cranial bones; its inner surface, which
                    bounds the longitudinal fissure, is flat and is separated from the opposite
                    hemisphere by the falx cerebri; its under surface, where it rests on the
                    tentorium, is concave, and is separated by that membrane from the cerebellum and
                    pons. From the front of the pons two strong white bands, the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The peripheral part of each hemisphere, which consists of grey matter, exhibits a
                    characteristic folded appearance, known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >convolutions</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gyri</hi> of the cerebrum. These
                    convolutions are separated from each other by <hi rend="italic">fissures</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">sulci,</hi> some of which are considered to subdivide the
                    hemisphere into lobes, whilst others separate the convolutions in each lobe from
                    each other. In each hemisphere of the human brain five lobes are recognised: the
                    temporo-sphe-noidal, frontal, parietal, occipital, and the central lobe or
                    insula. Passing obliquely on the outer face of the hemisphere from before,
                    upwards and backwards, is the well-marked <hi rend="italic">Sylvian
                    fissure,</hi> which is the first to appear in the development of the hemisphere.
                    Below it lies the tem-poro-sphenoidal lobe, and above and in front of it, the
                    parietal and frontal lobes. The frontal lobe is separated from the parietal by
                    the <hi rend="italic">fissure of Rolando,</hi> which extends on the outer face
                    of the hemisphere from the longitudinal fissure obliquely downwards and forwards
                    towards the Sylvian fissure. About two inches from the hinder end of the
                    hemisphere is the <hi rend="italic">pariet</hi><hi rend="italic">o-occipital
                    fissure,</hi> which, . commencing at the longitudinal fissure, passes down the
                    inner surface of the hemisphere, and transversely outwards for a short distance
                    on the outer surface of the hemisphere; it separates the parietal and occipital
                    lobes from each other.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Temporo-Sphenoidal Lobe</hi> presents on the outer surface
                    of the hemisphere three convolutions, arranged in parallel <hi rend="italic"

                    >n&amp;vaedsuperior,middle,and inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolutions.</hi>
                    The fissure which separates the superior and middle of these convolutions is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">parallel fissure.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Occipital Lobe</hi> also consists from above downwards of three parallel
                    convolutions, named <hi rend="italic">superior, middle, and inferior
                    occipital.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Frontal Lobe</hi> is more complex;
                    immediately in front of the fissure of Rolando, and forming indeed its anterior
                    boundary, is a convolution named <hi rend="italic">ascending frontal,</hi> which
                    ascends obliquely backwards and upwards from the Sylvian to the longitudinal
                    fissure. Springing from the front of this con volution, and passing forwards to
                    the anterior end of the cerebrum, are three convolutions, arranged in parallel
                    <hi rend="italic">tiers</hi> from above downwards, and named <hi rend="italic"
                    >superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions,</hi> which are also
                    prolonged on to the orbital face of the frontal lobe. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parietal Lobe</hi> is also complex; its most anterior convolution, named <hi
                    rend="italic">ascending parietal,</hi> ascends parallel to and immediately
                    behind the fissure of Rolando. Springing from the upper end of the back of this
                    convolution is the <hi rend="italic">postero-parietdl convolution,</hi> which,
                    forming the boundary of the longitudinal fissure, extends as far back as the
                    parieto-occipital fissure; springing from the lower end of the back of this
                    convolution is the <hi rend="italic">supra - marginal convolution,</hi> which
                    forms the upper boundary of the hinder part of the Sylvian fissure; as this
                    gyrus occupies the hollow in the parietal bone, which corresponds to the
                    eminence, it may appropriately be named the <hi rend="italic">convolution</hi>
                    of the <hi rend="italic">parietal eminence.</hi> Continuous with the convolution
                    of the parietal eminence is the <hi rend="italic">angular convolution,</hi>
                    which bends round the posterior extremity of the Sylvian fissure. Lying in the
                    parietal lobe is the <hi rend="italic">intra-parietal fissure,</hi> which
                    separates the convolution of the parietal eminence from the postero-parietal
                    convolution<pb break="no"

                    lobe by two <hi rend="italic">annectent</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bridging</hi>
                    gyri, which bridge across the transverse external part of the parieto-occipital
                    fissure; the depth and extent of this fissure vary in different brains in
                    proportion to the size of these bridging convolutions. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >superior annectent gyrus</hi> passes between the postero-parietal and the
                    superior occipital convolutions, whilst the <hi rend="italic">second annectent
                    gyrus</hi> connects the middle occipital with the angular gyrus. Two annectent
                    gyri also pass from the inferior occipital convolution to the lower convolutions
                    of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. These lobes of the cerebrum, though named after
                    the bones which form the vault of the skull, are not exactly co-terminous with
                    them. The frontal lobe not only lies under cover of the frontal bone, but
                    extends backwards under the anterior part of the parietal; for the fissure of
                    Rolando, which form3 its posterior boundary, lies from 1J to 2 inches behind the
                    coronal suture. The occipital lobe is not limited to the upper tabular part of
                    the occipital bone, but extends forwards under cover of the posterior part of
                    the parietal, for the parieto-occipital fissure lies about I inch in front of
                    the apex of the lambdoidal fissure. The temporo-sphenoidal lobe not only lies
                    under the squamous-temporal and great wing of the sphenoid, but passes upwards
                    under cover of the lower part of the parietal, for the Sylvian fissure passes
                    from below obliquely upwards and backwards across the line of the squamous
                    suture near its middle. The area covered by the parietal bone so far, then, from
                    being co-terminous with the parietal lobe of the cerebrum, is trenched on
                    anteriorly by the frontal, posteriorly by the occipital, and inferiorly by the
                    temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The convolutions of the parietal lobe itself are
                    grouped around the parietal eminence, and in the interval between it and the
                    sagittal suture. The inner table of the cranial bones is an almost exact mould
                    of the convolutions of these lobes; but this is not so with the exterior of the
                    skull, the configuration of which is modified by the formation of ridges and
                    processes for the attachment of muscles, by variations in the thickness of the
                    diploe, and by the development of the frontal and mastoid airsinuses. Hence the
                    outer surface of the skull does not correspond in shape to the outside of the
                    brain.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Central Lobe</hi> of the hemisphere, more usually called
                    the <hi rend="italic">insula</hi> or <hi rend="italic">island of Heil,</hi> does
                    not come to the surface of the hemisphere, but lies deeply within the Sylvian
                    fissure, the convolutions forming the margin of which conceal it. It consists of
                    four or five short convolutions, which radiate from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >locus</hi><hi rend="italic">perforatus anticus,</hi> situated at the inner end
                    of the fissure. This lobe is almost entirely surrounded by a deep sulcus, which
                    insulates it from the adjacent convolutions. It lies opposite the upper part of
                    the ali-sphenoid, where it articulates with the parietal and
                    squamous-temporal.</p>
                <p>Convolutions also exist on the inner surface of the hemisphere, and on the under
                    surface which rests on the tentorium, but these have no relation to the bones of
                    the cranial vault. They may be studied in connection with the corpus callosum or
                    great transverse commissure, which connects the two hemispheres, and with
                    certain fissures situated on these surfaces of the hemisphere. The small
                    convolutions which lie behind the internal part of the parieto-occipital fissure
                    form the inner convolutions of the occipital lobe, or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >occipital lobule</hi> (Fig. 73). Those which lie immediately in front of the
                    same fissure belong to the inner face of the parietal lobe, and form the <hi
                    rend="italic">quadrilateral lobule.</hi> It is customary, however, to name the
                    convolution which extends forwards from that fissure along the margin of the
                    longitudinal fissure to the anterior end of the hemisphere, and which then turns
                    back to the locus perforatus anticus as the <hi rend="italic">marginal
                    convolution.</hi> This is separated by a fissure called <hi rend="italic"

                    From the lower end of the parieto-occipital fissure an offshoot, called the <hi

                    the occipital lobe, which fissure marks on this surface of the hemisphere the

                    >hippocampus minor,</hi> in the posterior cornu of the ventricle.</p>
                <p>If a horizontal slice be removed from the upper, part of each hemisphere, the
                    peripheral grey matter of the convolutions will be seen to follow their various
                    windings, whilst the core of each convolution consists of white matter
                    continuous with a mass of white matter in the interior of the hemisphere. If a
                    deeper slice be now made down to the plane of the corpus callosum, the white
                    matter of that structure will be seen to be continuous with the white centre of
                    each hemisphere. The <hi rend="italic">corpus callosum</hi> does not equal the
                    hemispheres in length, but approaches nearer to their anterior than their
                    posterior ends (Pl. XVIII. fig. 3, B.) It terminates behind in a free rounded
                    end, whilst in front it forms a knee-shaped bend, and passes downwards • and
                    backwards as far as the lamina cinerea. If the dissection be performed on a
                    brain which has been hardened in spirit, the corpus callosum is seen to consist
                    almost entirely of bundles of nerve fibres, passing transversely across the
                    mesial plane between the two hemispheres; these fibres may be traced into the
                    white cores and grey matter of the convolutions, and apparently connect the
                    corresponding convolutions in the opposite hemispheres. Hence the corpus
                    callosum is a connecting or commissural structure, which brings the convolutions
                    of the two hemispheres into anatomical and physiological relation with each
                    other. On the surface of the corpus callosum a few fibres, the <hi rend="italic"

                    with that of the third ventricle, which again is continuous with the lining of
                    the fourth ventricle through the aqueduct of Sylvius. A little fluid is
                    contained in the cerebral ventricles, which, under some pathological conditions,
                    may increase greatly in quantity, so as to occasion considerable dilatation of

                    is exposed. This septum fits into the interval between the under surface of the
                    corpus callosum and the upper surface of the anterior part of the fornix. It
                    consists of two layers of grey matter, between which is a narrow vertical mesial

                    of the fornix forms the summit or crown of the arch. It consists of two lateral
                    halves, one belonging to each hemisphere. At the summit of the arch the two
                    lateral halves are conjoined to form the <hi rend="italic">body;</hi> but in
                    front of the body the two halves separate from each other, and form two anterior
                    pillars, which descend in front of the third ventricle to the base of the
                    cerebrum, where they form the <hi rend="italic">corpora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >albicantia,</hi> and then enter the substance of the optic thalamus. Behind the
                    body the two halves diverge much more from each other, and form the posterior
                    pillars; each of which curves downwards and outwards into the descending cornu

                    the fornix be now divided by a transverse incision, its anterior part thrown
                    forwards, and its posterior part backwards, the great transverse fissure of the
                    cerebrum is opened into, and the velum interpositum lying in that fissure is
                    exposed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">velum</hi><hi rend="italic">interpositum</hi> is an
                    expanded fold of pia mater, which passes into the interior of the hemispheres
                    through the great transverse fissure. It is triangular in shape; its base is in
                    a line with the posterior end of the corpus callosum, where it is continuous
                    with the external pia mater; its lateral margins are fringed by the choroid
                    plexuses, which are seen in the bodies and descending cornua of the lateral
                    ventricles, where they are invested by the endothelial lining of those cavities.
                    Its apex, where the two choroid plexuses blend with each other, lies just behind
                    the anterior pillars of the fornix. The interval between the apex and these
                    pillars is the aperture of communication between the two lateral ventricles and
                    the third, already referred to as the foramen of Monro. The choroid plexuses
                    contain the small <hi rend="italic">choroidal arteries,</hi> which supply the
                    corpora striata, optic thalami, and corpora quadrigemina; and the blood from
                    these bodies is returned by small veins, which join to form the <hi
                    rend="italic">veins of Galen</hi> (Fig. 75). These veins pass along the centre
                    of the velum, and, as is shown in Fig. 63, open into the straight sinus. If the
                    velum interpositum be now carefully raised from before backwards, the optic
                    thalami, third ventricle, pineal gland, and corpora quadrigemina are
                    exposed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">optic thalamus</hi> is a large, somewhat ovoid body
                    situated behind the corpus striatum, and abovp the crus cerebri. Its upper
                    surface is partly seen in the floor of the body of the lateral ventricle, but is
                    for the most part covered by the fornix and velum interpositum. Its
                    postero-inferior surface forms the roof of the descending cornu of the
                    ventricle, whilst its inner surface forms the side wall of the third ventricle.
                    At its outer and posterior part are two slight elevations, placed one on each
                    side of the optic tract, and named respectively <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">geniculatum</hi><hi rend="italic">internum</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">externum.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">third ventricle</hi> is a cavity situated in the mesial
                    plane between the two optic thalami. Its roof is formed by the velum
                    interpositum and body of fornix; its floor, by the pons Tarini, corpora
                    albicantia, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, and optic commissure; its anterior
                    boundary, by the anterior pillars of the fornix, anterior commissure, and lamina
                    cinerea; its posterior boundary, by the corpora quadrigemina and posterior
                    commissure. The cavity of this ventricle is of small size in the living head,
                    for the inner surfaces of the two thalami are connected together by intermediate
                    grey matter, named the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> or <hi rend="italic">soft
                    commissure;</hi> but in taking the brain out of the cranial cavity this
                    commissure is usually more or less torn through, and the cavity is consequently
                    enlarged. Immediately in front of the corpora quadrigemina, the white fibres of
                    the <hi rend="italic">posterior commissure</hi> pass across between the two
                    optic thalami. If the anterior pillars of the fornix be separated from each
                    other, the white fibres of the <hi rend="italic">anterior commissure τa⅛γ</hi>
                    be seen entering the two corpora striata.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pineal body</hi> is a reddish cone-shaped body, enveloped
                    by the velum interpositum, and situated upon the more anterior pair of the
                    corpora quadrigemina. From its broad anterior end two white bands, the <hi
                    rend="italic">peduncles of the pineal body,</hi> pass forwards, one on the inner
                    side of each optio thalamus. Each peduncle joins, along with the taenia
                    semicircularis, the anterior pillar of the fornix of its own side. In its
                    structure this body consists of a vascular stroma of connective tissue, in the
                    meshes of which lymphoid cells are contained. Branched corpuscles are also found

                    the posterior commissure, and posteriorly into the fourth ventricle under cover

                    endothelium.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Internal Structure of the Cerebrum.</hi> —The cerebrum is
                    composed both of grey and white matter, the general relations of these two forms
                    of nerve matter to each other may be seen by making sections through the
                    cerebrum. The determination, however, of their minute structure, and of the
                    relations and connections of the nerve fibres to the nerve cells is, owing to
                    the delicacy of the organ, one of the most difficult departments of anatomical
                    study. Several anatomists have endeavoured to trace out the course of the nerve
                    fibres in the organ, and though our knowledge is by no means complete, yet many
                    important facts have undoubtedly been ascertained. These facts have been
                    summarised, and numerous valuable additions made to them by Meynert in a recent
                    elaborate memoir, which has been frequently consulted and made use of in writing
                    the following description.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Grey Matter</hi> of the cerebrum is disposed in three great
                    groups: <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> The grey matter of the cortex of the
                    hemispheres; <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the grey matter of the great ganglia of
                    the base of the cerebrum <hi rend="italic">; c,</hi> the central grey matter
                    which forms the wall of the cerebral end of the cerebro-spinal tube.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a,</hi> The grey matter of the cortex of the hemisphere forms
                    the superficial part of the convolutions, and is known as the great
                    hemispherical ganglion, but in some localities, as at the loci perforati antici
                    and the septum lucidum, it has received distinctive names. When a convolution is
                    divided vertically the grey matter is seen to be confined to the surface and to
                    enclose a white core. The grey matter presents a laminated appearance, and as a
                    rule consists of five or six layers, which are composed of the characteristic
                    pyramidal nerve cells of the cortex of the cerebrum, of nerve fibres, of matrix
                    or neuroglia, and of blood-vessels. The most superficial layer consists of
                    neuroglia, in which nerve fibres extend parallel to the surface of the
                    convolutions. In the deeper layers are found the pyramidal nerve cells, which
                    lie with their long axes vertical to the surface of the convolutions, and which
                    contain angular nuclei. From the observations of Lockhart Clarke, Arndt,
                    Cleland, and Meynert, there can be no doubt that the pyramidal nerve cells vary
                    in relative size and in numbers in the different layers of the grey cortex, and
                    that the largest sized pyramidal cells lie in the third and fourth layers. L.
                    Clarke stated that the cells of all the layers of the posterior or occipital
                    lobe were small and of nearly uniform size, whilst in the convolutions anterior
                    to it numerous cells of a much larger kind were found; but though it is
                    undoubtedly true that large pyramidal cells are found in the frontal lobe in
                    considerable numbers, and that the greater number of the cells of the occipital
                    lobe are small and nearly uniform in size, there is no difficulty in recognising
                    in the occipital lobe a small proportion of cells, quite equal in magnitude to
                    the largest cells of the frontal lobe, interspersed amongst the smaller
                    pyramidal cells. The nerve fibres which ascend into the grey matter from the
                    white core of the convolution radiate into its several layers, and are
                    apparently continuous with the basal axis-cylinder processes of the nerve cells.
                    According to Cleland, the elongated apices of the cells, which are directed to
                    the surface of the convolution, are continuous with the nerve fibres situated in
                    the superficial layer of horizontal fibres. Immediately subjacent to the large
                    pyramidal cells numerous small, irregularly shaped nerve corpuscles, like those
                    of the internal granule layer of the retina, form the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">granule layer</hi> of the grey matter. Fusiform cells, which give
                    off lateral processes, are found in the deepest layer of the grey matter, and
                    form the <hi rend="italic">claustral</hi><hi rend="italic">layer</hi> of
                    Meynert. Gerlach has described here, as in the spinal cord, a network of
                    extremely minute nerve fibres, with which the branched lateral processes of the
                    nerve cells are apparently continuous. The neuroglia contains , multitudes of
                    small rounded corpuscles. In it also are found small stellate cells, provided
                    with minute branched processes, which cells, as Meynert states, are so pellucid,
                    that in the healthy brain they seem to be only free nuclei; it is difficult to
                    say whether these cells belong to the neuroglia, or are nerve cell elements. The
                    grey cortex of the cerebrum is much more vascular than the white matter. The
                    arteries derived from the pia mater pass vertically into it, and end in a close
                    polygonal network of capillaries; but it is also traversed by the arteries,
                    which terminate in the capillary network of supply for the white matter.</p>
                <p>In the grey matter of the cortex of the occipital lobe eight layers have been
                    described by Clarke and Meynert. The increase in number is due to the
                    intercalation of two additional granule layers, which coalesce and form a
                    distinct white band in the grey matter, owing, as Meynert states, to the absence
                    of pigment in the cells of the granule layers.</p>
                <p>The grey matter of the cortex of the island of Beil and of the convolutions
                    bounding the Sylvian fissure contains a very large proportion of fusiform cells.
                    They form the chief constituent of the grey <hi rend="italic">claustrum,</hi>
                    situated deeper than the grey matter of the island, and separated from the outer
                    part of the corpus striatum by a thin layer of white matter. Fusiform cells also
                    occur abundantly in the <hi rend="italic">nucleus amygdala,</hi> a grey mass
                    situated below the corpus striatum, which in some sections seems as if isolated,
                    but in reality is continuous with the grey matter of the inferior
                    temporo-sphenoidal convolution.</p>
                <p>The grey matter of the cortex of the gyrus hippocampi and of the hippocampus
                    major is apparently destitute of both the granule and claustral layers of cells.
                    Its superficial layer has been named the <hi rend="italic">nuclear lamina,</hi>
                    and contains small and scattered nerve corpuscles. Next this lamina lies the <hi
                    rend="italic">striatum</hi><hi rend="italic">reticulare,</hi> in which the
                    apices of the numerous pyramidal cells of the third layer branch and again unite
                    to form a delicate network. Deeper than the pyramidal cells is a thick layer of
                    so-called “granules,” which A. B. Stirling recognised some years ago as like the
                    granules of the rust coloured layer of the cerebellum; like them they consist of
                    a well-defined nucleus invested by delicate branched protoplasm. The grey matter
                    of the two layers of the septum lucidum, though included between the corpus
                    callosum and fornix, is yet in the same plane as the grey matter of the cortex
                    of the inner surface of the hemispheres, but is cut off from it by the
                    development of the transverse fibres of the corpus callosum. The grey matter of
                    the locus perforatus anticus contains <pb break="no"

                    arrangement of small nerve cells.</p>
                <p>δ, The great ganglia of the base of the cerebrum are the corpora striata, the
                    optic thalami, the corpora geniculata, the corpora quadrigemina, and the locus
                    niger in each crus cerebri.</p>
                <p>The corpus’striatum cerebri consists of two masses of grey matter separated from
                    each other by numerous striae of white fibres, which ascend from below upwards
                    through its substance. The upper mass of grey matter projects into the lateral
                    ventricle, and is called the intra-ventricular portion or <hi rend="italic"
                    >nucleus</hi><hi rend="italic">caudatus.</hi> The lower extra-ventricular
                    portion or <hi rend="italic">nucleus lenticularis</hi> forms the outer and lower
                    part of the corpus striatum, and is separated by the claustrum from the island
                    of Reil. Multipolar nerve cells are found in both the caudate and lenticular
                    masses, and in the latter cells of large size have been seen. The optic thalamus
                    forms an almost continuous mass of grey matter traversed by nerve fibres, which
                    are not, however, collected into definite striae. The nerve cells in the grey
                    matter are both multipolar and fusiform. The external corpus geniculatum
                    consists of alternate layers of grey and white matter, due to the zig-zag
                    folding of the grey matter; the nerve cells are multipolar, and contain pigment.
                    In the internal corpus geniculatum the cells are smaller in size and fusiform.
                    The grey matter of the corpora quadrigemina consists of two distinct masses.
                    One, the <hi rend="italic">zonular</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> ι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">layer,</hi> lies near the surface, and contains small multipolar
                    nerve cells; the other, the <hi rend="italic">Sylvian</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >central layer,</hi> lies at the sides of the Sylvian fissure and belongs to the
                    grey matter of the wall of the cerebro-spinal tube, and serves as a centre of
                    origin for the roots of both the 3d and 4th cranial nerves. The grey matter of
                    the crus cerebri occupies the centre of the cerebral peduncle. Its cells are
                    multipolar, and contain dark brown or black pigment, so that the name <hi
                    rend="italic">locus</hi><hi rend="italic">niger</hi> is applied to this
                    collection of nerve cells.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">c,</hi> The central grey matter of the cerebrum is in series
                    with the grey matter of the floor of the 4th ventricle and the grey matter of
                    the spinal cord. It is situated around the Sylvian aqueduct, and at the sides
                    and floor of the third ventricle, which form the cerebral portion of the
                    cerebrospinal tube. That which is situated in relation with the aqueduct of
                    Sylvius forms the <hi rend="italic">Sylvian</hi> or <hi rend="italic">central
                    layer</hi> just described in the corpora quadrigemina. That which lies in
                    relation to the third ventricle forms the middle or soft commissure, and the
                    well-defined grey layer which covers the inner wall of each optic thalamus; also
                    the grey masses situated at the base of the brain between and in front of the
                    crura cerebri, viz., the pons Tarini, tuber cinereum, lamina cinerea,
                    infundibulum, and the grey matter of the pituitary body. By some anatomists the
                    grey matter of the pineal body is referred to the same category, but Arnold has
                    pointed out that it is separated by its peduncle from the soft commissure; and
                    Meynert is disposed to regard it as a ganglion of origin of the tegmentum. Both
                    the pituitary and pineal bodies contain, besides the nervous matter, structures
                    of the type of the glands without ducts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">White Matter</hi> of the cerebrum consists of tracts or
                    fasciculi of nerve fibres, of which— <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> some connect the
                    cerebrum with the lower divisions of the encephalon; δ, others connect the two
                    hemispheres together; c, others connect different structures in the same
                    hemisphere; <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> others serve as roots of origin for the
                    more anterior encephalic nerves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a,</hi> The tracts of fibres which connect the cerebrum with
                    the lower divisions of the encephalon are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >peduncular</hi> fibres. The largest of these peduncles are the two <hi
                    rend="italic">crura cerebri</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cerebral peduncles.</hi>
                    Continuous below with the longitudinal fibres of the pons they ascend into the
                    optic thalami and corpora striata, and their fibres are named the <hi
                    rend="italic">peduncular</hi> fibres. From the corpora striata and optic thalami
                    fibres radiate into the convolutions of the lobes of the hemisphere and form the
                    <hi rend="italic">corona</hi><hi rend="italic">radiata.</hi> To some extent the
                    fibres of the <hi rend="italic">corona</hi> are directly continuous with those
                    of the cerebral peduncles, but there can be no doubt that a large portion of the
                    peduncular fibres terminate in the grey matter of the ganglia of the base of the
                    cerebrum, and that a still larger number arise from their nerve cells to aid in
                    the formation of the corona radiata. The direct continuity, therefore, of many
                    of the peduncular fibres with those of the corona is broken or interrupted by
                    the interposition of the cerebral ganglia, which Meynert has named <hi
                    rend="italic">ganglia</hi><hi rend="italic">of interruption.</hi> The peduncular
                    fibres and those of the corona constitute the cerebral portion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">projection</hi><hi rend="italic">system</hi> of fibres of Meynert,
                    a term devised to express that they conduct upwards to the grey cortex of the
                    hemispheres sensory impulses derived from the external world, the image of which
                    is projected upon the cortex. But it should also not be forgotten that many of
                    the fibres of this system conduct motor impulses downwards to be propagated
                    along the'motor cranial and spinal nerves. The peduncular fibres of the crura
                    cerebri are arranged in two groups, named respectively <hi rend="italic"
                    >crusta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tegmentum,</hi> which are separated from each
                    other by the nerve cells of the locus niger. The <hi rend="italic">crusta</hi>
                    forms the superficial or anterior part of the crus. Its fibres are in greater
                    part continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the pons derived from the
                    anterior pyramids of the medulla; but it receives additional fibres from the
                    grey matter of the locus niger, and from the cells of the Sylvian layer in the
                    corpora quadrigemina. Some of the fibres of the crusta pass directly upwards as
                    radiating fibres to the grey cortex of the occipital and temporal lobes, but the
                    larger number terminate in the nucleus caudatus and nucleus lenticularis of the
                    corpus striatum. From these nuclei a great mass of fibres radiates into the
                    cortex of the fronto-parietal lobes, more especially the frontal, but a few
                    also, bearing the special name of <hi rend="italic">stria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cornea,</hi> pass to the grey matter of the apex of the temporal lobe; fibres
                    also enter the convolutions of the insula. In addition to the radiating fibres,
                    the grey matter of the corpus striatum gives origin to fibres of the middle root
                    of the olfactory peduncle, and to connecting fibres with the grey matter of the
                    septum lucidum. The <hi rend="italic">tegmentum</hi> forms the posterior or
                    deeper part of the crus cerebri. Its fibres are continuous with the longitudinal
                    fibres of the pons derived from the olivary fasciculi, fasciculi teretes, and
                    posterior pyramids of the medulla. A. few of the fibres of the tegmentum enter
                    the corpora quadrigemina and corpora geniculata, but the great majority enter
                    the optic thalami, in the grey matter of which many evidently terminate, though
                    some may pass through into the cortex of the hemispheres as fibres of the corona
                    radiata. But the grey matter of the thalamus gives origin to numerous radiating
                    fibres: those which arise in its posterior part radiate into the occipital and
                    temporal lobes, whilst those proceeding out of its anterior part radiate into
                    the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, and the insula. In the optic thalamus
                    the <hi rend="italic">fornix</hi> arises. Its fibres emerge from the under
                    surface of the thalamus, form the corpus albicans, and then pass backwards as
                    the upper boundary of the great transverse fissure to end as the taenia
                    hippocampi in the gyrus hippocampi; hence this convolution has a special
                    connection with the optic thalamus through the fornix In the corpus albicans the
                    fibres of the fornix are arranged in loops, in the concavities of which nerve
                    cells are situated. The optic thalamus also gives origin to the middle root of
                    the optic tract. Owing to the connections of the locus niger, nucleus caudatus,
                    and nucleus lenticularis with the crusta, Meynert has named them the <hi

                    hemispheres bears a direct relation to the size of the crusta and its ganglia,
                    whilst the development of the hemispheres is in inverse relation to the size of
                    the tegmentum and its ganglia.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">superior peduncles</hi> of the cerebellum connect that
                    organ with the cerebrum. They arise in the grey matter of the vermiform process,
                    ascend to the corpora quadrigemina, and some fibres are even prolonged
                    apparently into the tegmentum, and through it doubtless into the optic
                    thalamus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">b,</hi> The fibres which connect together the two hemispheres
                    are called <hi rend="italic">commissural</hi> fibres. The largest of these
                    commissures is the <hi rend="italic">corpus callosum,</hi> which, as has already
                    been described, connects corresponding convolutions in the opposite hemispheres.
                    As its fibres lie on a plane superior to those of the corona radiata, the two
                    systems of fibres intersect with each other on their way to the convolutions.
                    The <hi rend="italic">anterior commissure,</hi> though often described as
                    connecting the two corpora striata, yet, as Spurzheim pointed out half a century
                    ago, passes through these bodies to the convolutions around the Sylvian fissure,
                    and gives a root of origin to the olfactory nerve. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior commissure</hi> passes into the two optic thalami; some of its fibres
                    are said to extend into the tegmentum, and others into the substance of the
                    hemisphere.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">c,</hi> The tracts which connect different convolutions in the
                    same hemisphere are named <hi rend="italic">arcuate fibres,</hi><hi

                    immediately beneath the inner surface of the cortex of the hemispheres, and
                    connect together the grey matter of adjacent convolutions. In some localities
                    they are strongly marked, and have ^received special names.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fasciculus</hi><hi rend="italic">uncinatus</hi> passes
                    across the Sylvian fissure, traverses the claustrum and amygdala, and connects
                    the convolutions of the frontal with those of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The
                    <hi rend="italic">fillet of the gyrus</hi><hi rend="italic">fornicatus</hi>
                    extends longitudinally in that convolution, immediately above the corpus
                    callosum, from its anterior to its posterior ends, and connects two different
                    parts of its grey matter together. The <hi rend="italic">longitudinal
                    fibres</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">corpus callosum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >nerves of Lancisi,</hi> also connect the anterior and posterior ends of the
                    callosal convolution. The <hi rend="italic">longitudinal inferior
                    fasciculus</hi> connects the convolutions of the occipital with those of the
                    temporal lobe. Longitudinal fibres lie on the inner surface of the septum
                    lucidum, and extend into the gyrus fornicatus.</p>
                <p>The corpora quadrigemina are connected with the optic thalami by nervous tracts
                    called <hi rend="italic">brachia,</hi> and smaller tracts also connect the
                    thalami with the corpora geniculata. The peduncles of the pineal gland connect
                    that body with the fornix, and are probably continued into the optic thalamus.
                    The taenia semicircularis is also at one end apparently connected with the optic
                    thalamus, but its posterior termination is not well ascertained.</p>
                <p>The great cerebral ganglia and the central masses of grey matter are centres of
                    origin for sensori-motor nerves. The hemispherical ganglia, again, are the parts
                    of the brain associated with the intellectual processes. The question has often
                    been put, Are not the individual convolutions distinct organs, each endowed with
                    special properties 1 and various arguments based on physiological, pathological,
                    and anatomical grounds have been advanced in support of this proposition. In
                    connection with the anatomical branch of the argument it may be stated that the
                    convolutions possess, not only in man, but in all animals with convoluted
                    brains, great regularity both in position and arrangement; but specialisation of
                    form is not in itself a sufficient test of specialisation of function. <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> gain, though the convolutions have definite forms they are
                    not disconnected from each other, for the grey matter forms a continuous layer
                    over the whole surface of the hemisphere. Hence a group of cerebral convolutions
                    differs from a group of muscles, each member of which is undoubtedly a distinct
                    organ, for each muscle is isolated from those around it by a definite investing
                    sheath. As regards internal structure, evidence has already been given that all
                    the convolutions are not constructed on precisely the same plan, and it has also
                    been pointed out that the convolutions are not all connected in the same way
                    with the great cerebral ganglia. These structural modifications unquestionably
                    point to functional differences in the several parts in which they are found.
                    But further, special connections through the arcuate fibres are established
                    between certain convolutions and not between others, and it is possible not only
                    that particular combinations of convolutions through an interchange of
                    internuncial fibres may condition a particular state of intellectual activity,
                    but that these combinations associate various convolutions together in the
                    performance of a given intellectual act, just as in the muscular system several
                    muscles are as a rule associated together for the performance of a given
                    movement. A clue to the special functions of the convolutions may perhaps be
                    obtained by studying their connections, just as the action of the members of a
                    group of muscles is ascertained by examining the direction of their fibres and
                    the attachment of their terminal tendons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mass and Weight of the Brain.</hi> —The human brain is
                    absolutely bigger and heavier than the brain of any animal, except the elephant
                    and the larger whales. It is also heavier relatively to the bulk and weight of
                    the body than are the brains of lower animals, except in some small birds and
                    mammals. Considerable variations, however, exist in the size and weight of the
                    human brain, not only in the different races of mankind, but in individuals of
                    the same race and in the two sexes. The heaviest brains occur in the white
                    races. The average weight of the adult European male brain is 49 to 50 oz., that
                    of the adult female 44 to 45 oz.; so that the brain of a man is on the average
                    fully 10 per cent, heavier than that of a woman. The greater weight of the brain
                    in man as compared with woman is not in relation merely to his greater bulk, but
                    is a fundamental sexual distinction; for, whilst there is a difference of 10 per
                    cent, in the brain weight, the average stature of women is, as Thurnam has
                    calculated, only 8 per cent, less than that of men. Dr Boyd states that the
                    average weight of the brain in the newly born male infant is 11 *67 oz.; in the
                    female only 10 oz. The exact age at which the brain reaches its maximum size has
                    been variously placed at from the 3d to the 8th years by different authors; but
                    it continues to increase in weight to 25 or 30, or even 40. After 60 the brain
                    begins to diminish in weight; in aged males the average weight is about 45 oz.,
                    in females about 41 oz. In some cases the adult brain considerably exceeds the
                    average weight. The brains of several men distinguished for their intellectual
                    attainments have been weighed: the brain of Cuvier weighed 64£ oz.; of Dr
                    Abercrombie, 63 oz.; of Professor Goodsir, 57⅜ oz.; of Spurzheim, 55 oz.; of Sir
                    J. Y. Simpson, 54 oz.; of Agassiz, 53 ’ 4 oz.; and of Dr Chalmers, 53 oz. But
                    high brain weights have also been found where there was no evidence of great
                    intellectual capacity. Peacock weighed four male brains which ranged from 62 ’
                    75 to 61 oz.; Boyd, a specimen of 60 ’ 75 oz.; and Turner has recorded one of a
                    boy aged fifteen which weighed 60 oz. In the brains of the insane high brain
                    weights have also been observed. Bucknill met with a brain in a male epileptic
                    which weighed 64∣ oz.; Thurnam, one which weighed 62 oz.; and in the West Riding
                    Asylum, out of 375 males examined, the weight of the brain in 30 cases was 55
                    oz. or upwards, and the highest weights were <pb break="no"

                    case of dementia, and 60 oz. in one of melancholia. No case has as yet been
                    recorded of the weight of the brain in a woman possessing intellectual eminence;
                    but Boyd met with a woman’s brain as high as 55 ’ 25 oz., and many instances of
                    upwards of 50 oz. in women where there was no evidence of high mental endowment.
                    Skae, in a female monomaniac, observed a brain which weighed 61∣ oz.; and of 300
                    females examined in the West Riding Asylum the weight of the brain in 26 cases
                    was 50 oz. or upwards, the highest weights being 56 and 55 oz. in two cases of
                    mania. The size and weight of the brain do not therefore, <hi rend="italic">per
                    se,</hi> give an exact method of estimating the intellectual power of the
                    individual, and a high brain weight and great intellectual capacity are not
                    necessarily correlated with each other. It seems certain, if the human brain,
                    even amongst the most uncultivated peoples, falls below 30 oz., that this low
                    weight is not merely incompatible with intellectual power and activity, but is
                    invariably associated with idiocy or imbecility; so that the human brain has a
                    minimum weight below which intellectual action is impossible. Amongst the more
                    cultivated races the minimum weight-limit of intelligence is, however, in all
                    probability higher than 30 oz. It has been placed by Broca at 32 oz. for the
                    female, and 37 oz. for the male brain; and Thurnam’s numbers are almost the
                    same. To how low a weight the brain in the microcephalous idiot may fall is well
                    shown in a case recorded by Theile, where it weighed only 10 ’ 6 oz., in Gore’s
                    case of 10 oz. 5 grs., and in Marshall’s case, 8 J oz. But instances are not
                    wanting in which the brains of idiots have exceeded even 50 oz. Langdon Down
                    observed the brain of a male idiot aged 22, which weighed 59J oz.; and J. B.
                    Tuke has recently met with a brain of 60 oz. in a male idiot aged 37, the
                    capacity of whose cranium was 110∣ cubic inches. In the West Riding Asylum
                    tables the brain weights in 10 idiots were not less than 34 oz., and in 5 cases
                    exceeded 40 oz. As yet the opportunities of weighing the brain in the coloured
                    races of men have been but scanty. But from a very extensive series of
                    observations made by Barnard Davis, not on the brains themselves, but on the
                    cubic capacities of crania, from which an approximate estimate of the brain
                    weight may be obtained with a fair measure of accuracy, the following facts are
                    derived :—The average weight of the male brain in the African races is 45 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 oz.; of the female brain, 42 ’ 7 oz.: the average
                    weight of the male brain in the Australian races is 42 ’ 8 oz.; of the female
                    brain, 39 ’ 2 oz.: the average weight of the male brain in the Oceanic races,
                    46’5 oz.; of the female brain, 43 oz. The conclusions which may legitimately be
                    drawn from an analysis of Barnard Davis’s observations are as follows :— 1st,
                    That the average brain weight is considerably higher in the civilised European
                    than in the savage races; 2d, That the range of variation is much greater in the
                    former than in the latter; 3d, That there is an absence, almost complete, of
                    specimens heavier than 54 oz. in the exotic races, so that the higher terms of
                    the series are not represented; 4th, That though the male brains are heavier
                    than the female, there is not the same amount of difference in the average brain
                    weight between the two sexes in the uncultivated as in thè cultivated
                    peoples.</p>
                <p>No reliable determinations have as yet been made of the exact proportion, as
                    regards bulk and weight, which the convolutions bear to the corpora striata,
                    optic thalami, and corpora quadrigemina, but data are obtainable of the relative
                    weight of the pons, cerebellum, and medulla to the entire encephalon. Between
                    the ages of 20 and 70 the ratio of weight of the pons, cerebellum, and medulla,
                    to the entire brain, is as 13 to 100, and this relative weight is virtually the
                    same in both sexes.</p>

                    from the under surface or base of the encephalon, and pass outwards through
                    foramina situated in the floor of the cranial cavity. Continental anatomists
                    usually enumerate twelve pairs of cranial nerves; but because in one locality
                    two of these nerves lie together and pass through the same foramen, and in

                    anatomists have restricted the number to nine pairs. These nerves are numbered
                    from before backwards, in the order in which they are seen at the base of the

                <p>These nerves may be arranged in three groups according to the presence or absence
                    of motor and sensory fibres.</p>
                <p>First group.— <hi rend="italic">Sensory</hi> nerves, or nerves of special sense:
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> olfactory, the nerve of smell; <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> optic, nerve of sight; c, auditory, nerve of hearing.</p>
                <p>Second group.— <hi rend="italic">Motor</hi> nerves: <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    oculo-motor, the principal nerve of supply for the muscles of the eyeball; <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> trochlear, the nerve for
                    the superior oblique muscle; c, abducent, the nerve for the external rectus; <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> portio dura, the nerve for the facial muscles of
                    expression; <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> spinal accessory, the nerve which gives a
                    motor root to the pneumogastric, and supplies the sterno-mastoid and trapezius
                    muscles; <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> hypoglossal, the nerve for the muscles of the
                    tongue.</p>
                <p>Third group.— <hi rend="italic">Mixed</hi> nerves: <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    trifacial, distributed to the muscles of mastication, the skin of the face,
                    various mucous membranes, and to the anterior and lateral surfaces of the
                    tongue, where it may play the part of a nerve of the special sense of taste; <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> glosso-pharyngeal, distributed to the mucous membrane of
                    the pharynx, to certain palatopharyngeal muscles, and to the mucous membrane of
                    the back of the tongue, where it acts as a nerve of the special sense of taste;
                    <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the pneumogastric, conjoined with the internal
                    division of the spinal accessory, is distributed to several muscles, mucous
                    membranes, and internal organs.</p>
                <p>The consideration of the 1st group of cranial nerves may appropriately be
                    deferred until the organs of sense, in which they terminate, are described. The
                    anatomy of the motor nerves is as follows :—</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Oculo-motor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">third nerve</hi>
                    springs out of the inner surface of the crus cerebri. When its fibres are traced
                    into the crus, some are seen to pass to the nerve cells of the locus niger,
                    whilst others sink into the corpora quadrigemina, and extend as far as the
                    Sylvian group of large nerve cells. The nerve, after it has emerged from the
                    crus, runs forwards in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, and enters the
                    orbit through the sphenoidal fissure. It supplies the levator palpebrae
                    superioris, the superior, inferior, and internal recti muscles, and the inferior
                    oblique. It contributes the short or motor root to the ciliary ganglion, and
                    through it influences the iris and ciliary muscles within the eyeball. It also
                    communicates with the cavernous· plexus of the sympathetic.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n938/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0938-0881"/>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Trochlearis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fourth,</hi> the
                    smallest cranial nerve, lies at the outer side of the crus cerebri. When traced
                    backwards to its origin it is seen to sink into the valve of Vieussens, where
                    its fibres divide into three roots: one decussates across the valve with a root
                    of the corresponding nerve on the opposite side; another passes backwards to the
                    locus caeruleus; the third sinks into the corpora quadrigemina and reaches the
                    Sylvian group of nerve cells, from which the third nerve also arises. The fourth
                    nerve runs forward in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, enters the orbit
                    through the sphenoidal fissure, and ends in the superior oblique muscle. It also
                    communicates with the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Abducent</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sixth nerve</hi> springs
                    out of the groove between the lower border of the pons and the anterior pyramid
                    of the medulla oblongata. Its roots sink deeply into the pons, and arise from a
                    nucleus of grey matter at the floor of the fourth ventricle, common to it and
                    the portio dura. The sixth nerve runs forward in the inner wall of the cavernous
                    sinus, enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, and ends in the external
                    rectus muscle. It communicates with the carotid plexus of the sympathetic.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Portio</hi><hi rend="italic">dura</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >motor facial</hi> portion of the <hi rend="italic">seventh nerve</hi> springs
                    out of the groove between the lower border of the pons and the restiform body.
                    Its roots sink deeply into the pons, and whilst some of its fibres arise from a
                    grey nucleus, at the floor of the fourth ventricle, common to it and the sixth
                    nerve, others ascend from a nucleus which, according to Meynert, lies just on
                    the outer side of the superior olivary body, and others again decussate across
                    the median raphe of the pons. An accessory portion, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >portio</hi><hi rend="italic">intermedia,</hi> which is said to arise from the
                    lateral columns of the cord, joins the portio dura. The portio dura enters the
                    internal auditory meatus in the petrous-temporal bone along with the auditory
                    nerve; but at the bottom of the meatus it leaves that nerve and enters the
                    aqueduct of Fallopius, along which it is conducted through the bone to emerge at
                    the stylo-mastoid foramen. When in the aqueduct it forms a <hi rend="italic"
                    >hnee-shaped bend,</hi> and expands into a small <hi rend="italic"
                    >ganglion,</hi> which is joined by the <hi rend="italic">great, small,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">external petrosal nerves,</hi> and through the external
                    petrosal it communicates with the sympathetic. The portio dura gives off— <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> a minute branch to the stapedius muscle; <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">chorda</hi><hi rend="italic">tympani,</hi> which,
                    entering the tympanum, passes across that cavity, emerges through the Glaserian
                    fissure, and joins the lingual branch of the fifth nerve, which it accompanies
                    as far as the submaxillary ganglion; it gives a branch to the ganglion, and one
                    to the lingualis muscle. After the portio dura has passed through the
                    stylo-mastoid foramen it gives off— <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">posterior auricular</hi> branch to the occipital belly of the
                    occipitofrontalis and to the retrahens aurem muscle, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >d,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">digastric</hi> branch to the posterior belly of
                    the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles; and then runs forwards through the
                    parotid gland to the face, where it breaks up into numerous (e) <hi
                    rend="italic">facial</hi> branches to supply the facial muscles of expression
                    and the buccinator muscle. The facial is also the secretory nerve for the
                    salivary glands. Through the chorda tympani it influences the secretion of the
                    submaxillary and sublingual glands, and through the connection between its
                    lesser petrosal nerve and the auriculo-temporal in the otic ganglion it
                    influences the parotid gland.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Spinal Accessory</hi> is the lowest division of the <hi
                    rend="italic">eighth nerve.</hi> It springs out of the side of the medulla
                    oblongata, and from the lateral column of the cervical part of the spinal cord
                    as low as the fifth cervical nerve: its roots arise from the intermedio-lateral
                    group of nerve cells in the cord, and from a nucleus of grey matter in the floor
                    of the fourth ventricle. The spinal fibres of origin enter the skull through the
                    foramen magum, join the fibres from the medulla, and leave the cranial cavity
                    through the jugular foramen. This nerve, purely motor in function, is subdivided
                    into two parts, an internal and an external. The <hi rend="italic">external</hi>
                    passes obliquely outwards across the side of the neck, pierces the
                    sterno-mastoid, and ends in the trapezius, both of which muscles it supplies.
                    The <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> joins the pneumogastric nerve, of which it
                    forms the motor or accessory root, and is distributed along with it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hypoglossal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ninth nerve</hi>
                    springs out of the groove between the anterior pyramid and olivary body of the
                    medulla oblongata, in series with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. Its
                    roots pass through the medulla to the floor of the fourth ventricle, to arise
                    from the nerve cells in two nuclei of grey matter situated close to the median
                    furrow. This grey matter is in series with the anterior cornua in the spinal
                    cord. The nerve passes out of the skull through the anterior condyloid foramen,
                    and arches across the side of the neck to the tongue, to end in <hi
                    rend="italic">glossal</hi> branches for the supply of the intrinsic and
                    extrinsic muscles of the tongue. It also gives off— <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">descendens noni</hi> branch, which, after been joined by
                    the <hi rend="italic">communicantes noni</hi> from the cervical plexus, supplies
                    the omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles; <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">thyro-hyoid</hi> branch to the thyro-hyoid
                    muscle; <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">genio-hyoid</hi> branch
                    to the genio-hyoid muscle. It communicates in the neck with the sympathetic,
                    vagus, lingual branch of the fifth, and cervical plexus.</p>
                <p>The group of mixed nerves will now be considered.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Trifacial</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> is the
                    largest cranial nerve. It springs by two distinct roots out of the side of the
                    pons. The smaller or motor root arises from the nerve cells of a nucleus of grey
                    matter situated in the back of the pons, near the floor of the upper part of the
                    fourth ventricle. The larger or sensory root has, according to Meynert, a
                    complex origin— <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> from a nucleus of grey matter in the
                    pons to the outer side of the origin of the motor root; <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> by descending fibres which arise from nerve cells in the substance of
                    the corpora quadrigemina, from the grey matter of the locus caeruleus, and from
                    the longitudinal fibres of the pons; <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> by ascending
                    fibres which apparently arise from the grey tubercle of Rolando; <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> probably by fibres which traverse and embrace the superior
                    peduncle of the cerebellum. As the large sensory root of the fifth lies on the
                    petrous bone it expands into the Gasserian ganglion, which resembles in
                    structure the ganglion on the posterior root of a spinal nerve. From this
                    ganglion three large branches arise, named respectively the 1st, 2d, and 3d
                    divisions of the ganglion.</p>
                <p>The lsi or <hi rend="italic">Ophthalmic division</hi> is the upper sensory nerve
                    of the face, and divides into three branches, which pass out of the cranial
                    cavity through the sphenoidal fissure. By its <hi rend="italic">lachrymal</hi>
                    branch it supplies the lachrymal gland, and the outer part of the skin and
                    conjunctiva of the upper eyelid; by its <hi rend="italic">frontal</hi> branch,
                    the inner part of the skin and conjunctiva of the upper lid, and the skin of the
                    forehead; by its <hi rend="italic">oculo-nascd</hi> branch, it gives <hi
                    rend="italic">long ciliary</hi> nerves to the eyeball, and a nasal nerve to the
                    mucous membrane of the nose, and the skin of the side of the nose. From the
                    oculo-nasal nerve arises the long or sensory root of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ciliary ganglion,</hi> which lies in the cavity of the orbit, and which
                    receives also a motor root from the third nerve, and a root from the
                    sympathetic. This ganglion gives origin to the <hi rend="italic">short

                <p>The 2cZ or <hi rend="italic">Superior Maxillary division</hi> is the sensory

                    the floor of the orbit, from which it emerges on the face through the
                    infra-orbital foramen as the <hi rend="italic">infra-orbital</hi> nerve. It
                    gives off a small <hi rend="italic">orbital</hi> branch to a small part of the

                    form the sensory root of the <hi rend="italic">spheno-palatine</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Meckel's</hi> ganglion. This ganglion receives a motor root
                    through the great petrosal nerve from the knee-shaped bend of the portio dura,
                    and a sympathetic root from the carotid plexus, which runs along with the great
                    petrosal, and forms with it the <hi rend="italic">vidian</hi> nerve. The
                    ganglion gives origin to—α,an <hi rend="italic">orbital</hi> branch, which
                    supplies a layer of non-striped muscular fibres, described by H. Müller and
                    Turner as developed in connection with the periosteum of the orbit, where it
                    covers the spheno-maxillary fissure; <hi rend="italic">b, upper nasal</hi> and

                <p>The 3&lt;Z or <hi rend="italic">Inferior Maxillary division</hi> passes out of
                    the skull through the foramen ovale, and as it does so is joined by the motor
                    root of the 5th. By the junction a mixed nerve is formed, which is the sensory
                    nerve for the lower part of the face, and the skin of the temple, and the motor
                    nerve for the muscles of mastication. Immediately after passing through the
                    foramen this nerve divides into a small and large division, in each of which
                    motor and sensory fibres are found. The <hi rend="italic">small division</hi>
                    supplies <hi rend="italic">motor masticatory</hi> branches to the masseter,
                    temporal, external, and internal pterygoid muscles; but further it gives off a
                    <hi rend="italic">long buccal</hi> branch, which, though often described as the
                    motor nerve for the buccinator muscle, is really a sensory nerve for the skin
                    and mucous membrane of the cheek. The sensory nature of this nerve is proved,
                    not only by physiological and pathological experiments, but by tracing its
                    fibres through the buccinator muscle to the mucous membrane. Turner has also
                    recorded two cases in which the long buccal nerve arose as a branch of the
                    sensory superior maxillary nerve. The <hi rend="italic">large division</hi>
                    separates into three branches— <hi rend="italic">a, auriculo-temporal,</hi>
                    which ascends to supply the parotid gland, the skin of the auricle, external
                    meatus, and temple, and the temporo-maxillary joint; <hi rend="italic">b,
                    inferior dental,</hi> which enters the dental canal in the lower jaw, and
                    supplies the lower set of teeth and the skin and mucous membrane of the lower
                    lip; it also gives off a <hi rend="italic">mylo-hyoid</hi> branch to the
                    mylo-hyoid and anterior belly of the digastric muscle; c, <hi rend="italic"
                    >lingual</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gustatory,</hi> which runs forward along the
                    side of the tongue to end in the filiform and fungiform papillae of its mucous
                    membrane. The lingual branches are sensory nerves of touch, though some
                    physiologists believe that they are also nerves of taste. Connected with the
                    branches of the inferior maxillary division are two small ganglia, which, like
                    the ciliary and spheno-palatine ganglia, are of a greyish colour, contain nerve
                    cells, and receive roots from motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves. The <hi
                    rend="italic">submaxillary ganglion</hi> lies under cover of the mylo-hyoid
                    muscle, and receives a root from the motor chorda tympani nerve, a root from the
                    sensory lingual, and a sympathetic root. It gives branches to the sub-maxillary
                    and sublingual salivary glands. The <hi rend="italic">otic ganglion</hi> lies
                    close to the Eustachian tube, and receives a root from the muscular nerve to the
                    internal pterygoid, a root from the sensory auriculo-temporal, and a sympathetic
                    root. It also receives the <hi rend="italic">small petrosal</hi> nerve, by which
                    it is connected to the knee-shaped bend of the portio dura and to the
                    glosso-pharyngeal nerve. It supplies the tensor tympani and tensor palati
                    muscles. The branches of the three divisions of the fifth cranial nerve, which
                    Dass to the ekin of the temple, forehead, and face, freely communicate with the
                    branches of the portio dura, which supply the muscles situated in those
                    regions.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Glosso-pharyngeal</hi> or uppermost division of the <hi
                    rend="italic">eighth</hi> nerve springs out of the side of the medulla oblongata
                    between the olivary and restiform bodies; its roots arise from two small masses
                    or nuclei of grey matter in the floor of the 4th ventricle. The nerve passes out
                    of the skull through the jugular foramen, where it possesses two small <hi
                    rend="italic">ganglia,</hi> named <hi rend="italic">jugular</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">petrous.</hi> It then passes across the side of the neck and gives
                    off <hi rend="italic">carotid</hi> branches, which run along the internal
                    carotid artery; <hi rend="italic">pharyngeal</hi> branches to the mucous
                    membrane of the pharynx; <hi rend="italic">tonsil-itic</hi> branches to the
                    tonsil and soft palate; <hi rend="italic">glossal</hi> branches to the base of
                    the tongue and the circumvallate papillae, which branches are unquestionably
                    nerves of the special sense of taste; <hi rend="italic">muscular</hi> branches
                    to the stylopharyngeus and perhaps the constrictor muscles. Through the jugular
                    and petrous ganglia the nerve communicates with the vagus and sympathetic. The
                    petrous ganglion gives off the <hi rend="italic">tympanic</hi> branch or <hi
                    rend="italic">nerve of Jacobson,</hi> which enters the tympanic cavity, supplies
                    its mucous membrane, and gives off three communicating branches—one to the
                    sympathetic; a second to the great petrosal, and through it to the knee-shaped
                    bend of the facial; a third to the small petrosal, and through it to the otic
                    ganglion.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pneumogastric</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Vagus</hi> is the
                    middle subdivision of the <hi rend="italic">eighth</hi> cranial nerve. It
                    springs out of the side of the medulla oblongata, between the olivary and
                    restiform bodies; its roots arise from a nucleus of grey matter in the floor of
                    the 4th ventricle, which nucleus, along with those for the glosso-pharyngeal
                    nerve, is in series with the posterior cornu of grey matter in the spinal cord.
                    It goes through the jugular foramen, is joined by the inner division of the
                    spinal accessory which is its motor root, then passes down the side of the neck,
                    enters the thorax, reaches the outer wall of the oesophagus, accompanies that
                    tube through the diaphragm, and terminates in the wall of the stomach. The left
                    nerve lies on a plane anterior to the right: it crosses in front of the arch of
                    the aorta, and is distributed to the anterior wall of the stomach, whilst the
                    right nerve supplies the posterior wall. Each nerve possesses high in the neck
                    two enlargements, named <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lower
                    ganglia.</hi> The branches of the vagus are numerous and important. The upper
                    ganglion gives origin to the <hi rend="italic">auricular</hi> branch, which
                    traversing a small canal in the petrous temporal bone, is distributed to the
                    skin of the back of the auricle. The lower ganglion gives origin to— <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">pharyngeal</hi> branch, which forms
                    a plexus with the glosso-pharyngeal and sympathetic nerves, from which the
                    muscles of the pharynx are supplied; <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the <hi

                    >external</hi> branch to supply the crico-thyroid muscle, and an <hi
                    rend="italic">internal,</hi> which pierces the thyro-hyoid membrane, and
                    supplies the mucous lining of the larynx and the mucous covering of the
                    epiglottis. The trunk of the nerve gives origin to— <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">recurrent laryngeal</hi> branch, which on the right side
                    turns round the subclavian artery, and on the left round the arch of the aorta,
                    and ascends to the larynx to supply its intrinsic muscles except the
                    crico-thyroid; <hi rend="italic">b, cardiac</hi> branches, which arise from the
                    nerve partly in the neck and partly in the chest, and. join the great cardiac

                    in the chest, pass into the substance of the lungs, and form along with the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Descriptive Anatomy of the Sympathetic Nervous
                    System.</hi></p>
                <p>The Sympathetic Nervous System consists of a pair of ∣ gangliated cords, situated
                    one on each side of the spinal column; of three great gangliated prevertebral
                    plexuses situated in the thoracic and abdominal cavities <hi rend="italic">;
                    of</hi> numerous smaller ganglia lying more especially in relation with the
                    thoracic and abdominal viscera; of multitudes of fine distributory nerves.</p>
                <p>Each <hi rend="italic">Gangliated Cord</hi> of the sympathetic extends along the
                    side of the spine from the base of the skull to the coccyx. In the neck it lies
                    in front of the transverse processes of the vertebrae; in the thorax, in front
                    of the heads of the ribs; in the abdomen, on the sides of the vertebral bodies;
                    and as it descends in front of the sacrum it approaches its fellow, so that in
                    front of the coccyx the two are united in a single ganglion, the <hi
                    rend="italic">ganglion</hi><hi rend="italic">impar</hi> (Fig. 66, c). Each cord
                    consists of a number of ganglia united into a continuous cord by intermediate
                    nerves. As a rule, the ganglia equal in number the vertebrae of the region.
                    Thus, in the sacral region there are five ganglia, in the lumbar five, and in
                    the thorax twelve; but in the neck there are only three, named superior, middle,
                    and inferior; of these the superior is very large, and represents without doubt
                    several smaller ganglia. From the superior cervical ganglion the cord is
                    prolonged upwards by an <hi rend="italic">ascending</hi> or cranial offshoot
                    through the carotid canal into the cranial cavity, and forms a plexus around the
                    internal carotid artery, both in the carotid canal, named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >carotid plexus,</hi> and in the inner wall of the cavernous sinus, named the
                    <hi rend="italic">cavernous plexus.</hi> Through branches derived either
                    directly or indirectly from these plexuses the sympathetic roots for the ciliary
                    and spheno-palatine ganglia, described in connection with the fifth nerve, are
                    derived.</p>
                <p>From the gangliated cord and its ascending or cranial prolongation a
                    communicating and a distributory series of branches are derived.</p>
                <p>By the <hi rend="italic">Communicating</hi> branches this portion of the
                    sympathetic is connected with most of the cranial and with the anterior
                    divisions of all the spinal nerves, so as to bring the cerebro-spinal and
                    sympathetic systems into close anatomical and physiological relation with each
                    other. It is important also to observe that each communicating branch contains
                    not only non-medullated nerve fibres from the sympathetic system to the
                    cerebro-spinal nerves, but medullated fibres from the cerebro-spinal to the
                    sympathetic, so that a double interchange takes place between the two systems.
                    The cranial prolongation of the sympathetic and the superior cervical ganglion
                    communicate with the 3d and 4th nerves, the Gasserian ganglion of the 5th, the
                    6th, the portio dura of the 7th, the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumogastric of the
                    8th, and the 9th.cranial nerves, and with the anterior divisions of the four
                    upper cervical spinal nerves. The middle cervical ganglion communicates with the
                    5th and 6th cervical nerves, the inferior cervical ganglion with the 7th and 8th
                    cervical nerves, the twelve thoracic ganglia with the series of intercostal
                    nerves, the five lumbar ganglia with the series of lumbar spinal nerves, the
                    sacral and coccygeal ganglia with the sacral nerves and the coccygeal nerve.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Distributory</hi> branches of the gangliated cord are as
                    follows :—α, <hi rend="italic">Pharyngeal</hi> branchée from the superior
                    cervical ganglion, which join the pharyngeal branches of the glossopharyngeal
                    and pneumogastric nerves, to form the <hi rend="italic">pharyngeal plexus,</hi>
                    which supplies the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx, δ, <hi
                    rend="italic">Articular</hi> branches from the upper thoracic and the lumbar

                    >c, Pulmonary</hi> branches from the 3d or 4th thoracic ganglia, which join the

                    which supply the muscular coat of the arteries: those which arise from the
                    cranial prolongation of the superior cervical ganglion supply the internal
                    carotid artery and its branches to the brain and eyeball: those which arise from
                    the superior cervical ganglia itself supply the external carotid artery and its
                    branches; from the branch accompanying the facial artery the submaxilliary
                    ganglion derives its sympathetic root; from that accompanying the middle
                    meningeal artery the otic ganglion derives its sympathetic root: the vaso-motor
                    nerves which arise from the middle cervical ganglion supply the inferior thyroid
                    artery, and pass to the thyroid gland: the vaso-motor branches of the inferior
                    cervical ganglion supply the vertebral and basilar arteries and their several
                    branches, which pass to the spinal cord and the hinder par⅛ of the encephalon.
                    Vaso-motor nerves also arise from the thoracic ganglia, which pass to the
                    thoracic aorta, from the lumbar ganglia to the abdominal aorta, and from the
                    sacral ganglia to the middle sacral artery; the ganglion impar gives branches to

                    developed in connection with the end of the middle sacral artery; a body of

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Prevertebral Cardiac plexus</hi> (Pl. XVII. c) is situated
                    at the base of the heart, and is divided into a <hi rend="italic"
                    >superficial</hi> part, which lies in the concavity of the arch of the aorta,
                    and a <hi rend="italic">deep</hi> part between the aorta and trachea. It
                    receives the cardiac branches of the pneumogastric and the cervical ganglia of
                    the sympathetic. It contains collections of nerve cells and a dense plexiform
                    arrangement of nerve fibres. It gives off branches to the heart, which wind
                    around the surface of that organ and penetrate its muscular substance: on these
                    branches minute ganglia are found which regulate its rhythmical movements.
                    Through these branches and the cardiac plexus the heart is brought into
                    connection with both the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems of nerves. The
                    sympathetic apparently regulates its contraction, for when this nerve is
                    stimulated the action of the heart is accelerated. The pneumogastric again
                    exercises an inhibitory or restraining influence on the contractions of the
                    organ, for when this nerve is irritated the activity of contraction is
                    diminished, but when divided it is greatly increased. The cardiac plexus also
                    sends offsets to the <hi rend="italic">anterior</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior pulmonary plexuses</hi> for the supply of nerves to the lungs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Prevertebral Solar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Epigastric
                    plexus</hi> is situated at the pit of the stomach around the coeliac axis, a
                    branch of the abdominal aorta. It receives the great and small splanchnic nerves
                    from the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic, and some of the terminal branches
                    of the pneumogastric nerve. It contains large collections of nerve cells, which
                    form the two <hi rend="italic">semilunar ganglia,</hi> and a dense plexiform
                    arrangement of nerve fibres. It gives origin, either directly or indirectly, to
                    numerous plexiform branches, which accompany, and are named after, the abdominal
                    aorta and its various branches given off to the walls and viscera of the abdomen
                    proper. In this manner, not only <pb break="no"

                    viscera receive their vaso-motor nerves, but the muscular and mucous coats of
                    the stomach, intestines, gall bladder, bile ducts, ureters, and seminal ducts,
                    and the glandular structures of the liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, and
                    supra-renal capsules. It is important also to observe that these plexuses of
                    distribution not unfrequently contain small ganglia, and the branches which
                    supply the muscular coat of the stomach and intestines have minute microscopic
                    ganglia, with stellate nerve cells lying amidst them. The distribution of the
                    pneumogastric nerve to the stomach, and its connection with the solar plexus,
                    enables that nerve to stimulate its peristaltic contraction, and, according to
                    some experimenters, that of the small intestine also; but the precise action of
                    the sympathetic on these organs is still a disputed question.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Prevertebral Hypogastric plexus</hi> is situated in front
                    of the last lumbar vertebra. It receives branches from the lumbar ganglia of the
                    sympathetic, and from the plexus surrounding the abdominal aorta. It divides
                    into two parts, which lie one on each side of the rectum, and are called the <hi
                    rend="italic">pelvic plexuses;</hi> these plexuses are joined by branches from
                    the sacral ganglia of the sympathetic, and from the 3d and 4th sacral spinal
                    nerves, and contain small gangliform collections of nerve cells. From the pelvic
                    plexuses numerous plexiform nerves arise, which accompany the internal iliac
                    artery and its branches to the walls and viscera of the pelvis, and are named
                    after them. These nerves not only supply the vaso-motor nerves for these
                    blood-vessels, but also the muscular coat and mucous membrane of the bladder,
                    rectum, and urethra, besides the prostate gland in the male, and the uterus and
                    vagina, and in part the ovary, in the female; in connection with their
                    distribution to these viscera, minute ganglia are found lying amidst the nerves,
                    the nerve cells in which act undoubtedly as centres of reinforcement for the
                    origin of additional, nerve fibres.</p>
                <p>From the distribution of the branches of the gangliated cord of the sympathetic,
                    and of the gangliated prevertebral plexuses, it will be seen that this nerve is
                    especially related to the blood-vessels and to the viscera. contained within the
                    great cavities of the body. As the cerebro-spinal system is engaged in the
                    supply of nerves to the voluntary muscles, the sympathetic is the medium of
                    supply for the involuntary muscular apparatus, both in the coats of the vessels
                    and in the walls of the hollow viscera. But though the vaso-motor nerves branch
                    from the sympathetic ganglia, it must not be supposed that they have no
                    connection with the cerebro-spinal system. The communicating branches between
                    the sympathetic ganglia and the anterior divisions of the spinal nerves
                    establish a connection between them and the cerebro-spinal nervous axis. By
                    recent experiments, the tract of transmission of the vasomotor fibres has been
                    traced along with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves, through the lateral
                    columns of the cord to the medulla oblongata, in which the vaso-motor nerve
                    centre lies a little to one side of the mesial plane, above the calamus
                    scriptorius. In the distribution of the sympathetic to the glandular viscera,
                    not only is it important to attend to their terminations in the muscular coat of
                    the blood-vessels of the glands, but the termination of the nerves in connection
                    with the secreting cells themselves must be taken into consideration. The
                    communications between the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems, not only
                    through the spinal nerves, but also through the pneumogastric, are to be kept in
                    mind in connection with the effects produced by varying mental conditions on the
                    secretions of the glands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Organs of Sense.</hi></p>
                <p>The organs of sense are the organs through the interme diation of which the mind
                    becomes cognisant of the appearance and properties of the various objects in the
                    external world. These organs are severally named nose, eye, ear, tongue, and
                    skin. For the excitation and perception of a sensation three sets of structures
                    are necessary: <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> a peripheral end-organ; δ, a sensory
                    nerve; c, a central organ. The peripheral end-organ is the part of the apparatus
                    to which the stimulus necessary for the production of the sensation is applied.
                    This stimulus causes nervous impulses to be propagated from the end-organ along
                    the fibres of the sensory nerve to the central organ, in which that nerve
                    terminates at its central extremity. These nervous impulses occasion molecular
                    changes in the nerve cells of the brain, and the mind becomes conscious of a
                    sensation. The shape and construction of each organ of sense is adapted to the
                    application of the stimulus required for the production of the particular
                    sensation to which the organ is subservient. Each organ of sense possesses its
                    own characteristic form of end-organ. The touch corpuscles of the skin, the end
                    bulbs found in several mucous membranes, and the Pacinian corpuscles, are the
                    end-organs occurring in their several localities; they have the peripheral ends
                    of the sensory nerves terminating in their substance, and the axial cylinder of
                    the nerve fibre ends in their interior. The rods and cones of the retina, the
                    rods of Corti in the cochlea, the olfactory cells of the nose, and the gustatory
                    bodies in the tongue, are the end-organs belonging to their several organs of
                    sense; the sensory nerve fibres which terminate in relation with them have not
                    yet, however, been traced into actual continuity with their substance. A
                    stimulus, whatever may be its nature, applied to any organ of sense can excite
                    only that kind of sensation for the production of which the organ is
                    subservient. Thus a stimulus applied to the eye, whether it be the natural
                    stimulus of the waves of light, the mechanical stimulus of a blow, or an
                    electric stimulus, can only excite the sensation of light. Stimuli applied to
                    the ear can only excite the sensation of sound, and in like manner with the
                    other senses. In studying the anatomy of the organs of sense the arrangement of
                    numerous accessory structures, which assist either in conducting stimuli or in
                    modifiying their effects, the arrangement and structure of the peripheral
                    end-organs, and the origin, course, and distribution of the sensory nerves, will
                    have to be considered.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Nose</hi> or organ of smell is a large cavity situated
                    in the face, between the orbits, above the mouth, and below the cribriform plate
                    of the ethmoid bone. It communicates by the <hi rend="italic">anterior
                    nares,</hi> or nostrils, with the external atmosphere, by <hi rend="italic">the
                    posterior nares</hi> with the pharynx, and through it with the larynx, trachea,
                    and lungs. It is the proper entrance to the respiratory passage, is accessory to
                    the production of the voice, aids in the sense of taste, and forms one of the
                    most important features of the face. It is subdivided into a right and a left
                    chamber by a vertical mesial partition, the <hi rend="italic">septum nasi,</hi>
                    so that the nose is a double organ in the same sense as the eyes or ears are
                    double. The walls of the cavity of the nose are formed partly of bone and partly
                    of cartilage. The osseous walls are referred to on page 826. The cartilages form
                    the point, the alae, and a part of the septum nasi. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >mesial</hi> or <hi rend="italic">septal cartilage</hi> is triangular in shape,
                    and fits into the interval between the vomer, the mesial plate of the ethmoid,
                    and the nasal spine of the superior maxilla. Anteriorly and inferiorly its
                    border is free, projects on to the face, and forms the <hi rend="italic"
                    >columna</hi> of the nose. The <hi rend="italic">lateral cartilages</hi> form

                    lateral cartilage, and behind to the anterior edge of the superior maxilla. In
                    this membrane two to five small cartilaginous plates, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">epactal cartilages,</hi> are often found imbedded. The skin of the
                    nose which covers the lower lateral cartilages contains numerous sebaceous
                    follicles, which open by comparatively large orifices on the surface. It is
                    closely connected to these cartilages, and to the muscles of the alae. The lower
                    lateral cartilage forms the wall of the <hi rend="italic">vestibule</hi> or
                    entrance to the nasal chamber, and the vestibule is lined by a prolongation of
                    the integument, which is studded with numerous short hairs or <hi rend="italic"
                    >vibrissae.</hi> Each nasal chamber is lined by a mucous membrane called the <hi
                    rend="italic">pituitary</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Schneiderian.</hi> This
                    membrane is prolonged into the meatuses and the air sinuses which open into
                    them; posteriorly it is continuous with the mucous lining of the pharynx, and
                    anteriorly it blends with the cutaneous lining of the vestibule. The pituitary
                    membrane is thick and soft, and diminishes the size of the meatuses and the
                    openings of the air sinuses as seen in the skeleton. The mucous membrane is
                    divided into a respiratory and an olfactory region. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >respiratory</hi><hi rend="italic">region</hi> corresponds to the floor of the
                    nose, to the inferior turbinated bone, and to the lower third of the nasal
                    septum. It is covered by a ciliated columnar epithelium, and contains numerous
                    racemose glande for the secretion of mucus or <hi rend="italic">pituita.</hi> It
                    is also vascular, and the veins which ramify in it have a plexiform arrangement.
                    The mucous lining of the air sinuses is also ciliated, but almost devoid of
                    glands, except in the antrum, in which region the glands sometimes dilate into
                    cystic tumours.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">olfactory region</hi> is the seat of distribution of the
                    olfactory nerve and of its peripheral end-organs. It corresponds to the roof of
                    the nose, to the superior and middle turbinals, and the upper g rds of the
                    septum. The mucous membrane is thick, soft, easily destroyed, of a yellowish
                    brown colour, and blended with the periosteum. When vertical sections through
                    this membrane are examined microscopically the tubular glands discovered by
                    Bowman may be seen in its vascular connective tissue layer. These glands contain
                    roundish secreting cells with yellowish-brown pigment-stained contents. The
                    epithelium is cylindrical, but not usually ciliated, though patches of ciliated
                    epithelium cells are said to occur in man. Long, slender, and even branched
                    processes proceed from the deeper end of each cell towards or even into the
                    sub-epithelial connective tissue. The colls usually contain pigment granules.
                    Between the epithelium cells the characteristic olfactory cells of Schultze are
                    situated. Each <hi rend="italic">olfactory cell</hi> consists of a globular or
                    fusiform body, from which two long processes arise: one, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >peripheral</hi><hi rend="italic">process,</hi> passes vertically between the
                    adjacent cylindrical epithelium cells to the free surface of the mucous
                    membrane: in amphibia, reptiles, and birds it projects beyond the plane of the
                    epithelium as a simple hair-like structure, or subdivided into several slender
                    “<hi rend="italic">olfactory hairs;”</hi> in fish and mammals, man inclusive, it
                    ends, without forming a hair-like prolongation, on the general plane of the
                    mucous surface. The second or <hi rend="italic">central process</hi> of the
                    olfactory cell extends towards the sub-epithelial connective tissue: it is finer
                    than the peripheral process, and has not unfrequently a varicose appearance like
                    a nerve fibre.</p>
                <p>In the description of the developmentof the brain (p. 864), the origin of the
                    olfactory bulb and peduncle from the hemisphere vesicle was referred to. In the
                    adult brain the <hi rend="italic">olfactory peduncle</hi> is in contact with the
                    under surface of the frontal lobe. It is a white band, which divides in front of
                    the locus perforatus anticus into three so-called roots of the olfactory nerve.
                    The <hi rend="italic">external</hi> or <hi rend="italic">long root</hi> passes
                    outwards across the Sylvian fissure to the gyrus hippocampi, and perhaps also to
                    the insula: a few fibres are continuous with the anterior commissure; but in
                    mammals, where the olfactory peduncle forms a good-sized lobe, it receives many
                    fibres from the commissure. The <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> or <hi

                    plate of the ethmoid, one on each side of the crista galli. The bulb consists
                    both of grey and white matter, and sometimes retains the central cavity lined by
                    a ciliated epithelium. The grey matter contains fusiform and pyramidal nerve
                    cells imbedded in neuroglia (the <hi rend="italic">stratum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gelatinosum</hi> of L. Clarke). Between it and the central cavity is the white
                    matter formed of nerve fibres interspersed with “granules,” similar to those
                    seen in the rust coloured layer of the cerebellum. Between the grey matter and

                    >glomerulosum</hi> ol Meynert, which apparently consists of coils of the

                    ,,</hi> The <hi rend="italic">olfactory nerve fibres</hi> form the first pair of
                    cranial nerves or nerves ol smell; they leave these glomeruli in from 15 to 25
                    bundles, and enter the roof of the nose through the holes in the cribriform
                    plate (Pl. XIX. figs. 1, 2); they lie in grooves in the bones of the olfactory
                    region, and form a network from which bundles of fine non-medullated fibres
                    arise that enter the mucous membrane and run between the glands into the
                    epithelial layer. These nerves have a varicose appearance, and though their
                    terminations have not been precisely ascertained, it is believed that they are
                    connected with the central processes of the olfactory cells, which cells are
                    therefore regarded as the peripheral end-organs of the olfactory nerve fibres.
                    The mucous membrane of the nose also receives branches from the 1st and 2d
                    divisions of the 5th cranial nerve. Their mode of termination in that membrane
                    is not known, but they are associated with the sense of touch, and not with the
                    special sense of smell</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Eyeball,</hi> globe of the eye, or organ of vision, is a
                    complex optical apparatus situated in the cavity of the orbit, imbedded to a
                    large extent in loose fat, and with several muscles attached to it. Its form
                    approximates to the spheroidal, but it actually consists of segments of two
                    spheres, the posterior of which is the larger.</p>
                <p>The eyeball consists of three coats or tunics, which enclose three translucent
                    refracting media. The first or external coat consists of a posterior, white,
                    opaque part, the <hi rend="italic">sclerotic,</hi> which corresponds in its area
                    with the posterior larger segment of the ball, and of an anterior, translucent
                    part, the <hi rend="italic">cornea,</hi> which corresponds in its area with the
                    anterior smaller segment of the eyebalL Piercing the sclerotic coat is the optic
                    nerve, which enters the globe about ∣th inch to the nasal or inner side of its
                    anteroposterior axis. The second or middle coat, or tunica vasculosa, consists
                    of a posterior part or <hi rend="italic">choroid,</hi> the area of which
                    corresponds almost exactly with the sclerotic; <pb break="no"

                    internal or nervous coat is named the <hi rend="italic">retina,</hi> and in it
                    the optic nerve terminates. The enclosed refracting media occupy the axis of the
                    globe, and are named from before backwards the <hi rend="italic">aqueous humour,
                    crystalline lens,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vitreous body.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sclerotic coat,</hi> called from its white appearance the
                    white of the eye, is a firm, unyielding fibrous membrane, which forms the
                    posterior fths of the outer coat of the eyeball. It is thicker behind than in
                    front, and where pierced by the optic nerve it has a cribriform structure, as
                    the bundles of nerve fibres do not pass through one large, but several small
                    openings. The sclerotic consists of the white fibrous form of connective tissue,
                    intermingled with a small proportion of elastic fibres. The bundles of white
                    fibres lie in two directions; some pass in the meridian of the globe from the
                    optic nerve towards the cornea, others lie parallel to its equator. The
                    sclerotic is joined by accessory fibres behind, derived from the perineurium of
                    the optic nerve, where the nerve pierces it; and in front from the tendons of
                    the recti and obliqui muscles, which are inserted into it. In the cetacea the
                    sclerotic possesses extraordinary thickness. In fish and amphibia it consists
                    largely of cartilage, and in birds a ring of bone is developed around its
                    anterior margin. It is the protecting coat of the eyeball.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cornea</hi> forms the translucent anterior ⅜th of the outer
                    coat of the eyeball. It is almost circular in form, and is blended at its
                    circumference with the anterior border of the sclerotic. Its anterior surface is
                    convex, and covered by the conjunctival epithelium. The forward projection of
                    the cornea is always greater in young than in aged persons. Its posterior
                    surface is concave, and bounds the chamber in which the aqueous humour is
                    contained: if the chamber be punctured, and the humour evacuated, the cornea
                    loses its translucency, its tension, and its forward convexity, and becomes
                    flaccid and opaque. It has considerable thickness, and can be readily split up
                    into laminae. When antero-posterior sections are made through it and the
                    epithelium on its anterior and posterior surfaces, four distinct series of
                    structures may be seen, viz., the anterior epithelium, the proper tissue of the
                    cornea, the posterior elastic lamina, and the posterior epi-(endo)-thelium.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">anterior epithelium</hi> of the cornea, often called the
                    conjunctival epithelium, is stratified. The deepest layer, which lies next the
                    cornea, is formed of elongated cells, which lie vertically to the plane of the
                    surface of the cornea. The more superficial layers are squamous cells, often
                    with fluted surfaces and serrated or spinous edges. The intermediate layers are
                    irregular in shape, and often possess, as Cleland pointed out, long digitate
                    processes, which interlock with those of the adjacent cells.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">proper tissue of the cornea</hi> is a modified form of
                    connective tissue. When examined fresh it appears as if perfectly homogeneous,
                    but after a time, and more especially if hardened in alcohol, chloride of gold,
                    and other reagents, it is seen to consist of cells and an intercellular matrix.
                    The cells consist of two kinds,—those which belong to the cornea, and those
                    which have migrated into it. The proper cornea cells or <hi rend="italic">cornea
                    corpuscles</hi> were first seen by Toynbee, and have been carefully studied by
                    numerous subsequent observers. They are large stellate, flattened cells, and lie
                    with their surfaces parallel to the surfaces of the cornea; they possess many
                    branching processes, and the processes of adjacent cells anastomose to form a
                    cell network. They consist of nucleated masses of protoplasm, which Kühne showed
                    to be contractile, and are apparently destitute of a cell wall. In vertical
                    sections through the cornea the corpuscles seem as if shaped like elongated
                    spindles. The <hi rend="italic">migrating cells</hi> of the cornea were first
                    seen by Von Recklinghausen. They resemble white blood corpuscles, and possess
                    active amoeboid movements, so that they can wander through the corneal tissue.
                    In a healthy cornea they have migrated out of the marginal blood-vessels; but in
                    an inflamed cornea, where their number is greatly increased, they are in part
                    white corpuscles derived from the blood, and in part produced by proliferation
                    of the proper cornea corpuscles. The <hi rend="italic">intercellular matrix</hi>
                    of the cornea consists of a laminated substance, the lamellae being arranged
                    parallel to the surfaces of the cornea. The lamellae consist of fasciculi of
                    extremely delicate filaments; immediately under the anterior epithelium the
                    fasciculi decussate with each other, and at the circumference of the cornea the
                    fasciculi run into the connective tissue of the sclerotic. Bowman described a
                    translucent structureless layer or anterior <hi rend="italic">elastic
                    lamina</hi> between the conjunctival epithelium and the cornea proper, but it is
                    doubtful if this layer exists as a constant arrangement. Bowman and other
                    observers have injected tubular spaces in the cornea which are apparently
                    situated between the lamellae. The exact nature of these spaces is somewhat
                    doubtful, but Thin believes them to be lymph-vessels traversing its sub stance,
                    for he has seen an endothelial lining similar to the endothelial cells of the
                    lymphatics. It is probable that these spaces serve as the channels for the
                    migrating corpuscles to wander through. Thin also describes the proper cornea
                    corpuscles as lying in lacunae, which communicate with each other and with the
                    lymph-vessels. The <hi rend="italic">posterior elastic lamina</hi> forms a
                    distinct translucent, structureless layer adherent to the back of the proper
                    tissue of the cornea, from which it may be stripped off without much difficulty.
                    When torn across, the edges curl inwards towards the corneal tissue. It is from
                    ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> √ <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi>- <hi
                    rend="subscript"> δ</hi> ∙ to th inch thick, and resists the action of various
                    reagents. This lamina thins off at its circumference and splits into fibres,
                    which become continuous with the pectinate ligament of the iris.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">posterior epithelium</hi> of the cornea, also called the
                    endothelium of the aqueous humour, forms a single layer of polygonal cells on
                    the back of the posterior elastic lamina. It is continuous with the endotheiιal
                    covering of the pectinate ligament and of the anterior surface of the iris.</p>
                <p>The cornea is not in the adult traversed by blood-vessels, though in the foetus a
                    layer of capillaries lies near its anterior surface. In the adult, however, the
                    margin of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n946/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0946-0887"/> the cornea is penetrated by a zone of capillary
                    loops derived from the arteries of the conjunctiva; these loops, according to
                    Lightbody, are invested by perivascular lymph spaces. The venous canal of
                    Schlemm runs round the circumference of the cornea, at the junction of its
                    deeper layers with the sclerotic. Leber states that it is not a simple canal,
                    but a plexiform arrangement of veins. The nerves of the cornea first seen by
                    Schlemm have been carefully examined by recent observers. They arise from the
                    ciliary nerves, and enter the margin of the cornea in from twenty to forty
                    fasciculi, which run from the circumference to the centre and to the anterior
                    surface of the cornea, and give off numerous branches. The nerve fibres soon
                    lose their medullary sheath, and branch; adjacent branches then communicate, and
                    form plexuses which possess nuclei at the points of intersection of the nerves.
                    From these plexuses delicate branches again arise, some of which penetrate
                    between the cells of the anterior epithelium, whilst others end in the proper
                    tissue of the cornea. Kühne stated that the terminal fibres ended in the cornea
                    corpuscles, but this statement has not been confirmed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Choroid coat</hi> forms the largest portion of the middle
                    coat of the eyeball. It lies immediately internal to the sclerotic, and extends
                    as far forward as the corpus ciliare, or annulus albidus, where it forms the
                    ciliary processes; it is pierced posteriorly by the optic nerve. It has a deep
                    black colour, from the numerous pigment cells it contains, and is abundantly
                    provided with blood-vessels and nerves. The <hi rend="italic">Corpus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ciliare,</hi> or annulus albidus, is a greyish-white ring which
                    surrounds the anterior border of the choroid close to the junction of the
                    sclerotic and cornea. It consists of two portions—an external, the <hi
                    rend="italic">ciliary muscle,</hi> which lies next the sclerotic, and an
                    internal, the <hi rend="italic">ciliary processes</hi> (Plate XIX. fig. 4).
                    These processes, about 80 in number, are folds, separated from each other by
                    furrows which extend forwards in the meridional direction as far as the iris,
                    and form collectively a zone-like plated frill around the circumference of the
                    iris. On the one hand, they are continuous with the vasculo-pigmentary
                    structures of the choroid; on the other, with the vasculo-pigmentary structures
                    of the iris.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Iris</hi> is a circular, flattened disc-shaped diaphragm,
                    situated behind the cornea, in front of the crystalline lens, and bathed by the
                    aqueous humour. By its circumference or ciliary border the iris is not only
                    continuous with the ciliary processes, ∣ but is connected by fibres, termed <hi
                    rend="italic">ligamentum pectinatum,</hi> with the posterior elastic lamina of
                    the cornea. The iris is the structure which gives the characteristic colour to
                    the eye—blue, grey, brown, hazel, as the case may be. It is perforated at, or
                    immediately to the inner side of, its centre by a circular aperture, the <hi
                    rend="italic">pupil,</hi> the size of which is regulated by the contraction or
                    relaxation of the muscular tissue of the iris.</p>
                <p>The structure of the several divisions of the middle coat will now be considered.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Choroid coat</hi> has its inner or anterior surface formed
                    by a distinct <hi rend="italic">pigmentary layer</hi> of hexagonal pigment cells
                    (Fig. 43). In the eyes of Albinos, though the cells are present, they contain no
                    pigment. In many mammals also, the pigment is absent from the inner surface, so
                    that the choroid possesses a beautiful iridescent lustre, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tapetum</hi><hi rend="italic">luendum.</hi> In ruminant animals and in the
                    horse the iridescence is due to the reflection of the light by the bundles of
                    the connective tissue stroma, but in cats from polygonal nucleated cells, which
                    Schultze states contain double refracting crystals. Next the inner pigmentary
                    layer is the <hi rend="italic">lamina</hi><hi rend="italic">vitrea,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">elastic layer</hi> of Kölliker. It forms a translucent membrane,
                    described by some as structureless, but by Kölliker as faintly fibrous, which is
                    intimately connected with the stroma of the choroid. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >stroma</hi> consists of a plexiform arrangement of bundles of connective
                    tissue, in the intervals between which numerous stellate pigment cells are
                    situated, which give to the entire thickness of the choroid its black
                    appearance. This stroma connects the outer surface of the choroid with the inner
                    surface of the sclerotic, and forms the <hi rend="italic">lamina</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fusca.</hi> Ramifying in the stroma are the blood-vessels and
                    nerves. The vessels of the choroid are arranged in two layers. Next the lamina
                    vitrea is a plexiform capillary layer, the meshes of which are so minute, and
                    the vessels so compacted together, as to give the appearance of avascular
                    membrane, long known as the <hi rend="italic">membrana</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ruyschiana.</hi> The capillaries radiate like minute stars from the terminal
                    twigs of the choroidal arteries and veins. The choroidal arteries and veins form
                    a layer external to the capillaries, <hi rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> next the
                    lamina fusca. The arteries are the short posterior ciliary branches of the
                    ophthalmic artery, which pierce the sclerotic close to the entrance of the optic
                    nerve, and, running forwards in a tor* tuous manner, divide dichotomously before
                    ending in the capillaries. The veins of the choroid are arranged in a series of
                    remarkable whorls, named the <hi rend="italic">venae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vorticosae,</hi> which receive the blood not only from the capillaries of the
                    choroid proper, but from those of the iris and ciliary body; they discharge
                    their blood by means of from 4 to 6 veins into the ophthalmic vein. The <hi
                    rend="italic">ciliary muscle</hi> is the greyish white structure which forms the
                    outer part of the ciliary body. It was at one time called the ciliary ligament,
                    but its muscular nature was discovered almost simultaneously by Bowman and
                    Brücke. It consists of smooth involuntary muscle, the fibres of which are
                    arranged in two layers. The outer and thicker part of the muscle consists of
                    fasciculi, which arise close to the canal of Schlemm, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> opposite the junction of the sclerotic and cornea, and radiate from
                    before backwards in the meridian of the eyeball, between the ciliary processes
                    and the sclerotic. The inner part of the muscle forms a ring-like arrangement of
                    fasciculi close to the circumference of the iris, and is often called the
                    annular muscle of Müller. Iwanoff has shown that in long-sighted persons
                    (hypermetropic) the annular muscle is strongly developed; whilst in
                    short-sighted (myopic) eyes its fasciculi are very feeble. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ciliary Processes</hi> have on their inner surface a black pigmentary layer of
                    cells continuous with that of the choroid. The vitreous layer is .also present,
                    but according to H. Müller is no longer smooth but reticulated. The stroma does
                    not contain so large a proportion of stellate pigment cells as in the choroid.
                    The arteries have been carefully studied by Leber; they are the long posterior
                    ciliary branches of the ophthalmic, and the anterior ciliary branches of the
                    muscular branches of the ophthalmic. They pierce the sclerotic, run forwards,
                    and at the anterior border of the ciliary muscle form by their anastomoses the
                    <hi rend="italic">circulus</hi><hi rend="italic">arteriosus,</hi> which gives
                    origin to. the arteries for the ciliary processes and the iris. The arteries for
                    the ciliary processes are short, and divide into tortuous branches, which
                    frequently anastomose, and form highly complex vascular plexuses, from which
                    arise veins that join the vense vorticosae. Before the long ciliary arteries
                    contribute to the formation of the arterial circle they send branches to the
                    ciliary muscle, and recurrent branches to the anterior part of the proper
                    choroid coat.</p>
                <p>The iris has its anterior surface covered by a layer of cells continuous with the
                    endothelium of the aqueous humour. This layer is continuous at the pupillary
                    border with a thick layer of cells filled with black pigment granules, the <hi
                    rend="italic">uvea,</hi> which covers the posterior surface of the iris, and is
                    continuous at its ciliary border with the pigmentary layer of the ciliary
                    processes. The connective tissue stroma of the iris also contains stellate
                    pigment cells. The variations in colour of the iris in different eyes depends
                    upon the distribution and amount of the pigment in the uvea and the <pb

                    filled with dark pigment granules; whilst in light-coloured eyes the εtellate
                    cells of the stroma are either devoid of pigment or only faintly coloured. The
                    iris contains numerous fasciculi of involuntary or non-striped muscular fibre
                    arranged in two directions. Circularly arranged fibres surround the aperture of
                    the pupil, and form the sphincter muscle, by the contraction of which the size
                    of the pupil is diminished. Smooth muscular fibres also radiate from the
                    pupillary to the ciliary border of the iris and form the dilatator muscle. The
                    muscular nature of these fibres in the human iris was long disputed, but was
                    satisfactorily demonstrated in 1852 by Lister. Jeropheef has also described
                    circular fasciculi surrounding the ciliary border. In birds and reptiles the
                    muscular tissue of the iris consists of transversely striped fibres. The
                    arteries of the iris arise from the circulus arteriosus, and run radially
                    forwards towards the pupil, where they anastomose and form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >circulus</hi><hi rend="italic">iridis minor.</hi> They possess relatively thick
                    external and muscular coats. The capillaries form a plexus not so compact as
                    that of the choroid coat. The veins of the iris end in the venae vorticosae. In
                    the foetus the pupil is closed in by a delicate membrane, <hi rend="italic"
                    >membrana pupillaris,</hi> into which the bloodvessels of the iris are
                    prolonged. This membrane disappears by absorption during the later months of
                    embryo life. The nerves of the middle coat of the eyeball are the long ciliary
                    branches of the ophthalmic division of the 5th and the short ciliary branches of
                    the ciliary ganglion (Pl. XIX. fig. 7, ~). They pierce the sclerotic near the
                    optic nerve, and run forward in the lamina fusca of the choroid. They give off
                    branches to the choroid which form in it a plexus in which H. Muller found nerve
                    cells. From this plexus delicate branches pass to the muscular coat of the
                    choroidal arteries. The ciliary nerves then enter the ciliary muscle, and form
                    plexuses with interspersed nerve cells, from which branches pass to the muscular
                    fibres. Other branches of the ciliary nerves enter the iris, and form plexuses,
                    from which branches proceed to the muscular tissue.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Retina</hi> is the delicate nervous coat of the eyeball
                    which lies immediately internal to the choroid, and extends from the place of
                    entrance of the optic nerve as far forward as the ciliary processes, where it
                    forms a jagged border, the <hi rend="italic">ora</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    to display it in a dissection without injury. Its inner or anterior surface,
                    concave forwards, is moulded on the vitreous body, and presents the following
                    appearances :—Almost exactly in the anteroposterior axis of the eyeball is a

                    found only in man and apes, though, as Knox and Hulke have shown, it exists in
                    reptiles; in the centre of this spot is a depression, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fovea centralis;</hi> about ⅜th inch to the inner side of the yellow spot is a
                    slight elevation, the <hi rend="italic">papilla optica,</hi> which marks the
                    disc-like entrance of the <hi rend="italic">optic nerve</hi> into the retina;
                    here the fibres of the nerve radiate outwards and forwards to the ora serrata,
                    and branches of the <hi rend="italic">arteria</hi><hi rend="italic">centralis

                <p>The retina is highly complex in structure, and consists of nerve fibres and
                    cells, of peripheral end-organs, of connective tissue, and of blood-vessels,
                    arranged in several layers. Max Schultze, who is the chief authority on the
                    subject, recognises ten layers, but includes among these the layer of hexagonal
                    pigment cells just described as the inner pigmentary layer of the choroid. If
                    this layer be omitted, nine layers may then be recognised, and, following
                    Schultze, be named from before backwards as follows:—1. Membrana limitans
                    interna; 2. Layer of optic nerve fibres; 3. Layer of ganglion cells; 4. Internal
                    granulated (molecular) layer; 5. Internal granule layer; 6. External granulated
                    layer; 7. External granule layer; 8. Membrana limitans externa; 9. Bacillary
                    layer (Fig. 78).</p>
                <p>The nervous elements of the retina will first be considered. The <hi
                    rend="italic">optic nerve fibres</hi> (2), where they pierce the sclerotic, as a
                    rule lose the medullary sheath, and radiate outwards as non-medullated fibres
                    from the optic disc to the ora serrata immediately behind and parallel to the
                    membrana limitans interna. These fibres vary greatly in size, and are frequently
                    varicose. When any of the optic nerve fibres retain the medullary sheath the
                    retina is there rendered opaque. Immediately behind the nerve fibres is the <hi
                    rend="italic">layer of ganglionic nerve cells</hi> These cells are either bi
                    polar or multipolar. In the living eye the cell substance is hyaline and the
                    nucleus transparent, but after death the substance both of the body of the cell
                    and the processes assumes a fibrillated appearance, like the axial cylinder of
                    an optic nerve fibre. One process, the central process, extends into the layer
                    of optic nerve fibres; and another, the peripheral, into the internal granulated
                    layer. Tho <hi rend="italic">internal granulated layer</hi> (4) contains the
                    branching processes of the nerve cells, some of which apparently become
                    continuous with an arrangement of excessively fine fibrils, probably nervous in
                    their nature. These fibrils are intermingled with a delicate plexus of
                    connective tissue. The <hi rend="italic">internal granule layer</hi> (5)
                    contains numerous fusiform nucleated enlargements, the so-called internal
                    granules, arranged in superimposed strata; from each fusiform enlargement a
                    fibre proceeds in two directions, one centrally into the internal granulated
                    layer, and one peripherally into the external granulated layer. These fibres
                    possess varicosities, and resemble the optic nerve fibres. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >external granulated layer</hi> (6) is very thin, and consists of an expanded
                    network of minute fibres, with nuclei situated at the points of intersection of
                    the fibres. Krause has called it the <hi rend="italic">membrana fenestrata.</hi>
                    The <hi rend="italic">external granule layer</hi> (7) contains numerous fusiform
                    nucleated enlargements, the so-called external granules, arranged in
                    superimposed strata: from each enlargement a fibre proceeds in two directions,
                    one centrally into the external granulated layer, and one peripherally through
                    the membrana limitans externa to the bacillary layer, where it becomes
                    continuous with the anterior end of either a rod or a cone, as the case may be.
                    Hence these fibres of the external granule layer are called by Schultze rod and
                    cone fibres, and the external granules are nucleated enlargements of these
                    fibres. These fibres possess varicosities like those of the internal granule
                    layer.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">bacillary layer</hi> (9) or membrane of Jacob consists of
                    multitudes of elongated bodies arranged side by side like rows of palisades, and
                    vertically to the surfaces of the retina. Some of these bodies are cylindrical,
                    and are named the <hi rend="italic">rods</hi> of the retina; others
                    flask-shaped, and named the <hi rend="italic">cones</hi> of the retina: the rods
                    equal in length the entire thickness of the bacillary layer; the cones are
                    shorter than the rods, and are interspersed at regular intervals between them;
                    the apex of each cone is directed towards, but does not reach, the plane of the
                    posterior or choroidal surface of the retina. The posterior or outer end of each
                    rod rests against the pigmentary layer of the choroid.</p>

                <p>The anterior or inner ends of both rods and cones are continuous with the rod and
                    cone fibres of the external granule layer, as already described. Each rod and
                    cone is subdivided into an outer strongly refractile and an inner feebly
                    refractile segment. By the action of various reagents the outer segments both of
                    the rods and cones exhibit a transverse striation, and ultimately break up into
                    discs. Hensen has described a longitudinal striation in the outer segments, and
                    Ritter has stated that both in the outer and inner segments of the rods an axial
                    fibre exists. Max Schultze has also seen the inner segments of both rods and
                    cones longitudinally striped on the surface. Modifications in the relative
                    numbers and appearances of the rods and cones have been seen in the eyes of
                    various vertebrata. In birds, for example, the cones are much more numerous than
                    the rods, whilst the reverse is the case in mammals generally. In the
                    cartilaginous fishes the cones are entirely absent; so also, as Schultze has
                    shown, in the bat, hedge-hog, and mole; whilst in reptiles the bacillary layer
                    is exclusively composed of cones. In all the vertebrata, except the mammalia,
                    the twin or double cones described by Hannover probably exist. In the amphibia,
                    lens-shaped bodies have been described in the inner segments of the cones. The
                    rods and cones are the peripheral end-organs in connection with the fibres of
                    the optic nerve, and their apparent relation to these fibres is as follows :—The
                    optic nerve fibres are continuous with the central processes of the ganglion
                    cells of the retina, the peripheral branching processes of which pass into the
                    internal granulated layer, where they may possibly become continuous with the
                    central processes of the inner granular layer. The peripheral processes of the
                    inner granular layer enter the external granulated layer, but it is difficult to
                    say whether or not they become continuous with the central processes of that
                    layer. There can, however, be no doubt that the peripheral processes of this
                    layer are directly continuous with the rods and cones of the bacillary layer.
                    The entire arrangement is sometimes called the radial nervous fibres of the
                    retina.</p>
                <p>In addition to the nervous structures just described, the retina contains a
                    delicate supporting connective tissue like the neuroglia of the brain and spinal
                    cord. Not only does it lie between the fibres, cells, and so-called granules in
                    the several nervous layers, and form in them a radial arrangement of supporting
                    fibres, but it constitutes the two limitary membranes of the retina. The <hi
                    rend="italic">membrana limitans</hi><hi rend="italic">externa</hi> (8) is
                    excessively thin, and appears in vertical sections through the retina as a mere
                    line between the bacillary and external granular layers, continuous on the one
                    hand with the connective tissue which passes for a short distance between the
                    rods and cones, and on the other with the connective tissue framework of the
                    external granule layer.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">membrana limitans</hi><hi rend="italic">interna</hi> (1)
                    covers the anterior surface of the retina, and lies next the vitreous body; its
                    posterior surface blends with the radial arrangement of connective tissue
                    between the optic nerve fibres, but its anterior or hyaloid surface, as J. C.
                    Ewart has recently shown, possesses a mosaic appearance, like that of a layer of
                    squamous endothelium.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">yellow spot</hi> exhibits some structural differences from
                    the rest of the retina. It owes its colour to the presence of yellow pigment
                    deposited in the more anterior layers of the retina. Except at its central
                    depression, the <hi rend="italic">fovea centralis,</hi> it is thicker than the
                    surrounding parts of the retina; but it is much softer, a condition which is due
                    to the almost complete absence of the layer of optic nerve fibres, and a
                    diminution in the amount of the supporting connective tissue; the membrana
                    limitans interna is, however, relatively stronger. In the fovea centralis itself
                    the rods of the bacillary layer have entirely disappeared, and are replaced by
                    cones which are distinguished by their close arrangement, and the more slender
                    form and increased length, especially of their outer segments. The external
                    granule layer is well marked, and the central fibres belonging to it, instead of
                    passing vertically forwards, incline very obliquely or almost horizontally
                    outwards to the internal granule layer, which, together with the layers anterior
                    to it, is so thin as almost to have disappeared. In the yellow spot surrounding
                    the fovea the bacillary layer is also composed of cones which are not, however,
                    so slender or so long as at the fovea itself. The layer of nerve cells and the
                    inner part of the external granule layer are thicker than in the rest of the
                    retina. The yellow spot is the part of the retina most sensitive to light.</p>
                <p>At the <hi rend="italic">ora</hi><hi rend="italic">serrata</hi> or anterior
                    border of the retina the nervous layers, including the rods and cones, cease to
                    exist. The radial connective tissue and internal limiting membrana are present;
                    from the radial tissue a layer of cells is prolonged forward in contact with the
                    deep surface of the ciliary processes as the <hi rend="italic">pars ciliaris
                    retinae.</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi></p>
                <p>The retina is supplied with blood by the arteria centralis, which, traversing the
                    axis of the optic nerve, reaches the retina at the optic disc. In the retina it
                    branches dichotomously in the nerve fibre layer, avoiding however the yellow
                    spot, and its terminal twigs reach the ora serrata. The capillaries form in the
                    more anterior layers of the retina a distinct network, which does not enter the
                    external granule and bacillary layers, but penetrates the yellow spot, though
                    not the fovea centralis. The blood is conveyed from the retina by the central
                    vein which accompanies the artery in the optic nerve, and opens either into the
                    ophthalmic vein or directly into the cavernous sinus. The veins and capillaries
                    of the retina have been described by His as completely invested by perivascular
                    lymphatic sheaths, whilst the arteries only possess such sheaths for a limited
                    part of their course.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Optic Nerve</hi> itself passes from the orbit through the
                    optic foramen into the cranial cavity, where it arises from the <hi
                    rend="italic">optic commissure.</hi> This commissure is a flattened band formed
                    by the junction of the two <hi rend="italic">optic tracts.</hi> Each tract winds
                    backwards around the tuber cinereum and crus cerebri to arise from the optic
                    thalamus, corpora quadrigemina, and geniculata; and some observers also state
                    that it derives fibres from the tuber cinereum and lamina cinerea. In the
                    commissure an interchange takes place between the fibres of opposite nerves and
                    tracts, so that not only does an optic nerve contain fibres derived from the
                    tract on its own side, but from the opposite tract, and it has even been stated
                    that fibres pass across the commissure from one optic nerve to the other, and
                    from one optic tract to the other.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Aqueous Humour</hi> is a limpid watery fluid, containing a
                    little common salt in solution, which occupies the space between the cornea and
                    the front of the crystalline lens. In this space the iris lies, and imperfectly
                    divides it into two chambers, an anterior and a posterior, which communicate
                    with each other through the pupil. The anterior chamber, of some size, is
                    situated between the iris and cornea; but as the iris is in contact with the
                    front of the lens, the posterior chamber is reduced to a mere chink between the
                    circumference of the iris and that of the lens.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Crystalline Lens</hi> is situated behind the iris and
                    pupil, and in front of the vitreous body. It is a transparent bi-convex lens,
                    with its antero-posterior diameter ⅜d less than the transverse, its posterior
                    surface more convex than the anterior, and with its circumference rounded. It
                    consists of a capsule and the body of the lens enclosed by the capsule. The <hi
                    rend="italic">lens capsule</hi> is a transparent, smooth, structureless, and
                    very elastic membrane, about twice as thick on the anterior as on the posterior
                    surface of the lens. It is non-vascular in the adult, though in the foetus a
                    branch of the central arterv of the retina, which traverses the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n949/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0949-0890"/> vitreous humour, ramifies in its posterior
                    portion. A single layer of polygonal cells lies between the body of the lens and
                    the anterior portion of the capsule. The <hi rend="italic">lens body</hi> is
                    softer at its periphery than in its centre. It is built up of concentric layers,
                    and on both the anterior and posterior surfaces lines are to be seen radiating
                    from the central pole of each surface towards the circumference of the body. The
                    radiated pattern varies in different animals. In the human foetus there are
                    usually three lines, but in the adult they are more numerous. The lines on one
                    surface do not lie immediately opposite those on the other, but are
                    intermediate. By the action of strong spirit and other reagents the body of the
                    lens can be split up from the periphery towards the centre in the direction of
                    these lines, so that they mark the edges of apposition of its concentric
                    laminse. Each lamina consists of numerous hexagonal fibres about <hi
                    rend="subscript"> rδ</hi> ⅛∙ <hi rend="subscript"> ff</hi> th inch wide, which
                    extend from one surface to the other over the circumference of the lens, so that
                    a fibre which begins at the polar end of a radius on the one surface terminates
                    at the circumferential end of a radius on the opposite. The edges of the fibres
                    are sinuous in man, but denticulated in many animals, especially fishes, so that
                    the fibres, not only in the same, but in superimposed layers, are closely
                    interlocked. The lens fibres are nucleated, a structural fact which gives a clue
                    to their true nature, and they are now regarded as peculiarly modified elongated
                    cells. Babuchin states that he can trace the transition from the cells of the
                    layer between the lens-body and capsule to the proper lens fibres. The lens-body
                    is non-vascular and non-nervous. The surfaces of the lens become more flattened
                    in old age, and its substance hardens and is less transparent.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vitreous Body</hi> is much the largest of the refracting
                    media, and occupies the largest part of the space enclosed by the tunics.
                    Anteriorly it Î3 hollowed out to receive the posterior convexity of the lens,
                    but posteriorly it is convex, and the retina is moulded on it. It is as
                    translucent as glass, jelly-like in consistency, and when punctured a watery
                    fluid drains out. Its minute structure is difficult to ascertain, but as it,
                    like the subcutaneous tissue of the embryo, contains rounded, stellate, and
                    fusiform cells, it is customary to refer it to the gelatinous form of connective
                    tissue; concentric lamellae, and even a radiated arrangement of fibres, have
                    also been described. It has been customary also to consider it as invested by a
                    delicate structureless membrane, the <hi rend="italic">hyaloid membrane;</hi>
                    but this is now regarded as belonging to the retina, where it is known as the
                    <hi rend="italic">membrana limitans</hi><hi rend="italic">interna.</hi> Almost
                    opposite the ora serrata a membrane springs from the vitreous body, passes
                    forwards for some distance in relation to the deep surface of the ciliary
                    processes, but separated from them by the pars ciliaris retinae, and then
                    inclines inwards to become attached to the anterior surface of the capsule of
                    the lens close to its circumference. It is so closely connected at its origin
                    with the membrana limitans that it is difficult to recognise it as a distinct
                    membrane. It is named the <hi rend="italic">suspensory ligament of the
                    lens,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">zonule of Zinn,</hi> and contains fibres, which
                    run in the meridional direction. Where it leaves the vitreous body a narrow
                    space is enclosed between it and that body, which space surrounds the
                    circumference of the lens, and is called the <hi rend="italic">canal of
                    Petit.</hi> From the relation of the suspensory ligament to the ciliary
                    processes it has a plicated surface, and when these processes are torn' away
                    from it a portion of the pigment of the processes is often left behind, so that
                    the zonule is sometimes named the <hi rend="italic">ciliary processes of the
                    vitreous body.</hi></p>
                <p>The Eyeball is an optical instrument, constructed on the plan of the camera
                    obscura. The sclerotic forms the wall of the chamber. The choroid represents the
                    black lining for absorbing the surplus rays of light. The cornea, aqueous
                    humour, lens, and vitreous body are the translucent media which, like the glass
                    lens of the camera obscura, bring the rays of light to a focus. The retina is
                    the sensitive plate on which the optical picture is thrown. In considering the
                    relation of the retina to the visual rays, it must be kept in mind that the
                    place of entrance of the optic nerve is insensible to light, and that the most
                    sensitive part of the retina is the yellow spot, with its fovea centralis, where
                    the optic nerve fibres are absent, but where the bacillary layer reaches its
                    maximum size. It is clear, therefore, that the rods and cones of this layer, and
                    not the optic nerve fibres, are the structures in the retina which are
                    stimulated by the light; and it is probable, as was suggested many years ago by
                    Goodsir, that these rods and cones are impressed by the light, not as it enters
                    the eye directly, but as it is reflected backwards from the choroid along their
                    axes. The iris is the diaphragm which, by opening or closing the pupil, admits
                    or cuts off the rays of light. The ciliary muscle represents the adjusting screw
                    of the camera; through its attachment to the ciliary processes and their
                    relation to the suspensory ligament of the lens, it is able to act upon the lens
                    and modify the curvature of its anterior surface; for when the eye is to be
                    accommodated to the vision of near objects the anterior surface of the lens
                    becomes more convex than when distant objects are being examined.</p>
                <p>It has already been stated on p. 864 that the retina is formed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">primary optic vesicle,</hi> which grows forwards to the
                    integument. By the involution and growth of the skin at this spot a hollow is
                    produced at the front of the vesicle, which gradually deepening forms a pouch,
                    the <hi rend="italic">secondary optic vesicle,</hi> in which the involuted part
                    of the skin is lodged. From the included sub-epidermal tissue the vitreous body
                    is derived; from the included epidermis, the lens; whilst the cornea sclerotic
                    and iris are produced by the subcutaneous connective tissue. The optic nerve and
                    retina are formed from the primary optic vesicle and its peduncle, and it is
                    probable that the bacillary layer is a special development of its internal
                    epithelial lining. The choroid coat again is derived from the pia mater. Hence
                    the eyeball is compounded of structures derived partly from the integument and
                    partly from the embryo brain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Accessory Parts to the Eyeball.</hi> —In relation to the
                    eyeball several accessory parts are found.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Eye-Brows</hi> are projections of the integument, from
                    which short, stiff hairs grow.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Eye-Lids, or</hi><hi rend="italic">palpebroe,</hi> are two
                    movable curtains, an upper and a lower, which protect the front of the globe.
                    Between each pair of lids is a horizontal fissure, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >palpebral fissure.</hi> From the free margins of the two lids project short

                    they also protect the front of the globe. Each eye-Hd consists of skin; of the
                    fibres of the orbicular sphincter muscle; of a thin plate of fibro-cartilage,
                    the <hi rend="italic">tarsal cartilage,</hi> to the inner end of which a fibrous
                    band, the <hi rend="italic">tendo</hi><hi rend="italic">palpebrarum,</hi> is
                    attached, this tendon springing from the ascending process of the superior
                    maxilla; and of the conjunctiva. Between the conjunctiva and the tarsal
                    cartilage is a layer of glands, the <hi rend="italic">Meibomian glands;</hi>
                    each gland consists of a short duct, which expands at its sides into small
                    sacculi. The sacculi contain short columnar cells; these secrete a sebaceous
                    material, which escapes through the orifice of the duct at the border of the
                    eye-lid.</p>

                    nictitans, so well developed in birds. The palpebral conjunctiva has small
                    papillae scattered over its surface; its epithelium is stratified, with scaly
                    cells on the free surface and elongated cells in the deepest layer. In the
                    sub-epithelial tissue are small branched mucous glands, which are numerous in
                    the caruncula. Little masses of adenoid tissue (p. 849) with lymphatic vessels
                    are also found in it, and the conjunctiva of the front of the eyeball is thinner
                    than the palpebral part. It is not glandular, and its nerves terminate in
                    end-bulbs (p. 862). The palpebral conjunctiva, and in part that of the eyeball,
                    receive their blood-vessels from those of the eye-lids, but the portion of the
                    conjunctiva next the cornea is supplied by the arteries of the sclerotic
                    coat.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lachrymal Apparatus</hi> is engaged in the secretion of the
                    tears, and in conveying them away from the front of the globe. The <hi
                    rend="italic">lachrymal gland</hi> occupies a depression in the outer part of
                    the roof of the orbit. It is smaller than an almond, is sub-divided into
                    lobules, and belongs to the group of compound racemose glands. It consists of
                    the ramifications of short ducts, which terminate in small sacculi The wall of
                    each sacculus consists of a delicate membrana propria, and the cavity contains
                    the polyhedral secreting cells. Outside the membrana propria is a capillary
                    network derived from the lachrymal artery, but Giannuzzi and Boll have recently
                    described a space between this network and the membrana propria which they
                    believe to be continuous with the lymphatic system. Pflüger has described nerves
                    as terminating in connection with the secreting celle. The excretory ducts of
                    the gland are from six to eight, and open on the back of the upper eye-lid. The
                    tears are washed over the surface of the globe by the involuntary winking of
                    this lid. When the secretion is increased in quantity, in the act of crying, the
                    tears flow over the cheek, but in ordinary circumstances they are conveyed away
                    by two slender tubes, the <hi rend="italic">lachrymal canals,</hi> which open by
                    minute orifices, the <hi rend="italic">puncta</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    From this sac a duct, the <hi rend="italic">nasal</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >lachrymal duct,</hi> proceeds which opens into the inferior meatus of the nose,
                    and here the tears mingle with the mucous secretion of that cavity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Muscles of the Eyeball.</hi> —The sclerotic coat of the eyeball
                    has six muscles inserted into it. Four of the muscles are called <hi
                    rend="italic">recti,</hi> and are situated, one superior, one inferior, one
                    external to, another internal to, the globe. They all arise from the rim of bone
                    which bounds the optic foramen; the external and internal muscles are inserted
                    vertically into the sides of the sclerotic, but the superior and inferior recti
                    have oblique insertions into its upper and lower aspects. The other two muscles
                    are called <hi rend="italic">obliqui.</hi> The superior oblique arises along
                    with the recti, passes to the inner end of the upper border of the orbit, where
                    its tendon goes through a pulley, and is directed back to be inserted obliquely
                    into the upper and outer part of the sclerotic. The inferior oblique arises from
                    the lower border of the orbit, passes outwards and upwards to be inserted
                    obliquely into the sclerotic. These muscles roll the eyeball in the orbit, and,
                    without entering into a minute analysis of their actions, their office may be
                    stated generally as follows :— The internal rectus rolls it inwards, the
                    external outwards, about its vertical axis; the superior rectus rolls it
                    upwards, the inferior downwards, about its transverse horizontal axis, though
                    from the obliquity of their insertions they give it at the same time a slight
                    inward or outward movement as the case may be; the superior and inferior oblique
                    roll the globe around its antero-posterior or sagittal axis, the superior
                    upwards and outwards, the inferior downwards and outwards.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Periosteal Muscle of the Orbit.—</hi> The periosteum of the
                    orbit contains, as H. Müller and Turner have described, a layer of non-striped
                    muscular fibre in the part which covers over the spheno-maxillary fissure. In
                    man it is rudimentary, but in the sheep, deer, elephant, &lt;fcc., where the
                    osseous wall of the orbit is deficient, this muscle forms a well-defined
                    structure. It has been suggested that it acts as a protractor muscle of the
                    globe.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Ear,</hi> or organ of hearing, is a complex acoustic
                    apparatus, situated in connection with the temporal bone. It is divided into
                    three parts, named external, middle, and internal ear.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">External Ear</hi> consists of the pinna or auricle and the
                    external auditory meatus. The <hi rend="italic">auricle</hi> is the oblong
                    convoluted body situated at the side of the head. Its incurved outer border is
                    named the <hi rend="italic">helix.</hi> Within this lies a curved ridge, the <hi
                    rend="italic">anti-helix,</hi> in front of which is a deep hollow, the <hi
                    rend="italic">concha,</hi> which leads into the external meatus. The concha is
                    bounded in front by a prominence, the <hi rend="italic">tragus,</hi> and behind
                    by a smaller prominence, the <hi rend="italic">anti-tragus;</hi> below the
                    anti-tragus is the <hi rend="italic">lobule,</hi> which forms the most depending
                    part of the auricle. The framework of the auricle is formed of yellow elastic
                    fibro-cartilage invested by integument, except the lobule, which consists merely
                    of a fold of integument containing fat. Attached to the cartilage are not only
                    the three auricular muscles referred to on page 836, but also certain smaller
                    muscles called the proper muscles of the pinna. Thus the <hi rend="italic"
                    >greater muscle of the helix</hi> is placed on its anterior border; the <hi

                    arises out of the concha; the <hi rend="italic">muscle of the tragus</hi> lies

                    >transverse muscle</hi> on the posterior or cranial surface of the auricle.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">External Meatus</hi> leads from the bottom of the concha
                    into the temporal bone, and is separated from the tympanum or middle ear by the
                    membrana tympani. It is a crooked passage one and quarter inch long, inclined at
                    first forwards and upwards, then downwards and inwards. The wall of the outer
                    end of the passage is formed of fibro-cartilage continuous with the cartilage of
                    the auricle, whilst that of the deeper end is formed of the plate-like tympanic
                    part of the temporal bone. The passage is lined with integument continuous with
                    the skin of the auricle, in which are situated numerous hairs, together with
                    ceruminous glands which secrete the well-known yellow “wax.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tympanum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Drum,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Middle Ear,</hi> is a chamber irregularly cuboidal in form,
                    situated in the temporal bone between the bottom of the meatus and the internal
                    ear. The outer wall is formed of the <hi rend="italic">membrani tympani,</hi>
                    which inclines obliquely downwards and inwards at the bottom of the external
                    meatus, at an angle of 55° to the axis of the meatus, whilst the membranes in
                    the two ears form with each other an obtuse angle of 130° to 135°. The tympanic
                    membrane is attached to a groove at the bottom of the meatus, and is concave on
                    its outer, convex on its inner surface. It consists of three layers: an external
                    tegumen-tary, continuous with the skin of the meatus, which contains no hairs or
                    glands; an internal mucous, continuous with the mucous lining of the tympanum;
                    and an intermediate membrana propria, which consists of unyielding fibres
                    arranged both radially and circularly. The radial fibres radiate from the point
                    of attachment of the handle of the malleus. The membrana propria is usually said
                    to be destitute both of nerves and vessels, but Kessel states that nerves,
                    blood, and lymph vessels exist in it as well as in the mucous and tegumentary
                    layers. Immediately in front of the membrana tympani is the Glaserian fissure.
                    The inner wall separates the tympanum from the labyrinth, and presents the
                    following appearances: a rounded elevation or <hi rend="italic">promontory</hi>
                    caused by the first turn of the cochlea, on the surface of which promontory are
                    grooves for the lodgment of the tympanic plexus of nerves; above the promontory
                    is an oval opening closed in by a membrane, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fenestra</hi><hi rend="italic">ovalis,</hi> which corresponds with the
                    vestibule; behind and below the promontory is a round opening closed in by a
                    membrane, the <hi rend="italic">fenestra rotunda,</hi> which corresponds with
                    the tympanic passage in the cochlea. The floor of the tympanum is a narrow chink
                    between the inner and outer walls; and the roof is formed by the anterior
                    surface of the petrous-temporal bone. At its anterior wall the tympanum opens
                    into the <hi rend="italic">Eustachian tube,</hi> a canal which communicates with
                    the nasal compartment of the pharynx immediately behind the inferior turbinal.
                    The wall of the tympanic end of this tube is formed ςf bone, that of the
                    pharyngeal end of a curved plate of hyaline cartilage, which is connected to the
                    bone by fibro-cartilage; its pharyngeal orifice is dilated into a trumpet-shaped
                    mouth; through this tube the ciliated mucous membrane of the nasal part of the
                    pharynx is prolonged into the tympanum. The cartilaginous wall of the tube does
                    not completely surround it, but is completed by a fibrous membrane, and a layer
                    of voluntary muscle, named by Rüdinger the dilatator tubae. Above the tympanic
                    orifice of the Eustachian tube is a fine canal, through which the tensor tympani
                    muscle enters the tympanum. At its posterior wall the tympanum communicates with
                    the air-sinuses in the mastoid temporal; here also is found a small hollow
                    eminence, the <hi rend="italic">pyramid,</hi> through a hole at the apex of
                    which the tendon of the stapedius muscle passes; and a foramen which transmits
                    the chorda tympani nerve.</p>
                <p>The tympanic cavity contains three small bones, named malleus, incus, and stapes,
                    arranged so as to form an irregular chain, stretching across the cavity from the
                    outer to the inner wall.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Malleus</hi> or hammer is the most external bone. In it may
                    be recognised a head separated by a constricted neck from an elongated handle.
                    Close to the junction of the neck and handle a long slender process projects
                    downwards and forwards to be inserted into the Glaserian fissure, and near the
                    root of the long process a short process projects outwards. By its handle the
                    malleus is intimately connected with the centre of the membrana tympani; by its
                    head it articulates with the incus; whilst ligamentous fibres pass from it
                    upwards, forwards, outwards, and backwards to the tympanic walls.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Incus,</hi> or anvil-shaped bone, possesses a body and two
                    processes; on the anterior surface of the body is a saddle-shaped hollow in
                    which the head of the malleus fits; the short process projects almost
                    horizontally backwards, and is attached by a ligament to the posterior wall of
                    the tympanum; the long process extends at first downwards and then inwards, to
                    end in a rounded projection, named <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >orbiculare,</hi> through which it articulates with the stapes.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Stapes,</hi> or stirrup-shaped bone, possesses a head and
                    neck, a base and two crura; the head articulates with the os orbiculare of the
                    incus; from the constricted neck the two crura curve inwards to the base, which
                    is attached to the fenestra ovalis. The joint between the malleus and incus is
                    diarthrodial and saddle-shaped, and the articular surfaces are enclosed by a
                    capsular ligament. The joint between the incus and stapes is also diarthrodial,
                    and possesses an investing capsular ligament. Toynbee and Rüdinger have
                    described the base of the stapes and the margin of the fenestra ovalis as each
                    invested by hyaline cartilage. Between these plates elastic fibres extend in a
                    plexiform manner, and the intervals between them are occupied by fluid; the
                    joint seems, therefore, a modified amphiarthrosis. The bones are moved on each
                    other at these joints by small muscles. The <hi rend="italic">tensor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tympani</hi> arises from the apex of the petrous temporal, and the
                    cartilage of the Eustachian tube enters the tympanum at its anterior wall, and
                    is inserted into the malleus near the root. The <hi rend="italic">laxator
                    tympani</hi> muscle arises from the spine of the sphenoid, and the cartilage of
                    the Eustachian tube enters the tympanum through the Glaserian fissure, and is
                    inserted into the neck of the malleus. The <hi rend="italic">stapedius</hi>
                    arises within the pyramid, enters the tympanum through the hole at its apex, and
                    is inserted into the neck of the stapes. The tympanum is lined by a mucous
                    membrane continuous with that of the Eustachian tube, which invests the tympanic
                    ossicles, ligaments, and muscles, and is prolonged backwards so as to line tho
                    mastoid air-sinuses. The epithelium covering this membrane, where it lines the
                    floor and the adjacent part of the anterior, posterior, and internal walls,
                    consists of ciliated columnar cells; but the epithelium covering the roof, the
                    promontory, the membrani tympani, and the tympanic ossicles, is tessellated. In
                    the sub-epithelial connective tissue the blood and lymph vessels and nerves of
                    the tympanum ramify. Kessel has recently described in it certain <hi
                    rend="italic">peculiar bodies,</hi> which consist of a central axial band with a
                    series of capsules, possessing a fibrillar structure, arranged concentrically
                    around the axis; the function of these bodies is not known.</p>
                <p>The formation of the auricle and external meatus is well adapted for collecting
                    and transmitting sound-vibrations inwards to the middle ear and labyrinth. These
                    vibrations strike the membrana tympani, and are propagated by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n952/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0952-0893"/> chain of bones across the tympanic cavity to the
                    labyrinth. The pressure of the vibrations on the tympanic membrane forces that
                    membrane inwards, so that its inner surface presses on the handle of the
                    malleus, the effect of which is to rotate the hammer about its axis; but by the
                    ligamentous attachment of the malleus to the tympanic walls and to the incus,
                    and, as Helmholtz has shown, by the interlocking of cog-like processes connected
                    with the articular surfaces of the two bones, the range of movement is so
                    limited that the pressure on the malleus is transmitted through the incus upon
                    the stapes, which presses, therefore, on the membrane of the fenestra ovalis, so
                    that the movements of the membrana tympani are thus transmitted to fluid within
                    the labyrinth. The tensor tympani muscle tightens the tympanic membrane by
                    drawing the handle of the malleus inwards, and still further adapts the
                    structures for the transmission of sound-vibrations. An antagonistic muscle, the
                    laxator tympani, has also been described. There is some difficulty in
                    determining the action of the stapedius, but if, as is probable, it draws the
                    stapes from the fenestra ovalis, it will diminish the pressure of the chain of
                    bones on that membrane.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Internal Ear,</hi> named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labyrinth,</hi> from its complex construction, is the part of the auditory
                    apparatus in which the nerve of hearing is distributed, and where the peripheral
                    end-organs are situated. It is imbedded in the petrous bone, and is divided into
                    three parts, viz., vestibule, semicircular canals, and cochlea, each of which
                    consists of an osseous and a membranous portion (Pl. XIX. figs. 8, 9,10).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vestibule</hi> lies immediately internal to the tympanum,
                    between it and the bottom of the internal auditory meatus; behind it are the
                    semicircular canals, and in front is situated the cochlea. It is the part of the
                    labyrinth which first appears in animals, and is therefore the most constant
                    part of the organ. In the myxinoid fishes a single semicircular canal is
                    superadded to the vestibule, in the lamprey two canals, but in other fishes and
                    in the higher vertebrates three canals exist. In amphibia, reptiles, and birds
                    the cochlea is small and rudimentary in comparison with its development in
                    mammals. The osseous vestibule is an ovoid chamber about ∣th inch in diameter.
                    In its outer or tympanic wall is the <hi rend="italic">fenestra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ovalis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in its inner are small <hi
                    rend="italic">auditory foramina,</hi> which transmit from the internal meatus
                    the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve; behind these holes is the opening
                    of a minute canal, the <hi rend="italic">aqueductus vestibuli;</hi> its anterior
                    wall communicates with the <hi rend="italic">scala vestibuli</hi> of the
                    cochlea, and into its posterior wall open the five orifices of the three
                    semicircular canals.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Semicircular Canals</hi> are named superior, posterior, and
                    external. The superior and posterior are sometimes called the vertical canals,
                    and the external the horizontal canal, but, as Crum Brown has shown, the
                    superior and posterior lie in planes equally inclined to the mesial plane of the
                    head, and the external is in a plane at right angles to the mesial plane.
                    Further, the canals in the two ears have definite relations to each other; for
                    whilst the superior canal of each ear is nearly parallel to the posterior canal
                    of the other, the external canals in both ears lie nearly in the same plane. The
                    canals are bent, forming nearly fds of a circle, and would have had six openings
                    into the vestibule had not the contiguous ends of the superior and posterior
                    blended together to open by a common orifice. The opposite end of each of these
                    canals and the outer end of the external canal dilate close to the vestibule to
                    twice their usual diameter, and form an <hi rend="italic">ampulla.</hi> The
                    osseous vestibule and semicircular canals are lined by a periosteum invested by
                    a tessellated endothelium, and contain a little fluid, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >perilymph.</hi> In this fluid the membranous labyrinth is suspended.</p>
                <p>The membranous vestibule is formed of two small sac-like dilatations, the walls
                    of which are directly continuous with each other, though the cavities are
                    separated by an intermediate partition. The upper and posterior dilatation,
                    named <hi rend="italic">utriculus,</hi> is larger than the lower and anterior,
                    named <hi rend="italic">sacculus.</hi> The sacculus is continuous with the <hi
                    rend="italic">ductus</hi><hi rend="italic">cochlearis</hi> of the membranous
                    cochlea, and both sacculus and utriculus communicate by slender tubes with a
                    short diverticulum lodged in the aqueductus vestibuli, to which the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">ductus</hi><hi rend="italic">vestibuli</hi> may be given. The
                    membranous semicircular canals are about ⅜d the diameter of the osseous. Their
                    walls are continuous with that of the utriculus, and they open by five orifices
                    into it. Each has an ampulla within the ampulla of the osseous canal. Both the
                    sacculus and utriculus are in places attached to the periosteal linings of the
                    osseous vestibule, and delicatθ ligamentous bands connect the membranous
                    semicircular canals to the periosteal lining of the tubes in which they are
                    contained. The wall of the membranous vestibule and canals consists of a
                    delicate fibrous membrane lined by a tessellated endothelium. The inner part of
                    this membrane has a vitreous or hyaline lustre, and gives origin in the canals
                    to short papillae which project into the lumen. The membranous vestibule and
                    canals are distended with the fluid <hi rend="italic">endolymph.</hi> The
                    sacculus, utriculus, and ampullae are specially modified in connection with the
                    peripheral termination of the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve. The
                    membranous wall forms in each of these dilatations a projecting ridge, the <hi
                    rend="italic">crista acoustica,</hi> to which calcareous particles, the <hi
                    rend="italic">otoliths,</hi> which may be either amorphous or crystalline, are
                    adherent. The endothelial investment of the crista is elongated into columnar
                    cells, and intercalated between them are fusiform cells, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >auditory cells,</hi> each of which, as Schultze and other observers have
                    described, possesses a peripheral and a central process. The peripheral process
                    projects beyond the plane of the free surface of the endothelium into the
                    endolymph as the <hi rend="italic">auditory hair,</hi> whilst the central
                    process extends into the sub-endothelial tissue, where the nerve plexus
                    belonging to the terminal branches of the auditory nerve ramifies, and with
                    which it is probably continuous. These auditory cells are, therefore, the
                    peripheral end-organs of the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve, and
                    their general arrangement is not unlike that of the olfactory cells of the
                    nose.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cochlea</hi> is by far the most complex part of the
                    labyrinth. It is about {th inch long, and shaped like the shell of a common
                    snail; its base lies near the internal meatus, and its apex is directed
                    outwards. The osseous cochlea is a tube wound spirally two and ahalf times round
                    a central pillar or <hi rend="italic">modiolus.</hi> Both the pillar and the
                    tube diminish rapidly in diameter from the base to the apex of the cochlea* The
                    tube is imperfectly divided into two passages by a <pb break="no"

                    it, and projects into the tube. When the membranous cochlea is in its place the
                    division is completed by a membrane, the <hi rend="italic">membranous spiral
                    lamina,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">basilar membrane,</hi> which bridges across
                    the interval between the free edge of the osseous spiral lamina and the outer
                    wall of the tube, to which it is attached by the <hi rend="italic">spiral
                    cochlear ligament.</hi> These passages are called <hi rend="italic">scala
                    tympani</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scala vestibuli.</hi> But another membrane,
                    the <hi rend="italic">membrane of Reissner,</hi> also arises from a denticulated
                    spiral crest, <hi rend="italic">limbus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">crista
                    spiralis,</hi> attached to the vestibular border of the free edge of the osseous
                    spiral lamina, and extends to the spiral ligament at the outer wall of the tube,
                    on the vestibular aspect of the basilar membrane, so as to enclose a passage
                    between it and the basilar membrane, called <hi rend="italic">scala</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">intermedia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ductus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cochlearis.</hi> The membrane of Reissner is formed of delicate vascular
                    connective tissue, with an endothelial layer on each of its two surfaces. The
                    scala tympani or lower passage, widest at the base of the cochlea, begins at the
                    inner wall of the tympanum, into which it would have opened through the fenestra
                    rotunda, had not the fenestra been closed up by a membrane. The scala vestibuli
                    or upper passage, also widest at the base, communicates with the cavity of the
                    osseous vestibule. At the apex of the cochlea these two scalae communicate with
                    each other through a small hole, the <hi rend="italic">helicotrema.</hi> As the
                    scala vestibuli opens into the osseous vestibule, the perilymphis continued into
                    it, and through the helicotrema into the scala tympani. The ductus cochlearis is
                    the membranous cochlea, and its walls are formed of the basilar membrane next
                    the scala tympani, of the membrane of Reissner next the scala vestibuli, and of
                    the spiral ligament next the wall of the cochlea, which connects the two
                    membranes together. It follows the spiral windings of the cochlea, terminates at
                    the apex of the spiral in a closed end, whilst at the base it communicates with
                    the sacculus of the membranous vestibule by a slender tube, the <hi
                    rend="italic">canalis reuniens;</hi> hence the membranous cochlea contains
                    endolymph. The termination of the cochlear branches of the auditory nerve and
                    the arrangement of the peripheral end-organs, in relation to them are to be
                    looked for in the basilar membrane. These parts have been repeatedly
                    investigated and described in elaborate monographs, the titles of which are
                    given as an appendix to Waldeyer’s article on the cochlea in Stricker’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Handbuch der Lehre von den Geweben,</hi> Leipsic, 1872. The
                    general results only of these investigations will be given here, and the
                    original memoirs may be referred to for further details.</p>
                <p>On the surface of the basilar membrane directed to the ductus cochlearis a
                    remarkable arrangement of cells exists, which presents an appearance that has
                    been compared with the key-board of a pianoforte, and has been named the <hi
                    rend="italic">organ of Corti;</hi> it consists of the following parts:—Some of
                    these cells, distinguished by their elongated curved form, are arranged in two
                    groups, an inner and an outer. The cells of the inner group rest by a broad foot
                    on the inner part of the basilar membrane, close to its attachment to the spiral
                    lamina, project obliquely forwards and outwards, and expand into a dilated head:
                    the cells of the outer group also rest by a broad foot on the same membrane,
                    incline forwards and inwards, and fit into a depression in the head of the cells
                    of the inner group: these two groups of cells form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rods</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pillars of Corti,</hi> and by their
                    juxtaposition arch over an excessively minute canal enclosed between them and
                    the basilar membrane, which may be named the <hi rend="italic">canal of
                    Corti.</hi> The inner rods are, however, more numerous than the outer, and
                    Pritchard has shown that the rods increase in length from the base to the apex
                    of the cochlea. Immediately internal and almost parallel to the inner group of
                    these rods, and adjacent therefore to the crista spiralis, is a row of
                    compressed conical cells, which possess at their anterior ends short stiff
                    hair-like processes; they are the <hi rend="italic">inner hair cells</hi> of
                    Deiters. Immediately external and almost parallel to the outer group of rods are
                    four or five rows of hair cells, the <hi rend="italic">outer hair cells,</hi>
                    which are attached by their bases to the basilar membrane, whilst from the
                    opposite extremity a brush of hairs projects through the reticular membrane. The
                    outer hair cells are, according to Waldeyer, relatively of large size in man.
                    The <hi rend="italic">reticular membrane</hi> of Kölliker is a delicate
                    framework perforated by rounded holes. It extends parallel to the basilar mem
                    brane from the inner rods of Corti to the external row of outer hair cells, and
                    through the holes in it the hairs of the latter project. It obviously acts as a
                    support for the anterior ends of these cells, and binds together these important
                    elements of the organ of Corti The interval between the outer hair cells and the
                    spiral ligament is occupied by cells of a more or less columnar form, the <hi

                    the ductus cochlearis, is the <hi rend="italic">membrana tectoria,</hi> which
                    springs from the crista spiralis close to the attachment of the membrane of
                    Reissner, passes outwards superficial to the membrana reticularis, and ends
                    externally at the spiral ligament.</p>
                <p>The origin, course, and distribution of the auditory nerve in the labyrinth will
                    now be considered. The auditory nerve is the <hi rend="italic">portio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mollis</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">seventh</hi> cranial nerve.
                    It appears at the base of the brain at the lower border of the po∩3 Varolii.
                    Traced to its origin its roots wind round the restiform body to the floor of the
                    4th ventricle, where they form the striae acousticae, and sink into the grey
                    matter of the floor. Some of the fibres arise from an inner, others from an
                    anterior collection of nerve cells, whilst others again are connected with the
                    cells in the restiform body, and probably with the flocculus of the cerebellum.
                    Where the nerve emerges at the lower border of the pons it contains a cluster of
                    nerve cells. The auditory nerve passes down the internal meatus, and divides
                    into a vestibular and a cochlear division. The <hi rend="italic">vestibular</hi>
                    division enters the vestibule, and divides into five branches for the sacculus,
                    utriculus, and three ampullae of the membranous semicircular canals. Each branch
                    enters a crista acoustica and forms a plexus, in the meshes of which nerve cells
                    are imbedded. From this plexus fine non-medullated fibres arise, which enter the
                    layer of cells on the surface of the crista, where they anastomose and form a
                    very delicate plexus, from which fibres spring that in all probability join the
                    central processes of the auditory cells.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cochlear</hi> division enters a canal in the axis of the
                    modiolus, and gives off lateral branches, which pass into the canals situated in
                    the osseous spiral lamina. Here they radiate outwards to the membranous spiral
                    lamina, and have connected with them collections of nerve cells forming the
                    spiral ganglion. Beyond the ganglion they form a flat plexiform expansion, from
                    which delicate nerves pass through a gap in the edge of the osseous lamina into
                    the organ of Corti. In this organ the nerves, as Gottstein and Waldeyer have
                    described, are arranged in two groups of fibres; the inner group become
                    continuous with the deep end of the inner hair cells; the outer group pass
                    across the canal of Corti and end in the outer hair cells. Hence these cells are
                    the peripheral end-organs of the cochlear branch of the auditory nerve, or the
                    <hi rend="italic">auditory cells of the cochlea.</hi></p>
                <p>The perilymph of the labyrinth is set in vibration by the movements of the
                    tympanic ossicles and the fenestra ovalis; motion is thus communicated to the
                    membranous labyrinth and the endolymph which it contains. The auditory hairs and
                    cells would thus be set in motion, and the vestibular branches of the auditory
                    nerve would be stimulated to conduct sound-impulses to the brain. The movements
                    of the perilymph in the scala tympani and of the endolymph in the ductus
                    cochlearis would set in vibration the basilar membrane, and the auditory cells
                    resting on it, by which the cochlear branch es of the auditory nerve would be
                    stimulated to conduct sound-impulses to the brain. It has been customary for
                    physiologists to regard the vestibule as the part of the labyrinth by which
                    sound or mere noise is determined; the cochlea, as the part which determines
                    variations and degrees of sound, as musical notes or harmony; the semicircular
                    canals, as determining the directions from which sound proceeds. But within the
                    last two years experiments and arguments have been advanced almost
                    simultaneously by Crum Brown and Mach in favour of the view that the
                    semicircular canals act as peripheral end-organs for the sense of rotation, by
                    which sense the axis about which rotation of the head takes place, the direction
                    of that rotation, and its rate, are determined.</p>
                <p>In the account of the development of the skeleton, p. 831, it was stated that the
                    external meatus, tympanum, and Eustachian tube are the remains of the first
                    branchial cleft of the embryo, that the tympanic ossicles are formed in the
                    first and second visceral arches, and that the petrous bone is ossified in the
                    cartilaginous basis cranii. The membranous labyrinth apparently arises as an
                    invagination of the integument at the upper end of the second branchial cleft.
                    The invaginated fold then closes in to form a shut sac, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >primary auditory vesicle.</hi> Out of this vesicle the three divisions of the
                    labyrinth are successively produced, and become enclosed by the petrous
                    cartilage, which when ossified forms the osseous labyrinth. The epidermal
                    investment of the invaginated tegumentary sac becomes transformed into the
                    special cell structures within the membranous labyrinth, and the sub-epidermal
                    connective tissue forms its fibrous wall· The cochlear and vestibular nerves
                    form at the same time as the labyrinth, and become connected through the trunk
                    of the auditory nerve with the brain.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Tongue,</hi> situated on the floor of the cavity of the
                    mouth, is the chief organ provided for the excitation of the special sense of
                    taste, but the under surface of the soft palate participates to some extent in
                    this property. The tongue is also highly endowed with the sense of touch. The
                    structures concerned in the excitation of taste and touch are situated in the
                    mucous membrane which envelopes the tongue. The tongue is also a muscular organ,
                    and plays an important part in articulation, mastication, and deglutition. Its
                    shape is flattened from above downwards, so that it presents an upper surface or
                    dorsum and a lower surface. Its posterior part is broad, forms the base or root
                    of the organ, and is attached to the hyoid bone. Its anterior extremity or tip
                    is more or less pointed, and its lateral margins or sides are rounded.</p>
                <p>The muscles connected with the tongue are arranged in pairs, and form three
                    distinct groups, viz., accessory, extrinsic, and intrinsic muscles. The <hi
                    rend="italic">accessory</hi> muscles are the stylo-hyoid, digastric, mylo-hyoid,
                    genio-hyoid, omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and thyro-hyoid, already referred to on
                    page 836, which act upon the hyoid bone, and thus indirectly are concerned in
                    the movements of the tongue. The <hi rend="italic">extrinsic</hi> muscles pass
                    from adjacent parts into the substance of the tongue, and are as follows :—The
                    stylo-glossus arises from the tip of the styloid process and the stylo-maxillary
                    ligament; it runs forwards along the side of the tongue to the tip. The
                    hyo-glossus is divided into three parts; <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> basi-glossus,
                    which arises from the body of the hyoid; <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>
                    ceratoglossus, from the great cornu of the hyoid; <hi rend="italic">c,</hi>
                    chondroglossus, from the small cornu of the hyoid. The fibres from these origins
                    ascend into the side of the tongue. The genio-hyo-glossus arises from the upper
                    tubercle of the symphysis of the lower jaw, its fibres radiate into the
                    substance of the tongue along its whole length from base to tip; this muscle is
                    separated from the corresponding muscle of the opposite half of the tongue by a
                    mesial septum of fibrous tissue. The palato-glossus arises in the substance of
                    the soft palate, and descends to the tongue in the anterior pillar of the
                    fauces. The <hi rend="italic">intrinsic</hi> muscles lie in the substance of the
                    tongue itself, and are as follows :—The lingualis superior (noto-glossus),
                    consisting of longitudinal fibres, which extend from the base to the tip beneath
                    the mucous membrane of the dorsum; the lingualis inferior, consisting of
                    longitudinal fibres, which extend from the base to the tip along the under

                <p>' ( The mucous membrane of the tongue forms a part of the general mucous lining
                    of the mouth; it covers the dorsum, tip, sides, and under surface; is reflected
                    from the under surface to the floor of the mouth, where it forms <hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi><hi rend="italic">fraenum</hi> or bridle of the tongue,
                    and is reflected also from the base to the epiglottis as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >froena</hi> of the epiglottis, as well as over the tonsils and anterior
                    palatine pillars. This membrane has its free surface elevated into multitudes of
                    fine processes, called the papillae of the tongue, some of which are simple,
                    others compound. The <hi rend="italic">simple</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >papillae</hi> are situated on the back part of the dorsum and the under surface
                    of the mucous membrane, as well as scattered between the compound papillae; they
                    are simple conical elevations of the membrane. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >compound</hi><hi rend="italic">papillae</hi> are arranged in three groups,
                    named filiform, fungiform, and circumvallate papillae. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >filiform</hi><hi rend="italic">papillae,</hi> elongated and thread-like, are
                    the smallest and most numerous, and cover the dorsum in front of the
                    circumvallate papillae. The <hi rend="italic">fungiform</hi> or club-shaped are
                    scattered over the anterior and middle parts of the dorsum, and at the tip and
                    sides. The <hi rend="italic">circumvallate</hi><hi rend="italic">papillae,</hi>
                    seven to twelve in number, form a V-shaped figure on the dorsum towards its
                    base; a depression in the mucous membrane, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >foramen</hi><hi rend="italic">caecum,</hi> marks the apex of the V. These are
                    the largest papillae; each is sunk in a vallum or trench-like depression of the
                    mucous membrane, which isolates it from the surrounding surface. The compound
                    character of these papillae is due to each having projecting from it numerous
                    small secondary papillae. The epithelial covering of the filiform papillae is
                    characterised by the peculiar modification which the tessellated epithelium of
                    the mouth has undergone'^ the cells have become cornified and elongated into
                    dense, imbricated brush-like processes. In the carnivora the epithelium is so
                    hardened as to form sharp spines, with the points turned backwards, which give
                    to the tongues of these animals a rough prickly character. In the fungiform and
                    circumvallate papillae the inequalities between the secondary papillae, which
                    project from them, are filled up by the^tessellated epithelium, so that the
                    surface of the compound papillae has a smooth appearance. Both the simple and
                    compound papillae are highly vascular; the lingual artery not only supplies the
                    muscular substance of the tongue, but gives off fine branches to the mucous
                    membrane. These branches end in capillaries, which form simple loops in the
                    simple papillae, but in the compound papillae the capillaries are so multiplied
                    that each secondary papilla has a capillary loop within it. The tongue is
                    provided with several nerves. The hypo-glossal nerve supplies its muscular
                    structure, but the inferior lingualis apparently receives a branch from the
                    chorda tympani of the facial· The lingual branch of the fifth is distributed to
                    the mucous membrane of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue: it breaks up into
                    minute branches, which enter the fungiform and filiform papillae, but their
                    exact mode of termination has not been precisely ascertained, though end-bulbs
                    and gustatory bodies are said to have been seen in connection with some of the
                    terminal branches. The glossal branch of the glosso-pharyngeal is distributed to
                    the mucous membrane of the root of the tongue and of the circumvallate papillae.
                    In connection with its terminal branches peculiar flask-shaped organs, called
                    <hi rend="italic">gustatory bulbs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bodies,</hi> have
                    recently been described by Lovén, Schwalbe, and Engelmann, in the sides of the
                    circumvallate papillae. These have been found in large numbers in lamellated
                    folds of the mucous membrane of the posterior part of the side of the rabbit’s
                    tongue, which folds may appropriately therefore be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >gustatory</hi><hi rend="italic">lamellae.</hi> When sections aro made through
                    one of these folds, or through a circumvallate papilla and the trench which
                    surrounds it, numerous flask-shaped gustatory bulbs may be seen in the
                    epithelium, which covers the side of the papilla and the opposite side of the
                    trench. The bottom of each flask is next the sub-epithelial tissue, whilst its
                    short neck opens on the surface by a mouth, the <hi rend="italic">gustatory
                    pore;</hi> similar bodies, though in much smaller numbers, have also been seen
                    in the fungiform papillae. Each gustatory body consists of two different forms
                    of cells, named <hi rend="italic">covering cells</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >gustatory cells.</hi> The covering cells are elongated, nucleated spindles,
                    which, arranged in layers, form the envelope of each gustatory bulb, and reach
                    from the bottom to the mouth of the flask; they enclose the gustatory cells. The
                    gustatory cells are attenuated, homogeneous, and highly refractile cells, which
                    possess an elliptical nucleated body with two processes, a central and
                    peripheral. These cells occupy the axis of the gustatory bulb. The peripheral
                    process, broader than the central, sometimes ends in a short hair-like tip,
                    which almost reaches the gustatory pore; the central process extends to the base
                    of the flask, and often divides into small branches. This process is varicose,
                    and not unlike the axial cylinder of a nerve fibre. The branches of the
                    glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which are distributed to the back of the tongue, enter
                    the circumvallate papillae, and form a minute plexus, with groups of nerve cells
                    interspersed in it, from which bundles both of medullated and non-medullated
                    fibres pass to the basis of the gustatory bulbs; and it is believed that the
                    finest non-medullated fibres are continuous with the peripheral processes of the
                    gustatory cells, which are therefore regarded as the peripheral end-organs of
                    the nerve of taste, and by the excitation of these bodies gustative or taste
                    sensations are produced. As the glosso-pharyngeal is the nerve distributed to
                    the circumvallate papillae, where these gustatory bulbs are especially found, it
                    is therefore the special nerve of taste; but as these bulbs have also been
                    sparingly seen in the other papillae, where the lingual nerve is distributed,
                    that nerve probably acts in a minor degree as a nerve of taste, though its
                    special function is undoubtedly that of a nerve of touch. The gustatory bulbs
                    are not penetrated by blood-vessels, but, as Fig. 85 shows, the vascular
                    sub-epithelial tissue is prolonged upwards along the sides of the bulbs almost
                    as far as the plane of the gustatory pore. Key, Beale, and other observers have
                    described special modifications of the epithelium in connection with the
                    terminations of the gustatory nerves in the frog. The mucous membrane of the <pb

                    glands, more especially on the dorsum near its root, which secrete mucus.
                    Depressions also occur in this part of the mucous membrane, around the walls of
                    which groups of lymphoid cells are collected in the sub-epithelial connective
                    tissue, which have an arrangement closely resembling the structure of the
                    adjacent tonsils, and form an example of adenoid tissue.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Skin,</hi> or Integument, invests the entire outer
                    surface of ⅛e body, and contains structures by the excitation of which the
                    properties of things are determined by the sense of touch. The skin also
                    contains accessory structures, as the nails, hairs, sebaceous glands, and sweat
                    glands. The skin consists of a non-vascular. cuticle or epidermis, and of a
                    vascular and sensitive corium, or cutis vera.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cuticle, Epidermis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scarf
                    skin,</hi> forms the outer covering of the skin, and protects the cutis. It is a
                    laminated structure, and consists of numerous layers of cells superimposed on
                    each other. As these cells cover a free surface exposed to the air, they belong
                    to the epithelium group. The thickness of the cuticle varies in different
                    localities from <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th to <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>
                    ⅜∙ <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi> ∙th inch; where the skin is frequently exposed
                    to pressure, as in the soles of the feet, the cuticle is the thickest and
                    hardest; and the hands of those accustomed to manual labour have a hard and
                    horny cuticle. The increase in thickness in these localities is for the purpose
                    of protecting the highly sensitive cutis from injury. The outer surface of the
                    cuticle in many parts of the body, especially the palm of the hand and the
                    fingers, is marked by ridges and furrows; the ridges indicate the position and
                    arrangement of the papillae of the cutis, whilst the furrows are due to the
                    sinking of the cuticle into the spaces between the rows of papillae. The mouths
                    of the sweat glands open on the surface of these ridges. The cuticle is divided
                    into two strata. The <hi rend="italic">superficial homy stratum</hi> consists of
                    layers of flat, polygonal scales like a tessellated epithelium; the cells in the
                    superimposed layers firmly adhere to each other by their surfaces, and in
                    vertical sections this stratum presents a fibrous appearance; but the cells may
                    be readily isolated by digestion in a caustic alkali. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >deeper</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mucous stratum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rete
                    Malpighii,</hi> lies next the cutis, and closely follows the undulations of its
                    papillary surface. The cells forming the layer next the cutis are columnar in
                    shape, those in the layers immediately succeeding are rounded or cubical, whilst
                    those next in order are polygonal, and not unfrequently possess pointed
                    processes or prickles projecting from them, hence the name, <hi rend="italic"
                    >prickle cells,</hi> employed by Schultze. The cells which lie next the horny
                    stratum assume the scale-like form. It is in the cells of the mucous stratum
                    that the colouring matter of the skin is found, which in the fair races of men
                    forms the isolated coloured spots called freckles and moles, but in the dark
                    races the pigment granules are uniformly distributed through the cells of this
                    stratum. The superficial cells of the homy stratum of the cuticle are
                    continually being shed, so that the cells of the deeper layers gradually
                    approach the surface, and new cells are continually being formed in the deeper
                    part of the rete "Malpighii. The cuticle is closely adherent to the cutis in the
                    healthy living skin, but on the application of a blister, or when putrefaction
                    sets in after death, it separates from it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cutis vera.—</hi> When the cuticle is removed the surface
                    of the cutis is seen to be studded with multitudes of minute elevations, the
                    papillae of the skin. These papillae are either simple conical structures, or
                    compound with two or three branches. They are largest in the palm and sole,
                    being from <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> th to ∙
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-⅞∙ <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi> ∙th of an inch
                    high, and are arranged in ridges, but more usually they are much shorter and
                    irregularly distributed. The cutis is formed of connective tissue, in which
                    stellate connective tissue corpuscles and elastic fibres are abundant. The
                    deeper surface of tho connective tissue of the cutis is reticulated, and is
                    continuous with the bundles of connective tissue that form the areolar
                    subcutaneous tissue. In the papillae themselves the fibres of the connective
                    tissue are not so well marked, and the surface of the papillae possesses more of
                    a homogeneous aspect, which gives rise to the appearance described as a basement
                    membrane. The cutis is highly vascular; the small arteries which go to the skin
                    give off branches to the lobules of fat in the subcutaneous tissue, then
                    penetrate the cutis, and form a plexus from which capillaries arise, which enter
                    the papillae, and form vascular loops within them. The lymphatic vessels of the
                    skin are numerous; they form a plexus in the cutis, which lies beneath the
                    vascular plexus, forms, as Neumann’s injections show, a network around both the
                    sebaceous and sweat glands, and gives off capillary loops into the papillae. The
                    nerves of the skin are the cutaneous branches both of the spinal and of certain
                    of the cranial nerves, the origin and distribution of which have already been
                    described. They run through the subcutaneous tissue, and enter the deep surface
                    of the cutis, where they divide into branches. As these pass towards the
                    papillae they unite to form a nerve plexus, from which smaller branches arise to
                    enter the papillae, and terminate, more especially in the skin of the palm of
                    the hand, fingers, and sole, which are the surfaces most sensitive ’to touch
                    impressions, in the <hi rend="italic">tactile</hi> or <hi rend="italic">touch
                    corpuscles.</hi> The touch corpuscles discovered by Wagner and Meissner are the
                    peripheral end-organs of the nerves of touch. They may be single or compound;
                    are usually ovoid inform, not unlike a minute fir cone; and are transversely
                    marked, from the transverse direction of the nuclei of fusiform cells which form
                    an investing capsule. Each single corpuscle and each division of a compound
                    corpuscle is penetrated by one, and, according to Thin, by never more than one,
                    medullated nerve fibre, but the exact mode of termination of the axial cylinder
                    of the fibre has not been ascertained. Virchow and other German observers have
                    stated that the papillae which contain capillaries do not contain nerves or
                    touch corpuscles, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> but Dalzell and Thin
                    have shown that certainly the majority of papillae that contain nerve fibres and
                    touch corpuscles are also vascular papillae. Non-medullated nerve fibres ascend
                    to the surface of the cutis, and, according to Langerhans, pass into the rete
                    Malpighii between the cells of the mucous layer.</p>

                    plate, the naü. Each nail rests on a bed, the surface of which is formed of the
                    cutis, which also overlaps the side and root of the nail; thus the nail fits
                    into a groove formed of the cutis something after the manner in which a
                    watch-glass fits into its rim. A nail is merely a special modification of the
                    cuticle, the cells of the superficial stratum of which are more homy, harder,
                    and more firmly adherent to each other than in the cuticle proper. Deeper than
                    the horny stratum is the rete Malpighii of the nail, the cells of which are
                    soft, as in the cuticle itself. The cutis forming the bed of the nail is studded
                    with papillae, which are arranged in almost parallel rows, and are highly
                    vascular. Nails grow both in length and thickness: the increase in thickness is
                    due to the formation of nerve cells on the bed of the nail; the increase in
                    length takes place through the formation of nail cells at its root, and as the
                    nail is thus slowly pushed forward it requires to be cut at intervals. At the
                    root, sides, and below the free border of the nail the cuticle is continuous

                    multitudes of elongated cylindrical horny structures, the hairs. In the skin of
                    the scalp, the armpits, and the pubis, they are long and numerous; but in the
                    eye-brows, eye-lashes, vibrissae of the nostrils, and surface of the body
                    generally, they are short. They are stronger and thicker in the skin of man than
                    of woman, more especially on the cheeks, lips, and chin. Hairs do not grow from
                    the skin of the palms and soles, the back of the ungual phalanges, and the
                    surface of the upper eye-lids. Each hair is partially embedded in a depression
                    of the skin, called a <hi rend="italic">hair follicle.</hi> The deeper end of
                    the follicle is somewhat dilated, and has in it a papilla, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hair papilla.</hi> The wall of the hair follicle is formed of the constituent
                    structures of the skin; the outer part of the wall belongs to the cutis, and has
                    been described as arranged in three layers, the external, middle, and inner
                    layer of the hair follicle. The external and middle layers are formed of
                    connective tissue, with blood-vessels; whilst the inner, sometimes called the
                    <hi rend="italic">vitreous layer,</hi> is transparent and homogeneous, and
                    continuous with the so-called basement membrane of the cutis. The inner part of
                    the wall of the hair follicle, or the <hi rend="italic">root-sheath,</hi>
                    belongs to the cuticle, and consists of two layers, the outer and inner
                    root-sheaths. The <hi rend="italic">outer root-sheath</hi> is continuous with
                    the rete Malpighii, and consists of cells similar to those of that stratum. The
                    <hi rend="italic">inner root-sheath</hi> is continuous with the horny stratum of
                    the cuticle, and consists of elongated scale-like translucent cells in which no
                    nuclei can be seen.</p>
                <p>A hair possesses a root, a shaft, and a tip; the root is embedded in the hair
                    follicle, whilst the shaft and tip form the free projecting part of the hair. In
                    the human hair the substance of the hair is composed of a ^δrozw-looking horny
                    material, which by the action of strong sulphuric acid is resolved into
                    elongated, closely compacted, fusiform cells, which in coloured hairs contain
                    pigment granules. In the thicker hairs the cells in the axis of the hair are
                    polygonal, contain air, and form a central pith or <hi rend="italic"
                    >medulla.</hi> The hair is invested by imbricated scale-like cells, which form
                    the <hi rend="italic">hair cuticle.</hi> In different animals the size and
                    relative proportion of the cells of the cuticle, medulla, end fibrous part of
                    the hair present many modifications. The wool of the sheep has its cuticle
                    scales, with well-defined serrated margins, so that the hair of this animal is
                    well adapted for felting into cloth; in the bat, also, the cuticle cells are
                    large and strongly serrated. The bristles of the pig, again, have the fibrous
                    part of the hair largely developed. In the deer tribe the hair consists of
                    polygonal medulla-like cells, which contain air. The root of the hair dilates at
                    its deeper end into a bulb which embraces the hair papilla. It is softer in
                    texture than the shaft, so that the cellular structure of the hair is more
                    easily demonstrated. Next the papilla the cells are like those of the rete
                    Malpighii, but when traced onwards to the shaft they are seen to become
                    differentiated, both in structure and composition, into the proper hair cells.
                    The root is enveloped in a special sheath, termed the <hi rend="italic">sheath
                    of Huxley,</hi> composed of nucleated cells, which sheath, in the more
                    superficial part of the follicle, blends with the internal root-sheath. The hair
                    papilla bears to the hair the same relation as a papilla of the cutis has to its
                    investing cuticle, so that a hair is to be regarded as a specially modified
                    cuticular structure. . The human hair papilla is vascular, but no nerves have
                    been traced into it. In the tactile hairs of the mammalia, however, nerves have
                    been traced into their papillae.</p>
                <p>The bristles, feathers, claws, hoofs, the horny envelope of the horn cores in the
                    hollow horned ruminants, and various tegumentary spines and scales, present in
                    many animals, are, like hairs and nails, special modifications of the
                    tegumentary system.</p>
                <p>Each hair follicle has opening into it the excretory duct of a small gland, named
                    a <hi rend="italic">sebaceous gland.</hi> This gland consists of the excretory
                    duct, and of from two to twenty grape-like saccular expansions which open into
                    the duct. The wall of the sacculi and of the duct is continuous with the
                    vitreous layer of the outer wall of the hair follicle. Capillary blood-vessels
                    are distributed on the outer wall of the sacculi. The sacculi are almost
                    entirely filled with polygonal cells containing drops of fat, which cells are
                    continuous with the epithelial lining of the gland duct and the cells of the
                    outer root-sheath. These glands secrete a fatty materia], which lubricates the
                    surface of the hair. Sometimes a small parasite, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acarus</hi><hi rend="italic">folliculorum,</hi> is found in a sebaceous
                    gland.</p>
                <p>Some years ago Kölliker described one or two bundles of smooth muscular fibres
                    extending from the wall of the hair follicle to the deep surface of the cutis;
                    these muscles, named <hi rend="italic">arrectores</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pili,</hi> by their contraction erect the hairs, that is, cause them to become
                    more prominent, and produce the condition of skin, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cutis</hi><hi rend="italic">anserina</hi> or goose skin, well known to occur
                    when cold is applied to the surface of the body.</p>
                <p>Hairs are developed about the 4th month of embryo life, within depressions in the
                    cutis, which form the future hair follicles, filled with cells similar to, and
                    continuous with, those of the rete Malpighii. A papilla forms at the bottom of
                    this depression, around which the cells become arranged in a bulbous expansion.
                    The cells, in line with the bulb, elongate and harden, and group themselves so
                    as to form the shaft of the young hair, which at this stage is completely buried
                    within the follicle. A rapid production of new cells takes place at the bulb,
                    the hair consequently increases in length, and is pushed outwards through the
                    superficial horny stratum of the cuticle, which had closed in the mouth of the
                    depression or follicle in which the hair is produced. At the same time, the more
                    external cells within the follicle are pushed outwards towards its wall, and
                    form the cells of the root-sheath. When a hair is pulled out of its follicle the
                    cells of the root-sheath are drawn out along with it. A new hair will be
                    developed at the bottom of a follicle from which the hair has been shed as long
                    as cells continue to be formed around the papilla. When the growth of cells
                    ceases within the hair follicles then permanent baldness is the result.</p>
                <p>The sebaceous glands are developed as bud-like offshoots from the hair follicles,
                    filled, like the follicles themselves, with cells continuous with those of the
                    rete Malpighii. Instead of the cells in these buds differentiating into a hair,
                    they become filled with fatty particles, and the wall of the bud assumes the
                    characteristic sacculated form of the gland.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Sweat Glands,</hi> or sudoriparous glands, are found generally
                    distributed throughout the skin, but are most abundant in the palms and soles,
                    where they number 2500 to 3000 in •each square inch. In the skin of the back,
                    again, there are only between 4β0 and 500 in the square inch. Each gland
                    consists of a ball-like body lying in the subcutaneous .tissue, from which a
                    tubular duct proceeds through the skin to open on its free surface. The ball is
                    composed of a convoluted tube continuous with the tubular duct, and terminating
                    in a blind end. The wall of the gland tube consists of a delicate nucleated
                    membrane lined by columnar secreting cells. It is surrounded by connective
                    tissue containing capillary blood-vessels. As the gland-duct pierces the cutis
                    it passes between the papillae; in its course through the cuticle it pursues a
                    spiral direction, and has its walls formed, not of a distinct membrane, but of
                    the cuticle cells themselves. The epithelial lining of the duct is continuous
                    with the cells of the rete Malpighii of the cuticle. In the axilla and groin the
                    sweat glands are much larger than in the skin generally. The sweat glands arise
                    as flask-shaped pouches of the rete Malpighii projecting into the cutis, which
                    in course of time become elongated into tubes, and the cells contained in which
                    become the secreting cells of the gland.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Vascular System.</hi></p>
                <p>The human body and the bodies of all the more highly organised animals are
                    traversed by numerous tubes or pipes, technically called Vessels, some of which
                    in man are nearly an inch in diameter, others so small as to require a
                    microscope for their examination, others again of every intermediate size. In
                    connection with the vessels is a central organ, the Heart. The heart and the
                    vessels collectively constitute the Vascular System. Of these vessels some
                    contain blood, and form the Blood-vascular system; others contain lymph, and
                    form the Lymph-vascular system. The lymph-vascular system is not independent of
                    the blood-vascular system, but communicates with it at several points. The
                    vascular system is a hydraulic apparatus, possessing a pump, pipes, and valves.
                    The heart is the pump, which works, not by the movements of a piston, but by the
                    contraction of its muscular walls; the vessels are the pipes, which convey the
                    contained fluid, and they are provided in certain localities with valves for
                    modifying its flow.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Blood-Vascular System.</hi> —The movement of the blood in
                    the blood-vascular system is called the <hi rend="italic">circulation of the
                    blood.</hi> In the lower Vertebrata the heart is a single organ, and the blood
                    flows from it through the vessels back again into the part of the heart from
                    which it had proceeded, forming a <hi rend="italic">simple circulation.</hi> In
                    man and the higher vertebrates the heart is a double organ, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> it consists of a right and left portion, intimately united to, but
                    not directly communicating with, each other. The blood which flows from its
                    right side passes through vessels which traverse the lungs, and is conveyed to
                    the left side of the heart; whilst the blood which flows from the left side
                    passes through vessels which traverse the body generally, and is conveyed to the
                    right side of the heart. This is called a <hi rend="italic">double
                    circulation;</hi> that which appertains to the lungs is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pulmonic circulation;</hi> that which appertains to the body generally is the
                    <hi rend="italic">systemic circulation.</hi> The vessels which carry the blood
                    away from the heart are called <hi rend="italic">arteries;</hi> those which
                    convey it back to the heart are <hi rend="italic">veins.</hi> The arteries and
                    veins do not communicate directly with each other, but through the
                    intermediation of a network of extremely minute vessels, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >capillaries.</hi> Hence, both in the pulmonary and systemic circulation, the
                    blood in its passage from the arteries into the veins must go through
                    capillaries. The blood which flows from the left side of the heart into the
                    systemic arteries is pure or arterial blood; as it traverses the systemic
                    capillaries it parts with certain of its constituents to nourish the organs and
                    tissues, and as it receives from them waste products it becomes impure blood; in
                    which condition it flows back to the right side of the heart by the systemic
                    veins as venous blood; hence the right side of the heart is often called the
                    venous side. The blood which flows from the right side of the heart along the
                    pulmonary artery is this impure blood; as it traverses the pulmonary capillaries
                    it is purified by the action of the air in the lungs, and is changed into
                    arterial or pure blood, in which condition it flows back by the pulmonary veins
                    to the left side of the heart, which consequently is called the arterial side.
                    The object of the pulmonary circulation, therefore, is to reconvert into pure
                    blood the blood which has been rendered impure during its passage through the
                    systemic capillaries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Heart.—</hi> The heart is a hollow muscle contained in the
                    cavity of the chest, and enclosed within a bag called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pericardium.</hi> The pericardium, with its enclosed heart, occupies the space
                    called <hi rend="italic">mediastinum,</hi> between the twc lungs; it lies
                    therefore behind the sternum, and in front of the spinal column, but projects
                    more to the left than to the right side of the mesial plane. The bag of the
                    pericardium is formed externally of a strong fibrous membrane, which is attached
                    below to the central tendon of the diaphragm, but blends above with the sheaths
                    of the great vessels which pass to and from the heart. When the bag is cut open
                    its inner surface is seen to possess a smooth glistening serous aspect, for it
                    is lined by a layer of squamous endothelium, which layer is continuous with the
                    serous membrane that invests the heart, and forms the visceral layer of the
                    pericardium. The continuity of the serous lining of the bag with the §erous
                    investment of the heart takes place where the great blood-vessels pierce the
                    fibrous bag.</p>
                <p>The heart lies obliquely from above downwards, from right to left, and from
                    behind forwards. For descriptive purposes it may be regarded as possessing a

                    the 5th and Gth left ribs. The heart has on its surface grooves which indicate
                    its division internally into four chambers, two in its right half, two in its
                    left half. The right chambers are the right auricle and right ventricle. The
                    left chambers are the left auricle and left ventricle. All these chambers are
                    lined by a smooth membrane, the <hi rend="italic">endocardium,,</hi> which is
                    continuous on the one hand with the lining membrane of the veins, on the other

                    above the diaphragm; it opens by a patent mouth into the upper and back part of
                    the sinus venosus. The <hi rend="italic">inferior vena cava</hi> conveys to the

                    pours into the auricle, and then flows into the right ventricle through a large
                    orifice of communication between them. The light auricle is separated by a
                    partition, the <hi rend="italic">auricular septum,</hi> from the left auricle.
                    On the surface of this septum is a depression, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">ovalis,</hi> surrounded by a raised border, the <hi
                    rend="italic">annulus</hi><hi rend="italic">ovalis,</hi> with which border the
                    inner end of the Eustachian valve is continuous. Before the birth of the child
                    the septum is perforated by a hole, called <hi rend="italic">foramen ovale,</hi>
                    through which the blood flows directly into the left auricle, but this foramen
                    is obliterated after the birth of the child.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Right Ventricle</hi> forms the right border, a large part
                    of the anterior surface, but only a small part of the posterior surface of the
                    heart. It is shaped somewhat like a flattened cone, its apex being directed
                    downwards towards the apex of the heart, its base to the corresponding auricle.
                    The inner surface of its wall is very irregular, owing to the muscular bundles
                    being elevated into strong ridges, called <hi rend="italic">columnoe
                    carneoe.</hi> Two, or it may be three, of these fleshy columns project like
                    nipples or big papillae into the cavity of the ventricle, and are called <hi
                    rend="italic">musculi papillares.</hi> Attached to the free apex of each
                    papillary muscle are several fibrous threads, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chordae</hi><hi rend="italic">tendineae,</hi> which, by their opposite
                    extremities, are connected to the segments of a large valve situated around the
                    opening between the right auricle and ventricle. The right auriculo-ventricular
                    opening, situated at the base of the ventricle, is sufficiently large to admit
                    three fingers, and possesses a valve which consists of three large pointed
                    segments or cusps (hence the name <hi rend="italic">tricuspid</hi> given to it),
                    between which three small intermediate cusps lie. One of the large cusps lies
                    opposite the anterior wall of the ventricle, another opposite the posterior,
                    whilst the third is between the auriculo-ventricular and pulmonary openings. The
                    cusps are flattened triangular folds of membrane connected by their bases around
                    the opening; when the valve is not in action the apex of each cusp hangs
                    pendulous in the ventricle: one surface is smooth, and looks to the cavity of
                    the ventricle, the other surface is rough and directed to its wall; to this
                    rough surface, to the apex, and to the edges of the cusp, the chordae tendineae
                    are attached. As tho musculi papillares, from which the chordae tendineae
                    spring, lie opposite the intervals between the cusps, the chordae tendineae from
                    any given papillary muscle divide themselves into two groups, one for each of
                    the two cusps between which it is situated. Attention has recently been drawn by
                    Rolleston to a band which passes from the base of the anterior papillary muscle
                    to the septal wall of the ventricle. As it prevents over-distension of the
                    ventricle, he has named it the <hi rend="italic">moderator band.</hi> The base
                    of this ventricle forms to the left and in front of the auriculo-ventricular
                    opening, a funnel-shaped prolongation, the <hi rend="italic">conus
                    arteriosus,</hi> from which the <hi rend="italic">pulmonary artery</hi> arises,
                    through the intermediation of a strong fibrous ring. Surrounding the mouth of
                    this artery is a valve called <hi rend="italic">semilunar,</hi> which consists
                    of three semilunar segments. Each segment is attached by its convex border to
                    the artery where it springs from the ventricle. The opposite border is free, and
                    possesses at its centre a minute nodule, the <hi rend="italic">corpus
                    Arantii,</hi> from which slender threads curve outwards at the free border and
                    in the substance of the valve to strengthen it. A thin lunated portion lies
                    immediately within the free border. One surface of the valve is convex, and
                    directed to the lumen <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the space contained by the
                    walls) of the artery; the other is concave, and directed to the wall of the
                    artery, and between it and the wall is a pouch named <hi rend="italic">sinus of
                    Valsalva.</hi> The pulmonary artery extends upwards and to the left for about If
                    inch, and then divides into two branches, one for each lung. The right ventricle
                    is completely separated from the left by the <hi rend="italic">ventricular
                    septum,</hi> which passes obliquely from left to right, and from before
                    backwards, so that it forms the posterior wall of the right ventricle and the
                    anterior wall of the left.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Left Auricle</hi> occupies the left part of the base of the
                    heart, and, like the right auricle, consists of a dilated <hi rend="italic"
                    >sinus</hi><hi rend="italic">venosus</hi> and an ear-shaped <hi rend="italic"
                    >auricula.</hi> Its muscular wall forms a smooth surface internally, except in
                    the auricula, where the ridge-shaped <hi rend="italic">musculi pectinati</hi>
                    occur. Opening into the sinus are the orifices of.the four <hi rend="italic"

                    the auricle is the large orifice of communication between it and the base of the
                    left ventricle.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Left Ventricle</hi> forms the left border, the apex, a
                    large part of the posterior surface, but only a small part of the anterior
                    surface of the heart. It is conical in form, its apex is at the apex of the
                    heart, the base at the corresponding auricle. As in the right ventricle, the
                    inner surface of its wall is elevated into fleshy columns, two of which project
                    like nipples into the cavity and form <hi rend="italic">musculi papillares,</hi>
                    which have <hi rend="italic">chordoe tendineoe</hi> connected with them. The
                    left auriculo-ventricular opening is large enough to admit &gt;two fingers. It
                    possesses a valve, which consists of two large pointed segments or cusps,
                    between which two small intermediate cusps lie, hence it is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">bicuspid valve;</hi> and as these cusps are placed one in front of
                    the other like the segments of a bishop’s mitre, the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >mitral valve</hi> is often given to it. The cusps agree in shape, general
                    arrangement, and mode of attachment with those of the tricuspid valve, but they
                    are stronger; and as the more anterior segment lies obliquely between the
                    auricular and aortic orifices, both its surfaces are smooth. From the base of
                    this ventricle the great systemic artery or <hi rend="italic">aorta</hi> arises
                    through the intermediation of a strong fibrous ring. The mouth of the aorta is
                    surrounded by a three segmented <hi rend="italic">semilunar valve,</hi> similar
                    to the semilunar pulmonary valve, but with thicker and stronger segments, and
                    possessing more strongly marked <hi rend="italic">sinuses of Valsalva.</hi> The
                    base of each ventricle has therefore two openings in it, one for communication
                    with the auricle, the other with the great artery arising from the ventricle.
                    The auriculo-ventricular openings are the most posterior, and almost in the same
                    plane; the aortic opening lies in front of the interval between the two
                    auriculo-ventricular, and the pulmonary opening is in front of the aortic.</p>
                <p>The walls of the cavities of the heart are formed of striped muscular fibre, over
                    the contractions of which the will exercises no control. The fibres are
                    collected into fasciculi, which have a reticulated arrangement, and the fibres
                    themselves branch and again unite to form a complicated network. The fibres of
                    the walls of the auricles are distinct from those of the ventricles, so that the
                    auricular and ventricular compartments are connected together, not by an
                    interchange of muscular tissue, but by an intermediate ring-like arrangement of
                    fibres of connective tissue. The muscular fasciculi of the auricles are arranged
                    in two strata. Tho deeper stratum consists of fibres proper to each auricle,
                    some of which run obliquely in the wall, others form the musculi pectinati,
                    surround the auricula, and are prolonged in rings into the coats of the venae
                    cavae and pulmonary veins, whilst fibres extend longitudinally and obliquely
                    along the wall of the coronary venous sinus. The superficial stratum consists of
                    fasciculi, which run obliquely from one auricle to the other on both the
                    anterior and posterior surfaces, and are said to be prolonged into the auricular
                    septum.</p>
                <p>The muscular wall of the ventricles is much thicker than that of the auricles,
                    and the wall of the left ventricle is about three times thicker than the right.
                    The fibres vary in their direction in different parts of the thickness of the
                    ventricular walls. The superficial external fibres run obliquely from above
                    downwards, and from right to left, and on the anterior surface of the ventricles
                    dip into the anterior ventricular groove to enter the septum, whilst on the
                    posterior surface they extend across the posterior ventricular groove; at the
                    apex of the heart they turn inwards in a whorl-like manner, and, as was known to
                    Lower and Gerdy, become continuous with superficial fibres on the inner wall of
                    the ventricle; at the base of the ventricles they turn round the border of the
                    auriculo-ventricular openings, and, as Pettigrew has shown, become continuous
                    with these superficial internal fibres, which run in the reverse direction. The
                    internal fibres are also prolonged into the musculi papillares, the chord®
                    tendineae springing from which serve therefore as tendons of insertion for these
                    muscles. If the substance of the wall be now dissected the fibres situated in
                    the centre of the wall are seen to lie in the horizontal plane. Various
                    anatomists have described these fibres of the ventricles as arranged in layers.
                    Lower recognised two layers spirally crossing each other; Haller, three; Wolff,
                    three in the right and six in the left ventricle. Pettigrew at one time believed
                    he could dissect nine layers, but has subsequently reduced the number to
                    seven—three external, a fourth or central, and three internal. He conceives that
                    the fibres of the three external layers run in a spiral direction from left to
                    right downwards, the first layer being more vertical than the second, and the
                    second than the third, whilst the fibres of the fourth or central layer are
                    horizontal. The three internal layers also run spirally, but in the reverse
                    direction from the external, with which they become continuous both at the base
                    and apex. The subdivision of the ventricular wall into such precise and
                    determinate layers as is implied in the descriptions of Pettigrew is, however,
                    to some extent an artificial procedure. There can be no doubt, as his
                    dissections so beautifully show, that the direction of the fibres in the
                    ventricular wall varies at different depths; but owing to the reticulated
                    arrangement of the fibres, not only are those connected together which lie in
                    one of the so-called layers, but they also anastomose with the fibres in the
                    layer contiguous to it on either aspect. Hence when one layer is peeled off,
                    that immediately subjacent exhibits, not a smooth face, which it would have done
                    had the definition of the layers been distinct, but a rough appearance, due to
                    the tearing through of intermediate connecting muscular fibres. Owing to these
                    connections the substance of the wall of the ventricle, as Henle’s dissections
                    show, may, with the exceptioħ of the superficial internal and external fibres,
                    be split up into lamellae, which extend either horizontally, obliquely, or in an
                    arched manner through the wall between its two surfaces; and the surfaces of
                    those lamellae are not parallel to the wall of the ventricle, but are directed
                    upwards and downwards.</p>
                <p>Except at the fibrous rings, where both the white and yellow fibres are distinct,
                    the connective tissue of the heart is small in quantity. The endocardial lining
                    consists of connective tissue with elastic fibres, with a layer of endothelium
                    on the free surface; and Schweigger-Seidel has also described smooth muscular
                    fibres in it. Hence, as Luschka has stated, the endocardium represents not
                    merely the inner coat of the blood-vessels but all the structures of the
                    vascular wall. Purkinje described fibres beneath the endocardium, which are now
                    regarded as imperfectly formed striated muscular fibres. The valves are folds of
                    the endocardium, enclosing fibres continuous with those in the fibrous rings:
                    the cuspidate auriculo-ventricular valves receive fibres from the chordae
                    tendineae.</p>
                <p>The heart is well supplied with blood, not by the blood which flows through its
                    cavities, but by two special coronary arteries which ramify in its walls, and
                    end in numerous capillaries lying between the fibres. From these capillaries the
                    coronary veins arise, which join to form the coronary venous sinus. Lymphatic
                    vessels occur both in the endocardium and pericardium, and apparently ramify in
                    the muscular wall. The nerves of the heart have been dissected especially by
                    Scarpa, Remak, Lee, and Pettigrew, and numerous small ganglia described in
                    connection with them (see p. 883).</p>

                    auriculo-ventricular openings, the valves of which open outwards, into the
                    ventricles. When the ventricles are distended their muscular walls contract and
                    force the blood into the arteries—the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery,
                    the left into the aorta—the valves at the mouth of each artery opening outwards
                    to allow of the free passage of the fluid. To prevent, during the ventricular
                    contraction, the regurgitation of blood into the auricles, the
                    auriculo-ventricular valves are floated away from the sides of the ventricle
                    across their respective openings, and by the apposition and slight overlapping
                    of their edges temporarily close the openings. The tilting upwards of the valves
                    into the auricles is prevented by the contraction of the musculi papillares, and
                    their connection with the cusps of the valve through the chordae tendineae.
                    Pettigrew has shown that casts of the ventricular cavities, more especially of
                    the left, have the form of a double cone, spirally twisted from right to left,
                    and has described the blood as forced in spiral streams against the under
                    surface of‘the segments of the valve, which are twisted and wedged into each
                    other so as to prevent regurgitation. The propulsion of the blood into the
                    arteries distends the elastic walls of those tubes; but when the ventricular
                    contraction has ceased, the elastic wall recoils, and the blood is propelled
                    onwards in the circulation. The regurgitation of the blood into the ventricles
                    is prevented by the closure of the semilunar valves, the segments of which are
                    thrown across the arterial orifices through the pressure exercised on the column
                    of blood in the lumen of the artery and in the sinuses of Valsalva.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Arteries.—</hi> These vessels were named arteries by the
                    older anatomists, on the supposition, now known to be erroneous, that they
                    contained air. The term is now employed to express a blood-vessel, which,
                    arising either directly or indirectly from the heart, conveys blood away from
                    that organ. Arteries divide and subdivide into smaller vessels in their course,
                    and to the individual branches descriptive names are applied. Some of these
                    names express the position of an artery, as subclavian, axillary; others, the
                    organ in which it is distributed, as pulmonary, hepatic; others a peculiarity in
                    its course, as circumflex, coronary. The branches of arteries may be either <hi

                    of the parent artery, which is the most common form, or by the breaking up of
                    the artery into a cluster of branches. Branches which arise either from the same
                    artery or from different arteries may be distributed in a common locality, may

                    >inosculation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">anastomosis,</hi> so that the blood from
                    one artery may thus flow from it into another. The most common anastomosis is by
                    the formation of loops between adjacent branches, but sometimes, as when the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> +</hi> ⅛vo vertebral arteries join to form the basilar, a
                    convergence of two almost straight arteries takes place; and in other cases, as
                    where the two anterior cerebral arteries are joined together by the anterior
                    communicating, a connecting branch passes transversely across the mesial plane.
                    A more complex form of anastomosis is when an artery (and a similar arrangement
                    is sometimes found in veins) rapidly subdivides into numerous branches, which
                    may again join to form a trunk either with or without the formation of a plexus.
                    This is called a <hi rend="italic">rete mirabile,</hi> an arrangement not
                    uncommon in the cetacea, in the internal carotid arteries of ruminants, in the
                    mesenteric arteries of the pig, in the arteries of the limbs of the sloths and
                    lemurs, and in the arterial system of fishes. The only examples of a rete in the
                    human body are the convoluted Malpighian tufts of the kidney and the arterial
                    distribution in the coccygeal body.</p>
                <p>The distribution of the pulmonary artery will be considered in the anatomy of the
                    lungs. That of the aorta will now be briefly described.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Aorta</hi> (Plate XX. figs. 2, 3, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a)</hi> lies in the cavities of the thorax and abdomen,and arises from the base
                    of the left ventricle. It ascends forwards, upwards, and to the right as far as
                    the level of the second right costal cartilage, then runs backwards and to the
                    left to reach the left side of the body of the 4th dorsal vertebra, and then
                    descends almost vertically to reach the left side of the body of the 5th dorsal
                    vertebra. It forms, therefore, an arch, well known as the <hi rend="italic">arch
                    of the aorta,</hi> which arches over the root of the left lung, and which has
                    attached to its concave surface a fibrous cord, known as the obliterated <hi
                    rend="italic">ductus arteriosus,</hi> which connects it with the left branch of
                    the pulmonary artery. The aorta continues its course downwards in close relation
                    to the bodies of the lower dorsal vertebrae, then passes through an opening in
                    the diaphragm, enters the abdomen, and descends in front of the bodies of the
                    lumbar vertebrae as low as the 4th, where it is usually described as dividing
                    into the two terminal branches, the common iliac arteries. At the angle of
                    bifurcation, however, a long slender artery, called the <hi rend="italic">middle
                    sacral,</hi> is prolonged downwards in front of the sacrum to the end of the
                    coccyx. In animals with long tails this artery can be recognised as a direct
                    continuation of the aorta, prolonging it downwards in front of the caudal
                    vertebrae, whilst the iliacs are seen to be collateral branches; but in man,
                    where the coccyx is rudimentary, and the lower limbs largely developed, the
                    iliac arteries which supply those limbs are so big as to obscure the true
                    signification of the middle sacral artery, and appear themselves to be the
                    terminal branches of the aorta. The branches which arise directly from the aorta
                    may be arranged in four groups.—1st, Branches for the supply of the viscera of
                    the thorax and abdomen proper; 2d, branches for the walls of the thorax,
                    abdomen, and pelvis; 3d, branches for the head, neck, and upper limbs; 4th,
                    branches for the lower limbs, pelvic walls, and viscera.</p>
                <p>The branches of the aorta which supply the viscera of the thorax are the
                    coronary, the oesophageal, the bronchial, and the pericardial. The <hi
                    rend="italic">coronary</hi> arteries, two in num ber, are the first branches of
                    the aorta, and arise opposite the right and left segments of the semilunar
                    valve, from the wall of the aorta, where it dilates into the sinuses of
                    Valsalva. The mouths of these arteries are closed by the opening outwards of the
                    aortic valves during the ventricular contraction. The elastic recoil of the
                    aorta following that contraction not only closes the aortic valves, but drives
                    the blood into the coronary arteries. These arteries break up into branches in
                    the muscular walls of the heart, and the sudden turgescence of its walls, which
                    results from the filling of these vessels, is, according to Brücke and Garrod,
                    the cause of the dilatation of the ventricular cavities.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">bronchial</hi> arteries are two in number <hi rend="italic"
                    >; one</hi> accompanies each bronchial tube, and supplies the tissues of the
                    lung.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">oesophageal</hi> arteries, three or four in number, supply
                    the coats of the oesophagus.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pericardial</hi> branches are very small arteries which
                    supply the back of the bag of the pericardium.</p>
                <p>The branches of the aorta which supply the viscera of the abdomen arise either
                    singly or in pairs. The single arteries are the coeliac axis, the superior
                    mesenteric, and the inferior mesenteric, which arise from the front of the
                    aorta; the pairs are the capsular, the two renal, and the two spermatic or
                    ovarian, which arise from its sides. The single arteries supply viscera which
                    are either completely or almost completely invested by the peritoneum, and the
                    veins corresponding to them are the roots of the vena portae. The pairs of
                    arteries supply viscera developed <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n964/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0964-0903"/> behind the peritoneum, and the veins
                    corresponding to them are rootlets of the inferior vena cava.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">coeliac</hi><hi rend="italic">axis</hi> is a thick, short
                    artery, which almost immediately divides into the coronary, hepatic, and splenic
                    branches. The <hi rend="italic">coronary</hi> artery subdivides into an
                    oesophageal branch for the lower end of the oesophagus, and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >gastric</hi> branch for the coats of the stomach. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >hepatic</hi> artery ends in the substance of the liver; but gives off a <hi
                    rend="italic">cystic</hi> branch to the gall bladder, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >pyloric</hi> branch to the stomach, a <hi rend="italic">gastro-duodenal</hi>
                    branch, which divides into a <hi rend="italic">superior
                    pancreatico-duodenal</hi> for the pancreas and duodenum, and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >right gastro-epiploic</hi> for the stomach and omentum. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >splenic</hi> artery ends in the substance of the spleen; but gives off <hi
                    rend="italic">pancreatic</hi> branches to the pancreas, <hi rend="italic">vasa
                    brevia</hi> to the great end of the stomach, and a <hi rend="italic">left
                    gastro-epiploic</hi> to the stomach and omentum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">superior mesenteric</hi> artery gives off an <hi
                    rend="italic">inferior pancreatico-duodenal</hi> branch to the pancreas and
                    duodenum; about twelve <hi rend="italic">intestinal</hi> branches to the small
                    intestines, which form in the substance of the mesentery a series of arches
                    before they end in the wall of the intestines; an <hi rend="italic"
                    >ileocolic</hi> branch to the end of the ileum, the caecum, and beginning of the
                    colon; a <hi rend="italic">right colic</hi> branch to the ascending colon; and a
                    <hi rend="italic">middle colic</hi> branch to the transverse colon.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">inferior mesenteric</hi> artery gives off a <hi
                    rend="italic">left colic</hi> branch to the descending colon, a <hi
                    rend="italic">sigmoid</hi> branch to the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and ends
                    in the <hi rend="italic">superior hcemorrhoidal</hi> artery which supplies the
                    rectum. The arteries which supply the coats of the alimentary tube from the
                    oesophagus to the rectum anastomose freely with each other in the wall of the
                    tube, or in its mesenteric attachment, and the anastomoses are usually by the
                    formation of arches or loops between adjacent branches.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">capsular arteries,</hi> small in size, run outwards from
                    the aorta to end in the supra-renal capsules.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">renal</hi> arteries pass one to each kidney, in which they
                    for the most part end, but in the substance of the organ they give off small <hi
                    rend="italic">perforating</hi> branches, which pierce the capsule of the kidney,
                    and are distributed in the surrounding fat.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">spermatic</hi> arteries are two long slender arteries,
                    which descend, one in each spermatic cord, into the scrotum to supply the
                    testicle. The corresponding arteries in the female, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ovarian,</hi> do not leave the abdomen; they supply the ovaries.</p>
                <p>The branches of the aorta which supply the walls of the thorax, abdomen, and
                    pelvis, are the intercostal, the lumbar, the phrenic, and the middle sacral.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">intercostal</hi> arteries arise from the back of the
                    thoracic aorta, and are usually ten pairs. They run down the sides of the
                    vertebral bodies as far as the commencement of the intercostal spaces, when each
                    divides into a <hi rend="italic">dorsal</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">proper
                    intercostal</hi> branch; the dorsal branch passes to the back of the thorax to
                    supply the deep muscles of the spine; the proper intercostal branch runs
                    outwards in the intercostal space to supply its muscles, and the lower pairs of
                    intercostals also give branchée to the diaphragm and wall of the abdomen.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lumbar</hi> arteries arise from the back of the abdominal
                    aorta, and are usually four pairs. They run down the sides of the lumbar
                    vertebrae, and divide into <hi rend="italic">a dorsal</hi> branch, which
                    supplies the deep muscles of the back of the loins, and an <hi rend="italic"
                    >abdominal</hi> branch which runs outwards to supply the wall of the abdomen.
                    The distribution of the lumbar and intercostal arteries exhibits a
                    transversely-segmented arrangement of the vascular system, similar to the
                    transversely-segmented arrangement of the bones, muscles, and nerves met with in
                    these localities, but more especially in the thoracic region.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">phrenic</hi> arteries, two in number, pass to supply the
                    under surface of the diaphragm.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">middle sacral</hi> artery, as already stated, is rather the
                    continuation of the aorta than a branch. As it runs down the front of the sacrum
                    it gives branches to the back of the pelvic wall.</p>
                <p>The statement has frequently been made that the visceral and parietal branches of
                    the aorta do not anastomose with each other. Injections made by Turner have,
                    however, shown that, both in the thoracic and abdominal cavities, slender
                    anastomosing communications exist between the two sets of branches. In the
                    abdominal cavity a wide meshed plexus of small arteries, named by him <hi
                    rend="italic">sub-</hi> or <hi rend="italic">extra-peritoneal</hi> plexus, lies
                    in the fat outside the peritoneum. It communicates, on the one hand, with the
                    perforating branches of the renal arteries and with slender branches of the
                    capsular, spermatic, colic, and pancreatic arteries, and in the region of the
                    diaphragm with the hepatic artery. On the other hand, it communicates with the
                    phrenic arteries, the lower intercostals, the lumbar branches of the aorta, and
                    with the ilio-lumbar, circumflex ilii, and epigastric branches of the iliac
                    arteries, which also go to the wall of the abdomen. In the pelvis also the
                    visceral superior haemorrhoidal artery anastomoses with the middle and lateral
                    sacral arteries. The extra-peritoneal plexus supplies the fat and lymphatic
                    glands lying outside the peritoneum, and it also gives origin to <hi
                    rend="italic">vasa vasorum</hi> for the coats of the aorta and vena cava. This
                    plexus may, when the visceral branches of the aorta are obstructed, aid in an
                    important manner in carrying on the circulation. In a subject examined by J.
                    Chiene, in the dissecting room of the University of Edinburgh, where the coeliac
                    axis and the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries were obliterated at their
                    origins, the blood flowed into these arteries and the viscera they supplied
                    through a great enlargement of the arteries of this plexus. In the thoracic
                    cavity a similar plexus, named the <hi rend="italic">extra-pleural</hi> plexus,
                    lies between the pleura and pericardium, which communicates on the one hand with
                    the internal mammary arteries, and on the other passes in front of the root of
                    the lung to join the bronchial system of vessels. Another portion of this plexus
                    joins on the one hand the intercostal arteries near the dorsal vertebrae, and on
                    the other passes to the lung at the back of its root.</p>
                <p>The branches for the head, neck, and upper limbs arise as three large arteries
                    from the transverse part of the aorta; they are named arteria innominata, left
                    common carotid, and left subclavian. The <hi rend="italic">arteria
                    innominata</hi> is the largest; it passes, upwards and to the right, to the root
                    of the neck, and then divides into the right common carotid and the right
                    subclavian. The carotid arteries supply the two sides of the head and neck; the
                    subclavian arteries the two upper extremities.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">subclavian</hi> artery is the commencement of the great
                    arterial trunk for the upper limb. It passes across the root of the neck and
                    under the clavicle, when it enters the armpit, and becomes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >axillary</hi> artery; by that name it extends as far as the posterior fold of
                    the axilla, when it enters the upper arm, takes the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >brachial</hi> or <hi rend="italic">humeral</hi> artery, and courses as far as
                    the bend of the elbow, where it bifurcates into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >radial</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ulnar</hi> arteries. From the subclavian part
                    of the trunk the following branches arise :— <hi rend="italic">a,
                    Vertebral,</hi> which enters the foramen at the root of the transverse process

                    of the atlas, and enters the skull through the foramen magnum, where it joins
                    its fellow to form the <hi rend="italic">basilar</hi> artery; it gives off <hi
                    rend="italic">muscular</hi> branches to the deep muscles of the neck, <hi

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ιdnar</hi> artery extends down the ulnar side of the front

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">common carotid</hi> artery runs up the neck by the side of
                    the windpipe, and on a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage
                    divides into the internal and external carotid arteries.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">internal carotid</hi> artery ascends through the carotid
                    canal in the temporal bone into the cranial cavity. It gives off an <hi
                    rend="italic">ophthalmic</hi> branch to the eyeball and other contents of the
                    orbit, and then divides into the <hi rend="italic">anterior</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">middle cerebral</hi> arteries. The middle cerebral artery extends
                    outwards into the Sylvian fissure, and supplies the island of Reil, the orbital
                    part, and the outer face of the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, and the
                    temporo-sphenoidal lobe; it also gives a choroid branch to the choroid plexus of
                    the velum interpositum. The anterior cerebral artery supplies the inner face of
                    the hemisphere from the anterior end of the frontal lobe as far back as the
                    internal parieto-occipital fissure. At the base of the brain not only do the two
                    internal carotids anastomose with each other through the <hi rend="italic"
                    >anterior communicating</hi> artery, which passes between their anterior
                    cerebral branches, but the internal carotid on each side anastomoses with the
                    posterior cerebral branch of the basilar, by a <hi rend="italic">posterior
                    communicating</hi> artery. In this manner a vascular circle, the <hi
                    rend="italic">circle of Willis,</hi> is formed, which permits of freedom of the
                    arterial circulation by the anastomoses between arteries not only on the same
                    side, but on opposite sides of the mesial plane. The vertebral and internal
                    carotid arteries, which are the arteries of supply for the brain, are
                    distinguished by lying at some depth from the surface in their course to the
                    organ, by having curves or twists in their course, whereby the force of the flow
                    of blood is retarded, and by the absence of large collateral branches. Further,
                    as the ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid, the circulation in
                    the eyeball is in sympathy with that in the brain.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">external carotid</hi> artery ascends through the upper part
                    of the side of the neck, and behind the lower jaw into the parotid gland, where
                    it divides into the internal maxillary and temporal branches. This artery gives
                    off the following branches :— <hi rend="italic">a, Superior thyroid</hi> to the
                    larynx and thyroid body; <hi rend="italic">b, Lingual</hi> to the muscles and
                    mucous membrane of the tongue, and to the sublingual gland; <hi rend="italic">c,
                    Facial</hi> to the face, palate, tonsil, and sub-maxillary gland; <hi
                    rend="italic">d, Occipital</hi> to the sterno-mastoid muscle and back of the
                    scalp; <hi rend="italic">e, Posterior auricular</hi> to the back of the ear and
                    the adjacent part of the scalp; <hi rend="italic">f, Superficial temporal</hi>
                    to the scalp in front of the ear, and by its <hi rend="italic">transverse
                    facial</hi> branch to the back part of the face; <hi rend="italic">g, Internal
                    maxillary,</hi> giving <hi rend="italic">muscular</hi> branches to the muscles
                    of mastication, <hi rend="italic">meningeal</hi> branches to the dura mater, <hi
                    rend="italic">dental</hi> branches to the teeth, and other branches to the nose,
                    palate, and tympanum; A, <hi rend="italic">Ascending pharyngeal,</hi> which
                    gives branches to the pharynx, palate, and tonsils.</p>
                <p>. The <hi rend="italic">common iliac</hi> artery, after a short course, divides
                    into the internal and external iliac arteries. The <hi rend="italic">internal
                    iliac</hi> enters the pelvis and divides into branches for the supply of the
                    pelvic walls and viscera, including the organs of generation, and for the great
                    muscles of the buttock. The <hi rend="italic">external iliac</hi> descends
                    behind Poupart’s ligament into the thigh, where it takes the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">femoral</hi> artery. The femoral descends along the front and
                    inner surface of the thigh, gives off a <hi rend="italic">profunda</hi> or deep
                    branch, which, by its <hi rend="italic">circumflex</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >perforating</hi> branches, supplies the numerous muscles of the thigh; most of
                    these extend to the back of the limb to carry blood to the muscles situated
                    there. Tho femoral artery then runs to the back of the limb in the ham, where it
                    is called <hi rend="italic">popliteal</hi> artery. The popliteal divides into
                    two branches, of which one, called <hi rend="italic">anterior tibial,</hi>
                    passes between the bones to the front of the leg, and then downwards to the
                    upper surface of the foot; the other, <hi rend="italic">posterior tibial,</hi>
                    continues down the back of the leg to the sole of the foot, and divides into the
                    <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">external plantar</hi>
                    arteries; branches proceed from the external plantar<pb break="no"

                    the <hi rend="italic">digital</hi> arteries. From the largo arterial trunks in
                    the leg many branches proceed, to carry blood to the different structures in the
                    limb.</p>
                <p>The wall of an artery consists of several coats. The outermost is the <hi
                    rend="italic">hιnica adventitia,</hi> composed of connective tissue; immediately
                    internal to this is the <hi rend="italic">yellow elastic</hi> coat; within this
                    again the <hi rend="italic">muscular coat,</hi> formed of involuntary muscular
                    tissue, the contractile fibro-cells of which are for the most part arranged
                    transversely to the long axis of the artery; in the larger arteries the elastic
                    coat is much thicker than the muscular, but in the smaller arteries the muscular
                    coat is relatively strong; the vaso-motor nerves terminate in the muscular coat.
                    Internal to the muscular coat is the <hi rend="italic">elastic fenestrated
                    coat,</hi> formed of a smooth elastic membrane perforated by small apertures.
                    Most internal of all is a layer of <hi rend="italic">endothelial cells,</hi>
                    which form the free surface over which the blood flows. The arteries are not
                    nourished by the blood which flows through them, but by minute vessels, <hi
                    rend="italic">vasa vasorum,</hi> distributed in their external, elastic, and
                    muscular coats.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Capillaries.—</hi> These are the minute tubes which connect
                    together the terminal branches of the arteries and the rootlets of the veins.
                    They vary in diameter in different localities from <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>
                    ∙g⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th to 33⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> th inch.
                    They are arranged in more or less compact networks, which lie in the interstices
                    between the tissues of the part or organ. The vascularity of a tissue depends
                    upon the relative proportion of the capillaries that it contains. Some tissues,
                    as adult cartilage, the cornea, epithelium, and endothelium, are destitute of
                    capillaries, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> are non-vascular. The capillary wall
                    is very simple in structure: in the smallest capillaries it consists merely of a
                    layer υi endothelial cells, continuous with the endothelial lining of the
                    arteries and veins; in the larger capillaries a delicate tunica adventitia is
                    superadded. The transition from a capillary to a small artery or a small vein is
                    marked by the development of a muscular and an elastic coat in the wall of the
                    blood-conveying tube.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Veins.—</hi> The veins convey the blood from the periphery
                    back to the heart, and in their course increase in size, by junction or
                    anastomosis with each other. In most of the veins delicate valves are found,
                    each of which consists of two semicircular segments, and a pouch-like dilatation
                    of the wall of the vein is opposite each segment. When the blood flows along the
                    veins, the valves lie against the wall of the vessel, but if pressure be applied
                    to a vein so as to obstruct the onward flow of the circulation, then the blood
                    passes into the pouch between the wall of the vein and the valve adjacent to the
                    seat of pressure, when the valve closes so as to stop regurgitation. The valves
                    are found especially in those veins where the circulation is likely to be
                    interfered with either by the pressure of the muscles on the veins during their
                    action, or by the pressure of blood caused by gravity, and are usually seated at
                    the points of confluence of veins. They are absent in the veins of the lungs, of
                    the brain, and of several of the abdominal viscera. Some of the veins lie in the
                    subcutaneous fat, and are called <hi rend="italic">superficial</hi> veins,
                    others lie amidst the muscles, and form the <hi rend="italic">deep</hi> veins.
                    The deep veins accompany the arteries and are named after them; the superficial
                    veins do not accompany arteries; frequent anastomoses take place between the
                    superficial and deep veins.</p>
                <p>The veins are arranged primarily into two groups—the Pulmonary veins and the
                    Systemic veins. The distribution of the pulmonary veins will be given in the
                    anatomy of the lungs.</p>
                <p>The Systemic veins consist of the coronary venous system; of the system of the
                    superior vena cava; of the system of the inferior vena cava; and associated with
                    the inferior vena cava is the portal venous system. The arrangement of the <hi
                    rend="italic">coronary vein</hi> has been described in the anatomy of the
                    heart.</p>
                <p>The system of the <hi rend="italic">Superior Vena Cava</hi> consists of both
                    superficial and deep veins, and is arranged as follows :—</p>
                <p>The superficial veins of the hand commence at the tips and sides of the fingers,
                    from which they proceed along tho back of the hand, beneath the skin of which
                    they may be distinctly seen. They then ascend along the fore-arm, forming three
                    large veins: the <hi rend="italic">radial,</hi> on the outer side; the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulnar,</hi> on the inner; and the <hi rend="italic">median,</hi>
                    in the middle of the front of the fore-arm. At the bend of the elbow the median
                    divides into two branches, of which one joins the radial to form the <hi
                    rend="italic">cephalic,</hi> the other joins the ulnar to form the <hi
                    rend="italic">basilic.</hi> Into one or other of the two branches of the median
                    the surgeon generally makes an opening when he is desirous of drawing blood from
                    the patient. The cephalic and basilic veins terminate by joining the deep or <hi
                    rend="italic">axillary</hi> vein. The communications between the superficial and
                    deep veins are not, however, confined to the point of termination of the former,
                    but occur at various parts of their course.</p>
                <p>The deep veins of the hand commence at the tips of the fingers, and pass as <hi
                    rend="italic">digital</hi> veins up the sides of the fingers to the palm of the
                    hand, where they form an arch corresponding to the arterial arch of the palm;
                    from this they extend upwards along the front of the fore arm, as far as the
                    bend of the elbow, closely accompanying the arteries of the fore-arm, and
                    receiving from the muscles numerous small branches corresponding to the small
                    arteries sent to those muscles. At the bend of the elbow two <hi rend="italic"
                    >brachial</hi> veins result from the junction of these different veins of the
                    fore-arm, which pass up the inner side of the upper-arm, closely accompanying
                    the brachial artery as far as the armpit, where they join to form a single large
                    vein, the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n967/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0967-0906"/><hi rend="italic">axillary.</hi> They receive in
                    their course many small branches from the muscles. The axillary vein also
                    receives the cephalic and basilic veins. Thus, a single large trunk conveys away
                    all the blood that has been circulating through the upper limb. This large vein
                    passes as the <hi rend="italic">subclavian</hi> Fein behind the clavicle, and
                    reaches the lower part of the aide of the neck, where it is joined by the large
                    veins that return the blood from the head and neck.</p>
                <p>The veins that return the blood from the inner and outer parts of the head and
                    neck are called the <hi rend="italic">external</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >internal jugular</hi> veins. The external is the smaller, and may commonly be
                    seen beneath the skin on the side of the neck. It returns the blood that has
                    been circulating on the outer part of the head, and must be regarded as a
                    superficial vein. The internal jugular returns the blood that has been
                    circulating on the face, in the brain, and cranial blood-sinuses, and in the
                    deeper parts of the neck. It accompanies the carotid artery, and must thus be
                    regarded as a deep vein. By the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins at
                    the root of the neck a large <hi rend="italic">brachio-cephalic</hi> vein on
                    each side is formed; these gradually converge, join, and form a single trunk,
                    the superior vena cava, which, after a short course, enters the upper part of
                    the right auricle of the heart. The veins corresponding to the intercostal
                    arteries, which run between the ribs, do not open directly into either the
                    superior or inferior vena cava, but pass to form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >azygos</hi> vein, which begins in the cavity of the abdomen, then enters the
                    cavity of the chest, and, as it courses upwards, gradually increases in size by
                    receiving the various intercostal veins, until it finally terminates by joining
                    the superior vena cava.</p>
                <p>The system of the <hi rend="italic">Inferior Vena Cava</hi> consists of both
                    superficial and deep veins, and is arranged as follows :— The superficial veins
                    of the foot are separated from the deep veins by the strong membrane or fascia
                    which binds down the muscles. They commence by very fine branches arising from
                    the capillaries of the skin. On the back of the foot the digital veins
                    proceeding from the skin of the toes form an arch, from the inner side of which
                    a vein, called the <hi rend="italic">long saphena,</hi> arises. This passes
                    upwards along the inner side of the leg and thigh, increasing considerably in
                    size in its course, owing to the number of veins joining it from the extensive
                    surface of the skin of the limb. It terminates, at the upper part of the thigh,
                    by passing through a hole in the fascia, and joins the femoral vein. From the
                    outer side of the same arch arises the <hi rend="italic">external saphenous</hi>
                    vein, which runs up the back of the leg to the ham, and pierces the fascia to
                    join the popliteal vein. The deep veins begin both on the back of the foot and
                    in the sole. Those which arise on the back of the foot form the <hi
                    rend="italic">anterior tibial</hi> veins, and accompany the anterior tibial
                    artery; they receive a considerable number of branches in their upward course,
                    which proceed from the great mass of muscles lying on the outer side of the leg.
                    The veins which begin in the sole of the foot accompany the plantar arteries,
                    and then pass upwards, along the inner side, of the ankle-joint, to reach the
                    back of the leg, along which they ascend as the <hi rend="italic">posterior
                    tibial</hi> veins, closely accompanying the posterior tibial artery, and
                    receiving in their course numerous small veins that proceed from the muscles of
                    the calf of the leg. At the upper part of the leg the anterior tibial veins pass
                    to the back of the leg, and join the posterior tibial veins. The large <hi
                    rend="italic">popliteal</hi> vein <hi rend="subscript">?</hi> formed by their
                    junction, ascends behind the knee-joint, lying in the ham, along with the
                    popliteal artery. It leaves the upper part of this space, and, passing to the
                    inner side of the thigh, ascends as the <hi rend="italic">femoral</hi> vein
                    along with the femoral artery as far as Poupart’s ligament, when it enters the
                    cavity of the abdomen. At the upper part of the thigh it receives the <hi
                    rend="italic">profunda</hi> vein, corresponding to the deep artery of the thigh,
                    which conveys bacl the blood that has been carried by that vessel to the
                    numerous large and important muscles of the thigh. The femoral vein is also
                    joined at this spot by the long saphena vein. When the femoral vein enters the
                    cavity of the abdomen it becomes the <hi rend="italic">external</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">iliac</hi> vein. The external iliac vein receives the smaller
                    veins which ramify in the lower part of the walls of the abdomen, as well as the
                    large <hi rend="italic">internal iliac</hi> vein, which corresponds to the
                    internal iliac artery, and by their junction the <hi rend="italic">common
                    iliac</hi> vein is formed. The two common iliac veins gradually converge, and,
                    about the level of the last vertebra of the loins, join to form a single large
                    vein, the inferior vena cava. The inferior vena cava ascends at the back of the
                    abdominal cavity lying on the right side of the aorta. Several veins open into
                    it; some corresponding with the parietal branches of the abdominal aorta, others
                    with the capsular, renal, and spermatic arteries. The greater number of the
                    veins proceeding from the organs contained in the cavity of the abdomen do not
                    open directly into the vena cava, but form a large vein called <hi rend="italic"
                    >portal.</hi> The vena cava passes through the diaphragm, enters the cavity of
                    the chest, and terminates by opening into the right auricle of the heart.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Portal</hi> system of veins is formed by the veins which
                    proceed from the large and small intestines, from the stomach, pancreas, and
                    spleen; they form the <hi rend="italic">inferior mesenteric, superior
                    mesenteric, splenic,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gastric</hi> veins, which join
                    together in the neighbourhood of the pancreas to form the portal venous trunk.
                    The portal vein then ascends to the under surface of the liver, which it enters
                    at the portal transverse fissure. In the substance of the liver it subdivides
                    into branches just like an artery, and the finest branches terminate in the
                    lobules of the liver in a plexus of capillaries.- From this plexus the rootlets
                    of the hepatic veins arise, which joining together form the large <hi
                    rend="italic">hepatic</hi> vein, which opens into the inferior vena cava before
                    it pierces the diaphragm. Retzius has pointed out that an extra-peritoneal
                    venous plexus exists in the abdominal cavity, which connects the rootlets of the
                    portal vein with those of the veins of the parietes of the abdomen.</p>
                <p>The wall of a vein possesses the same number of coats as that of an artery, but
                    the coats are thinner. Veins are also extensively provided with valves, which
                    are absent from the arteries except at the mouths of the aorta and pulmonary
                    artery.</p>

                    lymphatics are tubes with delicate transparent walls, which convey the fluid
                    called lymph and chyle. They arise in the tissues and terminate by joining the
                    venous system, so that their contained fluid flows towards the heart. They
                    resemble veins in having a course from periphery to centre; in possessing
                    valves, which are generally two in number and semilunar in shape; in being
                    divided into a superficial and a deep set—the superficial lymphatics being
                    situated, like the superficial veins, in the subcutaneous tissue; the deep
                    lymphatics accompanying the arteries and deep veins. Lymphatics differ, however,
                    from veins in possessing in their course glandular enlargements, in having
                    thinner coats, in being almost uniform in size, and not uniting into larger
                    vessels as they pass onwards in their course. As a rule they are like fine
                    threads, and their main trunk, the thoracic duct, is not bigger than a
                    crow-quill. The lymph-vessels are divided into lacteal or chyle vessels and
                    lymphatics proper.</p>

                    into the lumen of the boweL The lacteals from adjacent villi form a network in
                    the submucous coat of the intestine, from which larger lacteals arise, which
                    pierce the muscular coat, and then run between the folds of the mesentery to the
                    posterior wall of the abdomen, where, opposite the body of the first lumbar
                    vertebra, they join the deep lymphatic vessels of the abdomen to form the
                    thoracic duct.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lymphatic vessels proper</hi> correspond so closely in
                    their distribution in the extremities and in the head and neck with the veins of
                    those parts, that a special description of their arrangement is nob necessary,
                    the more so as a general representation of these vessels is given in Plate XXI.
                    The superficial and deep lymphatics of the lower limbs enter the abdominal
                    cavity, and are joined by the lymphatics of the pelvis. They ascend in front of
                    the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, join the lacteal vessels to form the
                    thoracic duct, the place of junction being marked by a dilatation of the duct
                    called <hi rend="italic">receptaculum chyli.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">thoracic
                    duct</hi> passes through the opening in the diaphragm which transmits the aorta,
                    ascends in front of the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae, receives in its course
                    the deep lymphatics of the left half of the chest, reaches the root of the neck
                    on the left side, is joined there by the deep and superficial lymphatics of the
                    left upper limb and left side of the head and neck, and opens into the great
                    veins at the angle of junction between the left internal jugular and subclavian.
                    This duct conveys, therefore, the chyle during digestion, and the lymph
                    contained in the lymph-vessels below the diaphragm and in the lymph-vessels
                    situated to the left side of the mesial plane in the parts of the body above the
                    diaphragm. The lymph-vessels on the right side of the supra-diaphragmatic parts
                    of the mesial plane do not join the thoracic duct, but converge to the root of
                    the neck on the right side, where they join to form the <hi rend="italic">right
                    lymphatic duct,</hi> which opens into the angle of junction of the right
                    internal jugular and subclavian veins.</p>
                <p>The mode of origin of the lymph-vessels has long been a vexed question amongst
                    anatomists. The lacteal vessels were at one time supposed to arise by open
                    mouths on the free surface of the intestinal villi, and this idea has been
                    revived in a modified form by some recent observers, who conceive that the
                    lacteals are continuous with a network formed by the anastomoses of processes
                    proceeding from the deep ends of the goblet cells, the mouths of which cells
                    open on the free surface of the villus. The lymph-vessels proper are in some
                    localities continuous with the serous cavities (p. 848); in others they arise
                    within the textures and organs. The most minute lymph-vessels, called
                    lymphcapillaries, like the blood-capillaries, have walls formed of a single
                    layer of elongated endothelial cells. These capillaries take their rise in the
                    connective tissue of a part or organ, and probably spring from spaces, or
                    juice-canals, between the bundles of the connective tissue, which bundles are
                    invested by an endothelial layer of cells. The juice canals are, therefore, a
                    network of minute canals, situated outside the blood-vessels, which allow the
                    tissues to be permeated by a nutrient juice derived from the blood.</p>
                <p>In some localities, as the brain and eyeball, the bloodvessels have been
                    described as enclosed in tubular spaces, called <hi rend="italic">peri-vascular
                    canals,</hi> in which cells like the corpuscles of the lymph have been seen, and
                    which are believed to be continuous with the lymphatic system. The researches of
                    Ludwig and some of his pupils into the minute structure of the lachrymal gland,
                    the glands of the skin, and the testis, have shown that lymph-capillaries lie in
                    close relation to the secreting structures of these glands.</p>
                <p>The coats of the lymph-vessels resemble in structure those of the veins, but they
                    are thinner and more transparent. The valves are small and numerous.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lymphatic glands</hi> are small bodies, varying in size
                    from a pea to an almond, situated in the course of the lymph-vessels in several
                    regions of the body. They are found especially in the groin, armpit, mesentery,
                    back of the abdomen, roots of the lungs, and side of the neck (Plate XXI.)
                    Entering one end of each gland are lymph-vessels, named <hi rend="italic">vasa
                    afferentia,</hi> and emerging from the opposite end of the gland are the
                    lymph-vessels named <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia.</hi> Each gland is
                    invested by a capsule of connective tissue, which sends processes into the
                    substance of the gland to divide it into compartments; it consists of adenoid
                    tissue, and the meshes of its retiform connective tissue contain multitudes of
                    lymph corpuscles. Each -gland is permeated by a network of minute canals, which
                    are continuous with both the vasa afferentia and efferentia; the gland,
                    therefore, is traversed by a stream of lymph which washes the lymph corpuscles
                    out of the meshes of the reticulum, and in this manner these corpuscles find
                    their way into the lymph. The lymph glands are, therefore, centres of origin for
                    the lymph corpuscles. The collections of adenoid tissue, forming the solitary
                    and Peyer’s glands of the intestine, and found in the tonsils and other
                    localities (p. 849), are also without doubt centres of formation for the lymph
                    corpuscles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Blood-Vascular Glands.</hi> —Intimately associated with the
                    vascular system are certain organs to which the names of blood-vascular glands,
                    or glands without ducts, are applied. These organs are the spleen, the thyroid
                    gland, the thymus gland, the suprarenal capsules, and portions of the pituitary
                    and pineal glands. The <hi rend="italic">Spleen</hi> is situated in the cavity
                    of the abdomen between the stomach and the diaphragm. It is invested by
                    peritoneum, and has a fibroelastic coat in which involuntary muscular
                    fibro-cells are formed. This coat sends multitudes of fine trabeculae-into the
                    interior of the organ, which subdivide it into numbers of minute compartments,
                    in which the red, highly vascular spleen pulp is contained. This pulp consists
                    of collections of small spherical masses of adenoid tissue, forming the
                    Malpighian corpuscles, of the terminal branches of the splenic blood-vessels,
                    and of the lymph-vessels, together with numerous cells, some of which are red
                    blood corpuscles, others lymph corpuscles, others contain pigment granules or
                    fat, others contain in their interior numerous blood corpuscles. The arteries of
                    the spleen in part end in capillaries from which the veins arise, but more
                    frequently they open into lacunae or blood spaces, which give origin to the
                    veins. The <hi rend="italic">Thymus gland,</hi> best seen in infancy and
                    childhood, lies in the cavity of the thorax near the base of the heart. It
                    consists of two lobes, each of which is composed of lobules of adenoid tissue,
                    to which numerous lymphvessels may be traced. In the adult it is converted into
                    a mass of fat. The <hi rend="italic">Thyroid gland</hi> is situated in the neck
                    at the front and sides of the windpipe. It consists of multitudes of minute
                    closed follicles, each of which is lined by a layer of cells. The <hi

                    above each kidney. They contain cells, some of which are arranged in columns,
                    others in a reticulated manner, and are well provided with bloodvessels, nerves,
                    and lymphatics.</p>

                    mesoblast lose their original spherical form and become stellate’, the processes
                    of adjacent cells unite together and form a network, and the nuclei rapidly
                    increase in numbers. The peripheral part of the protoplasm of the stellate cells
                    differentiates into a wall of nucleated protoplasm, and forms the wall of the
                    blood-vessels, whilst the central part of the protoplasm liquefies, and the
                    nuclei contained in it become the bloodcorpuscles. If the vessel remains as a
                    capillary, its wall assumes merely the character of a single layer of
                    endothelial<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0971-0908"/> cells; but if it becomes an artery or a vein, a
                    further differentiation of the mesoblast cells into the muscular and elastic
                    coats and the tunica adventitia takes place. The heart appears immediately below
                    the head in the form of a collection of cells in the splanchnopleure layer of
                    the mesoblast. It is believed that these cells form in the first instance a
                    solid mass, the central part of which liquefies to form blood and
                    blood-corpuscles, whilst the peripheral cells form the wall of a tube. The heart
                    tube now presents two constrictions, which indicate its division into an <hi
                    rend="italic">auricle,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">ventricle,</hi> and a <hi
                    rend="italic">bulbus</hi><hi rend="italic">arteriosus.</hi> The single ventricle
                    then subdivides into two by the gradual growth of the septum from the apex to
                    the base, and about the eighth week of embryo-life the right and left ventricles
                    are completely separated from each other. A septum then begins to form in the
                    originally single auricle, but its growth is not completed until after the birth
                    of the child, so that during foetal life the cavities of the right and left
                    auricles communicate with each other through a hole in the septum, named <hi
                    rend="italic">foramen ovale.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">primitive</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aortoe,</hi> right and left, arise from the ductus arteriosus, and
                    extend upwards to the 1st pair of visceral arches, into which they pass and arch
                    backwards to the sides of the spinal column, where they form the <hi
                    rend="italic">dorsal</hi><hi rend="italic">aortoe.</hi> Four additional pairs of
                    arterial arches then spring from the primitive aortae below the 1st pair, and
                    the whole are enumerated from above downwards as the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th
                    pairs of vascular arches. Each arch communicates behind with the dorsal aorta of
                    its own side. The two dorsal aortae then approximate and blend with each other
                    to form the descending thoracic and tho abdominal aorta. A longitudinal septum
                    also forms within the bulbus arteriosus itself, which divides it into two
                    vessels: the one, the ascending aorta, becoming continuous with the cavity of
                    the leftventricle and with the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th pairs of vascular arches,
                    the other, the pulmonary artery, becoming continuous with the cavity of the
                    right ventricle and with the 5th pair of vascular arches. The 4th left vascular
                    arch enlarges to form the transverse part of the arch of the aorta, and the left
                    subclavian artery springs as a collateral branch from it. The 4th right arch
                    forms the innominate, and the com mencement of the right subclavian artery. The
                    3d pair of arches form the two internal carotid arteries; each common carotid is
                    formed from the part of the primitive aorta which connects the 3d and 4th arches
                    with each other; whilst the external carotid is an enlargement of that part of
                    the primitive aorta which runs upwards from the 3d to the 1st visceral arch.
                    From the 5th left vascular arch, which is now continuous with the pulmonary
                    artery, two collateral branches arise, which proceed one to each lung, and form
                    the right and left pulmonary arteries, whilst the terminal part of this arch
                    joins the end of the transverse part of the arch of the aorta, and forms the <hi
                    rend="italic">ductus arteriosus.</hi> During foetal life, the lungs being
                    inactive, the blood of the right ventricle which passes into the pulmonary
                    artery almost entirely flows through the ductus arteriosus into the aorta. But
                    when the child is born, and the lungs come into play as respiratory organs, then
                    the blood of the right ventricle flows into the lungs through the right and left
                    pulmonary arteries, and the ductus arteriosus, being no longer required,
                    shrivels up into a slender fibrous cord. The capillaries, veins, and lymphatics
                    are also produced by a histological differentiation of the cells of the
                    mesoblast.</p>

                    Reproductive, and Urinary systems of organs have still to be considered. These
                    will be dealt with in detail under other headings in the succeeding volumes.</p>
