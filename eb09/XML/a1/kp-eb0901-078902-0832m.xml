                    >&lt;uσθησι&lt;s,</hi> sensation), a term in medicine used to describe a state
                    of insensibility to external impressions, either as the result of disease or as
                    induced artificially by the employment of certain substances known as
                    anaesthetics.</p>
                <p>In diseases of the brain or spinal cord anaesthesia is an occasional symptom, but
                    in such cases it is usually limited in extent, involving a limb or a definite
                    area of the surface of the body. Complete anaesthesia has been observed in
                    persons who were in a state of catalepsy or trance.</p>
                <p>The artificial induction of anaesthesia by the use of drugs or the inhalation of
                    vapours is a subject of great interest, both historically and from its practical
                    application to the relief of suffering and the treatment of disease. Although it
                    is mainly owing to the researches of distinguished chemists and physicians of
                    the present century that the employment of anaesthesia has come to occupy a
                    foremost place among remedies, there is abundant evidence to show that it is a
                    practice of great antiquity. Besides the mention by Homer of the anaesthetic
                    effects of nepenthe, and the reference by Herodotus to the practice nf the
                    Scythians of inhaling the vapours of a certain kind of hemp to produce
                    intoxication, the employment of anaesthetic3 in surgery by the use of mandragora
                    is particularly alluded to by Dioscorides and Pliny. It also appears, from an
                    old Chinese manuscript laid before the French Academy by Μ. Julien, that a
                    physician named Hoa-tho, who lived in the 3d century, gave his patients a
                    preparation of hemp, whereby they were rendered insensible during the
                    performance of surgical operations. Mandragora was extensively used as an
                    anaesthetic by Hugo de Lucca, who practised in the 13th century. The soporific
                    effects of mandrake are alluded to by Shakespeare, who also makes frequent
                    mention of anaesthetising draughts, the composition of which is not
                    specified.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Medical Gazette,</hi> vol. xii. p. 515, Dr Sylvester,
                    quoting from a German work by Meissner, published in 1782, mentions the case of
                    Augustus, king of Poland, who underwent amputation while rendered insensible by
                    a narcotic. But the practice of anaesthesia had never become general, and
                    surgeons appear to have usually regarded it with disfavour. When, towards the
                    close of last century, the brilliant discoveries of Priestley gave an impetus to
                    chemical research, the properties of gases and vapours began to be more closely
                    investigated, and the belief was then entertained that many of them would become
                    of great medicinal value. In 1800, Sir Humphrey Davy, experimenting on nitrous
                    oxide gas, discovered its anaesthetic properties, and described the effects it
                    had on himself when inhaled, with the view of relieving local pain. He suggested
                    its employment in surgery in the following words :—“As nitrous oxide, in its
                    extensive operation, seems capable of destroying physical pain, it may probably
                    be used with advantage in surgical operations in which no great effusion of
                    blood takes place.” His suggestion, however, remained unheeded for nearly half a
                    century. The inhalation of sulphuric ether for the relief of asthma and other
                    lung affections had been employed by Dr Pearson, of Birmingham, as early as
                    1785; and in 1805 Dr Warren, of Boston, U.S., used this treatment in the later
                    stages of pulmonary consumption.</p>
                <p>In 1818 Faraday showed that the inhalation of the vapour of sulphuric ether
                    produced anaesthetic effects similar to those of nitrous oxide gas; and this
                    property of ether was also shown by the American physicians, Godman (1822),
                    Jackson (1833), Wood and Bache (1834).</p>
                <p>These observations, however, appear to have been regarded in the light of mere
                    scientific curiosities and subjects for lecture-room experiment, rather than as
                    facts capable of being applied practically in the treatment of disease, till
                    December 1844, when Dr Horace Wells, a dentist of Hartford, Connecticut,
                    underwent in his own person the operation of tooth extraction while rendered
                    insensible by nitrous oxide gas. Satisfied, from further experience, that teeth
                    could be extracted in this way without pain, Dr Wells proposed to establish the
                    practice of painless dentistry under the influence of the gas; but in
                    consequence of an unfortunate failure in an experiment at Boston, he abandoned
                    the project. On 30th September 1846, Dr Morton, a dentist of Boston, employed
                    the vapour of sulphuric ether to procure general anaesthesia in a case of tooth
                    extraction, and thereafter administered it in cases requiring surgical operation
                    with complete success. This great achievement marked a new era in surgery.
                    Operations were performed in America in numerous instances under ether
                    inhalation, the result being only to establish more firmly its value as a
                    successful anaesthetic. The news of the discovery reached England on 17th
                    December 1846. On 19th December, Mr Robinson, a dentist in London, and on the
                    21st, Mr Liston, the eminent surgeon, operated on patients anaesthetised by
                    ether; and the practice soon became general both in Great Britain and on the
                    Continent.</p>
                <p>The late Sir James Y. Simpson, of Edinburgh, was the first to apply anaesthesia
                    by ether in midwifery practice. This he did on 19th January 1847, and he
                    subsequently employed ether inhalation in numerous cases of both easy and
                    difficult parturition, an account of which he published, containing much
                    important information. The results of his trials showed that while the
                    anaesthesia annulled the conscious sufferings of the patient, it in no way
                    interfered with the muscular contractions of the uterus and the progress of the
                    labour, and that it did not injuriously affect the child.</p>
                <p>These observatione excited great interest in the medical world, and led to the
                    extensive employment of ether inhalation till November 1847, when Simpson
                    announced his discovery of the anaesthetic properties of chloroform (the trial
                    of which had been suggested to him by Mr Waldie, a chemist of Liverpool), and
                    proposed it as a substitute for sulphuric ether. So convincingly did he
                    demonstrate the great advantages of chloroform, that this substance speedily
                    superseded the use of ether as an anaesthetic, and continues to the present time
                    probably the most widely-used of all the agents employed in medicine for the
                    relief of human suffering.</p>

                <p>As the result of further investigations in this department of scientific
                    research, in which the labours of Dr Snow, Mr Nunneley, and Dr Richardson have
                    been conspicuous, numerous other volatile organic fluids have been found to
                    possess anaesthetic properties. Several of these have been used in surgical
                    practice, but as yet none of them have been found to possess such superiority as
                    would entitle them to supersede chloroform.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Nitrous oxide gas has been reintroduced, and is now
                    extensively employed in dentistry.</p></note></p>
                <p>There are many who prefer ether as being a safer anaesthetic than chloroform,
                    less apt to depress the circulation, and less apt to excite vomiting; but any
                    advantage it has in these respects appears, in the estimation of surgeons, to be
                    practically counterbalanced by the greater efficiency and facility of
                    application of the latter substance. Ether, however, continues to be largely
                    used in America.</p>
                <p>When introduced by inhalation into the system, anaesthetic vapours act upon the
                    brain and sensory nerves in such a manner as more or less completely to abolish
                    their natural sensibility. The degree in which they do this can be in large
                    measure regulated by the quantity administered. Thus, taking the familiar
                    instance of chloroform, the effect of the inhalation of a small quantity (say
                    less than half a drachm) is a feeling of exhilaration or semi-intoxication,
                    accompanied with diminished sensibility to pain, but without entire loss of
                    consciousness. By continuing the inhalation and increasing the quantity,
                    profound stupor, stertorous breathing, fixing of the eyes, and muscular
                    relaxation mark the occurrence of complete anaesthesia. In many cases it is
                    desirable to produce merely the former of these conditions, viz., that of
                    imperfect anaesthesia; and this is the extent to which chloroform is usually
                    applied in uncomplicated labour. On the other hand, in surgical operations
                    requiring absolute stillness on the part of the patient the inhalation must be
                    carried to the extent of producing total unconsciousness. The state of
                    anaesthesia can be safely kept up for long periods by continuing to apply, with
                    due caution, the anaesthetic vapour. Whenever the inhalation is stopped,
                    consciousness begins to return, and, in most cases, is soon completely
                    restored.</p>
                <p>The importance to the science of medicine of the introduction of anaesthesia can
                    scarcely be over-estimated. By the employment of anaesthetics in surgery, not
                    only is the work of the surgeon relieved of a source of embarrassment, and
                    operations the most difficult and delicate undertaken which otherwise would have
                    been impossible, but the death-rate in the worst cases has by universal
                    testimony been greatly diminished. In no department of medicine has the use of
                    anaesthetics been so extensive, or their value so manifest, as in midwifery. The
                    power of chloroform in mitigating the pain attendant on ordinary labour, and in
                    facilitating operative interference in cases of difficulty, is a matter of
                    every-day experience in the practice of the accoucheur. In short, there is
                    almost no condition of great physical suffering which may not be alleviated by
                    the employment, under proper precautions, of anaesthetics. But if the boon has
                    been great to medical science, it has been greater still to mankind; for not
                    merely is an incalculable amount of actual pain prevented, but the dread of
                    submitting to surgical operations is beyond measure lessened by the thought that
                    they can be performed while the sufferer is kept in a state of tranquil
                    sleep.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, there is no known method of artificially producing insensibility
                    which is entirely free from risk, and deaths have occasionally occurred under
                    the administration of anaesthetic vapours. Like all medicinal substances of a
                    poisonous nature, the utmost care and watchfulness are requisite in their
                    administration. The danger, <hi rend="italic">coeteris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >paribus,</hi> is in proportion to the dose. It is more than probable that many
                    of the fatal instances of anaesthetic inhalation have been the result of
                    carelessness; and it is certain that by a better acquaintance with the
                    physiological action of the agents employed, and a closer observation of the
                    indications of danger in their use, the deaths may be greatly diminished. The
                    importance of this has been recognised in many large hospitals, where the
                    administration of anaesthetics is entrusted to one individual skilled in their
                    properties and uses.</p>
                <p>But it is doubtful whether many of the deaths occurring under anaesthesia can
                    justly be ascribed to that cause. Sudden deaths occurring in the course of
                    operations were by no means unheard of before anaesthetics came to be employed
                    in surgery at all. Even, however, admitting that all the reported cases of death
                    from anaesthesia are correct, it must be acknowledged that they are
                    insignificant in amount, considering the enormous extent to which the use of
                    chloroform and other anaesthetic agents prevails in all departments of medical
                    practice.</p>
                <p>The employment of local anaesthesia in surgery has the obvious advantage of being
                    free from risk to life. Many means of accomplishing this have been suggested,
                    the best known of which is the method of Dr Richardson, of the application of
                    ether spray to the part of the body which it is desired to render insensible. By
                    the rapid evaporation of the ether the tissues become frozen, and insensibility
                    of the part is produced. Since, however, the anaesthesia merely affects the
                    superficial textures, this plan is only available in the minor operations of
                    surgery. (j. o. A.)</p>
