                    Edinburgh on the 23d April 1500 (died 1565). His name was originally Alane, and

                    in the newly-founded college of St Leonards, where he graduated in 1515. Some
                    time afterwards he was appointed a canon of the collegiate church, and in this
                    office he at first contended vigorously for the scholastic theology as against
                    the doctrines of the Reformers. His views were entirely changed, however, on the
                    occasion of the execution of Patrick Hamilton in 1528. He had been chosen to
                    meet Hamilton in controversy, with a view to convincing him of his errors, but
                    the arguments of the Scottish proto-martyr, and above all the spectacle of his
                    intrepid conduct at the stake, impressed Alesius so powerfully that he was
                    entirely won over to the cause of the Reformers, though for a time he did not
                    make the fact known. A sermon which he preached against the dissoluteness of the
                    clergy gave great offence to Prior Hepburn, who cast him into prison, and might
                    have carried his resentment to the extremest limit had not Alesius contrived to
                    escape to the Continent in 1531. After travelling in various countries of
                    northern Europe, he settled down at Wittenberg, where he made the acquaintance
                    of Melancthon, and signed the Augsburg confession. Meanwhile he was tried in
                    Scotland for heresy, and condemned without a hearing. In 1533 a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0516-0479"/> decree of the Scottish clergy, prohibiting the
                    reading of the New Testament by the laity, drew from Alesius an ably-argued
                    defence of the right of the people, in the form of a letter to James V. A reply
                    to this by John Coch-laeus, also addressed to the Scottish king, occasioned a
                    second letter from Alesius, in which he not only restates and amplifies his
                    argument with great force and beauty of style, but enters at some length into
                    more general questions connected with the Reformation. In 1535, Henry VIII.
                    having broken with the Church of Rome, Alesius was induced to remove to England,
                    where he was very cordially received by the king and his advisers Cranmer and
                    Cromwell. After a short residence at Lambeth he was appointed, through the
                    influence of Cromwell, then chancellor of the university, to lecture on theology
                    at Cambridge; but when he had delivered a few expositions of the Hebrew psalms,
                    he was compelled by the opposition of the papal party to desist. Returning to
                    London, he supported himself for some time by practising as a physician. In 1537
                    he attended a convocation of the clergy, and at the request of Cromwell, the
                    president, conducted a controversy with Stokesley, bishop of London, on the
                    nature of the sacraments. His argument, which was marked by great ability, was
                    afterwards published at Leipsic. In 1539 Alesius was compelled to flee for the
                    second time to Germany, in consequence of the enactment of the persecuting
                    statute known as the Six Articles. He was immediately chosen to fill a
                    theological chair in the university of Frankfort-on-the-Oder, where he was the
                    first professor who taught the Reformed doctrines. In 1543 he quitted Frankfort
                    for a similar position at Leipsic, his contention that it was the duty of the
                    civil magistrate to punish fornication having given offence to some of the
                    authorities of the former university. At Leipsic Alesius remained until his
                    death, which occurred on the 17th March 1565. He enjoyed the intimate friendship
                    of Melancthon, to whom he rendered valuable assistance in many of his
                    disputations with the Catholic doctors.</p>
                <p>Alesius was the author of a large number of exegetical, dogmatic, and polemical
                    works. He displayed his warm interest in his native land by the publication
                    (1544) of a <hi rend="italic">Cohortatio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Concordiam Pietatis, missa</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Patriam suam,</hi> which had the express approval of Luther. In
                    1560 appeared his treatise, <hi rend="italic">De Necessitate</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et Merito Bonorum Operum,</hi> a valuable contribution to the
                    synergistic side in the controversy on good works.</p>
