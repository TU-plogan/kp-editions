                    through several schools, the last of which was the Charter-house, he went to
                    Oxford when he was about fifteen years old. He was first entered of Queen’s
                    College, but after two years was elected a scholar of Magdalen College, having,
                    it is said, been recommended by his skill in Latin versification. He took his
                    master’s degree in 1693, and held a fellowship from 1699 till 1711.</p>
                <p>The eleven years extending from 1693, or his twenty-first year, to 1704, when he
                    was in his thirty-second, may be set down as the first stage of his life as a
                    man of letters. During this period, embracing no profession, and not as yet
                    entangled in official business, he was a student, an observer, and an author;
                    and though the literary works which he then produced are not those on which his
                    permanent celebrity rests, they gained for him in his own day a high reputation.
                    He had at first intended to become a clergyman; but his talents having attracted
                    the attention of leading statesmen belonging to the Whig party, he was speedily
                    diverted from his earlier views by the countenance which these men bestowed on
                    him. His first patron (to whom he seems to have been introduced by Congreve) was
                    Charles Montague, afterwards Earl of Halifax, who was himself a dabbler in
                    literature, and a protector of literary men; and he became known afterwards to
                    the accomplished and excellent Somers. While both of them were quite able to
                    estimate justly his literary merits, they had regard mainly to the services
                    which they believed him capable of rendering to the nation or the party; and
                    accordingly they encouraged him to regulate his pursuits with a view to public
                    and official employment. For a considerable time, however, he was left to his
                    own resources, which cannot have been otherwise than scanty.</p>
                <p>His first literary efforts were poetical. In 1693 a short poem of his, addressed
                    to Dryden, was inserted in the third volume of that veteran writer’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Miscellanies.</hi> The next volume of this collection contained
                    his translation, in tolerable heroic couplets, of “all Virgil’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Fourth Georgic,</hi> except the story of Aristaeus.” Two and a
                    half books of Ovid were afterwards attempted; and to his years of early manhood
                    belonged also his prose <hi rend="italic">Essay on Virgil’s Georgics,</hi> a
                    performance which hardly deserved, either for its style or for its critical
                    excellence, the compliment paid it by Dryden, in prefixing it to his own
                    translation of the poem. The most ambitious of those poetical assay-pieces is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Account of the Greatest English Poets,</hi> dated April
                    1694, and addressed affectionately to Sacheverell, the poet’s fellow-collegian,
                    who afterwards became so notorious in the party-quarrels of the time. This
                    piece, spirited both in language and in versification, is chiefly noticeable as
                    showing that ignorance of old English poetry which was then universal. Addison
                    next, in 1695, published one of those compositions, celebrating contemporary
                    events, and lauding contemporary great men, on which, during the half-century
                    that succeeded the Revolution, there was wasted so much of good writing and of
                    fair poetical abihty. His piece, not very meritorious even in its own class, was
                    addressed “To the King,” and commemorates the campaign which was distinguished
                    by William’s taking of Namur. Much better than the poem itself are the
                    introductory verses to Somers, then lord keeper. This production, perhaps
                    intended as a remembrancer to the writer’s patrons, did not at once produce any
                    obvious effect: and we are left in considerable uncertainty as to the manner in
                    which about this time Addison contrived to support himself. He corresponded with
                    Tonson the bookseller about projected works, one of these being a Translation of
                    Herodotus. It was probably at some later time that he purposed compiling a
                    Dictionary of the English Language. In 1699 a considerable collection of his
                    Latin verses was published at Oxford, in the <hi rend="italic">Musoe
                    Anglicanae.</hi> These appear to have interested some foreign scholars; and
                    several of them show curious symptoms of his characteristic humour.</p>
                <p>In the same year, his patrons, either having still no office to spare for him, or
                    desiring him to gain peculiarly high qualifications for diplomatic or other
                    important business, provided for him temporarily by a grant, which, though
                    bestowed on a man of great merit and promise, would not pass unquestioned in the
                    present century. He obtained, on the recommendation of Lord Somers, a pension of
                    £300 a year, designed (as Addison himself afterwards said in a memorial
                    addressed to the crown) to enable him “to travel, and qualify himself to serve
                    His Majesty.” In the summer of 1699 he crossed into France, where, chiefly for
                    the purpose of learning the language, he remained till the end of 1700; and
                    after this he spent a year in Italy. In Switzerland, on his way home, he was
                    stopped by receiving notice that he was to be appointed envoy to Prince Eugene,
                    then engaged in the war in Italy. But his Whig friends <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0162-0147"/> were already tottering in their places; and, in
                    March 1702, the death of King William at once drove them from power and put an
                    end to the pension. Indeed Addison asserted that he never received but one
                    year’s payment of it, and that all the other expenses of his travels were
                    defrayed by himself. He was able, however, to visit a great part of Germany, and
                    did not reach Holland till the spring of 1703. His prospects were now
                    sufficiently gloomy: he entered into treaty, oftener than once, for an
                    engagement as a travelling tutor; and the correspondence in one of these
                    negotiations has been preserved. Tonson had recommended him as the best person
                    to attend in this character the son of the Duke of Somerset, commonly called
                    “The Proud.” The duke, a profuse man in matters of pomp, was economical in
                    questions of education. He wished Addison to name the salary he expected; this
                    being declined, he announced, with great dignity, that he would give a hundred
                    guineas a year; Addison accepted the munificent offer, saying, however, that he
                    could not find his account in it otherwise than by relying on his Grace’s future
                    patronage; and his Grace immediately intimated that he would look out for some
                    one else. Towards the end of 1703 Addison returned to England.</p>
                <p>Works which he composed during his residence on the Continent were the earliest
                    that showed him to have attained maturity of skill and genius. There is good
                    reason for believing that his tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Cato,</hi> whatever
                    changes it may afterwards have suffered, was in great part written while he
                    lived in France, that is, when he was about twenty-eight years of age. In the
                    winter of 1701, amidst the stoppages and discomforts of a journey across the
                    Mount Cenis, he composed, wholly or partly, his <hi rend="italic">Letter from,
                    Italy,</hi> which is by far the best of his poems, if it is not rather the only
                    one among them that at all justifies his claim to the poetical character. It
                    contains some fine touches of description, and is animated by a noble tone of
                    classical enthusiasm. While in Germany he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Dialogues
                    on Medals,</hi> which, however, were not published till after his death. These
                    have much liveliness of style, and something of the gay humour which the author
                    was afterwards to exhibit more strongly; but they show little either of
                    antiquarian learning or of critical ingenuity. In tracing out parallels between
                    passages of the Roman poets and figures or scenes which appear in ancient
                    sculptures, Addison opened the easy course of inquiry which was afterwards
                    prosecuted by Spence; and this, with the apparatus of spirited metrical
                    translations from the classics, gave the work a likeness to his account of his
                    travels. This account, entitled <hi rend="italic">Remarks</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >on Several Parts of Italy,</hi> &amp;c., he sent home for publication before
                    his own return. It wants altogether the interest of personal narrative: the
                    author hardly ever appears. The task in which he chiefly busies himself is that
                    of exhibiting the illustrations which the writings of the Latin poets, and the
                    antiquities and scenery of Italy, mutually give and receive. Many of the
                    landscapes are sketched with great liveliness, and there are not a few strokes
                    of arch humour. The statistical information is very meagre; nor are there many
                    observations on society; and politics are no further meddled with than to show
                    the moderate liberality of the writer’s own opinions.</p>
                <p>With the year 1704 begins a second era in Addison’s life, which extends to the
                    summer of 1710, when his age was thirty-eight. This was the first term of his
                    official career; and, though very barren of literary performance, it not only
                    raised him from indigence, but settled definitively his position as a public
                    man. His correspondence shows that, while on the Continent, he had been admitted
                    to confidential intimacy by diplomatists and men of rank; immediately on his
                    return he was enrolled in the Kitcat Club, and brought thus and otherwise into
                    communication with the gentry of the Whig party. Although all accounts agree in
                    representing him as a shy man, he was at least saved from all risk of making
                    himself disagreeable in society, by his unassuming manners, his extreme caution,
                    and that sedulous desire to oblige, which his satirist Pope exaggerated into a
                    positive fault. His knowledge and ability were esteemed so highly, as to confirm
                    the expectations formerly entertained of his usefulness in public business; and
                    the literary fame he had already acquired soon furnished an occasion for
                    recommending him to public employment. Though the Whigs were out of office, the
                    administration which succeeded them was, in all its earlier changes, of a
                    complexion so mixed and uncertain, that the influence of their leaders was not
                    entirely lost. Not long after Marlborough’s great victory at Blenheim, it is
                    said that Godolphin, the lord treasurer, expressed to Lord Halifax a desire to
                    have the great duke’s fame extended by a poetical tribute. Halifax seized the
                    opportunity of recommending Addison as the fittest man for the duty;
                    stipulating, we are told, that the service should not be unrewarded, and
                    doubtless satisfying the minister that his protegé possessed other
                    qualifications for office besides dexterity in framing heroic verse. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Campaign,</hi> the poem thus written to order, was received
                    with extraordinary applause; and it is probably as good as any that ever was
                    prompted by no more worthy inspiration. It has, indeed, neither the fiery spirit
                    which Dryden threw into occasional pieces of the sort, nor the exquisite polish
                    that would have been given by Pope, if he had stooped to make such uses of his
                    genius; but many of the details are pleasing; and in the famous passage of the
                    Angel, as well as in several others, there is even something of force and
                    imagination.</p>
                <p>The consideration covenanted for by the poet’s friends was faithfully paid. A
                    vacancy occurred by the death of another celebrated man, John Locke; and in
                    November 1704, Addison was appointed one of the five commissioners of appeal in
                    Excise. The duties of the place must have been as light for him as they had been
                    for his predecessor; for he continued to hold it with all the appointments he
                    subsequently received from the same ministry. But there is no reason for
                    believing that he was more careless than other public servants in his time; and
                    the charge of incompetency as a man of business, which has been brought so
                    positively against him, cannot possibly be true as to this first period of his
                    official career. Indeed, the specific allegations refer exclusively to the last
                    years of his life; and, if he had not really shown practical ability in the
                    period now in question, it is not easy to see how he, a man destitute alike of
                    wealth, of social or fashionable liveliness, and of family interest, could have
                    been promoted, for several years, from office to office, as he was, till the
                    fall of the administration to which he was attached. In 1706 he became one of
                    the undersecretaries of state, serving first under Hedges, who belonged to the
                    Tory section of the Government, and afterwards under Lord Sunderland,
                    Marlborough’s son-in-law, and a zealous follower of Addison’s early patron,
                    Somers. The work of this office, however, like that of the commissionership,
                    must often have admitted of performance by deputy. For in 1707, the Whigs having
                    become stronger, Lord Halifax was sent on a mission to the Elector of Hanover;
                    and, besides taking Vanbrugh the dramatist with him as king-at-arms, he selected
                    Addison as his secretary. In 1708 he entered Parliament, sitting at first for
                    Lostwithiel, but afterwards for Malmesbury, which, being six times elected, he
                    represented from 1710 till his death. Here unquestionably he did fail. What part
                    he may have taken in the details of business we are not informed; but he was
                    always a silent member, unless it be true that he once attempted to speak and
                    sat down in confusion. In 1709 Lord Wharton, the father of the notorious duke,
                    having been named lord-lieutenant of Ireland, Addison became his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n163/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0163-0148"/> secretary, receiving also an appointment as
                    keeper of records. This event happened only about a year and a half before the
                    dismissal of the ministry; and the Irish secretary would seem to have transacted
                    the business of his office chiefly in London. But there are letters showing him
                    to have made himself acceptable to some of the best and most distinguished
                    persons in Dublin; and he escaped without having any quarrel with Swift, his
                    acquaintance with whom had begun some time before. In the literary history of
                    Addison those seven years of official service are almost a blank, till we
                    approach their close. He defended the Government in an anonymous pamphlet on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Present State of the War;</hi> he united compliments to the
                    all-powerful Marlborough with indifferent attempts at lyrical poetry in his
                    opera of <hi rend="italic">Rosamond;</hi> and, besides furnishing a prologue to
                    Steele’s comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Tender Husband,</hi> he perhaps gave
                    some assistance in the composition of the play. Irish administration, however,
                    allowed it would seem more leisure than might have been expected. During the
                    last few months of his tenure of office Addison contributed largely to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tatler.</hi> But his entrance on this new field does nearly
                    coincide with the beginning of a new section in his history.</p>
                <p>Even the coalition-ministry of Godolphin was too Whiggish for the taste of Queen
                    Anne; and the Tories, the favourites of the court, gained, both in parliamentary
                    power and in popularity out of doors, by a combination of lucky accidents,
                    dexterous management, and divisions and doubledealing among their adversaries.
                    The real failure of the prosecution of Addison’s old friend Sacheverell,
                    completed the ruin of the Whigs; and in August 1710 an entire revolution in the
                    ministry had been completed. The Tory administration which succeeded kept its
                    place till the queen’s death in 1714, and Addison was thus left to devote four
                    of the best years of his life, from his thirty-ninth year to his forty-third, to
                    occupations less lucrative than those in which his time had recently been
                    frittered away, but much more conducive to the extension of his own fame, and to
                    the benefit of English literature. Although our information as to his pecuniary
                    affairs is very scanty, we are entitled to believe that he was now independent
                    of literary labour. He speaks, in an extant paper, of having had (but lost)
                    property in the West Indies; and he is understood to have inherited several
                    thousand pounds from a younger brother, who was governor of Madras. In 1711 he
                    purchased, for £10,000, the estate of Bilton, near Rugby,—the place which
                    afterwards became the residence of Mr Apperley, better known by his assumed name
                    of “Nimrod.”</p>
                <p>During those four years he produced a few political writings. Soon after the fall
                    of the ministry, he contributed five numbers to the <hi rend="italic">Whig
                    Examiner,</hi> a paper set up in opposition to the Tory periodical of the same
                    name, which was then conducted by the poet Prior, and afterwards became the
                    vehicle of Swift’s most vehement invectives against the party he had once
                    belonged to. These are certainly the most ill-natured of Addison’s writings, but
                    they are neither lively nor vigorous. There is more spirit in his allegorical
                    pamphlet, the <hi rend="italic">Trial and Conviction of Count Tariff.</hi></p>
                <p>But from the autumn of 1710 till the end of 1714 his principal employment was the
                    composition of his celebrated Periodical Essays. The honour of inventing the
                    plan of such compositions, as well as that of first carrying the idea into
                    execution, belongs to Richard Steele, who had been a school-fellow of Addison at
                    the Charter-house, continued to be on intimate terms with him afterwards, and
                    attached himself with his characteristic ardour to the same political party.
                    When, in April 1709, Steele published the first number of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tatler,</hi> Addison was in Dublin, and knew nothing of the design. He is said
                    to have detected his friend’s authorship only by recognising, in one of the
                    early papers, a critical remark which he remembered having himself communicated
                    to Steele. He began to furnish essays in a few weeks, assisted occasionally
                    while he held office, and afterwards wrote oftener than Steele himself. He thus
                    contributed in all, if his literary executor selected his contributions
                    correctly, more than GO of the 271 essays which the work contains. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Tatler</hi> exhibited, in more ways than one, symptoms of being an
                    experiment. The projector, imitating the news-sheets in form, thought it prudent
                    to give, in each number, news in addition to the essay; and there was a want,
                    both of unity and of correct finishing, in tho putting together of the literary
                    materials. Addison’s contributions, in particular, are in many places as lively
                    as anything he ever wrote; and his style, in its more familiar moods at least,
                    had been fully formed before he returned from the Continent. But, as compared
                    with his later pieces, these are only what the painter’s loose studies and
                    sketches are to the landscapes which he afterwards constructs out of them. In
                    his invention of incidents and characters, one thought after another is hastily
                    used and hastily dismissed, as if he were putting his own powers to the test, or
                    trying the effect of various kinds of objects on his readers; his most ambitious
                    flights, in the shape of allegories and the like, are stiff and inanimate; and
                    his favourite field of literary criticism is touched so slightly, as to show
                    that he still wanted confidence in the taste and knowledge of the public.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi> was dropped at the beginning of 1711, but only
                    to be followed by the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> which was begun on the
                    1st day of March, and appeared every week-day till the 6th day of December 1712.
                    It had then completed the 555 numbers usually collected in its first seven
                    volumes. Addison, now in London and unemployed, co-operated with Steele
                    constantly from the very opening of the series; and the two, contributing almost
                    equally, seem together to have written not very much less than five hundred of
                    the papers. Emboldened by the success of their former adventure, they devoted
                    their whole space to the essays. They relied, with a confidence which the
                    extraordinary popularity of the work fully justified, on their power of exciting
                    the interest of a wide audience by pictures and reflections drawn from a field
                    which embraced the whole compass of ordinary life and ordinary knowledge, no
                    kind of practical themes being positively excluded except such as were
                    political, and all literary topics being held admissible, for which it seemed
                    possible to command attention from persons of average taste and information. A
                    seeming unity was given to the undertaking, and curiosity and interest awakened
                    on behalf of the conductors, by the happy invention of the Spectator’s Club, in
                    which Steele is believed to have drawn all the characters. The figure of Sir
                    Roger de Coverley, however, the best even in the opening group, is the only one
                    that was afterwards elaborately depicted; and Addison was the author of all the
                    papers in which his oddities and amiabilities are so admirably delineated. To
                    him, also, the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> owed a very large share of its
                    highest excellences. His were many, and these the most natural and elegant, if
                    not the most original, of its humorous sketches of human character and social
                    eccentricities, its good-humoured satires on ridiculous features in manners, and
                    on corrupt symptoms in public taste; these topics, however, making up a
                    department in which Steele was fairly on a level with his more famous coadjutor.
                    But Steele had neither learning, nor taste, nor critical acuteness sufficient to
                    qualify him for enriching the series with such literary disquisitions as those
                    which Addison insinuated so often into the lighter matter of his essays, and of
                    which he gave an elaborate specimen in his celebrated and agreeable criticism on
                    <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost.</hi> Still further beyond the powers of Steele
                    were those speculations on the theory of literature and of the processes of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n164/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0164-0149"/> thought analogous to it, which, in the essays "On
                    the Pleasures of the Imagination,” Addison prosecuted, not, indeed, with much of
                    philosophical depth, but with a sagacity and comprehensiveness which we shall
                    undervalue much unless we remember how little of philosophy was to be found in
                    any critical views previously propounded in England. To Addison, further, belong
                    those essays which (most frequently introduced in regular alternation in the
                    papers of Saturday) rise into the region of moral and religious meditation, and
                    tread the elevated ground with a step so graceful as to allure the reader
                    irresistibly to follow; sometimes, as in the “Walk through Westminster Abbey,”
                    enlivening solemn thought by gentle sportiveness; sometimes flowing on with an
                    uninterrupted sedateness of didactic eloquence; and sometimes shrouding sacred
                    truths in the veil of ingenious allegory, as in the majestic “Vision of Mirza.”
                    While, in a word, the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> if Addison had not taken
                    part in it, would probably have been as lively and humorous as it was, and not
                    less popular in its own day, it would have wanted some of its strongest claims
                    on the respect of posterity, by being at once lower in its moral tone, far less
                    abundant in literary knowledge, and much less vigorous and expanded in thinking.
                    In point of style, again, the two friends resemble each other so closely as to
                    be hardly distinguishable, when both are dealing with familiar objects, aud
                    writing in a key not rising above that of conversation. But in the higher tones
                    of thought and composition, Addison showed a mastery of language raising him
                    very decisively, not above Steele only, but above all his contemporaries.
                    Indeed, it may safely be said, that no one, in any age of our literature, has
                    united, so strikingly as he did, the colloquial grace and ease which mark the
                    style of an accomplished gentleman, with the power of soaring into a strain of
                    expression nobly and eloquently dignified.</p>
                <p>On the cessation of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> Steele set on foot the
                    <hi rend="italic">Guardian,</hi> which, started in March 1713, came to an end in
                    October, with its 175th number. To this series Addison gave 53 papers, being a
                    very frequent writer during the latter half of its progress. None of his essays
                    here aim so high as the best of those in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator;</hi>
                    but he often exhibits both his cheerful and well-balanced humour, and his
                    earnest desire to inculcate sound principles of literary judgment. In the last
                    six months of the year 1714, the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> received its
                    eighth and last volume; for which Steele appears not to have written at all, and
                    Addison to have contributed 24 of the 80 papers. Most of these form, in the
                    unbroken seriousness both of their topics and of their manner, a contrast to the
                    majority of his essays in the earlier volumes; but several of them, both in this
                    vein and in one less lofty, are among the best known, if not the finest, of all
                    his essays. Such are the “Mountain of Miseries;” the antediluvian novel of
                    “Shallum and Hilpa;” the “Reflections by Moonlight on the Divine
                    Perfections.”</p>
                <p>In April 1713 Addison brought on the stage, very reluctantly, as we are assured,
                    and can easily believe, his tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Cato.</hi> Its success
                    was dazzling; but this issue was mainly owing to the concern which the
                    politicians took in the exhibition. The Whigs hailed it as a brilliant manifesto
                    in favour of constitutional freedom. The Tories echoed the applause, to show
                    themselves enemies of despotism, and professed to find in Julius Caesar a
                    parallel to the formidable Marlborough. Even with such extrinsic aids, and the
                    advantage derived from the established fame of the author, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cato</hi> could never have been esteemed a good dramatic work, unless in an age
                    in which dramatic power and insight were almost extinct. It is poor even in its
                    poetical elements, and is redeemed only by the finely solemn tone of its moral
                    reflections, and the singular refinement and equable smoothness of its
                    diction.</p>
                <p>The literary career of Addison might almost be held as closed soon after the
                    death of Queen Anne, which occurred in August 1714, when he had lately completed
                    his 42d year. His own life extended only five years longer; and this closing
                    portion of it offers little that is pleasing or instructive. We see him
                    attaining the summit of his ambition, only to totter for a little and sink into
                    an early grave. We are reminded of his more vigorous days by nothing but a few
                    happy inventions interspersed in political pamphlets, and the gay fancy of a
                    trifling poem on Kneller’s portrait of George I.</p>
                <p>The lord justices who, previously chosen secretly by the Elector of Hanover,
                    assumed the government on the Queen’s demise, were, as a matter of course, the
                    leading Whigs. They appointed Addison to act as their secretary. He next held,
                    for a very short time, his former office under the Irish lord-lieutenant; and,
                    early in 1715, he was made one of the lords of trade. In the course of the same
                    year occurred the first of the only two quarrels with friends, into which the
                    prudent, good-tempered, and modest Addison is said to have ever been betrayed.
                    His adversary on this occasion was Pope, who, only three years before, had
                    received, with an appearance of humble thankfulness, Addison’s friendly remarks
                    on his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Criticism;</hi> but who, though still very
                    young, was already very famous, and beginning to show incessantly his literary
                    jealousies, and his personal and party hatreds. Several little misunderstandings
                    had paved the way for a breach, when, at the same time with the first volume of
                    Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> there appeared a translation of the first
                    book of the poem, bearing the name of Thomas Tickell. Tickell, in his preface,
                    disclaimed all rivalry with Pope, and declared that he wished only to bespeak
                    favourable attention for his contemplated version of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey.</hi> But the simultaneous publication was awkward; and Tickell, though
                    not so good a versifier as Pope, was a dangerous rival, as being a good Greek
                    scholar. Further, he was Addison’s under-secretary and confidential friend; and
                    Addison, cautious though he was, does appear to have said (quite truly) that
                    Tickell's translation was more faithful than the other. Pope’s anger could not
                    be restrained. He wrote those famous lines in which he describes Addison under
                    the name of Atticus; and, as if to make reconciliation impossible, he not only
                    circulated these among his friends, but sent a copy to Addison himself.
                    Afterwards, he went so far as to profess a belief that the rival translation was
                    really Addison’s own. It is pleasant to observe that, after the insult had been
                    perpetrated, Addison was at the pains, in his <hi rend="italic">Freeholder,</hi>
                    to express hearty approbation of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> of Pope; who,
                    on the contrary, after Addison’s death, deliberately printed the striking but
                    malignant lines in the Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot. In 1715 there was acted, with
                    little success, the comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Drummer, or the Haunted
                    House,</hi> which, though it appeared under the name of Steele, was certainly
                    not his, and was probably written in whole or chiefly by Addison. It contributes
                    very little to his fame. From September 1715 to June 1716, he defended the
                    Hanoverian succession, and the proceedings of the Government in regard to the
                    rebellion, in a paper called the <hi rend="italic">Freeholder,</hi> which he
                    wrote entirely himself, dropping it with the fiftyfifth number. It is much
                    better tempered, not less spirited, and much more able in thinking, than his <hi
                    rend="italic">Examiner.</hi> The finical man of taste does indeed show himself
                    to be sometimes weary of discussing constitutional questions; but he aims many
                    enlivening thrusts at weak points of social life and manners; and the character
                    of the Fox hunting Squire, who is introduced as the representative of the
                    Jacobites, is drawn with so much humour and force that we regret not being
                    allowed to see more of him.</p>
                <p>In August 1716, when he had completed his 44th year, Addison married the
                    Countess-Dowager of Warwick, a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n165/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0165-0150"/> widow of fifteen years’ standing. She seems to
                    have forfeited her jointure by the marriage, and to have brought her husband
                    nothing but the occupancy of Holland House at Kensington. We know hardly
                    anything positively in regard to the affair, or as to the origin or duration of
                    his acquaintance with the lady or her family. But the current assertion that the
                    courtship was a long one is very probably erroneous. There are better grounds
                    for believing the assertion, transmitted from Addison’s own time, that the
                    marriage was unhappy. The countess is said to have been proud as well as
                    violent, and to have supposed that, in contracting the alliance, she conferred
                    honour instead of receiving it. To the uneasiness caused by domestic discomfort,
                    the most friendly critics of Addison’s character have attributed those habits of
                    intemperance, which are said to have grown on him in his later years to such an
                    extent as to have broken his health and accelerated his death. His biographer,
                    Miss Aikin, who disbelieves his alleged want of matrimonial quiet, has called in
                    question, with much ingenuity, the whole story of his sottishness; and it must
                    at any rate be allowed that all the assertions which tend to fix such charges on
                    him in the earlier parts of his life, rest on no evidence that is worthy of
                    credit, and are in themselves highly improbable. Sobriety was not the virtue of
                    the day; and the constant frequenting of coffee-houses, which figures so often
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> and elsewhere, and which was really
                    practised among literary men as well as others, cannot have had good effects.
                    Addison, however, really appears to have had no genuine relish for this mode of
                    life; and there are curious notices, especially in Steele’s correspondence, of
                    his having lodgings out of town, to which he retired for study and composition.
                    But, whatever the cause may have been, his health was shattered before he took
                    that which was the last, and certainly the most unwise step, in his ascent to
                    political power.</p>
                <p>For a considerable time dissensions had existed in the ministry; and these came
                    to a crisis in April 1717, when those who had been the real chiefs passed into
                    the ranks of the opposition. Townshend was dismissed, and Walpole anticipated
                    dismissal by resignation. There was now formed, under the leadership of General
                    Stanhope and Lord Sunderland, an administration which, as resting on
                    courtinfluence, was nicknamed the “German ministry.” Sunderland, Addison’s
                    former superior, became one of the two principal secretaries of state; and
                    Addison himself was appointed as the other. His elevation to such a post had
                    been contemplated on the accession of George I., and prevented, we are told, by
                    his own refusal; and it is asserted, on the authority of Pope, that his
                    acceptance now was owing only to the influence of his wife. Even if there is no
                    ground, as there probably is not, for the allegation of Addison’s inefficiency
                    in the details of business, his unfitness for such an office in such
                    circumstances was undeniable and glaring. It was impossible that a Government,
                    whose secretary of state could not open his lips in debate, should long face an
                    opposition headed by Robert Walpole. The decay of Addison’s health, too, was
                    going on rapidly, being, we may readily conjecture, precipitated by anxiety, if
                    no worse causes were at work. Ill health was the reason assigned for retirement,
                    in the letter of resignation which he laid before the king in March 1718, eleven
                    months after his appointment. He received a pension of £1500 a year.</p>
                <p>Not long afterwards the divisions in the Whig party alienated him from his oldest
                    friend. The Peerage Bill, introduced in February 1719, was attacked, on behalf
                    of the opposition, in a weekly paper, which was called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plebeian,</hi> and written by Steele. Addison answered it temperately enough in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Old Whig;</hi> provocation from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plebeian</hi> brought forth angry retort from the <hi rend="italic">Whig;</hi>
                    Steele charged Addison with being so old a Whig as to have forgotten his
                    principles; and Addison sneered at Grub Street, an d called his friend “Little
                    Dicky.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On this point,
                    however, see Macaulay’s Essay on <hi rend="italic">The Life and Writings of
                    Addison.</hi></p></note> How Addison felt after this painful quarrel we are not
                    told directly; but the <hi rend="italic">Old Whig</hi> was excluded from that
                    posthumous collection of his works for which his executor Tickell had received
                    from him authority and directions. In that collection was inserted a treatise on
                    the evidences of the faith, entitled <hi rend="italic">Of the Christian
                    Religion.</hi> Its theological value is very small; but it is pleasant to regard
                    it as the last effort of one who, amidst all weaknesses, was a man of real
                    goodness as well as of eminent genius.</p>
                <p>The disease under which Addison laboured appears to have been asthma. It became
                    more violent after his retirement from office, and was now accompanied by
                    dropsy. His deathbed was placid and resigned, and comforted by those religious
                    hopes which he had so often suggested to others, and the value of which he is
                    said, in an anecdote of doubtful authority, to have now inculcated in a parting
                    interview with his stepson. He died at Holland House on the 17th day of June
                    1719, six weeks after having completed his 47th year. His body, after lying in
                    state, was interred in the Poets’ Corner of Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Biographia Britannica</hi> gives an elaborate memoir of
                    him; particulars are well collected in the article under his name in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful
                    Knowledge;</hi> and a good many new materials, especially letters, will be found
                    in <hi rend="italic">The Life of Joseph Addison,</hi> by Lucy Aikin, 1843. (w.
                    s.)</p>
                <p>An edition of Addison’s works, in four volumes quarto, was published by
                    Baskerville at Birmingham in 1761. Dibdin characterises this as a “glorious
                    performance.” A complete edition in six volumes, with notes, by Richard Hurd,
                    appeared in 1811. An American edition (New York, 1854), in six volumes, with
                    notes, by G. W. Greene, contains several pieces collected for the first time. An
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> with valuable notes by Henry
                    Morley, appeared in 1871.</p>
