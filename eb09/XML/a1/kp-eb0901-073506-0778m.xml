                    Latinised form of Amesius this distinguished English theologian is now better
                    known on the Continent than in our own country, through works that were a power
                    in their day, and are not yet spent of their force. He was born at Ipswich,
                    Suffolk, in 1576. He received an excellent education at the grammar school of
                    Ipswich; and proceeded next to the university of Cambridge, where he was entered
                    of Christ’s college. From the outset, as to the latest, he was an omnivorous
                    student. Entering half-carelessly into the church where the great Master William
                    Perkins was the preacher, he was, under the sermon, roused and alarmed in such
                    fashion as was not rare under so burning and intense an orator as Perkins. Like
                    another Nicodemus he visited the venerable preacher, and was taught and
                    comforted so as never through life to forget his interviews with the “old man
                    eloquent.” Perkins having died at a ripe old age, was succeeded by one of
                    kindred intellect and fervour, Paul Bayne, and his friendship also was gained by
                    Ames. He proceeded B.A. and Μ. A. in due course, and was chosen to a fellowship
                    in Christ’s college. He was universally beloved in the university. His own
                    college (Christ’s) would have chosen him for the mastership; but a
                    party-opposition led to the election of a Dr Carey, who at once sought a quarrel
                    by arraigning Ames for disapproving of the surplice and other outward symbols.
                    Not succeeding by threats of expulsion, which were illegal and powerless, the
                    master resorted to transparent flattery. Ames stood firm, was led to re-examine
                    former opinions, and the result was that more absolutely than ever he decided
                    against conformity. Nevertheless, he preached in season and out of season, and
                    always with profound impression. One sermon became historical in the Puritan
                    controversies. It was delivered on St Thomas’ day, before the feast of Christ’s
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n779/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0779-0736"/> nativity, and in it he rebuked sharply Lusory
                    Lotts and the “heathenish debauchery” of the students during the twelve days
                    ensuing. His exposures and scathing denunciations won thunders of applause, but
                    there were sheathed in them lightnings of wrath among the High Church party. He
                    was summoned before the vice-chancellor and whole senate of the university. He
                    appeared, and in presence of as brilliant an assembly as ever met in the
                    congregationhouse, defended himself triumphantly. Nonconformity, admittedly in
                    lesser things, was regarded as excluding him from the Church of England. He left
                    the university, and would have accepted the great church of Colchester in Essex,
                    but the relentless bishop of London refused to grant institution and induction.
                    Like furtive persecution awaited him elsewhere, and at last he passed over to
                    Holland. To leave England was not so simple or easy a thing then, and Ames had
                    to disguise himself for safety. His disguise was singularly timed, for it
                    produced an incident that has long been worked into the very fabric of church
                    history in England and Holland. Coincident with his arrival at Rotterdam a
                    congress of theologians—Remonstrant and non-Remon-strant—was being held. Ames
                    went into the meeting in his “habit of a fisherman, with his canvas slops about
                    his body, and a red cap on his head.” As the debate proceeded, the English
                    visitor rose and craved permission to oppose Grevinchovius—a theologian long
                    since in oblivion, but a tower of strength in heresy at that day—in Latin. The
                    Remonstrant champion was rather taken aback at first; but jeered and flouted the
                    plain countryman, “like another Goliath scorning David.” The question was the
                    old-new one of the “self-determining power of the human will to spiritual good,
                    without any need of the previous efficacious operations of divine grace.” Ames
                    bore his opponent’s gibes at his dress, and overwhelmed him with his logical
                    reasoning from Phil. ii. 13, “It is God that worketh in us both to will and to
                    do.” The fisherman-controversialist made a great stir, and from that day became
                    known and honoured in the Low Countries. Subsequently Ames entered into a
                    controversy in print with Grevinchovius on universal redemption and election,
                    and cognate problems. He brought together all he had maintained in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Coronis</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Collationem,</hi><hi rend="italic">Hagiensem—</hi> his most masterful book,
                    which figures largely in Dutch church history. At Leyden, Ames became intimate
                    with the venerable Mr Goodyear, pastor of the English church there. While thus
                    resident in comparative privacy he was sent for to the Hague by Sir Horatio
                    Vere, who appointed him a minister in the army of the states-general, and of the
                    English soldiers in their service, a post held by some of the greatest of
                    England’s exiled Puritans. He married at the Hague a daughter of Dr Burgess, who
                    was domestic pastor of Vere. On his father-in-law’s return to England, Ames
                    succeeded to his place. It was at this time he began his memorable controversy
                    with Episcopius, who, in attacking the <hi rend="italic">Coronis,</hi> railed
                    against the author as having been “a disturber of the public peace in his native
                    country, so that the English magistrates had banished him thence; and now, by
                    his late printed <hi rend="italic">Coronis,</hi> he was raising new disturbances
                    in the peaceable Netherlands.” It was a miserable libel. Mr Goodyear being
                    present in the lecture-room when Episcopius vented his malice, there and then
                    rebutted his charge against his absent friend. None the less did the controversy
                    proceed. Ultimately Ames reduced the Remonstrants to silence. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Coronis</hi> had been primarily prepared for the Synod of Dort,
                    which sat from November 1618 until May 1619. At this celebrated synod the
                    position of Dr Ames, if an extremely honourable, was a peculiar one. The High
                    Church party in England had induced the king to interfere and bring about his
                    removal from the Hague, on the ground of his nonconformity; but he was still
                    held, deservedly, in such reverence that it was arranged he should attend the
                    synod informally. Throughout its sittings Dr Ames appears to have been the most
                    active and influential of the foreign divines. It is a sorrowful fact that, from
                    1611-12 onward, Ames was interfered with harassingly by the High Church party in
                    England. Twice over, when chosen professor, the most envenomed opposition was
                    led from England. He was kept from the university of Leyden; and when later
                    invited by the state of Friesland to a professoriate at Franeker, the
                    persecution was renewed, but this time abortively. He was installed at Franeker
                    on 7th May 1622, and delivered a most learned discourse on the occasion on “Urim
                    and Thummim.” He soon brought renown to Franeker as professor, preacher, pastor,
                    and theological writer. He prepared his <hi rend="italic">Medulla</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Theologica</hi> for his students. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Casus</hi><hi rend="italic">Conscientiae</hi> followed. Both these treatises
                    left their mark on the thought of the century. His “Cases of Conscience” was a
                    new thing in Protestantism. The work shows much insight into human nature, and
                    may be favourably compared with the bulkier <hi rend="italic">Ductor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Dubitantium.</hi> Having continued twelve years at Franeker, his
                    health gave way, and he contemplated removal to New England. But another door
                    was opened for him. His English heart yearned for more frequent opportunities of
                    preaching the gospel to his fellow-countrymen, and an invitation to Rotterdam
                    gave him such opportunity. His friends at Franeker were passionately opposed to
                    the transference, but ultimately acquiesced. At Rotterdam he drew all hearts to
                    him by his eloquence and fervour in the pulpit, and his irrepressible activity
                    as a pastor. Home-controversy engaged him again, and he prepared his <hi
                    rend="italic">Fresh Suit against Ceremonies—-</hi> extrinsically having the
                    distinction of being the book which made Richard Baxter a Nonconformist. It was
                    posthumously published. He did not long survive his removal to Rotterdam. Having
                    caught a cold from a flood which drenched his house, he died in November 1633,
                    in his fifty-seventh year.</p>
                <p>Few Englishmen have exercised so formative and controlling an influence on
                    continental thought and opinion as Dr Ames. He was a master in theological
                    controversy, shunning not to cross swords with the formidable Bellarmine. He was
                    a scholar among scholars, being furnished with extraordinary resources of
                    learning. His works, which even the <hi rend="italic">Biographia Britannica</hi>
                    (1778) testifies, were famous over Europe, were collected at Amsterdam in 5
                    vols. 4to. Only a very small proportion were translated into his mother tongue.
