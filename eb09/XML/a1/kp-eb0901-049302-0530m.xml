                    earl of Stirling, poet. The family of Alexander of Menstrie— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> of the poet— is of ancient lineage, “tracing its descent from
                    Somerled, lord of the Isles, in the reign of Malcolm IV., through a misty
                    Highland genealogy, to John, lord of the Isles, who married the Princess
                    Margaret, daughter of King Robert II. Their son, Alexander, was father of Angus,
                    who founded the family of Macalister of Loup, and of Alexander, who obtained
                    from the Argyle family a grant of the lands of Menstrie in Stirlingshire, and
                    settled there— his descendants assuming his christian name of Alexander as their
                    surname. The fifth in descent from this personage was Alexander Alexander, whose
                    successor was his son, William Alexander, the poet” (Works: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introductory Memoir,</hi> vol. i. p. ix., 1870). From his (rare) engraved
                    portrait, William was, it appears, aged 57 in 1637; so that he must have been
                    born (at Menstrie House, where afterwards was born Sir Ralph Abercromby) in
                    1580. The grammar school of neighbouring Stirling probably furnished his early
                    education; of his later, it is simply known that he attended the university of
                    Glasgow. On leaving it he proceeded on his travels with Archibald, seventh earl
                    of Argyle. It is supposed that it was during his sojourn on the Continent he
                    composed his series of sonnets, afterwards published under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Avrora</hi> (1604). He was tutor to the young earl. Upon his
                    return he proceeded to court, and won for himself speedily a name as a gentleman
                    of parts and learning. The first of his <hi rend="italic">Monarchicke
                    Tragedies</hi> had been published at Edinburgh in 1603, viz., <hi rend="italic"
                    >The</hi><hi rend="italic">Tragedie</hi><hi rend="italic">of Darivs,</hi> which,
                    like his <hi rend="italic">Parenesis to the Prince</hi> (1604), bore on the
                    title-page simply, “By William Alexander of Menstrie.” In 1604 he reprinted <hi
                    rend="italic">Darivs</hi> along with a new tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coesar,</hi> giving the two the afterwards more celebrated title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Monarchicke Tragedies —</hi> ultimately increased by <hi
                    rend="italic">The Alexandraen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Julius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Caesar</hi> (1607). In 1607 he describes himself as “William
                    Alexander, gentleman of the prince’s privy chamber.” King James was much taken
                    with him. He held his office with the prince of Wales until his lamented death
                    in 1612, on which he published his <hi rend="italic">Elegie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">on the Heath of Prince Henrie</hi> (Edinburgh, 1612). In 1612 he
                    was made master of bequests, and knighted; his title-page of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elegie</hi> bearing to be by “Sir William Alexander of Menstrie.”
                    In 1614 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Doomesday; or, the Great Hay of the
                    Lord’s Ivdgement</hi> (Edinburgh). In 1621 (September 21) he received the most
                    prodigious “gift” ever bestowed on a subject, viz., “a gift and grant” of
                    Canada, inclusive of Nova Scotia, or Acadie, and Newfoundland—a fact declarative
                    of royal ignorance of what the gift really was. Yet was it subsequently
                    confirmed by Charles I. In 1624, Alexander, in relation to his grant, published
                    <hi rend="italic">An Encouragement to Colonies—</hi> twice at least reprinted
                    (1625 and 1630). The gift and grant belong to history rather than biography, and
                    their later results to the romance of the peerage and of law. In 1626 he was
                    appointed Secretary of State for Scotland, and in 1630 created a peer, as Lord
                    Alexander of Tullibody, and Viscount Stirling. In 1631 he was made an
                    extraordinary judge in the Court of Session. In 1632 he built Argyle House, a
                    quaint building, which remains one of the “lions” of Stirling. In 1633 he was
                    advanced a step in the peerage, being created Earl of Stirling and Viscount
                    Canada; and in 1639 Earl of Dovan. In 1637 he collected his poetical works, and
                    issued them as <hi rend="italic">Recreations with the Muses,</hi> “by William,
                    Earle of Sterline,” with his portrait engraved by Marshall. This folio did not
                    include either <hi rend="italic">Avrora</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Psalms of
                    King David</hi> (Oxford, 1631), although there seems little doubt that he,
                    rather than King James, was the main author of the latter. It, however, first
                    gave his second sacred poem (incomplete) of <hi rend="italic">Jonathan.</hi> He
                    died in London on 12th February 1640, and later his remains were transferred to
                    Stirling. Lauded by Sir Robert Ayton and William Drummond of Haw-thornden, the
                    Earl of Stirling, nevertheless, soon fell out of men’s memories. The recent
                    careful and beautiful edition of his <hi rend="italic">Poetical Works</hi> (3
                    vols.) ought to revive his fame; for while there is too often a wearying
                    wordiness, the student-reader is rewarded with “full many a gem of purest ray
                    serene.” His <hi rend="italic">Doomesday</hi> has some grand things; his <hi
                    rend="italic">Avrora</hi> suggests comparison with Sidney’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Astrophel and Stella.</hi> (Works as above; Laing’s <hi rend="italic">Baillie's
                    Letters and Journals,</hi> iii. 529; <hi rend="italic">Drummond MSS.,</hi> by
                    Laing; <hi rend="italic">Hunter's MSS.,</hi> in Brit. Museum.) <hi
