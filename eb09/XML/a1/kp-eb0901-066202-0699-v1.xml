                <p><label type="entry">AMBROSE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Saint</hi></label>, Bishop of
                    Milan, was one of the most eminent fathers of the church in the fourth century.
                    He. was a citizen of Rome, born in Gaul,—according to some historians, in the
                    year 334, but according to others in 340. At the period of his birth his father
                    was praetorian prefect of Gallia Narbonensis; and upon his death the widow
                    repaired to Rome with her family. Ambrose received a religious education, and
                    was reared in habits of virtue by his mother, an accomplished woman, and eminent
                    for her piety. The names of his instructors in the rudiments of Greek and Roman
                    literature have not been transmitted to posterity; but in these branches he made
                    early proficiency, and having directed his attention to the law, he employed his
                    eloquence with such reputation in the praetorian court of Anicius Probus, that
                    he was soon deemed worthy of a place in the council. After he had continued in
                    this station for some time, Probus appointed him consular prefect of Liguria and
                    Aemilia, comprehending the territories of Milan, Liguria, Turin, Genoa, and
                    Bologna. Milan was chosen as the place of his residence and, by the prudent and
                    gentle use of his power, he conducted the affairs of the province with general
                    approbation and growing popularity.</p>
                <p>The death of Auxentius, bishop of Milan, in the year 374, made a sudden change in
                    the fortune and literary pursuits of Ambrose. At that period the tide of
                    religious contention ran high between the orthodox and the Arians, and a
                    violent· contest arose concerning the choice of a successor to Auxentius. When
                    the people were assembled in the church to elect the new bishop, Ambrose, in the
                    character of governor of the place, presented himself to the assembly, and in a
                    grave, eloquent, and pathetic address, admonished the multitude to lay aside
                    their contentions, and proceed to the election in the spirit of religious
                    meekness. It is reported that when Ambrose had finished his address, a child
                    cried out, “Ambrose is bishop,” and that the agitated multitude, regarding this
                    as a miraculous intimation, unanimously elected Ambrose bishop of Milan. Some
                    suppose that this was entirely a device of Ambrose or his friends; others
                    ascribe it to mere accident. Ambrose professed strong reluctance, and even fled,
                    or pretended to fly, from the city in order to avoid the intended honour. The
                    place of his concealment, however, was soon discovered; the emperor’s
                    confirmation of his election was made known to him; and after being baptized, he
                    was ordained bishop of Milan, about the end of the year 374. Whatever we may
                    think of the singular conduct of Ambrose in accepting an office for which he was
                    certainly unqualified in respect of previous studies, habits, and employments,
                    it must be admitted that he immediately betook himself to the necessary studies,
                    and acquitted himself in his new elevation with ability, boldness, and
                    integrity. Having apportioned his money among the poor, and settled his lands
                    upon the church, with the exception of making his sister tenant during life, and
                    having committed the care of his family to his brother, he entered upon a
                    regular course of theological study, under the care of Simplician, a presbyter
                    of Rome, and devoted himself to the labours of the church.</p>
                <p>The irruption of the Goths and the northern barbarians, who rushed down upon the
                    Roman empire at this time, spreading terror and desolation all around, compelled
                    Ambrose, along with several others, to retire to Illyricum, but his exile was of
                    short duration, for the northern invaders were quickly defeated by the forces of
                    the emperor, and driven back with considerable loss into their own
                    territories.</p>
                <p>The eloquence of Ambrose soon found ample scope in the dispute between the Arians
                    and the orthodox. About this era the doctrine of Arius concerning the person of
                    Christ had been extensively received, and had many powerful defenders both among
                    the clergy and the common people. Ambrose espoused the cause of the Catholics.
                    Gratian, the son of the elder Valentinian, took the same side; but the younger
                    Valentinian, who had now become his colleague in the empire, adopted the
                    opinions of the Arians; and all the arguments and eloquence of Ambrose were
                    insufficient to reclaim the young prince to the orthodox faith. Theodosius, the
                    emperor of the East, also professed the orthodox belief; but there were many
                    adherents of Arius scattered throughout his dominions. In this distracted state
                    of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, Palladius and Secundianus,
                    confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all
                    parts of that empire. This request appeared so equitable that he' complied
                    without hesitation; but Ambrose, foreseeing the consequence, prevailed upon the
                    emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops. A
                    synod, composed of thirty-two bishops, was accordingly held at Aquileia in the
                    year 381. Ambrose was elected president; and Palladius being called upon to
                    defend his opinions, declined, insisting that the meeting was a partial one, and
                    that the whole bishops of the empire not being present, the sense of the
                    Christian church concerning the question in dispute could not be obtained. A
                    vote was then taken, when Palladius and his associate Secundianus were deposed
                    from the episcopal office.</p>
                <p>Ambrose was equally zealous in combating the heathen <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n700/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0901-0700-0663"/> superstitions. Upon the accession of
                    Valentinian II., many of the senators who remained attached to the pagan
                    idolatry made a vigorous effort to restore the worship of the heathen deities.
                    Symmachus, a very opulent man and a great orator, who was at that time prefect
                    of the city, was intrusted with the management of the pagan cause, and drew up a
                    forcible petition, praying for the restoration of the altar of Victory to its
                    ancient station in the hall of the senate, the proper support of seven vestal
                    virgins, and the regular observance of the other pagan ceremonies. In the
                    petition he argued that this form of religion had long been profitable to the
                    Roman state, and reminded the emperor how much Rome had been indebted to
                    Victory, and that it had been the uniform custom of the senators to swear
                    fidelity to the government upon that altar. He likewise adduced many facts to
                    prove the advantages accruing to the state from its ancient religious
                    institutions, and pleaded that, as it was one divinity that all men worshipped
                    under different forms, ancient practice should not be rashly laid aside. He even
                    proceeded so far as to assert the justice of increasing the public revenue by
                    robbing the church, and attributed the late famine which had overtaken the
                    empire to the neglect of the ancient worship. To this petition Ambrose replied
                    in a letter to Valentinian, arguing that the devoted worshippers of idols had
                    often been forsaken by their deities; that the native valour of the Roman
                    soldiers had gained their victories, and not the pretended influence of pagan
                    priests; that these idolatrous worshippers requested for themselves what they
                    refused to Christians; that voluntary was more honourable than constrained
                    virginity; that as the Christian ministers declined to receive temporal
                    emoluments, they should also be denied to pagan priests; that it was absurd to
                    suppose that God would inflict a famine upon the empire for neglecting to
                    support a religious system contrary to His will as revealed in the Scriptures;
                    that the whole process of nature encouraged innovations, and that all nations
                    had permitted them, even in religion; that heathen sacrifices were offensive to
                    Christians; and that it was the duty of a Christian prince to suppress pagan
                    ceremonies. In the epistles of Symmachus and of Ambrose both the petition and
                    the reply are preserved, in which sophistry, superstition, sound sense, and
                    solid argument are strangely blended. It is scarcely necessary to add that the
                    petition was unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>The increasing strength of the Arians proved too formidable for Ambrose. In 384
                    the young emperor and his mother Justina, along with a considerable number of
                    clergy and laity professing the Arian faith, requested from the bishop the use
                    of two churches, one in the city, the other in the suburbs of Milan. The prelate
                    believing the bishops to be the guardians both of the temporal and spiritual
                    interests of the church, and regarding the religious edifices as the
                    unquestionable property of the church, positively refused to deliver up the
                    temples of the Lord into the impious hands of heretics. Filled with indignation,
                    Justina resolved to employ the imperial authority of her son in procuring by
                    force what she could not obtain by persuasion. Ambrose was required to answer
                    for his conduct before the council. He went, attended by a numerous crowd of
                    people, whose impetuous zeal so overawed the ministers of Valentinian that he
                    was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day
                    following, when he was performing divine service in the Basilica, the prefect of
                    the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian church in the
                    suburbs. As he still continued obstinate, the court proceeded to violent
                    measures: the officers of the household were commanded to prepare the Basilica
                    and the Portian churches to celebrate divine service upon the arrival of the
                    emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of Easter. Perceiving the growing
                    strength of the prelate’s interest, the court deemed it prudent to restrict its
                    demand to the use of one of the churches. But all entreaties proved in vain, and
                    drew forth the following characteristic declaration from the bishop :—“If you
                    demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will
                    not resist; but I will never betray the church of Christ. I will not call upon
                    the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the altar rather than desert
                    it. The tumult of the people I will not encourage; but God alone can appease
                    it.”</p>
                <p>Many circumstances in the history of Ambrose are strongly characteristic of the
                    general spirit of the times. The chief causes of his victory over his opponents
                    were his great popularity and the superstitious reverence paid to the episcopal
                    character at that period. But it must also be noted that he used several
                    indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people. He was
                    liberal to the poor; it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on
                    the public characters of his times; and he introduced popular reforms in the
                    order and manner of public worship. It is alleged, too, that at a time when the
                    influence of Ambrose required vigorous support, he was admonished in a dream to
                    search for, and found under the pavement of the church, the remains of two
                    martyrs, Gervasius and Protasius. The vulgar crowded to behold these venerable
                    relics, and, according to report, a number of sick persons were healed by
                    touching the bones. Ambrose exulted in these miracles, and appealed to them in
                    his eloquent sermons; while the court derided and called in question their
                    existence. It is remarkable that these and many other miracles obtained current
                    credit among the Christian historians of the second, third, and fourth
                    centuries; and Dr Cave, in speaking of them, says— <hi rend="italic">“</hi> I
                    make no doubt but God suffered them to be wrought at this time on purpose to
                    confront the Arian impieties.”</p>
                <p>Although the court was displeased with the religious principles and conduct of
                    Ambrose, it respected his great political talents; and when necessity required,
                    his aid was solicited and generously granted. When Maximus usurped the supreme
                    power in Gaul, and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent Ambrose
                    to dissuade him from the undertaking; and the embassy was successful On a second
                    attempt of the same kind Ambrose was again employed; and although he was
                    unsuccessful, it cannot be doubted that, if his advice had been followed, the
                    schemes of the usurper would have proved abortive; but the enemy was permitted
                    to enter Italy, and Milan was taken Justina and her son fled; but Ambrose
                    remained at his post, and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing
                    the plate of the church to be melted for their relief. Theodosius, the emperor
                    of the East, espoused the cause of Justina, and regained the kingdom.</p>
                <p>In the year 390 a tumult happened at Thessalonica, in which Botheric, one of the
                    imperial officers, was slain. Theodosius was so enraged at this that he issued a
                    royal mandate for the promiscuous massacre of the inhabitants of the place, and
                    about 7000 persons were butchered without distinction or mercy. The deed called
                    forth a severe rebuke from Ambrose, who charged the emperor not to approach the
                    holy communion with his hands stained with innocent blood. The emperor reminded
                    him that David had been guilty of murder and of adultery. The bishop replied,
                    “You have imitated David in his guilt; go and imitate him in his repentance.”
                    The prince obeyed, and after a course of eight months’ penance he was absolved,
                    on condition that in future an interval of thirty days should intervene before
                    any sentence of death or confiscation was executed.</p>
                <p>The generosity of Ambrose was favourably exhibited in <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n701/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0901-0701-0664"/> the year 392, after the assassination of
                    Valentinian and the usurpation of Eugenius. Rather than join the standard of the
                    usurper, he fled from Milan; but when Theodosius was eventually victorious, he
                    supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported Eugenius. Soon
                    after acquiring the undisputed possession of the Roman empire, Theodosius died
                    at Milan (395). Bishop Ambrose did not long survive him, having died in the year
                    397.</p>
                <p>On many accounts the character of the bishop of Milan stands high among the
                    fathers of the ancient church. With unvarying steadiness he delivered his
                    religious sentiments on all occasions; with unwearied assiduity he discharged
                    the duties of his office; with unabated zeal and boldness he defended the
                    orthodox cause in opposition to the Arians; with a liberal hand he fed the
                    numerous poor who flocked to his dwelling; with uncommon generosity he
                    manifested kindness to his adversaries; and with Christian affection he sought
                    the happiness of all men. His general disposition and habits were amiable and
                    virtuous, and his powers of mind vigorous and persevering. Ambition and bigotry
                    were the chief blemishes in his character.</p>
                <p>The writings of Ambrose are voluminous, but many of them are little more than
                    reproductions of the works of Origen and other Greek fathers. The great design
                    of them was to defend and propagate the Catholic faith. His expositions of
                    Scripture contain many extreme examples of allegorical and mystical
                    interpretation. Modern readers will regard much in the writings of Ambrose as
                    trivial, and even as ludicrous; but his style is vigorous, and the sentiment is
                    often weighty. Gibbon’s judgment appears to be too severe: “Ambrose could act
                    better than he could write; his compositions are destitute of taste or genius,
                    without the spirit of Tertullian, the copious elegance of Lactantius, the lively
                    wit of Jerome, or the grave energy of Augustin.” His exegetical writings include
                    an exposition of the Gospel of St Luke, and commentaries on certain Psalms. His
                        <hi rend="italic">Hexaemeron</hi> is a homiletical treatise on the history
                    of the creation. <hi rend="italic">"The Hymns</hi> of St Ambrose have exercised
                    a powerful influence on Christendom. They were designed by him to be a
                    preventive against the errors of Arianism, and to confirm the professors of the
                    true faith in the doctrines of the Trinity and the divinity of Christ.</p>
                <p>. . Very many of them have found a place in the liturgies of the western Church.
                    On account of the celebrity of St Ambrose, many hymns have been attributed to
                    him which are not his; and, on the other hand, some critics have gone into the
                    opposite extreme, and have deprived him of his property. In the Benedictine
                    edition of his works only twelve hymns are admitted; and Dom. Biraghi [of the

                <p>A liturgical form, the Ambrosian Ritual, which is still in use in the
                    arch-diocese of Milan, has been traditionally ascribed to Saint Ambrose. Several
                    attempts were made, in particular by the Emperor Charlemagne and Pope Nicolas
                    II., to secure uniformity by enforcing the adoption of the Roman breviary
                    throughout the Western Church, but the clergy of Milan refused to yield. The
                    ritual of Ambrose is included in the <hi rend="italic">Liturgia Latinorum</hi>
                    of Pamelius (Cologne, 1571-6). “Full information concerning its history will be
