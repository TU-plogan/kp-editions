                    celebrated Nonconformist divine, was educated in St John’s College, Cambridge.
                    He received deacon’s orders from a bishop, whereupon he settled as
                    assistant-master in the free school of Oakham, Rutland. He was recovered from
                    indifferent associates here by a very worthy minister, the Rev. Benjamin King.
                    Subsequently he married Mr King’s daughter, and “becoming a convert to his
                    principles, received ordination in the Presbyterian way, not being satisfied
                    with that which he had from the bishop.” He was presented to the living of Wilby
                    in Northamptonshire; but was thence ejected by the Act of Uniformity in 1662.
                    After his ejection he preached privately at Oakham and Wellingborough, sharing
                    the common pains and penalties of Nonconformists— <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>,

                    Sherlock, called <hi rend="italic">Antisozzo</hi> (after Socinus), written in
                    the vein of Andrew Marvell’s <hi rend="italic">Rehearsal Transprosed,</hi>
                    procured him much celebrity as a wit. Dr Robert South, who cannot be supposed to
                    have been favourably disposed towards the Nonconformists, publicly pronounced
                    that Alsop had the advantage of Sherlock in every way. Besides fame, <hi
                    rend="italic">Antisozzo</hi> procured for its author an invitation to succeed
                    the venerable Mr Cawton in Westminster. He accepted the call, and drew great
                    multitudes to his chapel. The other books he published showed a fecundity of
                    wit, a playful strength of reasoning, and a provoking indomitableness of
                    raillery. Even with Dr Goodman and Dr Stillingfleet for antagonists, he more
                    than held his own. His <hi rend="italic">Mischief of Impositions</hi> in answer
                    to the latter’s <hi rend="italic">Mischief of Separation,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Melius Inquirendum</hi> in answer to the former’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Compassionate Inquiry,</hi> remain historical landmarks in the
                    history of Nonconformity. Later on, from the entanglements of a son in alleged
                    treasonable practices, he had to sue for and obtained pardon from King James II.
                    This seems to have given a somewhat diplomatic character to his closing years,
                    inasmuch as, while remaining a Nonconformist, he had a good deal to do with
                    proposed political-ecclesiastical compromises. He died May 8, 1703. <hi
