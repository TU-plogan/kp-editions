                <p><label type="entry">ALI</label>, the fourth in order of the caliphs or successors
                    of Mahomet, was born at Mecca, about the year 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    His father, Abu Taleb, was an uncle of the prophet, and Ali himself was adopted
                    by Mahomet and educated under his care. While he was still a mere boy he
                    distinguished himself by being the first to declare his adhesion to the cause of
                    Mahomet, who in return made him his vicegerent, and some years after gave him
                    his daughter Fatima in marriage. Ali proved himself to be a brave and faithful
                    soldier; and when Mahomet died without male issue, he seemed to have the best
                    claims to become the recognised head of Islamism. Three other companions of
                    Mahomet, however, Abubekr, Omar, and Othman, occupied this position before him,
                    and it was not until 656, after the murder of Othman, that he assumed the title
                    of caliph. Almost the first act of his reign was the suppression of a rebellion
                    under Telha and Zobeir, who were instigated by Ayesha, the widow of Mahomet, a
                    bitter enemy of Ali, and hitherto one of the chief hindrances to his advancement
                    to the caliphate. The rebel army was defeated at Kharibah, near Bassorah, the
                    two generals being killed, and Ayesha taken prisoner. Ali’s next care was to get
                    rid of the opposition of Moawyah, who had established himself in Syria at the
                    head of a numerous army. A bloody battle took place in the plain of Suffein,
                    near the Euphrates, which seemed at first to be going in favour of Ali; when
                    suddenly a number of the enemy, fixing copies of the Koran to the points of
                    their spears, exclaimed that “the matter ought to be settled by reference to
                    this book, which forbids Mussulmans to shed each other’s blood.” On hearing this
                    the superstitious soldiers of Ali refused to fight any longer, and demanded that
                    the matter should be referred to arbitration. Abu Musa was appointed umpire on
                    the part of Ali, and Amru, one of the shrewdest men in the kingdom, on the part
                    of Moawyah. Amru persuaded Abu Musa that it would be for the advantage of
                    Moslemism that neither candidate should reign; and also, with a pretence of
                    deference, asked him to give his decision first. Abu Musa, falling into the
                    snare, proclaimed that he deposed both Ali and Moawyah; thereupon Amru declared
                    that he also deposed Ali, but that he invested Moawyah with the caliphate. This
                    treacherous decision greatly injured the cause of Ali, which was still further
                    weakened by the loss of Egypt, Syria, and Persia, including the sacred cities of
                    Mecca and Medina. Ali, however, resolved to make a final effort, and collected a
                    large army for that purpose. He was not destined to see the result of his plans.
                    Three of the fanatic sect of the Karigites made an agreement to assassinate Ali,
                    Moawyah, and Amru as the authors of disastrous feuds among the faithful. The
                    only victim of this plot was Ali, who died at Kufa in 661, of the wound
                    inflicted by a poisoned weapon. He had eight wives besides Fatima, and in all,
                    it is said, thirty-three children, one of whom, Hassan, a son of Fatima,
                    succeeded him in the caliphate. Ali is described as a bold, noble, and generous
                    man, “the last and worthiest of the primitive Moslems, who imbibed his religious
                    enthusiasm from companionship with the prophet himself, and who followed to the
                    last the simplicity of his example.” He was also remarkable for learning and
                    wisdom, and there are still extant collections of proverbs, verses, &amp;c.,
                    which bear his name, especially the <hi rend="italic">Sentences of Ali,</hi> an
                    English translation of which, by William Yule, was published at Edinburgh in
                    1832. The question of All’s right to succeed to the caliphate is an article of
                    faith which divided the Mahometan world into two great sects, the Sunnis and the
                    Shiahs, the former denying and the latter affirming his right. The Turks,
                    consequently, who are usually Sunnis, hold his memory in abhorrence; whereas the
                    Persians, who are generally Shiahs, venerate him as second only to the prophet,
                    and celebrate the anniversary of his martyrdom.</p>
