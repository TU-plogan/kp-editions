                    boundaries, however, are in many parts not accurately determined. It extends for
                    about 550 miles along the coast, and stretches inland from 320 to 380 miles;
                    lying between 2° 10' W. and 8° 50' E. long., and 32° and 37° N. lat. The area is
                    estimated at about 150,500 English square miles.</p>
                <p>The country is generally mountainous, being traversed by lofty ranges of the
                    Atlas system, which run nearly parallel to the coast, and rise in some places to
                    the height of upwards of 7000 feet. These are commonly divided into two leading
                    chains, which are distinguished as the Great and Little Atlas. The former, which
                    is the more southern and bordering on the Sahara, contains some of the highest
                    points in the country. The Little Atlas or Maritime Atlas, as it is sometimes
                    called, lies between the sea and the Great Atlas, and is composed of numerous
                    diversified ranges generally of no great elevation. A number of smaller chains
                    lie between these principal ones, and also between the latter and the sea,
                    forming so many ascending steps or degrees. These principal ranges are connected
                    by numerous transverse ones, thus forming extensive table-lands and elevated
                    valleys, with no connection between them but the intervening heights.
                    Occasionally the principal ranges are broken by deep defiles and narrow valleys.
                    The maritime region presents numerous narrow valleys, each carrying down to the
                    sea its mountain stream. In some parts the mountains rise abruptly from the sea,
                    in others a tract of flat land intervenes between the mountains and the coast,
                    and this is usually marshy, but sometimes fertile and well cultivated. There are
                    a number of extensive plains near the coast, one of the most important of which
                    is that of Metidja, commencing on the eastern side of the bay of Algiers, and
                    stretching thence inland to the south and west. It is about 60 miles in length
                    by 10 or 12 in breadth. Another great alluvial plain extends south and west for
                    many miles from the vicinity of Bona. A third similar plain lies to the
                    southeast and south-west of Oran, and south of Mostaganem is the plain of
                    Shellif. The coast is generally steep and rocky, abounding in capes and gulfs,
                    but very deficient in good harbours, and even in secure roadsteads, in
                    consequence of its exposure to the north winds.</p>
                <p>The rivers are numerous, but the majority of them have short courses. They mostly
                    rise in the mountains near the coast, and rush down with great impetuosity
                    through deep and rocky channels, presenting the character of mountain torrents.
                    During the rainy season they are much swollen, so as to render communication
                    with different parts of the country extremely difficult. The most important
                    river, both from the length of its course and the volume of its waters, is the
                    Shellif, which, rising in the northern slopes of the Djebel Amur, flows first
                    north and then west till it empties itself into the Mediterranean near
                    Mostaganem after a course of 370 miles, during which it receives numerous
                    tributary streams. The Seybouse is formed by the union of several small streams
                    in the interior of the province of Constantine, south-east of the town of that
                    name, and after a course of about 120 miles falls into the Mediterranean near
                    Bona. The Summam, which contains the greatest body of water after the Shellif,
                    rises in the interior of the province of Algiers near Aumale, and pursues a
                    generally north-east direction to its mouth near Bougie. The Rummel, formed of
                    several small streams south of the town Constantine, passes that town and
                    pursues a north-west direction to the sea. Among the less important rivers which
                    empty themselves into the Mediterranean are the Harrach, Isser, Mazefran, Tafna,
                    and Macta. Besides these, there are a number of streams in the interior, but
                    they are less known and are generally dry except in the rainy season.</p>
                <p>Algeria abounds in extensive lakes and marshes. Of the lakes in the northern part
                    of the country, near the coast, the principal are,—the Fezara 14 miles
                    south-west of Bona; the two lakes Sebkha and El Melah south of Oran; the three
                    small lakes in the immediate vicinity of Calle, and several others. In the
                    southern parts of the country are the extensive lakes of Chott-el-Harbi or
                    Western Chott. the Chott-el-Chergui or Eastern Chott; the Zarhez-Gherbi and the
                    Zarhez-Chergui; the Grand Sebkha-el-Chott, and a number of others. These are
                    mostly dried up in summer, leaving a thick stratum of salt. Many of the marshes,
                    especially in the neighbourhood of the larger towns, have been drained by the
                    French, and the climate has thus been rendered more salubrious. There are also a
                    number of warm mineral springs, containing principally salts of lime, which are
                    used with success by the Arabs in several kinds of disease. Some of these are in
                    the vicinity of Calle Bougie, Milianah, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Algeria is divided by a line running nearly east and west into two distinct
                    zones, called by the natives the <hi rend="italic">Tell</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Sahara.</hi> The Tell constitutes the zone bordering upon the
                    Mediterranean, and is the cultivated land—the land of corn. It consists of a
                    series of fertile basins, yielding almost exclusively corn of different kinds,
                    especially wheat and barley. Some parts of it are extremely fertile, but at the
                    same time flat and uniform. The chains separating the basins are clothed with
                    timber, and peopled by the Kabyles. The Sahara lies to the south of the Tell,
                    and is the region of pastures and of fruits. Hence, while the inhabitants of the
                    Tell are agriculturists, those of the Sahara are shepherds and gardeners. The
                    Sahara is sometimes spoken of as a desert, at other times as the country of
                    dates. It may properly be divided into two regions; the northern is mountainous,
                    but at the same time more fertile, better watered, and more populous than the
                    other, which, bordering on the Great Desert, consists chiefly of oases of
                    greater or less extent. The villages of the Sahara are surrounded by belts of
                    fruit trees, of which the palm is the chief, though there are also pomegranate,
                    fig, apricot, peach, and other trees, and vines. On the mountain ranges near the
                    coast are extensive forests of various species of oak, pine, cedar, elm, ash,
                    maple, olive, &amp;c. The cork tree is also very common. The trees, especially
                    the cedars and oaks, are frequently of gigantic size. Great injury is often done
                    to the forests by the people annually burning up the grass of their fields. In
                    this way extensive forests are sometimes consumed. The want of roads and
                    navigable rivers has prevented the French from deriving much benefit as yet from
                    the forests. Besides wheat and barley, the cotton plant, sugar-cane, and tobacco
                    are extensively cultivated.</p>
                <p>The animal kingdom presents little calling for notice. Lions, formerly very
                    plentiful, are now extremely rare; leopards, panthers, jackals, and hyaenas are
                    still common; and monkeys and apes are numerous. The wild boar is found in the
                    oak forests, and the brown bear in the higher parts of the country. There are
                    also various species of antelope. Of the feathered tribes, eagles, vultures,
                    hawks, and owls are common; snipes, curlews, plovers, storks, and herons
                    frequent the marshy parts; and the ostrich has its habitat in the desert. Among
                    the reptiles are various species of serpents, tortoises, turtles, lizards,
                    &amp;c. Locusts are common, and sometimes do great damage to the crops. One of
                    the severest invasions of these pests ever known occurred in 1866, when the
                    crops were nearly all destroyed, and the loss sustained by the colonists was
                    estimated at £800,000. The coast is rich in coral and sponges, and the obtaining
                    of these forms a considerable branch of industry. The chief wealth of most of
                    the Arab tribes consists in their sheep, of which they frequently possess
                    immense flocks; camels are also common, but the horses and mules are more
                    esteemed, and are noted for their excellence.</p>

                <p>From its position, Algeria might be supposed to enjoy a warm climate; but the
                    temperature varies considerably in different parts, according to the elevation
                    and configuration of the country. In the northern districts the climate very
                    much resembles that of the south of Spain, while in the Sahara the heat is often
                    excessive. In the more elevated regions the winter is frequently very severe;
                    but along the coast the temperature is mild, very rarely sinking to the
                    freezing-point even in winter, when heavy rains are of frequent occurrence. Dr
                    Shaw knew the thermometer reach the freezing-point only twice during twelve
                    years’ residence at Algiers. The coldest month is January, the hottest August.
                    The rains prevail from December to February; the temperate season continues from
                    March to June, and the hot season lasts from July to November. The mean annual
                    temperature of the town of Algiers is about 66.5° Fahr.; being for the coldest
                    month 48°, and for the hottest 83°. During summer there is a great difference
                    between the day and night temperature, especially in the inland districts. The
                    simoom or hot wind of the desert sweeps at intervals over the country, between
                    May and September, impregnating the air with fine sand from the desert. In
                    general, with the exception of places in the vicinity of the marshes, Algeria
                    possesses a healthy climate. Ophthalmia, however, is very common, and
                    elephantiasis is by no means an unusual disease, owing to the want of
                    cleanliness among the country people.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A Parliamentary Report on the climate of Algeria published
                    in 1867 is of great interest, particularly as investigating the causes of the
                    great reduction in the mortality of the French troops serving there. The
                    death-rate in Algerian hospitals for the first five years succeeding the
                    conquest amounted to nearly 79 per 1000; and for the period from 1831 to 1846 it
                    is given as high as 80 per 1000. In 1860 the deathrate per 1000 was only 17∙8;
                    in 1861, 11∙3; in 1862, 12∙21; in 1863, 12∙29; and in 1864, 14∙48. The causes of
                    this remarkable difference are stated to be—the former existence of certain
                    unhealthy conditions in the country itself, and in the mode of life of both
                    troops and colonists, which were accompanied by a high death-rate; and the
                    subsequent removal to a certain extent of these conditions, together with the
                    introduction of improved habits and modes of life, accompanied by improved
                    health and lower death-rates.</p></note></p>
                <p>Besides the Europeans there are eight distinct races of inhabitants in
                    Algeria—(1.) The Kabyles or Berbers, the descendants of the aboriginal
                    inhabitants of the country, constitute a large portion of the entire population.
                    They occupy chiefly the more elevated and mountainous parts, but numbers of them
                    also inhabit the plains and valleys. They are described as an active,
                    industrious race, living in villages, and principally engaged in agriculture and
                    the cultivation of fruit trees. They also make their own agricultural
                    implements, guns, gunpowder, leather, carpets, &amp;c. (2.) The Arabs are a very
                    numerous class, and inhabit principally the southern parts of the country. Some
                    of them are cultivators of the soil, and live in villages in the neighbourhood
                    of the towns; but the majority of them have no fixed habitation, dwelling in
                    tents and moving about from place to place. These are the Bedouins or nomadic
                    Arabs, and are the most unsettled and turbulent of the Algerine population. (3.)
                    The Moors, a mixed race, inhabit the towns and villages chiefly on or near the
                    sea-coast. (4.) The Jews are also to be found in the towns, and are engaged in
                    mercantile pursuits. (5.) The Turks, though long the dominant race, were never
                    very numerous, and since the French conquest they have nearly disappeared. (6.)
                    The Kolougis are the descendants of Turks by native women, and constitute a
                    considerable proportion of the inhabitants of Algiers and other towns. (7.) The
                    Negroes were originally brought from the interior and sold as slaves, but
                    slavery now no longer exists. (8.) The Mozabites are an African race, to be
                    found inhabiting the coast towns, and chiefly engaged in manual labour. They are
                    described as an honest, industrious, and peaceable people.</p>
                <p>The European civil population of Algeria amounted to only 45,000 persons in 1840,
                    and in 1845 it had increased to 75,867. In Dec. 1849 it had risen to 112,607, of
                    whom 58,005 were French, 6943 Maltese, 33,659 Spaniards, 6986 Italians, 2515
                    Germans, 1253 Swiss, and 3246 of other nations. According to the census of 1861
                    the entire population of Algeria was 2,966,836, of whom 2,374,091 were nomadic
                    native races, 112,229 French, and 80,517 other Europeans. In 1866 the entire
                    population was 2,921,246, of whom 2,434,974 were of indigenous wandering tribes,
                    217,990 Europeans, and 251,050 natives settled in towns. Of the Europeans,
                    122,119 were French, 58,510 Spaniards, 16,655 Italians, 10,627 Maltese, and 5636
                    Germans. In the civil territory the entire population in 1870 is given as
                    478,342, of which 121,629 were French, 97,913 other Europeans, 33,117 Jews, and
                    225,693 Mahometans.</p>
                <p>When under the dominion of the Turks, this country was governed by a dey, and
                    divided into four provinces— Algiers and Titterie in the centre, Tlemcen in the
                    west, and Constantine in the east. The last three were governed by beys under
                    the dey. At present it is divided into three provinces—Algiers in the centre,
                    Oran in the west, and Constantine in the east. Till 1871 the country was
                    entirely under military rule, but in that year various important reforms were
                    introduced; and in place of the former military governor a civil
                    governor-general was appointed to administer the affairs of the colony, and to
                    direct the action of both civil and military authorities. He is invested with
                    legislative powers in civil matters; but in all important cases he has to take
                    the advice of a colonial council, the members of which are appointed by the
                    French government. The power of the governorgeneral, however, extends only over
                    the settled districts. In the thinly-populated parts, and the districts where
                    the nomadic tribes are chiefly found, military rule still prevails. The three
                    provinces are subdivided into twelve departments, at the head of each of which
                    is a prefect, and under him are sub-prefects who rule over smaller divisions. By
                    an Act of 14th July 1865, the natives, both Mahometan and Jewish, were declared
                    entitled to the rank and prerogatives of French citizens, on placing themselves
                    completely and absolutely under the civil and political laws of France, and thus
                    were made admissible to all the grades in the army and navy, and to many posts
                    in the civil service of the state.</p>
                <p>In 1840 the revenue amounted to 5,610,706 frs. and the expenditure to 7,206,372
                    frs.; in 1850 these were respectively 19,632,271 frs. and 27,959,358 frs.; in
                    1860, 38,908,900 frs. and 39,471,372 frs.; and in 1870, 45,360,859 frs. and
                    51,762,316 frs. or £1,814,434 and £2,070,492. This expenditure does not include
                    the cost of the maintenance of the army, the expenditure for public works, and
                    other large sums disbursed by the home government. In the French financial
                    estimates for 1873 the home expenditure for Algeria was set down at 24,496,109
                    frs. or £979,844, and the revenue derived from the colony at 19,008,584 frs. or
                    £760,343. According to a statement made in the French legislative assembly in
                    1864, Algeria had cost the mother country three milliards of francs, or
                    £120,000,000 in money and 150,000 lives. The French army in Algeria numbers
                    about 60,000 men, and consists of two classes, namely, French troops, who remain
                    there for a certain number of years, and then return to France; and native
                    troops, who never quit the country except for fighting purposes.</p>
                <p>Algeria in the time of the Romans was noted for its fertility, and this is still
                    the character of the cultivated parts of the country. Many parts only want water
                    to render them fertile, and the government has lately sunk a number of Artesian
                    wells with the most beneficial results. The principal grain crops are wheat and
                    barley. In 1866 there were in the three provinces 4,163,367 acres of land under
                    different kinds of grain, and the produce amounted to 2,802,208 quarters; 28,132
                    acres of vineyards, 14,266 acres under cotton, 5957 under flax, and 9793 under
                    tobacco. In the province of Algiers the total area of land under cultivation
                    with cereals in 1868 was, in the civil portion, 178,642 acres, of which 120,286
                    were cultivated by Europeans; and in the military portion, 808,890 acres. The
                    total yield in the former case was 266,578, and in the latter 668,666 quarters.
                    These figures do not include other agricultural produce, such as beans, maize,
                    &amp;c, of which about 277,062 quarters were produced by 99,503 acres. The
                    produce of tobacco throughout the country was estimated at 6,845,000 lb. Olives
                    are grown largely and almost exclusively in the mountains of Kabylia.</p>

                <p>In that portion of the district included in the province of Algiers the quantity
                    of fruit gathered is estimated at over 100,000,000 lb. At present not much
                    attention is given to this article of production; but there can be no doubt that
                    with more care and attention Algeria might become one of the best
                    olive-producing countries in the world. Oranges are grown to a considerable
                    extent, and the trade in this article is increasing. The vine is cultivated; but
                    the produce is chiefly for home consumption, and it has scarcely yet become an
                    article of export. In the province of Algiers in 1868 about 1,350,000 gallons of
                    wine were produced. During the same year the exportation of cork from the colony
                    amounted to £63,932. The most important fibre is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >crin</hi><hi rend="italic">vegetal,</hi> or vegetable horse hair, produced from
                    the dwarf palm (<hi rend="italic">Cham</hi><hi rend="italic">oe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rops</hi><hi rend="italic">humilis),</hi> with which a vast
                    proportion of the uncultivated parts of the country is covered. Throughout the
                    entire colony, fibre to the value of £89,332 was exported in 1868. The alpha
                    fibre or esparto grass of Oran ranks next in importance, and is largely used in
                    the manufacture of paper. During the American war the cultivation of cotton was
                    extensively earned on, but since the close of the war it has very much fallen
                    off. flax is cultivated to a considerable extent in some parts. The rearing of
                    the silk-worm is also prosecuted.</p>
                <p>Although the mineral wealth of Algeria is enormous, mining operations have not
                    hitherto been carried on very extensively. The most important mineral products
                    are iron, copper, lead, mercury, and antimony. During 1868 the iron mines in the
                    province of Constantine turned out about 240,000 tons of ore, valued at
                    £486,672, being an increase of £185,532 as compared with the preceding year.
                    Nearly the whole of this was from the mine of Ain Mokra or Mokhta-el-Hadid,
                    which yields on an average 200,000 tons of ore per annum. The ore contains 65
                    per cent. of the metal. Lead ore to the value of £125,745 was exported during
                    that year.</p>
                <p>The trade of Algeria has very much increased since it became a French colony. The
                    imports, which in 1831 amounted to only £280,000, rose to £1,600,000 in 1844, to
                    £3,249,377 in 1854, and to nearly £4,500,000 in 1863. The exports, however, have
                    not grown in proportion; and during the ten years preceding 1863 they never
                    exceeded from 1½ to 2 millions sterling. In 1865 an Act declared the navigation
                    not only between France and Algeria but also between Algeria and foreign
                    countries open to all nations, and abolished various oppressive taxes affecting
                    foreign shipping. The following year these privileges were extended: the
                    coasting trade was thrown open and free navigation permitted, tonnage duties on
                    foreign shipping were abolished, and raw manufactured goods entering France free
                    of duty had the same advantage conceded to them in Algeria. Algerian products
                    might enter France free of duty, and the same privilege was accorded to French
                    products in Algeria, sugar excepted. In 1868 the imports amounted to £7,706,574,
                    which was an increase of £199,494 over the previous year. The proportions
                    received from the different countries were—France, 75 percent.; Turkey, 8∙44;
                    Russia, 4∙29; Spain, 3∙99; Great Britain, 3∙54; Italy, 2∙56; Barbary States,
                    1∙40. The imports from Turkey and Russia are exceptionally high, owing to the
                    necessity of obtaining grain supplies from these countries in consequence of a
                    failure in the crops. The principal ports of import were—Algiers, 40∙43 per
                    cent.; Oran, 33∙33; Philippeville, 15∙04; Bona, 7∙01; Mosta-ganem, 2∙33. In 1869
                    the imports amounted to £7,332,192, and in 1870 to £6,907,628. The principal
                    imports are cotton goods, wines, spirits, sugar, glass, crystal, cheese,
                    salt-fish, soap, &amp;c. The total value of the exports during 1868 amounted to
                    £4,122,772, being an increase of £236,293 as compared with 1867. The proportions
                    sent to the different countries were—France, 79∙20 per cent.; Spain, 11∙68;
                    Great Britain, 5∙84; Italy, 1∙80. The principal exports are sheep, oxen, skins,
                    wool, tobacco, flour, fresh and dried vegetables, olive-oil, flax, cotton, ores,
                    <hi rend="italic">crin</hi><hi rend="italic">vegetal.</hi> In 1869 the total
                    exports amounted to £4,438,045, and in 1870 to £4,978,250. The overland trade
                    between Algeria and its neighbours, Marocco and Tunis, now begins to assume some
                    importance. The number of vessels that entered and left the various ports in
                    1868 was 8740, of an aggregate burden of 1,664,513 tons, and manned by 16,173
                    men. This is an. increase over the previous year of 18∙40 per cent. as regards
                    the number of ships, and of 12∙63 per cent. as regards the tonnage. As engaged
                    in the direct trade with Britain, there entered 99 British vessels with an
                    aggregate of 17,940 tons, and cleared 109 British vessels with an aggregate of
                    12,523 tons. Besides these there were British vessels engaged in the direct or
                    carrying trade with other countries, of which entered 125 with an aggregate
                    burden of 14,972 tons, and cleared 106 with an aggregate of 19,960 tons. The
                    number of British vessels trading at the four principal ports, namely, Algiers,
                    Oran, Bona, and Philippeville in 1872 was as follows:—direct, entered,
                    171—tonnage, 60,285; left, 251—tonnage, 76,973; indirect, entered, 170—tonnage,
                    79,454; left, 125 — tonnage, 63,645. Daring that year 1595 vessels of 3,746,130
                    tons entered, and 1587 vessels of 376,402 tons cleared, at the port of Algiers.
                    The most important articles of export, as far as British trade is concerned, are
                    <hi rend="italic">crin</hi><hi rend="italic">vegetal</hi> and alpha fibre.
                    During the first nine months of 1872 about 6000 tons of the former were exported
                    from the port of Algiers alone; and about 60,000 tons of the latter from the
                    whole colony, chiefly from Oran. Some idea of the rapidly advancing commercial
                    prosperity of Algeria may be gathered from the fact that the amount of sums
                    discounted at the Bank of Algeria (which was established in 1851) had risen from
                    £3,900,130 in 1866-7 to £8,131,535 in 1871-2. Much has been done, particularly
                    of late years, in the way of opening up the country and developing its
                    resources. Roads have been formed and bridges built in various parts, harbours
                    have been improved, and lighthouses erected. There are now 374 miles of railway
                    open for traffic, forming a line from Algiers to Oran and one from Philippeville
                    to Constantine.</p>
                <p>In early times this country was inhabited by two nations, the Massyli and the
                    Massaesyli. During the struggle between Hannibal and the Romans, Syphax, the
                    prince of the Massaesyli, espoused the cause of the former, and Massinissa, the
                    prince of the Massyli, that of the latter. On the defeat of the Carthaginians
                    the territories of Syphax were annexed to those of Masinissa, who received the
                    title of King of Numidia. During the Roman civil war, Juba, king of Numidia,
                    sided with Pompey, and being defeated by Caesar, his kingdom became a Roman
                    province. Under the Romans the country enjoyed a great degree of prosperity.
                    Agriculture was encouraged, commerce extended, roads were formed, and towns
                    sprang up. Christianity, too, was early introduced and flourished. This state of
                    things, however, received a severe check when the Romans were driven out of
                    Africa by the Vandals about the middle of the 5th century. These in turn were
                    expelled by Belisarius, Justinian’s general, in 533. About the middle of the 7th
                    century the Saracens made themselves masters of the country, which came
                    afterwards to be divided into a number of petty states under independent chiefs,
                    and the people sank into a state of barbarism. About the middle of the 11th
                    century Abdallah-ben-Yazim, a learned Arab, formed a numerous sect of
                    religionists, known as Morabites, who overran the country, subdued many of the
                    petty chiefs, and laid the foundation of the dynasty of the Almoravides. That
                    dynasty reigned for nearly a hundred years, and at one time nearly the whole of
                    Barbary and a great part of Spain were under their government. They were
                    succeeded by the dynasty of the Almohades, who reigned over the region till
                    1273, when it was again split up into a number of small states. In 1505,
                    Ferdinand, king of Spain, sent a powerful fleet and army against the country,
                    under the Count of Navarre, who soon made himself master of Oran, Bugia, and
                    other towns, and finally, in 1509, took the town of Algiers. The Spanish rule,
                    however, was very distasteful to the Algerines; and on hearing of the death of
                    Ferdinand, in 1516, one of the native princes sent an embassy to Aruch
                    Barbarossa, the famous Turkish pirate, requesting his aid against the invaders.
                    This was readily granted; and no sooner had he established himself in the
                    country than he murdered the prince and caused himself to be proclaimed king in
                    his room. He introduced that system of piracy for which Algeria was afterwards
                    noted down to 1830. By force and treachery he extended his dominion over other
                    parts of the country, till at length the Spaniards marched a large army against
                    him from Oran, and being joined by many of the natives, defeated him in various
                    engagements, took him prisoner, and beheaded him. His brother Hayradin was then
                    chosen sultan; and he feeling himself unable to cope with the Spaniards, sought
                    the assistance of Turkey, and put himself under the protection of the Grand
                    Seignior. Aid was readily granted, and he himself was appointed pasha or viceroy
                    of Algiers. Having thus got rid of his enemies the Spaniards, he turned his
                    attention to the extension of his piratical enterprises; and in order to do this
                    with the greater security, he fortified the port of Algiers and built a strong
                    mole for the protection of his ships. He is said to have employed 30,000
                    Christian slaves for three years in the construction of the mole. The Algerine
                    pirates soon became dreaded, not <pb break="no"

                    maritime Christian powers, particularly the Spaniards. At length Pope Paul III.
                    induced Charles V. to undertake an expedition to suppress these depredations,
                    and issued a bull offering remission of sins and the crown of martyrdom to all
                    who either fell in battle or were made slaves. The emperor set sail with 120
                    ships and 20 galleys, having on board 30,000 chosen men. They landed in safety,
                    and were proceeding to attack the town of Algiers when a fearful storm arose,
                    and in one night (28th Oct. 1541) destroyed 86 ships and 15 galleys with all
                    their crews and military stores, so that the army on shore was deprived of the
                    means of subsistence. This was then fallen upon by the Algerines, when many were
                    killed and a great number taken prisoners, Charles himself and the remains of
                    his army escaping with difficulty.</p>
                <p>Algiers continued to be governed by viceroys or pashas appointed by the Porte
                    till the beginning of the 17th century, when the janissaries solicited and
                    obtained the right to choose their own dey or governor from among themselves.
                    This subsequently led to frequent altercations between the pashas and the deys,
                    the former seeking to recover their lost power, the latter to reduce it. In
                    1609, the Moors being expelled from Spain, flocked in great numbers to Algiers,
                    and, as many of them were very able sailors, they contributed to raise the power
                    of the Algerine fleet. In 1616 it consisted of forty sail of ships, of between
                    200 and 400 tons, their flagship having 500 tons. The Algerine pirates now
                    became so formidable to the European powers, that in 1617 the French sent
                    against them a fleet of fifty sail, under Beaulieu, who defeated their fleet and
                    took two of their vessels. In 1620 the English sent out a squadron under the
                    command of Sir Robert Mansel on the same errand, but it returned without
                    effecting anything. Their depredations becoming still more frequent and
                    troublesome, the Venetians equipped a fleet of twenty-eight sail, under the
                    command of Admiral Capello, with orders to burn, sink, or take all the Barbary
                    corsairs he should meet. In an engagement which speedily took place he signally
                    defeated them, and took and destroyed sixteen of their galleys. They soon,
                    however, regained their former strength; and at length Louis XIV., provoked by
                    the outrages committed by them on the coasts of Provence and Languedoc, ordered,
                    in 1681, a considerable fleet to be fitted out against them, under the command
                    of Vice-admiral Duquesne. He attacked them near the island of Scios, and
                    destroyed fourteen of their ships. This, however, had little effect upon them,
                    and the following year he bombarded the town of Algiers and nearly reduced it to
                    ashes. The Algerines, by way of reprisal, sent a number of galleys to the coast
                    of Provence, where they committed great ravages. In May 1683, Duquesne with his
                    fleet again cast anchor before Algiers, and proceeded to bombard the town. The
                    dey and the people sued for peace; but Mezo-morto, the Algerine admiral, who was
                    to have been delivered up as one of the hostages, violently opposed coming to
                    terms, stirred up the soldiery against the dey, and caused him to be murdered,
                    and was himself chosen as his successor. The bombardment was renewed, and
                    Mezomorto, reduced to extremities, caused all the French in the city to be
                    cruelly murdered, and the French consul to be tied to the mouth of a mortar and
                    shot off in the direction of the bombarding fleet. Duquesne was so exasperated
                    by this piece of cruelty that he did not leave Algiers till he had utterly
                    destroyed the fortifications, shipping, almost all the lower, and about
                    two-thirds of the upper part of the town. The Algerines, now thoroughly humbled,
                    sent an embassy to France to sue for peace, which was readily granted them. In
                    1686 the English concluded a treaty with the Algerines on favourable terms, and
                    this was several times subsequently renewed; but it was not till the taking of
                    Gibraltar and Port Mahon that England had sufficient check upon them to enforce
                    the observance of treaties. From that time England was treated with greater
                    deference than any other European power. In 1710 the Turkish pasha was expelled
                    and his office united to that of dey. The dey thus became the supreme ruler in
                    the country. He had the charge of the Turkish militia, recruited from
                    Constantinople and Smyrna, because their children by native mothers could not be
                    allowed to enjoy the same privileges as themselves in consequence of former
                    rebellions against the government. Under the dey there was a divan or council of
                    state, chosen from the principal civic functionaries.</p>
                <p>Matters continued very much in the same state, and the history of Algiers
                    presents little calling for special notice down to the expedition of Lord
                    Exmouth. The principal States of Europe had had their attention taken up with
                    weightier matters; but on the establishment of the peace of 1815 the English
                    sent a squadron of ships, under Lord Exmouth, to Algiers, to demand the
                    liberation of all slaves then in bondage there, and the entire discontinuance of
                    piratical depredations. Afraid to refuse, the Algerines returned a conciliatory
                    answer, and released a number of their slaves; but no sooner had the ships left
                    than they redoubled their activity and perpetrated every sort of cruelty against
                    the Christians. Among other acts of cruelty, they attacked and massacred a
                    number of Neapolitan fishermen who were engaged in the pearl-fishery at Bona.
                    The news of this excited great indignation in England, and Lord Exmouth was
                    again despatched with five ships of the line and eight smaller vessels, and at
                    Gibraltar he was joined by a Dutch fleet of six frigates, under Admiral
                    Capellen. They anchored in front of Algiers on the 26th August 1816. Certain
                    terms, which were extremely moderate, were proposed to the dey; but these not
                    meeting with acceptance, a fierce bombardment was at once commenced. At first
                    the assailants were subjected to a heavy fire from the enemy’s batteries; but
                    after a time these were one by one silenced, and ship after ship caught fire,
                    till the destruction of the Algerine naval force was complete. Next day the
                    terms proposed to the dey were accepted; Christian slaves to the number of 1211
                    were set at liberty, and a promise was given that piracy and Christian slavery
                    should cease for ever; The Algerines, however, did not long adhere to the terms
                    of the treaty. They lost no time in putting their city in a more formidable
                    state of defence than before, and this done, they considered themselves in a
                    condition to set the great powers of Europe at defiance.</p>
                <p>Various injuries had from time to time been inflicted on the French shipping, but
                    that which more directly led to a declaration of war was an insult offered to
                    the French consul by the dey. A debt had been contracted by the French
                    government to two Jewish merchants of Algiers at the time of the expedition to
                    Egypt, and the dey having a direct interest in the matter, had made repeated
                    applications for payment, but without success. Annoyed at this and at what he
                    considered insulting language on the part of the consul, he struck the latter on
                    the face in public. In consequence of this, a French squadron was sent to
                    Algiers which took the consul on board, and for three years maintained an
                    ineffective blockade. At length war on a great scale was resolved on, and a
                    fleet was equipped at Toulon in May 1830 under the command of Admiral Duperré.
                    It had also on board a land force, under the command of General Bourmont,
                    consisting of 37,000 infantry, 4000 cavalry, and a proportionate number of
                    artillery. The troops began to land on the 14th June upon the western side of
                    the peninsula of Sidi Ferruch, in the bay of Torre <pb break="no"

                    till the 19th, when a general attack was made upon them by a force of from
                    40,000 to 50,000 men. These, after a fierce conflict, were completely routed.
                    They renewed their attack on the 24th and 25th, but were on both occasions
                    repulsed. The French then advanced upon Algiers, and on the 29th the trenches
                    were opened. On the morning of the 4th of July the bombardment commenced, and
                    before night a treaty was concluded for the entire surrender of Algiers. The
                    next day the French took possession of the town; and 12 ships of war, 1500 brass
                    cannon, and over £2,000,000 sterling came into their hands as conquerors. The
                    Turkish troops were permitted to go wherever they pleased, provided they left
                    Algiers, and most of them were conveyed to Asia Minor. The dey himself, with his
                    private property and a large body of attendants, retired to Naples.</p>
                <p>When the French undertook the expedition against Algiers a pledge was given to
                    the English government that they did not aim at the permanent possession of the
                    country, but only at obtaining satisfaction for the injuries and insults that
                    they had received, and putting down that system of piracy which had so long
                    outraged Europe. The French government engaged that these objects being
                    accomplished, the final settlement and government of the country should be
                    arranged in concert with the other European powers for the general advantage.
                    Notwithstanding this, the French ministry in 1833 publicly declared that it was
                    the intention of their government to retain possession of Algiers and to
                    colonise it. Subsequently, the English government acquiesced in this, on
                    receiving an engagement that the French would not extend their conquests beyond
                    Algeria either on the side of Tunis or of Marocco.</p>
                <p>The capture of Algiers was celebrated in France with great demonstrations of joy.
                    General Bourmont was raised to the rank of marshal, and Admiral Duperré was
                    promoted to the peerage. The revolution of 1830 followed, when Bourmont was
                    deposed, and General Clausel appointed to succeed him. The conquerors, instead
                    of attempting to gain the good-will of the natives, destroyed a number of their
                    mosques, seized upon lands set apart for religious purposes, and attempted to
                    introduce their own laws and usages in place of those of the country, the
                    consequence of which was that the natives entertained the greatest abhorrence
                    for their oppressors, whom they regarded as the enemies of God and their
                    prophet. General Clausel incensed them still more by seizing upon the
                    possessions of the dey, the beys, and the expelled Turks in direct opposition to
                    the conditions on which the capital had been surrendered. Bona was taken
                    possession of, and an incursion was made into the southern province of Titterie,
                    when the troops of the bey were defeated and Mediah taken. The beys of Titterie
                    and Oran were deposed, and tributary rulers set up in their room. Still the war
                    continued. The French were incessantly harassed by irruptions of hordes of the
                    Arabs, so that no Frenchman was safe, even in the vicinity of the town; and
                    little reliance could be placed on the fidelity of the beys who governed the
                    provinces. Mediah was evacuated, and Oran abandoned. In February 1831 General
                    Berthezene was appointed commander-in-chief, and undertook several expeditions
                    into the interior to chastise the hostile tribes, but met with little success.
                    In October Bona was surrounded and taken by the Kabyles. There was now no safety
                    but in the town of Algiers; agriculture was consequently neglected, and it was
                    necessary to send to France for supplies of provisions and for fresh troops. In
                    November 1831 General Savary, Duc de Rovigo, was sent out with an additional
                    force of 16,000 men. The new governor sought to accomplish his ends by the
                    grossest acts of cruelty and treachery. One of his exploits was the massacre of
                    a whole Arab tribe, including old men, women, and children, during night, on
                    account of a robbery committed by some of them. He also treacherously murdered
                    two Arab chiefs whom he had enticed into his power by a written assurance of
                    safety. These proceedings exasperated the natives still further against the
                    French, and those tribes that had hitherto remained quiet took up arms against
                    them.</p>
                <p>About this time Abd-el-Kader first appears upon the field. His father, a
                    Marabout, had collected a few followers, and attacked and taken possession of
                    the town of Oran. On this they wished to elect him as their chief, but he
                    declined the honour on account of his great age; and recommended his son who, he
                    said, was endowed with all the qualities necessary to success. Abd-el-Kader was
                    born about the beginning of 1807, and had early acquired a great reputation
                    among his countrymen for learning and piety, as he was also distinguished among
                    them for skill in horsemanship and other manly exercises. He had made two
                    pilgrimages to Mecca in company with his father, once when a child and again in
                    1828, by which he obtained the title of <hi rend="italic">Hadji.</hi> At this
                    time he was living in obscurity, distinguished by the austerity of his manners,
                    his piety, and his zeal in observing the precepts of the Koran. He collected an
                    army of 10,000 horsemen, and, accompanied by his father, marched to attack Oran,
                    which had been taken possession of by the French. They arrived before the town
                    about the middle of May 1832, but after continuing their attack for three days
                    with great bravery they were repulsed with considerable loss. This was followed
                    by a series of conflicts, more or less severe, between the parties, but without
                    any permanent or decided advantage to either side. In March 1833 the Duc de
                    Rovigo was obliged, on account of his health, to return to France, and General
                    Avizard was appointed interim governor; but the latter dying soon after, General
                    Voirol was nominated his successor. Abd-el-Kader was still extending his
                    influence more and more widely among the Arab tribes; and the French at last
                    considered it to be their interest to offer him terms of peace. A treaty was
                    accordingly concluded with him by General Desmichels, governor of Oran, in
                    February 1834, in which he acknowledged the supremacy of France, and was
                    recognised by them as emir of the province of Mascara. One of the conditions of
                    the treaty was that the emir was to have a monopoly of the trade with the French
                    in corn. This part of the treaty was regarded with great dissatisfaction at
                    home, and the general was removed from his post. In July General Drouet d’Erlon
                    was sent out as governor-general of the colony. An intendant or head of the
                    civil department was also appointed, as well as a commissary of justice at the
                    head of the judicature. Tribunals of justice were also established, by which
                    both French and natives were allowed to enjoy their respective laws. From the
                    tranquil state of the country at this time the new governor was enabled to
                    devote his attention to its improvement. The French, however, soon became
                    jealous of the power of the emir, and on the pretence that he had been
                    encroaching on their territory, General Trezel, who had succeeded Desmichels in
                    the governorship of Oran, was sent against him with a considerable force. The
                    armies met at the river Makta, and the French were routed with great slaughter
                    on the 28th of June 1835. On the news of this defeat Marshal Clausel was sent to
                    Algiers to succeed Count d’Erlon. In order effectually to humble the emir, he
                    set out for his capital, Mascara, accompanied by the Duke of Orleans, at the
                    head of 11,000 men. On reaching the town the French found it deserted, and,
                    having set it on fire, they returned without having effected anything of
                    consequence. In January 1836 Marshal Clausel undertook an expedition against
                    Tlemcen, which he took and garrisoned. Soon <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n605/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0605-0568"/> after this the emir attacked and put to flight a
                    body of 3000 men under Count d’Arlanges on the Tafna. General Bugeaud, who had
                    succeeded Marshal Clause!, attacked the Arabs under Abd-el-Kader on the Sikak
                    river, 6th July 1836, and gained a complete victory over them. An expedition
                    against the bey of Constantine was next resolved on, and Marshal Clausel, at the
                    head of 8000 men, set out from Bona for this purpose in November 1836. They
                    encountered on their march a severe storm of hail and snow, followed by a sharp
                    frost, so that many of them died; and when they arrived before the walls of the
                    town they were unable to undertake the siege, and effected their retreat with
                    difficulty. The French were now anxious to conclude a peace with Abd-el-Kader,
                    and with this view General Bugeaud arranged a meeting with him on the banks of
                    the Tafna, and a treaty was signed, 30th May 1837. They were then free to turn
                    their strength against the bey of Constantine, and an army of 20,000 men set out
                    from Bona with this object under the command of General Damrémont early in
                    October. The town was, after a very gallant defence, taken by storm on the 12th
                    of that month by General Valée, General Damrémont having been killed by a
                    cannon-ball the previous day. On the capture of the city the neighbouring tribes
                    hastened to make their submission to the conquerors, and a strong garrison being
                    left to defend the town, the army returned to Bona. As a reward for his
                    services, General Valée was made a marshal and appointed governor-general of the
                    colony. Disputes with the emir as to the boundaries of his territory were
                    frequent, and at length war was again declared between the parties. The
                    immediate cause of war on this occasion was the marching of an armed force of
                    French troops through the emir’s territory. This the latter looked upon as an
                    infringement of the treaty, and consequently declared war. In October 1839, he
                    suddenly fell upon the French troops in the plain of Metidja, and routed them
                    with great slaughter, destroying and laying waste the European settlements. He
                    surprised and cut to pieces bodies of troops on their march; outposts and
                    encampments were taken by sudden assault; and at length the possessions of the
                    French were reduced to the fortified places which they occupied. On the news of
                    these events reaching France, reinforcements to the amount of 20,000 men were
                    sent out. The spring campaign was vigorously opened on both sides, and numerous
                    skirmishes took place, but without decisive results to either party. The French
                    were, indeed, everywhere successful in the field, but the scattered troops of
                    the enemy would speedily reassemble and sweep the plains, so that there was no
                    safety beyond the camp and the walls of the towns. The fort of Masagran, near
                    Mostaganem, with a garrison of only 123 men, gallantly withstood a fierce attack
                    by 12,000 to 15,000 Arabs, which lasted for three days. Marshal Valée was now
                    recalled, and General Bugeaud appointed to succeed him. The latter arrived at
                    Algiers on the 22d of February 1841, and adopted a new system, which was
                    completely successful. He made use of movable columns radiating from Algiers,
                    Oran, and Constantine, and having from 80,000 to 100,000 troops at his disposal,
                    the result soon told against the emir. Many of the Arab tribes were thus
                    intimidated or brought under subjection, hard pressed garrisons were relieved
                    and victualled, and town after town taken. Tekedemt, the principal stronghold of
                    Abd-el-Kader, was destroyed, and the citadel blown up; Mascara was taken; and
                    Saida, the only remaining fortress in the possession of the emir, was entirely
                    demolished. In January 1842 the town of Tlemcen was taken, and ten days
                    afterwards the fort of Tafna, which was demolished. The terrified Arabs
                    submitted on all sides, and now almost the entire country was subdued. The emir
                    himself, driven to extremities, was compelled to take refuge in Marocco. Here he
                    succeeded in raising a considerable force, and returned to Algeria. He made up
                    for the want of troops by the rapidity of his movements, and would suddenly make
                    an attack on one place when he was supposed to be in quite an opposite quarter.
                    In November 1842 the Duke of Aumale arrived in Algiers to take part in the
                    operations against the emir; and in the spring of the following year he suddenly
                    fell upon the camp of Abd-el-Kader while the great body of his troops were
                    absent, and took several thousand prisoners and a large booty, the emir himself
                    making his escape with difficulty. Not long afterwards the latter again took
                    refuge in Marocco, and so excited the fanatical passions of the people of that
                    country that their ruler was forced into a war with France. The army which was
                    sent into Algeria was attacked and defeated by Bugeaud at the river Isly, 14th
                    August 1844. The emperor of Marocco soon afterwards sued for peace, which was
                    granted him on condition that he should no longer succour or shelter the emir,
                    but aid in pursuing him. Abd-el-Kader was now reduced to great extremities, and
                    obliged to take refuge in the mountain fastnesses, whence he would from time to
                    time come down to annoy the French. In June 1845 a tribe of Arabs, who were
                    being pursued by a body of French troops under General Pelissier, took refuge in
                    a cave. As they refused to surrender, the general ordered a fire to be kindled
                    at the mouth of the cave, and the whole of those within, men, women, and
                    children, to the number of 500, were suffocated. The emir at length was brought
                    to such straits that he agreed to deliver himself up to the French on being
                    allowed to retire to Alexandria or St Jean d’Acre. Notwithstanding this promise,
                    which was given by General Lamoricière, and ratified by the governor-general, he
                    was taken to France, where he arrived on the 29th of January 1848; and was
                    imprisoned first in the castle of Pau, and afterwards in that of Amboise, near
                    Blois. In October 1852 Louis Napoleon, then president of the French Republic,
                    gave him his liberty on condition that he should not return to Algeria, but
                    reside at Brousso in Asia Minor. Here he remained till 1855 when, in consequence
                    of the destruction of that town by an earthquake, he obtained permission to
                    remove to Constantinople, and afterwards to Damascus. At the latter place he
                    rendered valuable aid to the Christians by protecting them during the massacre
                    by the Turks in Syria in 1860.</p>
                <p>On the revolution in France of 1848, General Cavaignac was appointed
                    governor-general of the colony; and the National Assembly, wishing to establish
                    a closer connection between the country and France, offered to incorporate it
                    with the republic. This proposal, however, met with considerable opposition, and
                    Algeria was simply declared a permanent possession, with the right to send four
                    deputies to the National Assembly, to be heard on all matters affecting the
                    interests of the colony. Colonists were also sent out to settle there, and other
                    means taken to further its prosperity. Still the republic did not seem to be
                    more successful in the administration of affairs than the monarchy had been. The
                    colonists died off or left in disgust, the natives were not more reconciled to
                    the French yoke, and many of them rose in open rebellion. The Kabyles, in
                    particular, the most intelligent and industrious of the native population,
                    manifested the greatest repugnance to the imposition of taxes and of the usages
                    of civilisation. In 1849 General Pelissier marched against several of the
                    rebellious tribes, and reduced them to subjection. Generals Canrobert and
                    Herbillon were sent into the district of Zaab to quell an insurrection excited
                    by the Marabout Bon-Zian. The latter was driven to take refuge in Zaatcha, which
                    resisted the utmost efforts of the French to take it for fifty-one days, but at
                    last it was carried by storm. In 1850 there <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n606/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0606-0569"/> were several expeditions sent out against the
                    natives, and in 1851 General St Arnaud succeeded in reducing to subjection
                    Little Kabylia. In 1852 General M'Mahon set out against Eastern Kabylia, and
                    Pelissier, in the south, took Laghouat by storm. The next few years present us
                    with several expeditions against the Kabyles, but these were not productive of
                    very marked results. In 1854 there was an expedition against certain Arab tribes
                    in the south, who were reduced to subjection. In 1856 a great expedition, under
                    the command of General Randon, was organised against the tribes of Great Kabylia
                    that had not yet submitted to the French; and after many months’ fighting they
                    were brought under subjection. The authority of France was now undisputed over
                    the country, and peace for a time was established.</p>
                <p>In 1858 the administration of the colony was confided to a special minister, the
                    first nominated being Prince Napoleon; but he only held office for a short time;
                    and soon after, the special ministry was abolished. In October 1859 certain Arab
                    tribes rose in rebellion, but were speedily subdued. In 1860 Marshal Pelissier
                    was made governorgeneral, with a vice-governor, a director-general of civil
                    affairs, and a council of thirty members. In the beginning of 1863 the emperor
                    promised to Algeria a constitution, with a representative assembly for
                    provincial matters; and said that it was not a colony properly so called, but an
                    Arab kingdom, and that the natives had an equal right to his protection with the
                    colonists. In April 1864 a formidable insurrection of the Arabs broke out in the
                    south, in consequence of an insult offered to one of their chiefs in a court of
                    justice, and they suddenly fell upon and cut to pieces a detachment of French
                    troops. A large force was speedily assembled and sent against them, and after
                    they had been beaten in several encounters the insurrection was at length put
                    down. Marshal Pelissier died in May, and Marshal M‘Mahon was appointed to
                    succeed him. A fresh insurrection of the Arabs broke out in October, but after
                    several defeats they were brought to subjection. In May 1865 the Emperor
                    Napoleon visited Algeria, and was everywhere received with the greatest
                    demonstrations of joy. After his return to France he wrote a letter to Marshal
                    M‘Mahon respecting the future government of the colony. He particularly pointed
                    out the necessity of seeking to gain the good-will of the natives by permitting
                    them to enjoy their territories unmolested, and to maintain their own customs,
                    and that they should be held as equal with the colonists before the law. He
                    further directed him to seek to stimulate the industry of the colonists, and to
                    strive to develop the resources of the country. In October a fresh insurrection
                    broke out in the province of Oran. It commenced with an attack upon a friendly
                    tribe, but was at length put down by a body of troops under the command of
                    Colonel de Colomb. It again broke out in March 1866, and Colonel de Colomb was a
                    second time sent out against the insurgents. He encountered them on the 16th,
                    and, after a fierce engagement, put them to flight with great loss. In the
                    beginning of 1867 a new expedition was organised against the refractory Arabs in
                    the south, and these being effectually put down, a period of comparative peace
                    followed. The crops in 1866 were almost entirely destroyed by an invasion of
                    locusts, and in January 1867 a violent earthquake destroyed several villages in
                    the vicinity of Blidah. A prolonged drought followed, which dried up the sources
                    of the springs and produced a famine, from which the natives suffered much. A
                    visitation of cholera succeeded, which is estimated to have carried off not less
                    than 50,000 persons. In January 1868 a fresh revolt broke out among the Arabs,
                    instigated by Si-Hamed, who had led on more than one of the previous revolts.
                    They assailed and plundered some of the friendly tribes, and being pursued and
                    attacked by a body of French troops, a fierce engagement took place, in which
                    Si-Hamed was killed and his followers put to flight. Peace was enjoyed for the
                    rest of that year; but towards the end of January 1869 several large bands of
                    insurgent Arabs in the extreme south marched northward, took by surprise
                    Tagguin, and being joined by others, in a short time they numbered 3000 horse. A
                    body of French troops was sent out against them from Laghouat, under the command
                    of Colonel Sonis, and after two and a half hours’ hard fighting the insurgents
                    were put to flight with great slaughter. In 1871 a widespread insurrection of
                    Arab and Kabyle tribes broke out, stimulated no doubt by a knowledge of the
                    weakened condition of France at home. It commenced with El-Mokrani, the
                    hereditary bach-agha of the Medjana, attacking and burning the village of
                    Brody-Bon-Arreredy, destroying isolated houses and posts throughout the district
                    subject to his influence, the colonists who did not succeed in reaching a place
                    of safety being massacred. All his attacks against the fortified places,
                    however, failed; and as soon as the French were able to assume the offensive he
                    was beaten in every engagement, and subsequently killed in action. When this
                    rebellion appeared almost overcome, the whole of Kabylia rose in arms at the
                    command of the sheikh El-Haddad, one of the most powerful chiefs in Kabylia, and
                    head of an influential religious confraternity. The Kabyles, for the first time
                    in history, descended from their mountain fastnesses, and attempted to invade
                    the plains of the Metidja. The most horrible massacres were perpetrated, and all
                    the principal ports on the coast were strictly blockaded on the landward side.
                    It was not till after the fall of the commune in Paris that troops could be
                    spared in sufficient numbers to suppress the insurrection. But this was at
                    length effected, and a war contribution of £1,200,000 imposed upon the rebels,
                    whose lands were also sequestrated, but the owners were permitted to resume
                    possession on comparatively easy terms. The greater part of the sum recovered
                    was distributed among the colonists who had suffered during the insurrection,
                    and a considerable portion of it has been allotted for public works. The
                    sequestration has also opened up much valuable territory for European
                    colonisation. Since the insurrection many new colonists have arrived here, and
                    among them many from Alsace and Lorraine. A law passed by the French Chamber,
                    15th September 1871, authorises, on certain conditions, the gratuitous
                    concession of 247,000 acres of land to such natives of Alsace and Lorraine as
                    might desire to preserve their French nationality. A more favourable era, it is
                    believed, has now dawned for the colony. Down to 1871 it had continued under
                    military rule, and this, it was thought, had had not a little to do with the
                    frequent insurrections that had broken out in the country. Accordingly, in
                    October of that year, a civil government was established, as has been already
                    noticed, and since that time the colony has continued in a more peaceable and
                    flourishing condition. <hi rend="smallcaps">(d. k.)</hi></p>
