                    Cornelius Jansen, and engraved by Payne; and to have been pronounced by Fuller
                    “a most rare poet as any our age or nation hath produced;” and to have drawn
                    from Samuel Johnson unequivocal eulogium, may be regarded as entitling to a
                    claim on our interest at this later day, Dr William Alabaster unites in himself
                    all these memorable tributes. Alabaster was his own spelling, as it was Bedell’s
                    and Fuller’s; but it is found contemporaneously “Arblastier.” The name is
                    derived from <hi rend="italic">arcubalista</hi> (in arms of the family, a
                    cross-bow bent in pale), and the same probably as Arblastier. He was born at
                    Hadleigh, Suffolk, about 1567, was educated at Westminster School, and went
                    thence to Trinity College, Cambridge. He was also incorporated at Oxford in
                    1592. He became fellow of Trinity. Having been appointed chaplain to Robert,
                    Earl of Essex, he attended him in that expedition, designed to aid Henry IV.
                    against the League in 1591, celebrated by Dr Donne in “The Storm” and “The
                    Calm.” While in France (in his twenty-fourth year), he was converted to Roman
                    Catholicism, and a quaint English sonnet, “Of his Conversion,” survives, wherein
                    he defies the “frowne and scorne and purblind pittie” of the world, as having a
                    vision of perdition if he yielded thereto. He did not long remain a Roman
                    Catholic. In the preface to his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Ecce</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sponsus Venit</hi> (1633), he relates that certain doctrines of
                    his having become obnoxious to the court of Rome, he was enticed to that city
                    and imprisoned there by authority of the Inquisition; and that on his liberation
                    he was confined within the city walls, but escaped at the peril of his life, and
                    returned to England. On his return he became prebendary of St Paul’s and rector
                    of Hatfield. Dr Alabaster was famous as a Hebraist; but his studies of Hebrew
                    took a twist in the direction of the cabalistic learning, by which he luxuriated
                    in discussions on the mystical meanings imagined to be hidden in the words of
                    the Old Testament. The investigation and application of this supposed mystical
                    meaning of Scripture was the main object of his <hi rend="italic">Apparatus
                    in</hi><hi rend="italic">Revelationem</hi><hi rend="italic">Jesu Christi</hi>
                    (Antwerp, 1607); and, indeed, it runs through all his critical writings, as in
                    his singular <hi rend="italic">Spiraculum</hi><hi rend="italic">Tubarum,
                    sive</hi><hi rend="italic">Fons Spiritualium Expositionem</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ex equivocis Penta-glotti</hi><hi rend="italic">Significationibus</hi> (n.d.,
                    folio), his <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Pentaglotton</hi> (1637, folio), and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Commentarius</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Bestia</hi><hi rend="italic">Apoca∙ lyptica</hi> (1621). It was of these books
                    Herrick wrote as making Alabaster “the one, one onely glory of a million.” A MS.
                    of Alabaster’s <hi rend="italic">Elisaeis</hi> is among Emanuel College MSS.; a
                    better one, with additional poems, entitled “Inuenta Bellica” — recalling
                    Herbert’s “Triumphus Mortis,” so headed—and “Inuenta Adespota,” is in the
                    Chetham Library, Manchester. The poem is unfinished, but has lines in it which
                    account for Spenser’s lofty praise and hopes. It has never been printed. His
                    best known verse is a Latin tragedy called <hi rend="italic">Roxana.</hi> This
                    is praised by Fuller, stirred Anthony à Wood into enthusiasm, and is regarded by
                    Dr Johnson as the only Latin verse in England worthy to be named previous to
                    Milton. It was prepared for his college (Trinity), and never meant for
                    publication. Having been surreptitiously published in 1632, the author thereupon
                    reprinted it, with this on the title-page, “A plagiariis unguibus vindicata,
                    aucta et agnita.” It is a curious composition. The subject is an oriental tale
                    which had previously been dramatised in the <hi rend="italic">Dalida</hi> of
                    Groto, an Italian. The scenes consist of conversations between real and
                    allegorical personages. The first act is entirely carried on between the ghost
                    of one of the characters and personifications of Death and Suspicion. Hallam
                    charges Alabaster with plagiarism from <hi rend="italic">Dalida,</hi> but he
                    cannot have really read the two. Alabaster died about 1640. <hi rend="smallcaps"
