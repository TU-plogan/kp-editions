                    his twelfth year he was almost constantly engaged in military expeditions,
                    chiefly against the crusaders. In 1285 he was present at the assault of a
                    stronghold of the Knights of St John, aud he took part in the sieges of Tripoli,
                    Acre, and Roum. In 1298 the princedom of Hamah and other honours, originally
                    conferred by Saladin upon Omar, passed by inheritance to Abulfeda; but the
                    succession was violently disputed by his two brothers, and the Court availed
                    itself of the opportunity to supersede all the three, and to abolish the
                    principality. The sultan Melik-el-Nassir ultimately (1310) restored the dignity
                    to Abulfeda, with additional honours, as an acknowledgment of his military
                    services against the Tartars and Bibars, the sultan’s rival. He received an
                    independent sovereignty, with the right of coining money, Ac., and had the title
                    Melik Mowayyad <hi rend="italic">(victorious prince)</hi> conferred upon him.
                    For twenty years, till his death in October 1331, he reigned in tranquillity and
                    splendour, devoting himself to the duties of government and to the composition
                    of the works to which he is chiefly indebted for his fame. He was a munificent
                    patron <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n76/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0076-0061"/> of men of letters, who repaired in large numbers
                    to his court. Abulfeda’s chief historical work is <hi rend="italic">An
                    Abridgement of the History of the Human Race,</hi> in the form of annals,
                    extending from the creation of the world to the year 1328. A great part of it is
                    compiled from the works of previous writers, and it is difficult to determine
                    accurately what is the author’s and what is not. Up to the time of the birth of
                    Mohammed, the narrative is very succinct; it becomes more full and valuable the
                    nearer the historian approaches his own day. It is the only source of
                    information on many facts connected with the Saracen empire, and altogether is
                    by far the most important Arabian history we now possess. Various translations
                    of parts of it exist, the earliest being a Latin rendering of the section
                    relating to the Arabian conquests in Sicily, by Dobelius, Arabic professor at
                    Palermo, in 1610. This is preserved in Muratori’» <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rerum</hi><hi rend="italic">Italicarum Scriptores,</hi> vol. i. The history
                    from the time of Mohammed was published with a Latin translation by Reiske,
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">Mos-lemici
                    (</hi> 5 vols., Copenhagen, 1789-94), and a similar edition of the earlier part
                    was published by Fleischer at Leipsic in 1831, under the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abulfedoe</hi><hi rend="italic">Historia Ante.- Islamitica.</hi> His <hi
                    rend="italic">Geography</hi> is chiefly valuable in the historical and
                    descriptive parts relating to the Moslem empire. From his necessarily imperfect
                    acquaintance with astronomy, his notation of latitude and longitude, though
                    fuller than that of any geographer who preceded him, can in no case be depended
                    on, and many of the places whose position he gives with the utmost apparent
                    precision cannot be now identified. A complete edition was published by MM.
                    Reinaud and De Slane at Paris in 1840; and Reinaud published a French
                    translation, with notes and illustrations, in 1848. MSS. of both Abulfeda’s
                    great works are preserved in the Bodleian Library and in the National Library of
                    France.</p>
