                <p><label type="entry">AGASSIZ</label>, Louis <hi rend="smallcaps">John
                    Rudolph,</hi> was the son of a Swiss Protestant clergyman. His father was the
                    pastor of the parish of Motiers, a small town situated near the northeastern
                    angle of the Little Murtensee, and not far from the eastern extremity of the
                    Lake of Neuchatel. Agassiz was born at this retired place on May 28, 1807.
                    Educated first at home, then spending four years at the gymnasium of Bienne, he
                    completed his elementary studies at the academy of Lausanne. Whilst at this
                    latter place he already became conspicuous amongst his fellow-students, not only
                    for his love of the natural sciences, but for the manifest talent he displayed
                    in pursuing them. The close alliance between these subjects and the science of
                    medicine led him to adopt the latter as his profession, for which he studied
                    successively at the universities of Zurich, Heidelberg, and Munich; at the same
                    time availing himself of the advantages afforded <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n296/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0296-0275"/> by these universities for extending his knowledge
                    of natural history, especially of botany. Having completed his academical
                    course, he took his degree of doctor of medicine at Munich.</p>
                <p>Up to this time he had no particular inclination for the study of ichthyology,
                    which soon afterwards became the great occupation of his life. Agassiz always
                    declared that he was led into ichthyological pursuits through the following
                    circumstances:-—In 1819-20, Spix and Martius were engaged in their celebrated
                    Brazilian tour, and on their return to Europe, amongst other collections of
                    natural objects, they brought home an important one of the freshwater fishes of
                    Brazil, and especially of the Amazon river. Unfortunately Spix did not live long
                    enough to work out the history of these fishes; hence it became necessary that
                    some other naturalist should undertake the task of describing them. It is no
                    insignificant proof of the reputation which Agassiz had already won, that,
                    though little more than a youth just liberated from his academic studies, he was
                    selected for this purpose. His attention being thus directed to the special
                    subject of ichthyology, he at once threw himself into the work with that
                    earnestness of spirit which characterised him to the end of his busy life. Thus,
                    in 1828 we find him, after describing a new species of Cynocephalus, publishing
                    a description of a new cyprinoid fish. This was followed by a yet more elaborate
                    research into the history of the cyprinoid and other fishes found in the lake of
                    Neuchatel. Rapidly enlarging his plans, the publication of the last-named work
                    was succeeded by the issue, in 1830, of a prospectus of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Freshwater Fishes of Central Europe.</hi> It was only in 1839,
                    however, that the first part of this important publication appeared. The task of
                    describing and figuring the Brazilian fishes of Spix and Martius was completed
                    and the work published in 1829.</p>
                <p>Acquiring fresh confidence through these labours, he now contemplated a yet
                    greater task. Having become a professed ichthyologist, it was impossible that
                    the fossil fishes with which the stratified rocks of his native mountains abound
                    should fail to attract his attention. The rich stores furnished by the slates of
                    Glarus and the limestones of Monte Bolca were already well known; but very
                    little had been accomplished in the way of the scientific study of them. Agassiz
                    at once threw himself into this new field of labour with his wonted enthusiasm,
                    and began the publication of the work which, more than any other, made him known
                    to foreign naturalists, and laid the foundation of his worldwide fame. Five
                    volumes of his <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les
                    Poissons</hi><hi rend="italic">Fossiles</hi> appeared at intervals between the
                    years 1833 and 1844. They were magnificently illustrated, chiefly through the
                    labours of Dinkel, an artist of remarkable power in delineating natural
                    objects.</p>
                <p>Agassiz soon found that his palaeontological labours rendered a new basis of
                    ichthyological classification absolutely necessary. The fossils rarely exhibited
                    any traces of the soft tissues of fishes. They chiefly consisted of the teeth,
                    scales, and fins, even the bones being perfectly preserved in but comparatively
                    few instances. Hence the classifications of Cuvier and other naturalists were of
                    little use to him in determining the mutual relations of the fossil forms. He
                    therefore adopted his well-known classification, which divided fishes into four
                    groups—viz., Ganoids, Placoids, Cycloids, and Ctenoids. The first of these
                    groups was chiefly represented amongst living fishes by the Lepidosteus or bony
                    pike of the great American rivers; by the Polypterus or Bischir of the Nile; and
                    by the sturgeon. The last fish has a wide geographical range; but the other two,
                    which best display the characters on which Agassiz based his Ganoid class, are
                    limited to the fresh-water rivers of local geographical areas. But in the
                    Palaeozoic and Mesozoic ages it was strikingly otherwise.</p>
                <p>The Ganoids were the most remarkable as well as the most widely diffused of
                    primeval fishes; we find them equally in the fresh-water deposits of the weald,
                    in the marine deposits of the oolites, the chalk, and the magnesian limestone,
                    and in the more mixed and dubious deposits of tho coal measures. Agassiz,
                    therefore, was fully justified in attaching very great importance to this
                    hitherto unrecognised class. Indeed, later ichthyologists— <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> J. Müller and Professor Owen—have found it necessary to retain the
                    class in their recent classifications, though in a modified form. The remaining
                    portions of Agassiz’ system have not been adopted by them; but though they do
                    not accept the terms Placoids, Cycloids, and Ctenoids as representing classes,
                    all zoologists employ them as new and convenient adjectives, of the utmost value
                    to students of systematic ichthyology. One reason for the rejection of Agassiz’
                    system by modern ichthyologists is the obvious one that he draws the
                    characteristics of his classes from a single organ—the skin—and that not the
                    most important. At the same time, it must be admitted that the Placoids, like
                    the Ganoids, also constituted a natural group closely corresponding with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pisces</hi><hi rend="italic">cartilaginei</hi> of Cuvier and
                    others. The distinction between Cycloids and Ctenoids was a much more trivial
                    one, and needlessly separated closely-allied forms. It is only those who are
                    familiar with the magnitude and difficulties of the task thus undertaken that
                    can appreciate the daring courage of the youth who grappled with it. Under
                    twenty-five years of age, and, as already observed, with limited financial
                    resources, he nevertheless seems to have known no fear. He soon announced to
                    geologists several important generalisations, the correctness of which has been
                    confirmed by all subsequent research. In particular, he pointed out that no
                    examples of Cycloids and Ctenoids, comprehending the bulk of the fishes now seen
                    in our markets, were to be found in rocks of older date than the cretaceous
                    age.</p>
                <p>As the work proceeded it became obvious that it would over-tax the resources of
                    the intrepid young zoologist, unless some additional assistance could be
                    afforded to him. The British Association for the Advancement of Science wisely
                    came to his aid, and the late Earl of Ellesmere— better known in his youth as
                    Lord Francis Egerton—gave him yet more efficient help. The original drawings
                    made for the work, chiefly by Dinkel, amounted to 1290 in number. These were
                    purchased by the earl; but, with princely liberality, he left all that were
                    necessary for the further prosecution of his labours in the hands of
                    Agassiz.</p>
                <p>It was whilst he was thus engaged that Agassiz paid his first visit to England,
                    for the purpose of studying the rich stores of fossil fishes with which this
                    country abounds. He was then in his youthful prime—a model of manly vigour and
                    scientific enthusiasm; but amongst his many qualities none were more remarkable
                    than the quickness with which he detected the peculiarities of any new fossil,
                    and the retentiveness of his memory, which enabled him to make ready use of his
                    newly-acquired knowledge. The consciousness that he possessed these powers led
                    him occasionally—though, it must be allowed, but rarely—to trust unduly to them,
                    and made him sometimes hasty and offhand in his conclusions.</p>
                <p>But fossil ichthyology, though a very large subject, was insufficient to occupy
                    his energetic mind. In 1837 we find him issuing the “Prodrome” of a monograph on
                    the recent and fossil Echinodermata, the first part of which appeared in 1838;
                    and in 1839-40 he published, in addition, two quarto volumes on the fossil
                    Echinoderms of Switzerland. This division of the invertebrate animals was
                    evidently a favourite one with him, since we find it the subject of numerous
                    memoirs which appeared from time to time during his later life.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n297/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0297-0276"/>
                <p>It was by these great undertakings that he chiefly won his distinguished position
                    as one of the greatest leaders in scientific research; but his observant
                    faculties were by no means concentrated upon them exclusively. His intellectual
                    <hi rend="italic">tentacula</hi> expanded in every direction. The history of the
                    Belemnites, the muscular system of recent and fossil shells, the principles of
                    classification of the animal kingdom, the embryology of the salmon, and critical
                    studies of special genera of fossil Mollusca—all engaged his attention. During
                    his travels in England in 1834 he was ever on the alert for new specimens for
                    the museum at Neuchatel. One characteristic incident of this kind may be
                    referred to here. A fine porpoise had been caught by the Scarborough fishermen.
                    Agassiz was weary with travel, and had but a few hours to remain in the town,
                    but the chance could not be allowed to escape; the creature was purchased, and
                    midnight saw Agassiz and the writer of this sketch working by the dim light of
                    two tallow candles dissecting the animal, and shipping off its half-cleaned
                    bones to Neuchatel, before he ventured to take the much-needed rest.</p>
                <p>Subsequently to his first visit to England the labours of Hugh Miller, Dr
                    Malcolmson, and other geologists brought to light the marvellous ichthyal fauna
                    of the Devonian beds of the north-east of Scotland. Murchison and Sedgwick had
                    some time previously directed attention to the existence of fishes of this
                    geological age, especially amongst the bituminous shales of Caithness; but the
                    more recent discoveries were of far greater interest than the earlier ones,
                    because of the strange forms of the Pterich-thys, the Coccosteus, and other
                    species then made known to geologists for the first time. The supposition of
                    Hugh Miller, that some of these fishes had vertical instead of horizontal
                    mouths, suggestive of a transition from the crustacean to the ichthyal type,
                    added fresh interest to the subject in the eyes of a philosophic inquirer like
                    Agassiz. These fossils were reported upon by him more than once, and were
                    finally made the subjects of a special monograph, which was published in 1844.
                    Miller’s interpretation of the structure of the mouth Agassiz soon demonstrated
                    to be erroneous.</p>
                <p>The year 1840 witnessed the inauguration of a new movement, which has proved to
                    be of the utmost importance to geological science. Previously to this date De
                    Saussure, Venetz, Charpentier, and others had made the glaciers of the Alps the
                    subjects of special study, and Charpentier had even arrived at the important
                    conclusion that the well-known erratic blocks of alpine rocks scattered so
                    abundantly over the slopes and summits of the Jura mountains, had been conveyed
                    thither by glaciers. The question having attracted the attention of Agassiz, he
                    at once grappled with it in his wontedly enthusiastic manner. He not only made
                    successive journeys to the alpine glaciers in company with Charpentier, but he
                    had a rude hut constructed upon one of the Aar glaciers, which for a time he
                    made his comfortless home, in order that he might the more thoroughly
                    investigate the structure and movements of the ice. These labours resulted in
                    the publication of his magnificent illustrated folio entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Etudes</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Glaciers.</hi> In this important work the movements of the
                    glaciers, their moraines, their influence in grooving and rounding off the rocks
                    over which they travelled, producing the striations and <hi rend="italic">roches
                    moutonnés</hi> with which we are now so familiar, were treated with a
                    comprehensiveness which threw into the shade all the writings of previous
                    labourers in this field. He not only accepted Charpentier’s idea that some of
                    the alpine glaciers had extended across the wide plains and valleys drained by
                    the Aar and the Rhone, and thus landed parts of their remains upon the uplands
                    of the Jura, but he went still further in the same direction. He concluded that,
                    at a period geologically recent, Switzerland had been another Greenland; that
                    instead of a few glaciers stretching their restricted lines across the areas
                    referred to, one vast sheet of ice, originating in the higher Alps, had extended
                    over the entire valley of north-western Switzerland until it reached the
                    southern slopes of the Jura, which, though they checked and deflected its
                    further extension, did not prevent the ice from reaching in many places the
                    summit of the range. At a later period we shall find him holding a similar view
                    in the case of the vast plains spread out between the Andes and the eastern
                    coast of South America. The publication of this work gave a fresh impetus to the
                    study of glacial phenomena in all parts of the world. In 1841 Agassiz spent many
                    weeks in his hut on the Lower Aar glacier, where he received as his guest the
                    late Professor James Forbes, who was also engaged upon the study of glacial
                    phenomena. The latter philosopher, in his work on <hi rend="italic">Norway and
                    its Glaciers,</hi> recognised in the fullest manner his indebtedness to Agassiz
                    for much new light respecting the details of glacial action.</p>
                <p>Thus familiarised with the phenomena attendant on the movements of recent
                    glaciers, Agassiz was prepared for a new and most unexpected discovery which he
                    made in 1846, in conjunction with the late Professor Buckland. These two <hi
                    rend="italic">savants</hi> visited the mountains of Scotland together, and found
                    in six different localities clear evidence of some ancient glacial action. The
                    discovery was announced to the Geological Society of London in a joint
                    communication from the two distinguished observers. Similar discoveries were
                    subsequently made by Buckland, Lyell, Ramsay, and others in various parts of
                    Scotland, Westmoreland, Cumberland, and North Wales. The former existence of
                    glaciers in each of these mountainous districts is a fact that no one now
                    presumes to doubt any more than that these glaciers, either directly, or
                    indirectly in the shape of icebergs, have at least contributed largely to the
                    accumulation of those wide-spread deposits with which geologists are familiar
                    under the name of drift and boulder formations.</p>
                <p>But we must now follow Agassiz to a new sphere of labour. In 1838 he was
                    appointed to the professorship of natural history at Neuchatel, with a very
                    limited income. In the autumn of 1846 he crossed the Atlantic, with the two-fold
                    design of investigating the natural history and geology of the United States,
                    and delivering a course of lectures on zoology at the Lowell Institute; and the
                    tempting advantages, pecuniary and scientific, presented to him in the New
                    World, induced him to settle in the United States, where he remained to the end
                    of his life. He was appointed professor of zoology and geology in the university
                    of Cambridge, U.S., in 1847. He left that post in 1851 for a medical
                    professorship of comparative anatomy at Charlestown, but returned in 1853 to
                    Cambridge.</p>
                <p>This transfer to a new field, and the association with fresh objects of high
                    interest to him, gave his energies a new stimulus. Volume after volume now
                    proceeded from his pen: some of his writings were popular, and addressed to the
                    multitude, but most of them dealt with tho higher departments of scientific
                    research. His work on Lake Superior, and his four volumes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Contributions to the Natural History of the United States,</hi> were of this
                    latter character. But whilst thus working earnestly at American zoology, he
                    still kept in view more generalised inquiries, the fruits of which appeared in
                    1854, with the title of <hi rend="italic">Zoologie Générale</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Esquisses Générales de Zoologie contenant

                    vivants et détruits.</hi> Before leaving these literary labours, we must not
                    overlook the valuable service he rendered to science by the formation, for his
                    own use, of a catalogue of scientific memoirs—an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n298/mode/1up"

                    already so full. This catalogue, edited and materially enlarged by the late Hugh
                    Strickland, was published by the Ray Society under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliographia</hi><hi rend="italic">Zoologiae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Geologi</hi><hi rend="italic">ae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi> Nor must we forget that he was building up another
                    magnificent monument of his industry in the Museum of Natural History, which
                    rose under his fostering care, at Cambridge. But at length the great strain on
                    his physical powers began to tell. He then sought to restore his waning health
                    by a southern voyage. His early labours among the fishes of Brazil had often
                    caused him to cast a longing glance towards that country; and he now resolved to
                    combine the pursuit of health with the gratification of his long-cherished
                    desires. In April 1865 he started for Brazil, along with his admirable wife and
                    an excellent class of assistants. Even on shipboard he could not be idle. In his
                    outward voyage he delivered a course of lectures, open to all his
                    fellow-passengers, but especially addressed to his assistants, and intended to
                    instruct them in the nature and bearings of the great problems upon which they
                    might hope to throw light during their stay in Brazil. An interesting account of
                    this journey, to the success of which the emperor of Brazil contributed in every
                    possible way, was published by Mrs Agassiz when they returned home, laden with
                    the natural treasures of the Brazilian rivers.</p>
                <p>In 1871 he made a second excursion, visiting the southern shores of the North
                    American continent, both on its Atlantic and its Pacific seaboards. He had for
                    many years yearned after the establishment of some permanent school where
                    zoological science could be studied, not in class-rooms or museums of dead
                    specimens, but amidst the living haunts of the subjects of study. Like all truly
                    great teachers, he had little faith in any school but that of nature. The last,
                    and possibly the most permanently influential, of the labours of his long and
                    successful life was the establishment of such an institution, which he was
                    enabled to effect through the liberality of Mr John Anderson, a citizen of New
                    York. That gentleman not only handed over to Agassiz the island of Penikese, on
                    the east coast, but also presented him with $50,000 wherewith permanently to
                    endow it as a practical school of natural science, especially devoted to the
                    study of marine zoology. Another American friend gave him a fine yacht, of 80
                    tons burden, to be employed in marine dredging in the surrounding seas. Had
                    Agassiz lived long enough to bring all this machinery into working order, it is
                    difficult to exaggerate the practical advantages which American science would
                    have reaped from it when guided by such experienced hands. But it was otherwise
                    ordained. The disease with which he had straggled for some years proved fatal on
                    Dec. 14, 1873.</p>
                <p>A letter to his old friend, Sir Philip M. de Grey Egerton, Bart., written but a
                    few days before his death, and doubtless one of the last that he penned, showed
                    that his spirit was still as indomitable and his designs as large as ever; and
                    one of his latest expressed wishes was that he might be spared for four more
                    years in order that the work he had contemplated might be completed.</p>
                <p>Our available space will not allow us to give a detailed sketch of the opinions
                    of this remarkable man on even the more important of the great subjects which he
                    studied so long. From first to last he steadily rejected the doctrine of
                    evolution, and affirmed his belief in independent creations. In like manner he
                    retained his confidence in the former existence and agency of vast continental
                    ice-sheets, rather than in the combined action of more limited glaciers and
                    icebergs, which nearly all modern geologists recognise as the producers of the
                    drifts and boulder-clays. When studying the superficial deposits of the
                    Brazilian plains in 1865, his vivid imagination covered even that wide tropical
                    area, as it had covered Switzerland before, with one vast glacier, extending
                    from the Andes to the sea. His daring conceptions were only equalled by the
                    unwearied industry and genuine enthusiasm with which he worked them out; and if
                    in details his labours were somewhat defective, it was only because he had the
                    courage to attempt what was too much for any one man to accomplish. (W. C.
