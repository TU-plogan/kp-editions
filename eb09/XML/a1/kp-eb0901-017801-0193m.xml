                    same Latin source is so used in most of the countries of Europe where the civil
                    law is in force. The <hi rend="italic">advocatus</hi> of the Romans meant, as
                    the word implies, a person whose assistance was called in or invoked. The word
                    is not often used among the earlier jurists, and appears not to have had a
                    strict meaning. It is not always associated with legal proceedings, and might
                    apparently be applied to a supporter or coadjutor in the pursuit of any desired
                    object. When it came to be applied with a more specific limitation to legal
                    services, the position of the <hi rend="italic">advocatus</hi> was still
                    uncertain. It was different from, and evidently inferior to, that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">juris-consultus,</hi> who gave his opinion and advice in questions
                    of law, and may be identified with the consulting counsel of the present day.
                    Nor is the merely professional advocate to be confounded with the more
                    distinguished <hi rend="italic">orator,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">patronus,</hi>
                    who came forward in the guise of the disinterested vindicator of justice. This
                    distinction, however, appears to have arisen in later times, when the profession
                    became mercenary. By the <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cincia,</hi> passed about two centuries before Christ, and subsequently
                    renewed, the acceptance of remuneration for professional assistance in lawsuits
                    was prohibited. This law, like all others of the kind, was evaded. The skilful
                    debater was propitiated with a present; and though he could not sue for the
                    value of his services, it was ruled that any <hi rend="italic">honorarium</hi>
                    so given could not be demanded back, even though he died before the anticipated
                    service was performed. The traces of this evasion of a law may be found in the
                    existing practice of rewarding counsel by fees in anticipation of services. In
                    the Justinian collection we find that legal provision had been made for the
                    remuneration of advocates. (<hi rend="italic">Dig.</hi> lib. 50, tit. 12, §
                    10-13; Brissonius, <hi rend="italic">De Sig. Verb.;</hi> Heineccius <hi
                    rend="italic">ad Pand.</hi> lib. iii. tit. 1.) The <hi rend="italic">advocatus
                    fisci,</hi> or fiscal advocate, was an officer whose function, like that of a
                    solicitor of taxes at the present day, was connected with the collection of the
                    revenue. (See generally on this subject Forsyth’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hortensius,</hi> London, 1849.) The term advocate is of frequent use in the
                    chronicles, capitularies, chartularies, and other records of ecclesiastical
                    matters, during the Middle Ages. (See Du Cange, s.v. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Advocati</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiarum,</hi> who affords a profuse supply
                    of references to authorities.) The term was applied in the primitive church to
                    those who defended the Christians against malignants or persecutors. As the
                    church waxed rich and powerful, its temporal supporters assumed a more important
                    position. The advocate, defender, or patron, was of a temporal rank,
                    corresponding to the power of the ecclesiastical body who sought his advocacy.
                    Princes sought the distinction from Rome; and it was as a relic of the practice
                    of propitiating temporal sovereigns by desiring their protection that Henry
                    VIII. received his title of “Defender of the Faith.” The office of advocate to
                    any of the great religious houses, possessed of vast wealth, was one of dignity
                    and emolument, generally held by some feudal lord of power and influence. This
                    kind of protection, however, was sometimes oppressive. In the authorities quoted
                    by Du Cange we find that, so early as the 12th century, the advocates were
                    accused of rapine and extortion; and by a capitulary of the popedom of Innocent
                    III. they are prohibited from taking and usurping rewards and privileges beyond
                    use and wont. The office at length assumed a fixed character in its powers and
                    emoluments; and it became the practice for the founders of churches and other
                    ecclesiastical endowments to reserve the office of advocate to themselves and
                    their representatives. The term advocate was subsequently superseded by the word
                    patron; but a relic of it still exists in the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >advowson,</hi> and the word <hi rend="italic">advowee,</hi> which is the form
                    in which the Latin <hi rend="italic">advocatus</hi> found its way into the
                    technicalities of English law. Until lately, advocate was the proper designation
                    of legal practitioners in the Probate and Admiralty courts, and still is the
                    name given to those who practise in what remains of ecclesiastical courts. In
                    France, corporations or faculties of avocats were attached to the parliaments
                    and other tribunals. They formed, before the revolution, a part of the extensive
                    and powerful body commonly called the nobility of the robe. It was not necessary
                    that the avocat should be born noble, and his professional rank was little
                    respected by the hereditary aristocracy; but as a middle rank, possessed of
                    great powers and privileges, which it jealously guarded, the profession acquired
                    great influence. In the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Methodique,</hi> the avocat is called “the tutelary genius of the repose of
                    families, the friend of man, his guide and protector.” The avocats, as a body,
                    were reorganised under the empire by a decree of 15th December 1810. (See Camus,
                    <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">sur l</hi><hi rend="italic">a

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0194-0179"/> France there is a distinction between <hi
                    rend="italic">avocats</hi> and <hi rend="italic">avoués.</hi> The latter, whose
                    number is limited, act as procurators or agents, representing the parties before
                    the tribunals, draft and prepare for them all formal acts and writings, and
                    prepare their lawsuits for the oral debates. The office of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >avocat,</hi> on the other hand, consists in giving advice as to the law, and
                    conducting the causes of his clients by written and oral pleadings. The number
                    of avocats is not limited; every licentiate of law being entitled to apply to
                    the corporation of avocats attached to each court, and after presentation to the
                    court, taking the oath of office, and passing three years in attendance on some
                    older advocate, to have himself recognised as an advocate. The Faculty of
                    Advocates is the collective term by which the members of the bar are known in
                    Scotland. They professionally attend the supreme courts in Edinburgh; but they
                    are privileged to plead in any cause before the inferior courts, where counsel
                    are not excluded by statute. They may act in cases of appeal before the House of
                    Lords; and in some of the British colonies, where the civil law is in force, it
                    is customary for those who practise as barristers to pass as advocates in
                    Scotland. This body has existed by immemorial custom. Its privileges' are
                    constitutional, and are founded on no statute or charter of incorporation. The
                    body formed itself gradually, from time to time, on the model of the French
                    corporations of avocats, appointing like them a dean or doyen, who is their
                    principal officer. No curriculum of study, residence, or professional training
                    was, until 1856, required on entering this profession; but the faculty have
                    always had the power, believed to be liable to control by the Court of Session,
                    of rejecting any candidate for admission. The candidate undergoes two private
                    examinations—the one in general scholarship, in lieu of which, however, he may
                    produce evidence of his having graduated as master of arts in a Scottish
                    university, or obtained an equivalent degree in an English or foreign
                    university; and the other, at the interval of a year, in Roman, private
                    international, and Scots law. He must, before the latter examination, produce
                    evidence of attendance at classes of Scots law and conveyancing in a Scottish
                    university, and at classes of civil law, public or international law,
                    constitutional law, and medical jurisprudence in a Scottish or other approved
                    university. He has then to undergo the old academic form of the public
                    impugnment of a thesis on some title of the pandects; but this ceremony, called
                    the public examination, has degenerated into a mere form. A large proportion of
                    the candidate’s entrance fees (amounting to £339) is devoted to the magnificent
                    library belonging to the faculty, which literary investigators in Edinburgh find
                    so eminently useful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lord Advocate,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">King’s
                    Advocate,</hi> is the principal law-officer of the crown in Scotland. His
                    business is to act as a public prosecutor, and to plead in all causes that
                    concern the crown. He is at the head of the system of public prosecutions by
                    which criminal justice is administered in Scotland, and thus his functions are
                    of a far more extensive character than those of the English law-officers of the
                    crown. He is aided by a solicitor-general and subordinate assistants called
                    advocates-depute. The office of king’s advocate seems to have been established
                    about the beginning of the 16th century. Originally he had no power to prosecute
                    crimes without the concurrence of a private party; but in the year 1597 he was
                    empowered to prosecute crimes at his own instance. He has the privilege of
                    pleading in court with his hat on.</p>
