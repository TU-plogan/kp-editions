                    Valencia, on the W. by Albacete and Murcia, on the S. by Murcia, and on the S.E.
                    and E. by the Mediterranean Sea. It was formed in 1834 of districts taken from
                    the ancient provinces of Valencia and Murcia, the former contributing by far the
                    larger portion. Its length is about 73 miles, its breadth 68 miles, and the area
                    2090 square miles. The surface of the province is extremely diversified. In the
                    north and west there are extensive mountain ranges of calcareous formation,
                    intersected by deep ravines; while farther south the land is more level, and
                    there are many fertile valleys. On the Mediterranean coast, salt marshes,
                    exhaling an insalubrious miasma, alternate with rich plains and pleasant and
                    productive huertas or gardens, such as those of Alicante and Denia. There is no
                    considerable river in the province, but a few rivulets flow east through the
                    valleys into the Mediterranean. The sky is clear, the climate temperate, and the
                    rainfall very slight. Notwithstanding the want of rivers and of rain,
                    agriculture is in a very flourishing condition. The inhabitants possess a spirit
                    of steady industry uncommon in Spain, and by means of wells and canals they have
                    to a large extent succeeded in overcoming the disadvantages of nature. Many
                    tracts originally rocky and sterile have been levelled, and now present terraces
                    covered with the vine and with useful trees. Cereals are grown, but the
                    inhabitants prefer to raise such articles of produce as are in demand for
                    export, and consequently part of the grain supply of the province has to be
                    imported. Esparto grass, rice, the sugar-cane, and tropical fruits and
                    vegetables are largely produced. Great attention is given to the rearing of bees
                    and silk-worms; and the wine of the province is held in high repute throughout
                    Spain, while some inferior kinds are sent to France to be mixed with claret.
                    Cattle are not extensively reared. The most important minerals of the province
                    are lead, copper, iron, and coal. There are about twenty lead and copper mines;
                    and mineral springs are found at various places. The manufactures consist of
                    fine cloths, silk, cotton, woollen and linen fabrics, girdles and lace, paper,
                    hats, leather, earthenware, and soap. There are numerous oil-mills and brandy
                    distilleries. Many of the inhabitants are engaged in the carrying trade, while
                    the fisheries on the coast are also actively prosecuted, tunny and anchovies
                    being caught in great numbers. Barilla is obtained from the sea-weed on the
                    shores, and some of the saline marshes yield large supplies of salt by
                    spontaneous evaporation. The province is divided into 16 judicial divisions and
                    206 parishes. Alicante is the chief town, and the other places of importance are
                    Denia and Villajoyosa on the coast; and Orihuela, Elche, Villena, and Alcoy in
                    the interior. Education is in a low state; <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    criminals arrested it is found that 14 in 15 can neither read nor write. The
                    people are of a lively and irascible temperament, and offences against the
                    person are frequent. Population (1870), estimated at 440,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alicante,</hi> the capital of the above province, and, after
                    Cadiz and Barcelona, the most considerable seaport of Spain. It is situated at
                    the head of the bay of Alicante, in the Mediterranean Sea, in 38° 20' N. lat.,
                    and 0° 30' W. long. The city is built on the bay in the form of a half-moon, and
                    is overlooked by a rock 400 feet high, surmounted by a castle, which has been
                    suffered to fall into decay. There is good anchoring-ground in the bay, but only
                    the smaller vessels can come up to the mole or pier. The bay is protected by
                    batteries, and there is a fixed light on the mole, 95 feet high, and visible for
                    a distance of 15 miles. Alicante was the <hi rend="italic">Lucentum</hi> of the
                    Romans; but notwithstanding its antiquity, the town presents a modern
                    appearance, and has few remains of Roman, mediaeval, or Moorish times. It is the
                    seat of a bishop, and has a cathedral and episcopal palace. It has also a good
                    town-house, an orphanage, a lyceum, a public library, and a school of
                    navigation. Cotton, linen, and woollen goods, cigars, and confections are
                    manufactured. There is a considerable trade in the fruit and other produce of
                    the surrounding plain; and the <hi rend="italic">vino tinto,</hi> or dark red
                    wine, produced in the vicinity, is sent to France for mixing purposes. At the
                    island of Plana, on the coast, very beautiful marble is procured. The foreign
                    trade of the port, though still considerable, has greatly declined on account of
                    the imposition of an excessive import tariff. In 1871, besides coasting traders,
                    372 Spanish and foreign vessels, with a tonnage of 62,546, entered the port. Of
                    these vessels, 78 were British, measuring 29,021 tons. The value of the imports
                    under foreign and native flags was £542,526, and the duties paid were £90,421,
                    without reckoning duties corresponding to material and fuel for railways, which
                    are admitted free. The chief imports are coals, iron, machinery, and guano; and
                    the chief exports esparto—of which 11,000 tons were shipped in 1871— raisins,
                    almonds, oranges, olive oil, silk, saffron, wine, lead, salt, and soda. There
                    are here English and other European consuls. Alicante was besieged by the Moors
                    in 1331, and again by the French in 1709, when the English commandant and his
                    staff were killed by the explosion of a mine. Population, 31,500.</p>
