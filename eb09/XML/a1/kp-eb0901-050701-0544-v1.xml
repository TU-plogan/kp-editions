                    organs of reproduction. Some have root-like processes by which they are attached

                    consistence. Some of the red and green delicate fronds form beautiful objects

                    they must be first washed carefully in fresh water to separate saline matters,
                    and then placed within dryingpaper and subjected to pressure. Very delicate
                    seaweeds should be floated out in water, drawing-paper being placed under them,
                    and their fronds being carefully arranged on the paper before they are raised
                    out of the water. They must then be dried partially in the air, and afterwards
                    under pressure between sheets of drying-paper.</p>
                <p>Seaweeds are composed entirely of cells, which in some instances become elongated
                    so as to have the appearance of tubes. Some Algae are uni-cellular, that is, are
                    composed of a single cell, as occurs in some Desmidieae, as Closterium. At other
                    times they are composed of numerous cells, which are kept together by a
                    gelatinous matter, but separating easily from each other so as to have an
                    independent existence. This is observed in the red snow plant <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Protococcus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Palmella nivalis).</hi> The cells of
                    seaweeds are sometimes joined together so as to form a linear series, and to
                    give them a thread-like appearance; and in such a case, when the divisions
                    between the cells are marked, the whole appears like a beaded necklace of cells.
                    When the cells are united both lengthwise and laterally they then form an
                    expanded flat frond. In some instances the frond is gelatinous.</p>
                <p>The germinating bodies or spores of seaweeds are cells often contained in
                    cavities (Fig. 2). They vary in colour, and the fronds have frequently the same
                    colour as thé spores. In reference to their colour, Algae have been divided into
                    three sub-orders: 1. Melanospermeae, brown coloured seaweeds (Fig. 1), with
                    olive-brown spores; 2. Rhodospermeae, rose-coloured seaweeds, with red spores;
                    3. Chlorospermeae, green-coloured seaweeds, with green spores.</p>
                <p>Algae are multiplied by the division of cells and by spores. By cell-division
                    there is a multiplication of cells, and by separation from the parent plant
                    these cells may bear buds. True fertilisation is effected by means of union of
                    cells, or what is called conjugation. In this process two kinds of cells unite
                    by means of a tube, and the contents of the one passes into the other, thus
                    giving rise to germinating spores. This is seen in Confervae, such as the green
                    matter often seen in ponds, and called <hi rend="italic">silk-weed.</hi> There
                    are also observed in Algae two kinds of fertilising bodies, one set called
                    Antheridia, containing moving filaments or spermatozoïde; and the other called
                    Archegonia, containing a rudimentary cell, which, after contact with the
                    spermatozoïde, becomes a spore forming a new plant. The spores produced by some
                    Algae move about in water, and have been called Zoospores. Their spontaneous
                    movements are effected by means of vibratile slender threads called cilia. These
                    zoospores are contained in a cell, which ultimately bursts and scatters them.
                    The process is well seen in a green Alga called Vaucheria. The zoospores move
                    about for a certain time, and ultimately the spores get fixed to a rock or the
                    wood of a pier, and then the cilia disappear. Cilia sometimes occur in pairs at
                    one end of a spore, numbering two or three; at other times they are placed round
                    the whole circumference of the spore.</p>
                <p>Spores have a tendency to divide into four; such compound spores are called
                    tetraspores (Fig. 3). They are common in the sub-order Rhodospermeae. They seem
                    to differ from ordinary spores, and to be more of the nature of buds. In some
                    Algae, such as Corallines, there is a coating of calcareous matter which
                    conceals their tissue. This can be removed by means of hydrochloric acid.
                    Diatoms, a subdivision of Algae, are so called from two Greek words signifying
                    to cut through, in allusion to the mode of division into two valves. They are
                    microscopic one-celled bodies, covered externally by a siliceous or flinty coat.
                    They are on the confines of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and have been
                    referred sometimes to the one and sometimes to the other. Their mode of
                    reproduction by conjugation and spores seems to indicate their alliance with
                    Algae, although some still place them among infusorial animalcules. The
                    siliceous markings of Diatoms are very beautiful microscopic objects. After
                    exposure to the action of fire or nitric acid, the silex remains unaltered, and
                    in that state the streaks of the covering are easily observed.</p>
                <p>Many of the Algae supply nutritious food. <hi rend="italic">Rhodymenia</hi><hi

                        >carrageen</hi> or Irish moss. Their fronds consist in part of a substance
                    allied to starch, which is extracted by putting them in water, and on cooling it
                    forms a jelly. Species of Ulva, one of the Chlorosperms, supply the green laver.
                    Species of Caulerpa furnish food to turtles. <hi rend="italic">Laminaria</hi><hi

                    many farms situated near the sea-shore. Seaweeds after burning yield barilla, an
                    impure carbonate of soda. Kelp was for many years prepared from seaweeds in
                    Scotland, more especially in the Western and Northern Islands.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n546/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0546-0509"/>
                <p>As regards the distribution of seaweeds, some are cosmopolitan or pelagic, as
                    species of Ulva and Enteromorpha, which are equally abundant in high northern
                    and southern latitudes, as they are under the equator and in temperate regions.
                    Many Diatomaceae are distributed from pole to pole. In general, however,
                    seaweeds are more or less limited in their distribution, so that different
                    marine floras exist in various parts of the ocean. The marine species have been
                    estimated at about 6000, and they are distributed in various regions. The
                    Northern Ocean, from the pole to the 40th degree, the sea of the Antilles, the
                    eastern coasts of South America, those of New Holland, the Indian Archipelago,
                    the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Chinese and Japanese seas, all present very
                    large marine regions, each of which possesses a peculiar vegetation. The degree
                    of exposure to light, and the greater or less motion of the waves, are important
                    in the distribution of Algae. The intervention of great depths of the ocean has
                    an influence on sea plants similar to that of high mountains on land plants.
                    Melanospermeae increase as we approach the tropics, where the maximum of the
                    species is found. Rhodospermeae chiefly abound in the temperate zone; while
                    Chlorospermeae form the chief marine vegetation of the polar zone, and abound in
                    the colder temperate zone. The green colour is characteristic of those Algae
                    which grow either in fresh water or in the shallower parts of the sea; the
                    olive-coloured Algae are abundant between the tide-marks; while the red-coloured
                    species occur chiefly in the deeper and the darker parts of the sea.</p>
                <p>Some seaweeds are worthy of note on account of the mode of their growth and
                    distribution. <hi rend="italic">Chorda</hi><hi rend="italic">Filum,</hi> a long
                    cord-like seaweed, lies in beds of 15 to 20 miles in length, and only about 600
                    feet in breadth, in the North Sea and the British Channel. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sargassum bacciferum</hi> constitutes the Gulf-weed, which has been noticed
                    by all who have crossed the Atlantic. The Gulf-weed has never been seen
                    attached, but always floating. From the abundance of this seaweed its locality
                    is called the Sargasso Sea. The most remarkable of the seaweeds, as regards size
                    and the extent of range, are <hi rend="italic">Macrocystis pyrifera</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Laminaria</hi><hi rend="italic">radiata.</hi> Masses of
                    Macrocystis, like green meadows, are found in every latitude. Many specimens
                    have been seen about 300 feet long; some even extend to 700 feet or upwards. A
                    tree seaweed, <hi rend="italic">Lessonia fuscescens,</hi> with a stem 10 feet
                    long, 12 inches in circumference, and its fronds 2-3 feet long and 3 inches
                    broad, is found in immense masses off the Patagonian regions. <hi rend="italic"
                        >D'Urvill</hi><hi rend="italic">ae</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">utilis</hi> is another large Antarctic seaweed, which, along
                    with Lessoniae, occurs at the Falkland Islands, formed by the surf into enormous
                    vegetable cables, several hundred feet long, and thicker than the human body. In
                    Britain we have a marked distribution of seaweeds as regards depth. There is a
                    littoral zone lying between high and low water marks, divided into sub-regions
                    characterised by the following seaweeds :—1. <hi rend="italic">Fucus
                        canaliculatum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">Fucus
                        vesiculosus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">Fucus
                        nodosus;</hi> 4. <hi rend="italic">Fucus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >serratus.</hi> Secondly, there is a laminarian zone, commencing at
                    low-water mark, and extending for a depth of 7 to 15 fathoms. Here we meet with
                    the great tangle seaweeds, such as <hi rend="italic">Laminaria</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">digitata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L. saccharina,</hi> along
                    with deepwater Fuci. (J. H. B.)</p>
