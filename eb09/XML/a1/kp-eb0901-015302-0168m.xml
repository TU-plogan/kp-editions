                <p><label type="entry">ADHESION</label>, a term used to denote the physical force in
                    virtue of which one body or substance remains attached to the surface of another
                    with which it has been brought into contact. It is to be distinguished from <hi
                    rend="italic">cohesion,</hi> which is the mutual attraction that the particles
                    of the same body exert on each other; and it differs from <hi rend="italic"
                    >chemical attraction</hi> or <hi rend="italic">affinity,</hi> since the
                    properties of the substances it affects remain unchanged after it takes place.
                    It is a force that the molecules of the adhering bodies exert on each other, and
                    must not be confounded with a contact which is due to mere mechanical pressure,
                    such as that which a piece of caoutchouc tubing exerts by its elasticity on a
                    body that distends it. A very familiar instance of adhesion occurs in the
                    wetting of solid bodies. It often, indeed generally, happens that, when a solid
                    and a liquid touch each other, a film of the latter adheres to the former, and
                    neither falls nor can be shaken off. This arises from the adhesion of the liquid
                    to the solid being a stronger force than the cohesion of the particles of the
                    liquid. It is also stronger than the force of gravitation; and the liquid can
                    only be removed by being forcibly rubbed off, or by the process of evaporation.
                    The force of adhesion may be determined by poising a plate of metal on a
                    balance, and afterwards ascertaining what additional force will be required to
                    detach it from the surface of a liquid. But this can only be done in the few
                    cases in which the liquid does not wet the solid (otherwise the measurement
                    would be that of the cohesive force of the liquid), and does not act on it
                    chemically. The phenomena of <hi rend="smallcaps">Capillary Attraction</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> depend on adhesion. Sometimes, when a solid and a
                    liquid are brought into contact, the adhesive force overcomes the cohesion of
                    the particles of the solid, so that it loses its solid form, and is dissolved or
                    held in solution. Solid bodies, too, as well as liquids, adhere to solids.
                    Smooth surfaces (of lead, for instance, or of dissimilar metals) will adhere;
                    and if two plates of polished glass be laid together, it will scarcely be
                    possible to separate them without breaking them. If the solids are pressed
                    together, the adhesive force is generally greater; but it has been shown to be
                    dependent to a very slight extent only on the pressure of the atmosphere. To a
                    looser kind of adhesion, whereby one body is prevented from moving smoothly on
                    the surface of another, we give the name of <hi rend="italic">friction.</hi> The
                    force of this increases with pressure, which may be the effect of gravitation or
                    the result of mechanical appliances. If it be desired that solids should adhere
                    permanently, this is commonly effected by the intervention of other
                    substances—the cements, mortars, and solders—in a liquid or viscid state, which,
                    when they “set” or become solid, adhere closely to the bodies united by means of
                    them. The principle of the processes of plating, gilding, &amp;c., is similar to
                    this. The adhesive force of cements, &amp;c., is sometimes very great. The
                    common experiment of splitting a thin sheet of paper into two is an illustration
                    of it. The paper is pasted carefully between two pieces of cloth, which are
                    pulled asunder after the paste has dried. The adhesion of the paste to the paper
                    and to the cloth is so strong that the paper is thus separated into two sheets,
                    which can easily be detached from the cloth by wetting it. Again, air and other
                    gases adhere to solids. A dry needle, placed carefully on the surface of still
                    water, will float, resting on a cushion of air; and when thermometers are filled
                    with mercury, the liquid has to be boiled in them to expel the air that adheres
                    to the glass.</p>
