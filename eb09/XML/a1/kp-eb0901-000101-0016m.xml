                    denotes also the primary vowel sound. This coincidence is probably only
                    accidental. The alphabets of Europe, and perhaps of India also, were of Semitic
                    origin, and in all the Semitic alphabets except one, this same symbol (in
                    modified forms) holds the first place; but it represents a peculiar breathing,
                    not the vowel <hi rend="italic">a,—</hi> the vowels in the Semitic languages
                    occupying a subordinate place, and having originally no special symbols. When
                    the Greeks, with whom the vowel sounds were much more important, borrowed the
                    alphabet of Phoenicia, they required symbols to express those vowels, and used
                    for this purpose the signs of breathings which were strange to them, and
                    therefore needed not to be preserved; thus the Phoenician equivalent of the
                    Hebrew <hi rend="italic">aleph</hi> became <hi rend="italic">alpha;</hi> it
                    denoted, however, no more a guttural breathing, but the purest vowel sound.
                    Still, it would be too much to assume that the Greeks of that day were so
                    skilled in phonetics that they assigned the first symbol of their borrowed
                    alphabet to the <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-sound, <hi rend="italic">because</hi>
                    they knew that sound to be the most essential vowel.</p>
                <p>This primary vowel-sound (the sound of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">father)</hi> is produced by keeping the passage through which the
                    air is vocalised between the glottis and the lips in the most open position
                    possible. In sounding all other vowels, the airchannel is narrowed by the action
                    either of the tongue or the lips. But here neither the back of the tongue is
                    raised (as it is in sounding <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and other vowels), so that
                    a free space is left between the tongue and the uvula, nor is the front of the
                    tongue raised (as in sounding <hi rend="italic">e</hi>), so that the space is
                    clear between the tongue and the palate. Again, no other vowel is pronounced
                    with a wider opening of the lips; whereas the aperture is sensibly reduced at
                    each side when we sound o, and still more when we sound <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    (that is, <hi rend="italic">yoo).</hi> The whole channel, therefore, from the
                    glottis, where the breath first issues forth to be modified in the oral cavity,
                    to the lips, where it finally escapes, is thoroughly open. Hence arises the
                    great importance of the sound, by reason of its thoroughly non-consonantal
                    character. All vowels may be defined as open positions of the speech-organs, in
                    which the breath escapes without any stoppage, friction, or sibilation arising
                    from the contact of those organs, whereas consonants are heard when the organs
                    open after such contact more or less complete. Now, all vowels except <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> are pronounced with a certain contraction of the organs;
                    thus, in sounding the <hi rend="italic">i</hi> (the English <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi>-sound), the tongue is raised so as almost to touch the palate, the
                    passage left being so close, that if the tongue were suffered for a second to
                    rest on the palate, there would be heard not <hi rend="italic">i</hi> but <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a similar relation exists
                    between <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> This is commonly
                    expressed by calling <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">w</hi>
                    semi-vowels. We might more exactly call <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> consonantal-vowels; and as an historic fact, <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> does constantly pass into <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> into <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> But no consonant has this relation to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>-sound; it has absolutely no affinity to any consonant; it is, as we have
                    called it, the one primary essential vowel.</p>
                <p>The importance of this sound may be shown by historical as well as by
                    physiological evidence. We find by tracing the process of phonetic change in
                    different languages, that when one vowel passes into another, it is the pure
                    α-sound which thus assumes other forms, whereas other vowels do not pass into
                    the <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-sound, though sometimes the new sound may have this
                    symbol. Roughly speaking, we might express the general character of vowel change
                    by drawing two lines from a common point, at which <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    placed. One of these lines marks the progress of an original <hi rend="italic">a
                    (ah-</hi> sound <hi rend="italic">)</hi> through <hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(a</hi>-sound), till it sinks finally to <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>-sound); the other marks a similar degradation, through
                    o to <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (<hi rend="italic">oo</hi>-sound). This figure
                    omits many minor modifications, and is subject to some exceptions in particular
                    languages. But it represents fairly in the main the general process of
                    vowel-change. Now, we do not assert that there ever was a time when <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> was the only existing vowel, but we do maintain that in
                    numberless cases an original <hi rend="italic">a</hi> has passed into other
                    sounds, whereas the reverse process is excessively <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n17/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0017-0002"/> rare. Consequently, the farther we trace back the
                    history of language, the more instances of this vowel do we find; the more
                    nearly, if not entirely, does it become the one starting point from which all
                    vowel-sound is derived.</p>
                <p>It is principally to the effort required to keep this sound pure that we must
                    attribute the great corruption of it in all languages, and in none more than our
                    own. Indeed, in English, the short <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-sound is never heard
                    pure; it is heard in Scotland, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                    >man,</hi> which is quite different from the same word on English lips. We have
                    it, however, long in <hi rend="italic">father,</hi> &amp;c., though it is not
                    common. It has passed into a great many other sounds, all of which are denoted
                    in a most confusing way by the original symbol, and some by other symbols as
                    well. Thus <hi rend="italic">a</hi> denotes—(1.) The English vowel-sound in <hi
                    rend="italic">man,</hi> perhaps the most common of all the substitutes, dating
                    from the 17th century. (2.) It appears in <hi rend="italic">want;</hi> for this
                    sound <hi rend="italic">o</hi> is also employed, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >on.</hi> (3.) A more open sound is heard in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> (also
                    denoted by <hi rend="italic">au</hi> in <hi rend="italic">auk,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">aw</hi> in <hi rend="italic">awl).</hi> (4.) Very commonly it
                    represents the continental <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >ale</hi> (here also we have the symbol <hi rend="italic">ai</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">ail).</hi> (5.) It is found in <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> and
                    many similar words, where the sound is really the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> of
                    <hi rend="italic">den,</hi> prolonged in the utterance; here also <hi
                    rend="italic">ai</hi> is sometimes an equivalent, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >air.</hi> Then (6) there is a sound which is not that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> either in <hi rend="italic">man</hi> or in <hi rend="italic"
                    >father,</hi> but something between the two. It is heard in such words as <hi
                    rend="italic">ask, pass, grant,</hi> &amp;c. All these may be, and often are,
                    pronounced with the sound either of <hi rend="italic">man</hi> or of <hi
                    rend="italic">father;</hi> still, we do often hear in them a clearly
                    distinguishable intermediate sound, which ought to have a special symbol. Lastly
                    (7), there is the dull sound heard in final unaccentuated syllables, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the word <hi rend="italic">final</hi> itself. It is
                    that to which all unaccentuated syllables tend; but it is also often heard even
                    in monosyllables, where it is represented by every other vowelsymbol in the
                    language, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">her, sir, son,
                    sun.</hi> This Protean sound is commonly called the neutral vowel; it occurs in
                    all languages, but perhaps in none so frequently as in English. This great
                    variety of sounds, which are all denoted among us by one symbol, clearly shows
                    the insufficiency of our written alphabet.</p>
                <p>As in English, so in Sanskrit, the short «Λ-sound was lost, and was replaced
                    regularly by the neutral sound. This was regarded by the grammarians as inherent
                    in every consonant, and therefore was only written at the beginning of a word;
                    in fact, it is the smallest amount of vowelsound requisite to float a consonant.
                    Long <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> however, kept its sound pure, and does so still
                    in the vernaculars of India. In Latin the sound was probably pure, both short
                    and long, and it has been preserved so in the Romance languages down to the
                    present day. In Greek there was considerable variation, proved in one case at
                    least by a variation of symbol; in Ionic <hi rend="italic">a</hi> commonly
                    passed into <hi rend="italic">η,</hi> a symbol which probably denoted the modern
                    Italian open <hi rend="italic">e;</hi> but possibly the close <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> that is, the English <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                    >ale.</hi> On the other hand, it is probable that the Doric <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> approximated to an <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> being sounded as <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> in our word <hi rend="italic">want;</hi> and it is likely
                    that this variation was the πλατειασμός which the grammarians attribute to the
                    Dorians. This is commonly supposed to have been the retention of α where the
                    Ionic had <hi rend="italic">η</hi>; but that was not peculiar to the Dorians,
                    being common to all the Greeks except the Ionians. In the north of Europe we
                    find a similar tendency to give to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> an <hi rend="italic"
                    >o</hi>-sound; thus in Norse, <hi rend="italic">aa</hi> is sounded as an open o.
                    By a further extension in the north of England, at least in such parts as have
                    been specially exposed to Norwegian influence, <hi rend="italic">au</hi> has the
                    sound of <hi rend="italic">o; e.g., law</hi> is pronounced <hi rend="italic"
                    >lo.</hi></p>
                <p>A is frequently used as a prefix in lieu of some fuller form in old English. Thus
                    it stands for the preposition <hi rend="italic">on</hi> (O.E. <hi rend="italic"
                    >an)</hi> in <hi rend="italic">away, again, afoot, asleep;</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">off</hi> in <hi rend="italic">adown</hi> (O.E. <hi rend="italic"
                    >of-dune);</hi> and seems to be intensive in <hi rend="italic">athirst</hi>
                    (O.E. <hi rend="italic">of-thirst).</hi> Sometimes, especially with verbs, it
                    represents the old English <hi rend="italic">â</hi> which in old High German
                    appears as <hi rend="italic">ur</hi> or <hi rend="italic">er,</hi> and in modern
                    German as <hi rend="italic">er,</hi> which signifies the completion of an
                    action, as in <hi rend="italic">erwachen,</hi> to which <hi rend="italic"
                    >awake</hi> corresponds. Frequently no special force seems to be added by the
                    prefix, as in <hi rend="italic">abide, arise,</hi> &amp;c. Sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> appears as the representative of the prefix commonly used
                    in past participles, which has the form <hi rend="italic">ge</hi> in German, and
                    <hi rend="italic">ge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in old English, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">ago</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >agone;</hi> compare <hi rend="italic">aware</hi> (O.E. <hi rend="italic"
                    >gewaere), among</hi> (O.E. <hi rend="italic">gemang),</hi> &amp;c. <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> also stood for the preposition <hi rend="italic">an
                    (on)</hi> in such expressions (now obsolete) as <hi rend="italic">a-doing,
                    a-making,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >making</hi> are verbal nouns. Lastly, it represents the prepositions <hi
                    rend="italic">on</hi> or <hi rend="italic">of</hi> in the phrases <hi
                    rend="italic">now-a-days, Jack-a-lantern,</hi> and others.</p>
                <p>The place that A occupies in the alphabet accounts for its being much employed as
                    a mark or symbol. It is used, for instance, to name the sixth note of the gamut
                    in music; in some systems of notation it is a numeral (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Arithmetic);</hi> and in Logic it denotes a universal affirmative proposition
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Logic).</hi> In algebra, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and
                    the first letters of the alphabet are employed to represent known quantities. Al
                    marks the best class of vessels in Lloyd’s Register of British and Foreign
                    Shipping. In the old poets, <hi rend="italic">“</hi> A <hi rend="italic">per
                    se”</hi> is found, meaning the highest degree of excellence; as when Chaucer
                    calls Creseide “the floure and <hi rend="italic">A per se</hi> of Troye and
                    Grece.”</p>
                <p>A was the first of the eight <hi rend="italic">literoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nundinales</hi> at Rome, and on this analogy it stands as the first of the
                    seven Dominical letters.</p>
                <p>It is often used as an abbreviation, as in A.D. for <hi rend="italic"
                    >anno</hi><hi rend="italic">domini,</hi> A.M. for <hi rend="italic">ante
                    meridiem,</hi> A.B. and A. Μ. for <hi rend="italic">artium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >baccalaureus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">artium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >magister.</hi> In commerce A stands for <hi rend="italic">accepted.</hi> (J.
