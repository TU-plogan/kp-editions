                    elevated station of one of the governors of provinces. Deprived of his protector
                    by death, and engaging in the dangerous intrigues that pave the way to power in
                    an unstable government, he procured his own banishment to Upper Egypt. Here he
                    spent two years in maturing his schemes for future greatness; and in 1766,
                    returning to Cairo, he either slew or expelled the beys, and seized the reigns
                    of government. Emboldened by success, he rescued himself from the power of the
                    Porte, coined money in his own name, and assumed the rank of sultan of Egypt.
                    Occupied in more important concerns, the Porte made no vigorous opposition to
                    his measures, and Ali seized the opportunity to recover a part of the Said, or
                    Upper Egypt, which had been taken possession of by an Arab sheik. He next sent
                    out a fleet from Suez, which, seizing upon Djedda, entered the port of Mecca;
                    while a body of cavalry, commanded by Mahomet Bey, his favourite, took and
                    plundered Mecca itself. Having formed an alliance in 1770 with the Sheik Daher,
                    a rebel against the Porte in Syria, he aimed at the conquest of all Syria and
                    Palestine. He first endeavoured to secure Gaza; then his army, forming a
                    junction with that of Daher at Acre, advanced to Damascus. There, on the 6th of
                    June 1771, a battle was fought with the Turkish pashas, and Mahomet and Daher,
                    Ali’s generals, routed them with great slaughter. The latter instantly took
                    possession of Damascus, and the castle itself had also capitulated, when Mahomet
                    unexpectedly hastened back to Egypt with all his Mamelukes. Some ascribe this
                    strange conduct to an impression made upon Mahomet by the Turkish agents, and
                    others to a report of the death of Ali Bey.</p>
                <p>Although unsuccessful, Ali never lost sight of his favourite object; and Mahomet,
                    losing his confidence, was forced to save his life by exile. Mahomet, however,
                    quickly returned with an army, and drove Ali Bey from Cairo. In this unfortunate
                    state of affairs Ali fled to Daher, and, combining their forces, they attacked
                    the Turkish commander at Sidon, and came off victorious, although the Turkish
                    army was three times their number. After a siege of eight months, they next took
                    the town of Jaffa. Deceived by letters from Cairo, which were only intended to
                    ensnare him, and stimulated by his recent victories, Ali returned to Cairo.
                    Entering the deserts which divide Gaza from Egypt, he was furiously attacked by
                    a thousand chosen Mamelukes led on by Murad Bey, who was enamoured of Ali’s
                    wife, and had obtained the promise of her, provided that he could take Ali
                    captive. Ali was wounded, made prisoner, and carried to Mahomet. He died three
                    days after, from the effects either of poison or of his wounds.</p>
