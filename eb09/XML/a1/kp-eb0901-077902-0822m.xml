                    situated in the province of North Holland, is built somewhat in the form of a
                    halfmoon, on the Y or Ij, an arm of the Zuyder Zee, in 52° 22' N. lat., and 4°
                    53' E. long. The name Amsterdam means “the dam or dyke of the Amstel,” from a
                    river so called which passes in a north-easterly direction through the city,—the
                    “dam” referring to the extensive and costly system of embankments, canals, and
                    sluices necessary to secure this low-lying city against the encroachments of the
                    tide. Towards the land Amsterdam was at one time surrounded by a fosse or canal,
                    and regularly fortified; but its ramparts have been demolished, and the
                    twenty-eight bastions that formed part of the defences are now used as
                    promenades or covered with buildings. Within the city, four canals—the Prinseu
                    Gracht, Keizer’s Gracht, Heeren</p>
                <p>Gracht, and the Singel—extend, in the form of polygonal crescents, nearly
                    parallel to each other and to the former fosse; while numerous smaller canals
                    intersect the city in every direction, dividing it into about 90 islands, with
                    nearly 290 bridges. Some of these are of stone, but the majority are of iron and
                    wood, and constructed so as to allow vessels for inland navigation to pass
                    through. The site of Amsterdam was originally a peat bog, and all its buildings
                    rest upon piles that are driven some 40 or 50 feet through a mass of loose sand
                    and mud until they reach a solid stratum of firm clay. This foundation is
                    perfectly secure as long as the piles remain under water. In 1822, however, an
                    overladen com magazine sank into the mud. The piles are liable to the ravages of
                    wood-worms that are supposed to have been brought by vessels from foreign ports.
                    The streets in the oldest parts of the town are narrow and irregular, but are
                    nowhere without pavements or footways. The houses frequently present a
                    picturesque sky-line, broken by fantastic gables, roofs, chimneys, towers, and
                    turrets of a∏ forms and dimensions. Four of the principal of those towers have
                    exterior galleries very near the top, running round them, from which an alarm
                    used to be blown in case of fire, and a light shown to indicate the locality of
                    the fire to the citizens, who from the age of twenty to fifty are all enrolled
                    in the fire-brigade and civic guard. This mode of signalling is now, however,
                    superseded by a system of telegraphic communication embracing the whole city.
                    Westward of the Amstel, which passes almost through the centre of the city, is
                    the more modem part, where the houses are often exceedingly handsome, and the
                    streets broad, and planted with rows of large trees between the houses and the
                    canals. The chief promenades are the Vondelspark, laid out and maintained by
                    private individuals, with the design of its being ultimately presented to the
                    city; and the Plantaadje or Plantation, part of which is occupied by the botanic
                    and the zoological gardens, and which is also supported by private
                    contributions. Of the public buildings, the principal is the palace, an imposing
                    structure, built in 1648, by the architect Jacob van Kämpen, and adorned with
                    stone carvings by the celebrated artist Artus Quellinus of Antwerp. It is
                    supported on 13,659 piles, and is 282 feet long, with a breadth of 235 feet and
                    a height of 116, exclusive of a turreted cupola, which rises 66 feet above the
                    main building. It was originally the Stadhuis, but was appropriated as a palace
                    by King Louis Napoleon in 1808. The most· magnificent<pb break="no"

                    feet by 57, and 90 in height, with walls incrusted with white Italian marble. On
                    the opposite side from the palace of the square called the Dam, stands the Beurs
                    or Exchange, a fine tetraprostyle Ionic building, serving as a front to a large
                    quadrangle with a handsome peristyle of the same order. The Oude Kerk, built
                    about the year 1300, has some beautiful stained windows and a fine organ, as
                    well as monuments to various celebrated Dutchmen, including the naval heroes Van
                    Heemskerk and Sweerts. The Niewe Kerk, a much finer edifice, where the kings of
                    Holland are crowned, dating from 1408, is remarkable for the carving of its
                    pulpit, for the elaborate bronze castings of its choir, and for the monuments to
                    the famous Admiral De Ruyter and Holland’s greatest poet, Vondel, whose statue
                    stands in the park which bears his name. There are many other places of worship
                    in Amsterdam, including those belonging to the Dutch Reformed Church, the
                    English Episcopalians, the Scotch Presbyterians, the Lutherans, the Jansenists,
                    the Roman Catholics, the Greeks, &lt;fcc., and also several Jewish synagogues;
                    but, as a rule, the church architecture of the town is bald and uninteresting.
                    We may except, however, the synagogue of the Shephardim Jews, the equal of which
                    is only to be found at Leghorn; the Moses and Aaron’s Church (R.C.); and the new
                    Lutheran place of worship, which has a green copper cupola. The Paleis voor
                    Volks-vlijt is a building of iron and glass, 440 feet long by 280 broad, with a
                    dome 200 feet high, erected between 1855 and 1864. It is used for industrial
                    exhibitions, the performance of operas, &lt;tc., and possesses a collection of
                    pictures (copies and some originals), as well as a fine garden. The
                    Schreijerstoren, or “crier’s tower,” at the end of the Geldersche Kade, where
                    vessels left for all parts of the globe, was built about 1482, and got its name
                    from the tears of the sailors who here bid their friends farewell. The chief
                    literary institutions of Amsterdam are the Athenaeum, the society called “<hi
                    rend="italic">Felix</hi><hi rend="italic">Meritis,”</hi> from the first words of
                    the inscription on their place of meeting; the society <hi rend="italic"
                    >“Natura</hi><hi rend="italic">Artis</hi><hi rend="italic">Magistra”</hi> to
                    whom the zoological gardens belong; the Royal Academy of the Fine Arts, and the
                    Seaman’s Institute. The galleries of pictures in the city are of great value.
                    The museum in the Trippenhuis contains over 400 works, chiefly of the Flemish
                    and Dutch schools, including the</p>
                <p>“Night Guard” of Rembrandt, whose statue may be seen on the Kaasplein, opposite
                    the house he occupied, and the “Banquet of the Civic Guard,” by Van der Heist;
                    besides nearly 4000 engravings, and a magnificent numismatic collection,
                    considered one of the finest in the world. Among the other collections are those
                    in the Museum Van der Hoop and in the Fodor Museum, that belonging to the <hi
                    rend="italic">“Arti</hi><hi rend="italic">et Amicitioe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >”</hi> Society, as well as several private galleries. Amsterdam is also
                    remarkable for the number and high character of its benevolent institutions,
                    which are to a large extent supported by voluntary contributions. Among others
                    may be mentioned hospitals for the sick, the aged, the infirm, the blind, the
                    deaf, the dumb, the insane, widows, orphans, and foundlings. There is a noble
                    institution, the Society for the Public Welfare, whose object is to promote the
                    education and improvement of all classes. It has branches in nearly every town
                    and village in HoUand. There is also an admirable sailors’ home.</p>
                <p>Amsterdam is now capitally supplied with water for drinking and culinary purposes
                    from the Haarlem dunes. Formerly the inhabitants were dependent on the
                    rain-water collected in cisterns, and the supply brought from Weesp in large
                    flat-bottomed barges. This, added to the general humidity of the atmosphere
                    caused by the canals, made Amsterdam an unpleasant place of residence in summer,
                    but the exertions of the inhabitants have done much of late to counteract these
                    noxious influences. The people usually have a robust appearance, and the
                    death-rate of the city is low.</p>
                <p>The population (1874) is estimated at 285,000, of whom about 60,000 are Roman
                    Catholics, and 30,000 Jews, the rest being mostly Protestants of various
                    sects.</p>
                <p>The accompanying plan indicates the extent and position of the docks of
                    Amsterdam. The arsenal and the admiralty offices are situated on the island of
                    Kattenburg, between the Dijk Gracht and the Niewe Vaart. The approach to the
                    city from the Zuyder Zee is intricate and dangerous, owing to the numerous
                    shallows; and a bar at the entrance to the Y compels vessels to unload part of
                    their cargo in the roadstead. These delays and dangers were to a large extent
                    provided against in 1825, by the opening of a canal across North Holland from
                    the Niewe Diep, opposite the Texel, to Amsterdam; and a more direct and
                    capacious canal to the North Sea is at present in process of construction. The

                    December 1870;—</p>

                <p>The principal imports of Amsterdam are—coffee, amounting in 1870 to 1,147,240
                    bags and 1499 casks; tea, in the same year, 79,573 chests; sugar, in the same
                    year, 273,750,000 ft; tobacco, rice, cotton, indigo, timber, tin, hemp, and
                    grain. The exports comprise cheese, butter, madder, clover, rape, linseed oil,
                    gin, and other products of Holland, besides general goods and manufactures from
                    various European countries. There is also a large export trade in the produce of
                    the East and West Indies. There are two lines of railway, the one connecting
                    Amsterdam with Haarlem, Leyden, and Rotterdam; and the other with Utrecht,
                    Arnheim, and Prussia. Amsterdam has sugar refineries; soap, oil, glass, iron,
                    dye, and chemical works; distilleries, breweries, tanneries; tobacco and snuff
                    factories. The cutting of diamonds has long been extensively practised in the
                    city by the Jews. Although no longer the centre of the banking transactions of
                    the world, Amsterdam is still a place of considerable importance in this
                    respect. The celebrated bank of Amsterdam, founded in 1609, was dissolved in
                    1796; and the present bank of the Netherlands w as established on the model of
                    the Bank of England in 1814.</p>
                <p>About the year 1200 Amsterdam was a small fishing village, held in fief by the
                    lords of Amstel, together with the surrounding district, called Amstelland.
                    Towards the close of the 13th century it reverted, in consequence of the
                    complicity of Gysbrecht Van Amstel in the murder of Count Floris V., to the
                    counts of Holland, who gave it a charter and other privileges. It was fortified
                    in 1482, and soon rose to be the most important commercial city of the
                    Netherlands. The early voyages to India, and the union of the seven provinces in
                    1579, added greatly to the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0824-0781"/> prosperity of Amsterdam—so much so, that it
                    excited the 'upidity of the earl of Leicester, who made a futile attempt to
                    surprise it in 1587; aud its position was still further improved by the peace of
                    Westphalia in 1648, which closed the navigation of the Scheldt, and consequently
                    ruined the trade of Antwerp. Two years later, the stadtholder William II.
                    intended to surprise it, but the bold attitude of the inhabitants obliged him to
                    give up his project. Amsterdam suffered so severely from the war in the time of
                    Cromwell, that more than 4000 houses stood tenantless; and the French occupation
                    during the First Empire inflicted a more permanent injury upon the city. Since
                    1813, however, much of its former commercial influence has returned; and the
                    completion of the above-mentioned canal will, no doubt, confirm its position as
                    the chief commercial city of the kingdom, its secondary place as a seaport
                    lately having been due to the difficulty of access to it from the sea. Among the
                    many eminent men who saw the light in Amsterdam may be mentioned the celebrated
                    philosopher BaruchJ Spinosa (1632), the flower painter Van Huysum (1682), the
                    naturalist Swammerdam (1637), and the poet Bilderdyk (1750). (See Caspar
