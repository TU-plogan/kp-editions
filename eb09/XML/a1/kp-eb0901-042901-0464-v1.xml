                <p><label type="entry">AIR-PUMP</label>, an apparatus by means of which a closed
                    vessel can have the air it contains removed from it. It consists essentially of
                    two parts—a receiver, from which the air is to be exhausted; and a pump, to
                    perform the work of exhaustion. The receiver is in general made of glass, in
                    order that the condition of objects placed within it for the purpose of
                    experiment may be readily seen by the operator. It is open at the bottom, and
                    has its lower edge accurately ground; when in its place in the air-pump it
                    stands upon a smooth brass plate. The pump itself is a brass cylinder, having a
                    piston in it, which can be moved backwards and forwards by means of a rod, in
                    the usual way. At the end of the cylinder nearest the receiver is placed a small
                    valve, in the piston itself is another (or some mechanism which serves the
                    purpose of a valve), and there is frequently a third in the outer end of the
                    cylinder. All these valves open outwards from the receiver. The action of the
                    pump, when arranged in this way, is exactly similar to the action of an ordinary
                    well-pump, with air as the fluid instead of water. The air-pump was invented
                    about 1654 by Otto von Guericke, a magistrate of Magdeburg, and a man who
                    devoted great attention to various problems in pneumatics.<note anchored="true"

                            “Magdeburg hemispheres.”</p></note> The first description of his pump
                    was published in 1657 in the <hi rend="italic">Mechanica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Hydraulico-pneumatica</hi> of Gaspar Schottus, professor of mathematics at
                    Wurtemberg. He used a spherical glass receiver, with a pumping syringe attached,
                    and kept the whole of the working parts under water to prevent leakage. His pump
                    was very imperfectly constructed, but he did eventually succeed in getting a
                    very good vacuum with it. The method of producing the Torricellian vacuum, by
                    filling a vessel with liquid and then removing the liquid without permitting
                    ingress of air, was previously known; but a vacuum produced in this way was
                    obviously useless for experiments with any objects but those which could
                    previously be immersed in the liquid used. Guericke was, however, the first to
                    recognise that, by virtue of its perfect elasticity, or tendency to expand
                    indefinitely, air could be pumped out of a closed space as well as water; and
                    this is the principle of his and all succeeding air-pumps. Although the
                    invention of the air-pump is due to a German, almost all the improvements made
                    in it from time to time have come from Englishmen. Dr Boyle contributed so much
                    to its perfection that for a long time the state of the air in an exhausted
                    receiver was called <hi rend="italic">vacuum Boyleanum,</hi> and the air-pump
                    itself <hi rend="italic">machina</hi><hi rend="italic">Boyleana.</hi> Dr Hook,
                    Hawkesbee, John Smeaton, and others brought the air-pump externally to very much
                    the same form as that in which it is commonly seen at present, and which is
                    shown in the annexed woodcut. The pump here has two cylinders, which are worked
                    by a winch handle, the pump rods having toothed racks on the upper part of their
                    length. Professor Tate is the inventor of a double-action air-pump, now much
                    used where a very perfect vacuum is required. It has two pistons in one barrel,
                    the air being drawn from the receiver at the centre of the barrel, and
                    discharged into the atmosphere at its extremities. Very complete air-pumps have
                    two or three barrels, arranged as shown in the woodcut, for rapid exhaustion,
                    until the pressure in the receiver is equal to (say) half-an-inch of mercury;
                    and in addition to these a horizontal Tate’s barrel, which can then be put into
                    action to bring the vacuum down to inch of mercury(1-600th of the pressure of
                    the atmosphere), or even less at low temperatures. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Pneumatics.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Air-Pump,</hi> in steam-engines, is
                    the pump which draws the condensed steam, along with the air which is always
                    mixed with it, and also the condensing water (except where a surface condenser
                    is used), away from the condenser, and discharges it into the hot well. See <hi
