                    of Dichet, Somerset. The younger Richard being ordained, became assistant to his
                    venerable father, and immediately stirred the entire county by his burning
                    eloquence. In March 1641 he succeeded to many-sided Richard Bernard as rector of
                    Batcomb (Somerset). He declared himself on the side of the Puritans by
                    subscribing “The testimony of the ministers in Somersetshire to the truth of
                    Jesus Christ” and “The Solemn League and Covenant.” He continued for twenty
                    years rector of Batcomb. On the Act of Uniformity being passed, he cast in his
                    lot with the Two Thousand of the ejected. Upon the Five-Mile Act he removed to
                    Frome Selwood, and preached there and around until his death on December 22,
                    1681. His works are all of the richest spiritual character, with a wistfulness
                    of appeal that goes right to the heart. His <hi rend="italic">Vindiciae
                    Pietatis</hi> (which appeared successively in 1660, 1663, and 1665) was refused
                    licence by Sheldon, and was published, in common with other Nonconformist books,
                    without it. It was rapidly bought up, and “did much to mend this bad world.”
                    Roger Norton, the king’s printer, caused a large part of the first impression to
                    be seized, on the ground of not being licensed, and to be sent to the royal
                    kitchen. Glancing over its pages, he was struck with what he read, and on second
                    thoughts it seemed to him a sin that a book so holy—and so saleable—should be
                    destroyed. He therefore bought back the sheets, says Calamy, for an old song,
                    bound them, and sold them in his own shop. This in turn was complained of
                    against him, and the shrewd publisher had to beg pardon on lus knees before the
                    council-table; and the remaining copies were sentenced to be “bisk’d,” or rubbed
                    over with an inky brush, and sent back to the kitchen for lighting fires. Such
                    “bisk’d” copies occasionally occur still. The book was not killed. It was
                    reissued, with additions, and a contribution by Joseph Alleine, and went forth
                    on a mission which has endured to our day. (Calamy, <hi rend="italic">s.v.;</hi>
