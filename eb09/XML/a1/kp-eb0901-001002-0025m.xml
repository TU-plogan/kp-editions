                    from the larger abbeys, to the abbots of which they continued subordinate; but
                    in later times the actual distinction between abbeys and priories was lost.</p>
                <p>Reserving for the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Monasticism</hi> the history of
                    tho rise and progress of the monastic system, its objects, benefits, evils, its
                    decline and fall, we propose in this article to confine ourselves to the
                    structural plan and arrangement of conventual establishments, and a description
                    of the various buildings of which these vast piles were composed.</p>
                <p>The earliest Christian monastic communities with which we are acquainted
                    consisted of groups of cells or huts collected about a common centre, which was
                    usually the abode of some anchorite celebrated for superior holiness or singular
                    asceticism, but without any attempt at orderly arrangement. The formation of
                    such communities in the East does not date from the introduction of
                    Christianity. The example had been already set by the Essenes in Judea and the
                    Therapeutae in Egypt, who may be considered the prototypes of the industrial and
                    meditative communities of monks.</p>
                <p>In the earliest age of Christian monasticism the ascetics were accustomed to live
                    singly, independent of one another, at no great distance from some village,
                    supporting themselves by the labour of their own hands, and distributing the
                    surplus after the supply of their own scanty wants to the poor. Increasing
                    religious fervour, aided by persecution, drove them further and further away
                    from the abodes of men into mountain solitudes or lonely deserts. The deserts of
                    Egypt swarmed with the cells or huts of these anchorites. Antony, who had
                    retired to the Egyptian Thebaid during the persecution of Maximin, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 312, was the most celebrated among them for his
                    austerities, his sanctity, and his power as an exorcist. His fame collected
                    round him a host of followers, emulous of his sanctity. The deeper he withdrew
                    into the wilderness, the more numerous his disciples became. They refused to be
                    separated from him, and built their cells round that of their spiritual father.
                    Thus arose the first monastic community, consisting of anchorites living each in
                    his own little dwelling, united together under one superior. Antony, as Neander
                    remarks <hi rend="italic">(Church History,</hi> vol. iii. p. 316, Clark’s
                    Trans.), “without any conscious design of his own, had become the founder of a
                    new mode of living in common, Coenobitism.” By degrees order was introduced in
                    the groups of huts. They were arranged in lines like the tents in an encampment,
                    or the houses in a street. From this arrangement these lines of single cells
                    came to be known as <hi rend="italic">Laurae,</hi> Λαυραι, “streets” or
                    “lanes.”</p>
                <p>The real founder of coenobian monasteries in the modern sense was Pachomius, an
                    Egyptian of the beginning of the 4th century. The first community established by
                    him was at Tabennae, an island of the Nile in Upper Egypt. Eight others were
                    founded in his lifetime, numbering 3000 monks. Within 50 years from his death
                    his societies could reckon 50,000 members. These coenobia resembled villages,
                    peopled by a hard-working religious community, all of one sex. The buildings
                    were detached, small, and of the humblest character. Each cell or hut, according
                    to Sozomen (H. E. iii. 14), contained three monks. They took their chief meal in
                    a common refectory at 3 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.,</hi> up to which hour they
                    usually fasted. They ate in silence, with hoods so drawn over their faces that
                    they could see nothing but what was on the table before them. The monks spent
                    all the time, not devoted to religious services or study, in manual labour.
                    Palladius, who visited the Egyptian monasteries about the close of the 4th
                    century, found among the 300 <pb break="no"

                    Pachomian rule, 15 tailors, 7 smiths, 4 carpenters, 12 camel-drivers, and 15
                    tanners. Each separate community had its own <hi rend="italic">oeconomus,</hi>
                    or steward, who was subject to a chief <hi rend="italic">oeconomus</hi>
                    stationed at the head establishment. All the produce of the monks’ labour was
                    committed to him, and by him shipped to Alexandria. The money raised by the sale
                    was expended in the purchase of stores for the support of the communities, and
                    what was over was devoted to charity. Twice in the year the superiors of the
                    several <hi rend="italic">coenobia</hi> met at the chief monastery, under the
                    presidency of an Archimandrite (“the chief of the fold,” from <hi rend="italic"
                    >μάνδρα,</hi> a fold), and at the last meeting gave in reports of their
                    administration for the year.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">coenobia</hi> of Syria belonged to the Pachomian
                    institution. We learn many details concerning those in the vicinity of Antioch
                    from Chrysostom’s writings. The monks lived in separate huts, <hi rend="italic"

                    They were subject to an abbot, and observed a common rule. (They had no
                    refectory, but ate their common meal, of bread and water only, when the day’s
                    labour was over, reclining on strewn grass, sometimes out of doors.) Four times
                    in the day they joined in prayers and psalms.</p>
                <p>The necessity for defence from hostile attacks, economy of space, and convenience
                    of access from one part of the community to another, by degrees dictated a more
                    compact and orderly arrangement of the buildings of a monastic coenobium. Large
                    piles of building were erected, with strong outside walls, capable of resisting
                    the assaults of an enemy, within which all the necessary edifices were ranged
                    round one or more open courts, usually surrounded with cloisters. The usual
                    Eastern arrangement is exemplified in the plan of the convent of Santa Laura,
                    Mt. Athos <hi rend="italic">(Laura,</hi> the designation of a monastery
                    generally, being converted into a female saint).</p>
                <p>This monastery, like the Oriental monasteries generally is surrounded by a strong
                    and lofty blank stone wall, enclosing an area of between 3 and <hi rend="italic"
                    >4</hi> acres. The longer side extends to a length of about 500 feet. There is
                    only one main entrance, on the north side (A), defended by three separate iron
                    doors. Near the entrance is a large tower (M), a constant feature in the
                    monasteries of the Levant. There is a small postern gate at (L.) The <hi
                    rend="italic">enceinte</hi> comprises two large open courts, surrounded with
                    buildings connected with cloister galleries of wood or stone. The outer court,
                    which is much the larger, contains the granaries and storehouses (K), and the
                    kitchen (H), and other offices connected with the refectory (G). Immediately
                    adjacent to the gateway is a two-storeyed guesthouse, opening from a cloister
                    (C). The inner court is surrounded by a cloister (EE), from which open the
                    monks’ cells (II). In the centre of this court stands the catholicon or
                    conventual church, a square building with an apse of the cruciform domical
                    Byzantine type, approached by a domed narthex. In front of the church stands a
                    marble fountain (F), covered by a dome supported on columns. Opening from the
                    western side of the cloister, but actually standing in the outer court, is the
                    refectory (G), a large cruciform building, about 100 feet each way, decorated
                    within with frescoes of saints. At the upper end is a semicircular recess,
                    recalling the Triclinium of the Lateran Palace at Rome, in which is placed the
                    seat of the <hi rend="italic">Hegu-menos</hi> or abbot. This apartment is
                    chiefly used as a hall of meeting, the Oriental monks usually taking their meals
                    in their separate cells. St Laura is exceeded in magnitude by the Convent of
                    Vatopede, also on Mount Athos. This enormous establishment covers at least <hi
                    rend="italic">4</hi> acres of ground, and contains so many separate buildings
                    within its massive walls that it resembles a fortified town. It lodges above 300
                    monks, and the establishment of the Hegumenos is described as resembling the
                    court of a petty sovereign prince. The immense refectory, of the same cruciform
                    shape as that of St Laura, will accommodate 500 guests at its 24 marble
                    tables.</p>
                <p>The annexed plan of a Coptic monastery, from Lenoir shows us a church of three
                    aisles, with cellular apses, and two ranges of cells on either side of an oblong
                    gallery.</p>
                <p>Monasticism in the West owes its extension and development to Benedict of Nursia
                    (born <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 480). His rule was diffused with miraculous
                    rapidity from the parent foundation on Monte Cassino through the whole of
                    Western Europe, and every country witnessed the erection of monasteries far
                    exceeding anything that had yet been seen in spaciousness and splendour. Few
                    great towns in Italy were without their Benedictine convent, and they quickly
                    rose in all the great centres of population in England, France, and Spain. The
                    number of these monasteries founded between <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 520
                    and 700 is amazing. Before the Council of Constance, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> 1005, no fewer than 15,070 abbeys had been established of this order
                    alone. The Benedictine rule, spreading with the vigour of a young and powerful
                    life, absorbed into itself the older monastic foundations, whose discipline had
                    too usually become disgracefully relaxed. In the words of Milman <hi
                    rend="italic">(Latin Christianity,</hi> vol. i. p. 425, note x.), “The
                    Benedictine rule was universally received, even in the older monasteries of
                    Gaul, Britain, Spain, and throughout the West, not as that of a rival order (all
                    rivalry was of later date), but as a more full and perfect rule of the monastic
                    life.” Not only, therefore, were new monasteries founded, but those already
                    existing were pulled down, and rebuilt to adapt them to the requirements of the
                    new rule.</p>
                <p>The buildings of a Benedictine abbey were uniformly arranged after one plan,
                    modified where necessary (as at <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n27/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0027-0012"/> Durham and Worcester, where the monasteries stand
                    close to the steep bank of a river), to accommodate the arrangement to local
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>We have no existing examples of the earlier monasteries of the Benedictine order.
                    They have all yielded to the ravages of time and the violence of man. But we
                    have fortunately preserved to us an elaborate plan of the great Swiss monastery
                    of St Gall, erected about <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 820, which puts us in
                    possession of the whole arrangements of a monastery of the first class towards
                    the early part of the 9th century. This curious and interesting plan has been
                    made the subject of a memoir both by Keller (Zurich, 1844) and by Professor
                    Willis (<hi rend="italic">Arch. Journal,</hi> 1848, vol. V. pp. 86-117). To the
                    latter we are indebted for the substance of the following description, as well
                    as for the above woodcut, reduced from his elucidated transcript of the original
                    preserved in the archives of the convent. The general appearance of the convent
                    is that of a town of isolated houses with streets running between them. It is
                    evidently planned in compliance with the Benedictine rule, which enjoined that,
                    if possible, the monastery should contain within itself every necessary of life,
                    as well as the buildings more intimately connected with the religious and social
                    life of its inmates. It should comprise a mill, a bakehouse, stables and
                    cow-houses, together with accommodation for carrying on all necessary mechanical
                    arts within the walls, so as to obviate the necessity of the monks going outside
                    its limits. The general distribution of the buildings may be thus described
                    :—The church, with its cloister to the south, occupies the centre of a
                    quadrangular area, about 430 feet square. The buildings, as in all great
                    monasteries, are distributed into groups. The church forms the nucleus, as the
                    centre of the religious life of the community. In closest connection with the
                    church is the group of buildings appropriated to the monastic life and its daily
                    requirements—the refectory for eating, the dormitory for sleeping, the common
                    room for social intercourse, the chapter-house for religious and disciplinary
                    conference. These essential elements of monastic life are ranged about a
                    cloister court, surrounded by a covered arcade, affording communication
                    sheltered from the elements, between the various buildings. The infirmary for
                    sick monks, with the physician’s house and physic garden, lies to the east. In
                    the same group with the infirmary is the school for the novices. The outer
                    school, with its head-master’s house against the opposite wall of the church,
                    stands outside the convent enclosure, in close proximity to the abbot’s house,
                    that he might have a constant eye over them. The buildings devoted to
                    hospitality are divided into three groups,—one for the reception of
                    distinguished guests, another for monks visiting the monastery, a third for poor
                    travellers and pilgrims. The first and third are placed to the right and left of
                    the common entrance of the monastery,—the hospitium for distinguished guests
                    being placed on the north side of the church, not far from the abbot’s house;
                    that for the poor on the south side next to the farm buildings. The monks are
                    lodged in a guest-house built against the north wall of the church. The group of
                    buildings connected with the material wants of the establishment is placed to
                    the south and west of the church, and is distinctly separated from the monastic
                    buildings. The kitchen, buttery, and offices, are reached by a passage from the
                    west end of the refectory, and are connected with the bakehouse and brewhouse,
                    which are placed still further away. The whole of the southern and western sides
                    is devoted to workshops, stables, and farm-buildings. The buildings, with some
                    exceptions, seem to have been of one story only, and all but the church were
                    probably erected of wood. The whole includes thirty-three separate blocks. The
                    church (D) is cruciform, with a nave of nine bays, and a semicircular apse at
                    either extremity. That to the west is surrounded by a semicircular colonnade,
                    leaving an open “Paradise” (E) between it and the wall of the church. The whole
                    area is divided by screens into various chapels. The high altar (A) stands
                    immediately to the east of the transept, or ritual choir; the altar of St Paul
                    (B) in the eastern, and that of St Peter (C) in the western apse. A cylindrical
                    campanile stands detached from the church on either side of the western apse
                    (FF).</p>
                <p>The “cloister court” (G) on the south side of the nave of the church has on its
                    east side the “pisalis” or “calefactory” (H),the common sitting-room of the
                    brethren, warmed by flues beneath the floor. On this side in later monasteries
                    we invariably find the chapter-house, the absence of which in this plan is
                    somewhat surprising. It appears, however from the inscriptions on the plan
                    itself, that the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n28/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0028-0013"/> north walk of the cloisters served for the
                    purposes of a chapter-house, and was fitted up with benches on the long sides.
                    Above the calefactory is the “dormitory” opening into the south transept of the
                    church, to enable the monks to attend the nocturnal services with readiness. A
                    passage at the other end leads to the “necessarium” (I), a portion of the
                    monastic buildings always planned with extreme care. The southern side is
                    occupied by the “refectory” (K), from the west end of which by a vestibule the
                    kitchen (L) is reached. This is separated from the main buildings of the
                    monastery, and is connected by a long passage with a building containing the
                    bakehouse and brewhouse (M), and the sleeping-rooms of the servants. The upper
                    story of the refectory is the “vestiarium,” where the ordinary clothes of the
                    brethren were kept. On the western side of the cloister is another two story
                    building (N). The cellar is below, and the larder and store-room above. Between
                    this building and the church, opening by one door into the cloisters, and by
                    another to the outer part of the monastery area, is the “parlour” for interviews
                    with visitors from the external world (O). On the eastern side of the north
                    transept is the “scriptorium” or writing-room (P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>),
                    with the library above.</p>
                <p>To the east of the church stands a group of buildings comprising two miniature
                    conventual establishments, each complete in itself. Each has a covered cloister
                    surrounded by the usual buildings, i.e., refectory, dormitory, &amp;c., and a
                    church or chapel on one side, placed back to back. A detached building belonging
                    to each contains a bath and a kitchen. One of these diminutive convents is
                    appropriated to the “oblati” or novices (Q), the other to the sick monks as an
                    “infirmary” (R).</p>
                <p>The “residence of the physicians” (S) stands contiguous to the infirmary, and the
                    physic garden (T) at the north-east corner of the monastery. Besides other
                    rooms, it contains a drug store, and a chamber for those who are dangerously
                    ill. The “house for blood-letting and purging” adjoins it on the west (U).</p>
                <p>The “outer school,” to the north of the convent area, contains a large
                    school-room divided across the middle by a screen or partition, and surrounded
                    by fourteen little rooms, termed the dwellings of the scholars. The
                    head-master’s house (W) is opposite, built against the side wall of the church.
                    The two “hospitia” or “guest-houses” for the entertainment of strangers of
                    different degrees (X <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> X <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>) comprise a large common chamber or refectory in the centre, surrounded
                    by sleeping apartments. Each is provided with its own brewhouse and bakehouse,
                    and that for travellers of a superior order has a kitchen and store-room, with
                    bed-rooms for their servants, and stables for their horses. There is also an
                    “hospitium” for strange monks, abutting on the north wall of the church (Y).</p>
                <p>Beyond the cloister, at the extreme verge of the convent area to the south,
                    stands the “factory” (Z), containing workshops for shoemakers, saddlers (or
                    shoemakers, <hi rend="italic">sellarii),</hi> cutlers and grinders,
                    trencher-makers, tanners, curriers, fullers, smiths, and goldsmiths, with their
                    dwellings in the rear. On this side we also find the farm-buildings, the large
                    granary and threshing-floor (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), mills (<hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi>), malt-house (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>). Facing the west are the stables
                    (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>), ox-sheds <hi rend="italic">(f),</hi> goat-stables
                    <hi rend="italic">(g),</hi> piggeries (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>), sheep-folds
                    (i), together with the servants’ and labourers’ quarters (<hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi>). At the southeast corner we find the hen and duck house, and
                    poultry-yard <hi rend="italic">(m),</hi> and the dwelling of the keeper (<hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi>). Hard by is the kitchen garden (o), the beds bearing the
                    names of the vegetables growing in them, onions, garlic, celery, lettuces,
                    poppy, carrots, cabbages, &amp;c., eighteen in all. In the same way the physic
                    garden presents the names of the medicinal herbs, and the cemetery (<hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi>) those of the trees, apple, pear, plum, quince, &amp;c.,
                    planted there.</p>
                <p>It is evident, from this most curious and valuable document, that by the 9th
                    century monastic establishments had become wealthy, and had acquired
                    considerable importance, and were occupying a leading place in education,
                    agriculture, and the industrial arts. The influence such an institution would
                    diffuse through a wide district would be no less beneficial than powerful.</p>

                    Benedictine monastery in the 12th century, and enables us to compare it with
                    that of the 9th, as seen at St Gall. We see in both the same general principles
                    of arrangement, which indeed belong to all Benedictine monasteries, enabling us
                    to determine with precision the disposition of the various buildings, when
                    little more than fragments of the walls exist. From some local reasons, however,
                    the cloister and monastic buildings are placed on the north, instead, as is far
                    more commonly the case, on the south of the church. There is also a separate
                    chapter-house, which is wanting at St Gall.</p>
                <p>The buildings at Canterbury, as at St Gall, form separate groups. The church
                    forms the nucleus. In immediate contact with this, on the north side, lie the
                    cloister and the group of buildings devoted to the monastic life. Outside of
                    these, to the west and east, are the “halls and chambers devoted to the exercise
                    of hospitality, with which every monastery was provided, for the purpose of
                    receiving as guests persons who visited it, whether clergy or laity, travellers,
                    pilgrims, or paupers.” To the north a large open court divides the monastic from
                    the menial buildings, intentionally placed as remote as possible from the
                    conventual buildings proper, the stables, granaries, barn, bakehouse, brewhouse,
                    laundries, &amp;c., inhabited by the lay servants of the establishment. At the
                    greatest possible distance from the church, beyond the precinct of the convent,
                    is the eleemosynary department. The <hi rend="italic">almonry</hi> for the
                    relief of the poor, with a great hall annexed, forms the pauper’s hospitium.</p>
                <p>The most important group of buildings is naturally that devoted to monastic life.
                    This includes two cloisters, the great cloister surrounded by the buildings
                    essentially connected with the daily life of the monks,—the church to the south,
                    the refectory or frater-house here as always on the side opposite to the church,
                    and furthest removed from it, that no sound or smell of eating might penetrate
                    its sacred precincts, to the east the dormitory, raised on a vaulted undercroft,
                    and the chapter-house adjacent, and the lodgings of the cellarer to the west. To
                    this officer was committed the provision of the monks’ daily food, as well as
                    that of the guests. He was, therefore, appropriately lodged in the immediate
                    vicinity of the refectory and kitchen, and close to the guest-hall. A passage
                    under the dormitory leads eastwards to the smaller or infirmary cloister,
                    appropriated to the sick and infirm monks. Eastward of this cloister extend the
                    hall and chapel of the infirmary, resembling in form and arrangement the nave
                    and chancel of an aisled church. Beneath the dormitory, looking out into the
                    green court or herbarium, lies the “pisalis” or “calefactory,” the common room
                    of the monks. At its northeast corner access was given from the dormitory to the
                    <hi rend="italic">necessarium,</hi> a portentous edifice in the form of a Norman
                    hall, 145 feet long by 25 broad, containing fifty-five seats. It was, in common
                    with all such offices in ancient monasteries, constructed with the most careful
                    regard to cleanliness and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n29/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0029-0014"/> health, a stream of water running through it from
                    end to end. A second smaller dormitory runs from east to west for the
                    accommodation of the conventual officers, who were bound to sleep in the
                    dormitory. Close to the refectory, but outside the cloisters, are the domestic
                    offices connected with it; to the north, the kitchen, 47 feet square, surmounted
                    by a lofty pyramidal roof, and the kitchen court; to the west, the butteries,
                    pantries, &amp;c. The infirmary had a small kitchen of its own. Opposite the
                    refectory door in the cloister are two lavatories, an invariable adjunct to a
                    monastic dining-hall, at which the monks washed before and after taking
                    food.</p>
                <p>The buildings devoted to hospitality were divided into three groups. The prior’s
                    group “entered at the south-east angle of the green court, placed near the most
                    sacred part of the cathedral, as befitting the distinguished ecclesiastics or
                    nobility who were assigned to him.” The cellarer’s buildings, were near the west
                    end of the nave, in which ordinary visitors of the middle class were hospitably
                    entertained. The inferior pilgrims and paupers were relegated to the north hall
                    or almonry, just within the gate, as far as possible from the other two.</p>
                <p>Westminster Abbey is another example of a great Benedictine abbey, identical in
                    its general arrangements, so far as they can be traced, with those described
                    above. The cloister and monastic buildings lie to the south side of the church.
                    Parallel to the nave, on the south side of the cloister, was the refectory, with
                    its lavatory at the door. On the eastern side we find the remains of the
                    dormitory, raised on a vaulted substructure, and communicating with the south
                    transept. The chapter-house opens out of the same alley of the cloister. The
                    small cloister lies to the south-east of the larger cloister, and still farther
                    to the east we have the remains of the infirmary, with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >table hall,</hi> the refectory of those who were able to leave their chambers.
                    The abbot’s house formed a small court-yard at the west entrance, close to the
                    inner gateway. Considerable portions of this remain, including the abbot’s
                    parlour, celebrated as “the Jerusalem Chamber,” his hall, now used for the
                    Westminster King’s scholars, and the kitchen and butteries beyond.</p>
                <p>St Mary’s Abbey, York, of which the ground-plan is annexed, exhibits the usual
                    Benedictine arrangements. The precincts are surrounded by a strong fortified
                    wall on three sides, the river Ouse being sufficient protection on the fourth
                    side. The entrance was by a strong gateway (U) to the north. Close to the
                    entrance was a chapel, where is now the church of St Olaf (W), in which the new
                    comers paid their devotions immediately on their arrival. Near the gate to the
                    south was the guest’s-hall or hospitium (T). The buildings are completely
                    ruined, but enough remains to enable us to identify the grand cruciform church
                    (A), the cloister-court with the chapter-house (B), the refectory (I), the
                    kitchen-court with its offices (K, O, O), and the other principal apartments.
                    The infirmary has perished completely.</p>
                <p>Some Benedictine houses display exceptional arrangements, dependent upon local
                    circumstances, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the dormitory of Worcester runs from
                    east to west, from the west walk of the cloister, and that of Durham is built
                    over the west, instead of as usual, over the east walk; but, as a general rule,
                    the arrangements deduced from the examples described may be regarded as
                    invariable.</p>
                <p>The history of Monasticism is one of alternate periods of decay and revival. With
                    growth in popular esteem came increase in material wealth, leading to luxury and
                    worldliness. The first religious ardour cooled, the strictness of the rule was
                    relaxed, until by the 10th century the decay of discipline was so complete in
                    France that the monks are said to have been frequently unacquainted with the
                    rule of St Benedict, and even ignorant that they were bound by any rule at all.
                    (Robertson’s <hi rend="italic">Church History,</hi> ii. p. 538.) These
                    alternations are reflected in the monastic buildings and the arrangements of the
                    establishment.</p>
                <p>The reformation of these prevalent abuses generally took the form of the
                    establishment of new monastic orders, with new and more stringent rules,
                    requiring a modification of the architectural arrangements. One of the earliest
                    of these reformed orders was the <hi rend="italic">Cluniac.</hi> This order took
                    its name from the little village of Clugny, 12 miles N.W, of Macon, near which,
                    about <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 909, a reformed Benedictine abbey was
                    founded by William, Duke of Auvergne, under Berno, abbot of Beaume. He was
                    succeeded by Odo, who is often regarded as the founder of the order. The fame of
                    Clugny spread far and wide. Its rigid rule was adopted by a vast number of the
                    old Benedictine abbeys, who placed themselves in affiliation to the mother
                    society, while new foundations sprang up in large numbers, all owing allegiance
                    to the “archabbot,” established at Clugny. By the end of the 12th century the
                    number of monasteries affiliated to Clugny in the various countries of Western
                    Europe amounted to 2000. The monastic establishment of Clugny was one of the
                    most extensive and magnificent in France. We may form some idea of its enormous
                    dimensions from the fact recorded, that when, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>

                    two generals of the Carthusians and Cistercians, the king (St Louis), und three
                    of his sons, the queen mother, Baldwin, Count of Flanders and Emperor of
                    Constantinople, the Duke of Burgundy, and six lords, visited the abbey, the
                    whole party, with their attendants, were lodged within the monastery without
                    disarranging the monks, 400 in number. Nearly the whole of the abbey buildings,
                    including the magnificent church, were swept away at the close of the last
                    century. When the annexed ground-plan was taken, shortly before its destruction,
                    nearly all the monastery, with the exception of the church, had been rebuilt.
                    The church, the ground-plan of which bears a remarkable resemblance to that of
                    Lincoln Cathedral, was of vast dimensions. It was 656 feet by 130 feet wide. The
                    nave was 102 feet, and the aisles 60 feet high. The nave (G) had double vaulted
                    aisles on either side. Like Lincoln, it had an eastern as well as a western
                    transept, each furnished with apsidal chapels to the east. The western transept
                    was 213 feet long, and the eastern 123 feet. The choir terminated in a
                    semicircular apse (F), surrounded by five chapels, also semicircular. The
                    western entrance was approached by an ante-church, or <hi rend="italic">narthex
                    (</hi> B <hi rend="italic">),</hi> itself an aisled church of no mean
                    dimensions, flanked by two towers, rising from a stately flight of steps bearing
                    a large stone cross. To the south of the church lay the cloister-court (H), of
                    immense size, placed much further to the west than is usually the case. On the
                    south side of the cloister stood the refectory (P), an immense building, 100
                    feet long and 60 feet wide, accommodating six longitudinal and three transverse
                    rows of tables. It was adorned with the portraits of the chief benefactors of
                    the abbey, and with Scriptural subjects. The end wall displayed the Last
                    Judgment. We are unhappily unable to identify any other of the principal
                    buildings (N). The abbot’s residence (K), still partly standing, adjoined the
                    entrance gate. The guest-house (L) was close by. The bakehouse</p>
                <p>(M), also remaining, is a detached building of immense size. The first English
                    house of the Cluniac order was that of Lewes, founded by the Earl of Warren, <hi
                    rend="italic">cir.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1077. Of this only a few
                    fragments of the domestic buildings exist. The best preserved Cluniac houses in
                    England are Castle Acre, Norfolk, and Wenlock, in Shropshire. Ground-plans of
                    both are given in Britton’s <hi rend="italic">Architectural Antiquities.</hi>
                    They show several departures from the Benedictine arrangement. In each the
                    prior’s house is remarkably perfect. All Cluniac houses in England were French
                    colonies, governed by priors of that nation. They did not secure their
                    independence nor become “abbeys” till the reign of Henry VI. The Cluniac
                    revival, with all its brilliancy, was but short lived. The celebrity of this, as
                    of other orders, worked its moral ruin. With their growth in wealth and dignity
                    the Cluniac foundations became as worldly in life and as relaxed in discipline
                    as their predecessors, and a fresh reform was needed. The next great monastic
                    revival, the Cistercian, arising in the last years of the 11th century, had a
                    wider diffusion, and a longer and more honourable existence. Owing its real
                    origin, as a distinct foundation of reformed Benedictines, in the year 1098, to
                    a countryman of our own, Stephen Harding (a native of Dorsetshire, educated in
                    the monastery of Sherborne), and deriving its name from Citeaux <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cistercium),</hi> a desolate and almost inaccessible forest
                    solitude, on the borders of Champagne and Burgundy, the rapid growth and wide
                    celebrity of the order is undoubtedly to be attributed to the enthusiastic piety
                    of St Bernard, abbot of the first of the monastic colonies, subsequently sent
                    forth in such quick succession by the first Cistercian houses, the far-famed
                    abbey of Clairvaux (de Clara Valle), <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1116.</p>
                <p>The rigid self-abnegation, which was the ruling principle of this reformed
                    congregation of the Benedictine order, extended itself to the churches and other
                    buildings erected by them. The characteristic of the Cistercian abbeys was the
                    extremest simplicity and a studied plainness. Only one tower—a central one—was
                    permitted, and that was to be very low. Unnecessary pinnacles and turrets were
                    prohibited. The triforium was omitted. The windows were to be plain and
                    undivided, and it was forbidden to decorate them with stained glass. All
                    needless ornament was proscribed. The crosses must be of wood; the candlesticks
                    of iron. The renunciation of the world was to be evidenced in all that met the
                    eye. The same spirit manifested itself in the choice of the sites of their
                    monasteries. The more dismal, the more savage, the more hopeless a spot
                    appeared, the more did it please their rigid mood. But they came not merely as
                    ascetics, but as improvers. The Cistercian monasteries are, as a rule, found
                    placed in deep well-watered valleys. They always stand on the border of a
                    stream; not rarely, as at Fountains, the buildings extend over it. These
                    valleys, now so rich and productive, wore a very different aspect when the
                    brethren first chose them as the place of their retirement. Wide swamps, deep
                    morasses, tangled thickets, wild impassable forests, were their prevailing
                    features. The "Bright Valley,” <hi rend="italic">Clara</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Vallis</hi> of St Bernard, was known as the “Valley of Wormwood,” infamous as a
                    den of robbers. “It was a savage dreary solitude, so utterly barren that at
                    first Bernard and his companions were reduced to live on beech
                    leaves.”—(Milman’s <hi rend="italic">Lat. Christ.</hi> vol. iii. p. 335.)</p>
                <p>All Cistercian monasteries, unless the circumstances of the locality forbade it,
                    were arranged according to one plan. The general arrangement and distribution of
                    the various buildings, which went to make up one of these vast establishments,
                    may be gathered from that of St Bernard’s own Abbey of Clairvaux, which is here
                    given.</p>
                <p>It will be observed that the abbey precincts are surrounded by a strong wall,
                    furnished at intervals with watchtowers<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n31/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0031-0016"/> and other defensive works. The wall is nearly
                    encircled by a stream of water, artificially diverted from the small rivulets
                    which flow through the precincts, furnishing the establishment with an abundant
                    supply in every part, for the irrigation of the gardens and orchards, the
                    sanitary requirements of the brotherhood, and for the use of the offices and
                    workshops. The precincts are divided across the centre by a wall, running from
                    N. to S., into an outer and inner ward,—the former containing the menial, the
                    latter the monastic buildings. The precincts are entered by a gateway (P), at
                    the extreme western extremity, giving admission to the lower ward. Here the
                    barns, granaries, stables, shambles, workshops, and workmen’s lodgings were
                    placed, without any regard to symmetry, convenience being the only
                    consideration. Advancing eastwards, we have before us the wall separating the
                    outer and inner ward, and the gatehouse (D) affording communication between the
                    two. On passing through the gateway, the outer court of the inner ward was
                    entered, with the western <hi rend="italic">façade</hi> of the monastic church
                    in front. Immediately on the right of entrance was the abbot’s house (G), in
                    close proximity to the guest-house (F). On the other side of the court were the
                    stables, for the accommodation of the horses of the guests and their attendants
                    (H). The church occupied a central position. To the south were the great
                    cloister (A), surrounded by the chief monastic buildings, and further to the
                    east the smaller cloister, opening out of which were the infirmary, novices’
                    lodgings, and quarters for the aged monks. Still further to the east, divided
                    from the monastic buildings by a wall, were the vegetable gardens and orchards,
                    and tank for fish. The large fish-ponds, an indispensable adjunct to any
                    ecclesiastical foundation, on the formation of which the monks lavished extreme
                    care and pains, and which often remain as almost the only visible traces of
                    these vast establishments, were placed outside the abbey walls.</p>
                <p>The Plan No. 2 furnishes the ichnography of the distinctly monastic buildings on
                    a larger scale. The usually unvarying arrangement of the Cistercian houses
                    allows us to accept this as a type of the monasteries of this order. The church
                    (A) is the chief feature. It consists of a vast nave of eleven bays, entered by
                    a narthex, with a transept and short apsidal choir. (It may be remarked that the
                    eastern limb in all unaltered Cistercian churches is remarkably short, and
                    usually square.) To the east of each limb of the transept are two square
                    chapels, divided according to Cistercian rule by solid walls. Nine radiating
                    chapels, similarly divided, surround the apse. The stalls of the monks, forming
                    the ritual choir, occupy the four eastern bays of the nave. There was a second
                    range of stalls in the extreme western bays of the nave for the <hi
                    rend="italic">fratres conversi,</hi> or lay brothers. To the south of the
                    church, so as to secure as much sun as possible, the cloister was invariably
                    placed, except when local reasons forbade it. Round the cloister (B) were ranged
                    the buildings connected with the monks’ daily life. The chapter-house (C) always
                    opened out of the east walk of the cloister in a line with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n32/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0032-0017"/> south transept. In Cistercian houses this was
                    quadrangular, and was divided by pillars and arches into two or three aisles.
                    Between it and the transept we find the sacristy (X), and a small book room (Y),
                    <hi rend="italic">armariolum,</hi> where the brothers deposited the volumes
                    borrowed from the library. On the other side of the chapter-house, to the south,
                    is a passage (D) communicating with the courts and buildings beyond. This was
                    sometimes known as the <hi rend="italic">parlour,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >colloquii</hi><hi rend="italic">locus,</hi> the monks having the privilege of
                    conversation here. Here also, when discipline became relaxed, traders, who had
                    the liberty of admission, were allowed to display their goods. Beyond this we
                    often find the <hi rend="italic">calefactorium</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >day-room—</hi> an apartment warmed by flues beneath the pavement, where the
                    brethren, half frozen during the night offices, betook themselves after the
                    conclusion of lauds, to gain a little warmth, grease their sandals, and get
                    themselves ready for the work of the day. In the plan before us this apartment
                    (E) opens from the south cloister walk, adjoining the refectory. The place
                    usually assigned to it is occupied by the vaulted substructure of the <hi
                    rend="italic">dormitory</hi> (Z). The <hi rend="italic">dormitory,</hi> as a
                    rule, was placed on the east side of the cloister, running over the <hi
                    rend="italic">calefactory</hi> and <hi rend="italic">chapter-house,</hi> and
                    joined the south transept, where a flight of steps admitted the brethren into
                    the church for nocturnal services. Opening out of the dormitory was always the
                    <hi rend="italic">necessarium,</hi> planned with the greatest regard to health
                    and cleanliness, a water-course invariably running from end to end. The
                    refectory opens out of the south cloister at (G). The position of the refectory
                    is usually a marked point of difference between Benedictine and Cistercian
                    abbeys. In the former, as at Canterbury, the refectory ran east and west
                    parallel to the nave of the church, on the side of the cloister furthest removed
                    from it. In the Cistercian monasteries, to keep the noise and sound of dinner
                    still further away from the sacred building, the refectory was built north and
                    south, at right angles to the axis of the church. It was often divided,
                    sometimes into two, sometimes, as here, into three aisles. Outside the refectory
                    door, in the cloister, was the <hi rend="italic">lavatory,</hi> where the monks
                    washed their hands at dinner time. The buildings belonging to the material life
                    of the monks lay near the refectory, as far as possible from the church, to the
                    S.W. With a distinct entrance from the outer court was the kitchen court (F),
                    with its buttery, scullery, and larder, and the important adjunct of a stream of
                    running water. Further to the west, projecting beyond the line of the west front
                    of the church, were vast vaulted apartments (SS), serving as cellars and
                    storehouses, above which was the dormitory of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >conversi.</hi> Detached from these, and separated entirely from the monastic
                    buildings, were various workshops, which convenience required to be banished to
                    the outer precincts, a saw-mill and oil-mill (UU) turned by water, and a
                    currier’s shop (V), where the sandals and leathern girdles of the monks were
                    made and repaired.</p>
                <p>Returning to the cloister, a vaulted passage admitted to the small cloister (I),
                    opening from the north side of which were eight small cells, assigned to the
                    scribes employed in copying works for the library, which was placed in the upper
                    story, accessible by a turret staircase. To the south of the small cloister a
                    long hall will be noticed. This was a <hi rend="italic">lecture-hall,</hi> or
                    rather a hall for the religious disputations customary among the Cistercians.
                    From this cloister opened the <hi rend="italic">infirmary</hi> (K), with its
                    hall, chapel, cells, blood-letting house, aud other dependencies. At the eastern
                    verge of the vast group of buildings we find the <hi rend="italic">novices'
                    lodgings</hi> (L), with a third cloister near the novices’ quarters and the
                    original guest-house (M). Detached from the great mass of the monastic edifices
                    was the original abbot’s house (N), with its dining-hall (P). Closely adjoining
                    to this, so that the eye of the father of the whole establishment should be
                    constantly over those who stood the most in need of his watchful care,—those who
                    were training for the monastic life, and those who had worn themselves out in
                    its duties,—was a fourth cloister (O), with annexed buildings, devoted to the
                    aged and infirm members of the establishment. The cemetery, the last
                    resting-place of the brethren, lay to the north side of the nave of the church
                    (H).</p>
                <p>It will be seen that the arrangement of a Cistercian monastery was in accordance
                    with a clearly-defined system, and admirably adapted to its purpose.</p>
                <p>The base court nearest to the outer wall contained the buildings belonging to the
                    functions of the body as agriculturalists and employers of labour. Advancing
                    into the inner court, the buildings devoted to hospitality are found close to
                    the entrance; while those connected with the supply of the material wants of the
                    brethren,—the kitchen, cellars, &amp;c.,—form a court of themselves outside the
                    cloister, and quite detached from the church. The church refectory, dormitory,
                    and other buildings belonging to the professional life of the brethren, surround
                    the great cloister. The small cloister beyond, with its scribes’ cells, library,
                    hall for disputations, &amp;c., is the centre of the literary life of the
                    community. The requirements of sickness and old age are carefully provided for
                    in the infirmary cloister, and that for the aged and infirm members of the
                    establishment. The same group contains the quarters of the novices.</p>
                <p>This stereotyped arrangement is further illustrated by the accompanying bird’s
                    eye view of the mother establishment of Citeaux. A cross (A), planted on the
                    high road.</p>

                <p>directs travellers to the gate of the monastery, reached by an avenue of trees.
                    On one side of the gate-house (B) is a long building (C), probably the almonry,
                    with a dormitory above for the lower class of guests. On the other side is a
                    chapel (D). As soon as the porter heard a stranger knock at the gate, he rose,
                    saying, <hi rend="italic">Deo</hi><hi rend="italic">gratias,</hi> the
                    opportunity for the exercise of hospitality being regarded as a cause for
                    thankfulness. On opening the door he welcomed the new arrival with a blessing—
                    <hi rend="italic">Benedicite.</hi> He fell on his knees before him, and then
                    went to inform the abbot. However important the abbot’s occupations might be, he
                    at once hastened to receive him whom heaven had sent. He also threw himself at
                    his guest’s feet, and conducted him to the chapel (D) purposely built close to
                    the gate. After a short prayer, the abbot committed the guest to the care of the
                    brother hospitaller, whose duty it was to provide for his wants, and conduct the
                    beast on which he might be riding to the stable (F), built adjacent to the inner
                    gate-house (E). This inner gate conducted into the base court (T), round which
                    were placed the barns, stables, cow-sheds, &amp;c. On the eastern side stood the
                    dormitory of the lay brothers, <hi rend="italic">fratres conversi</hi> (G),
                    detached from the cloister, with cellars and storehouses below. At (H), also
                    outside the monastic buildings proper, was the abbot’s house, and annexed to it
                    the guest-house. For these buildings there was a separate door of entrance into
                    the church (S). The large cloister, with its surrounding arcades, is seen at V.
                    On the south end projects the refectory (K), with its kitchen at (I), accessible
                    from the base court. The long gabled building on the east side of the cloister
                    contained on the ground floor the chapter-house and calefactory, with the monks’
                    dormitory above (M), communicating with the south transept of the church. At (L)
                    was the staircase to the dormitory. The small cloister is at (W), where were the
                    <hi rend="italic">carols</hi> or cells of the scribes, with the library (P)
                    over, reached by a turret staircase. At (R) we see a portion of the infirmary.
                    The whole precinct is surrounded by a strong buttressed wall (XXX), pierced with
                    arches, through which streams of water are introduced. It will be noticed that
                    the choir of the church is short, and has a square end instead of the usual
                    apse. The tower, in accordance with the Cistercian rule, is very low. The
                    windows throughout accord with the studied simplicity of the order.</p>
                <p>The English Cistercian houses, of which there are such extensive and beautiful
                    remains at Fountains, Rievaulx, Kirkstall, Tintern, Netley, &amp;c., were mainly
                    arranged after the same plan, with slight local variations. As an example, we
                    give the ground-plan of Kirkstall Abbey, which is one of the best preserved and
                    least altered. The church here is of the Cistercian type, with a short chancel
                    of two squares, and transepts with three eastward chapels to each, divided by
                    solid walls (2 2 2). The whole is of the most studied plainness. The windows are
                    unornamented, and the nave has no triforium. The cloister to the south (4)
                    occupies the whole length of the nave. On the east side stands the two-aisled
                    chapter house (5), between which and the south transept is a small sacristy (3),
                    and on the other side two small apartments, one of which was probably the
                    parlour (6). Beyond this stretches southward the calefactory or day-room of the
                    monks (14). Above this whole range of building runs the monks’ dormitory,
                    opening by stairs into the south transept of the church. At the other end were
                    the necessaries. On the south side of the cloister we have the remains of the
                    old refectory (11), running, as in Benedictine houses, from east to west, and
                    the new refectory (12), which, with the increase of the inmates of the house,
                    superseded it, stretching, as is usual in Cistercian houses, from north to
                    south. Adjacent to this apartment are the remains of the kitchen, pantry, and
                    buttery. The arches of the lavatory are to be seen near the refectory entrance.
                    The western side of the cloister is, as usual, occupied by vaulted cellars,
                    supporting on the upper story the dormitory of the lay brothers (8). Extending
                    from the south-east angle of the main group of buildings are the walls and
                    foundations of a secondary group of considerable extent. These have been
                    identified either with the hospitium or with the abbot’s house, but they occupy
                    the position in Which the infirmary is more usually found. The hall was a very
                    spacious apartment, measuring 83 feet in length by 48 feet 9 inches in breadth,
                    and was divided by two rows of columns. The fish-ponds lay between the monastery
                    and the river to the south. The abbey mill was situated about 80 yards to the
                    north-west, The mill-pool may be distinctly traced, together with the gowt or
                    mill stream.</p>
                <p>Fountains Abbey, first founded <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1132, deserves
                    special notice, as one of the largest and best preserved Cistercian houses in
                    England. But the earlier buildings received considerable additions and
                    alterations in the later period of the order, causing deviations from the strict
                    Cistercian type. The church stands a short distance to the north of the river
                    Skell, the buildings of the abbey stretching down to and even across the stream.
                    We have the cloister (H) to the south, with the three-aisled chapter-house (I)
                    and calefactory (L) opening from its eastern walk, and the refectory (S), with
                    the kitchen (Q) and buttery (T) attached, at right angles to its southern walk,
                    Parallel with the western walk is an immense vaulted substructure (U),
                    incorrectly styled the cloisters, serving as cellars and store-rooms, and
                    supporting the dormitory of the <hi rend="italic">conversi</hi> above. This
                    building extended across the river. At its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n34/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0034-0019"/> S.W. corner were the necessaries (V), also built,
                    as usual, above the swiftly flowing stream. The monks’ dormitory was in its
                    usual position above the chapter-house, to the south of the transept. As
                    peculiarities of arrangement may be noticed the position of the kitchen (Q),
                    between the refectory and calefactory, and of the infirmary (W) (unless there is
                    some error in its designation) above the river to the west, adjoining the
                    guest-houses (XX). We may also call attention to the greatly lengthened choir,
                    commenced by Abbot John of York, 1203-1211, and carried on by his successor,
                    terminating, like Durham Cathedral, in an eastern transept, the work of Abbot
                    John of Kent, 1220- 1247, and to the tower (D), added not long before the
                    dissolution by Abbot Huby, 1494-1526, in a very unusual position at the northern
                    end of the north transept. The abbot’s house, the largest and most remarkable
                    example of this class of buildings in the kingdom, stands south to the east of
                    the church and cloister, from which it is divided by the kitchen court
                    (K),surrounded by the ordinary domestic offices. A considerable portion of this
                    house was erected on arches over the Skell. The size and character of this
                    house, probably, at the time of its erection, the most spacious house of a
                    subject in the kingdom, not a castle, bespeaks the wide departure of the
                    Cistercian order from the stern simplicity of the original foundation. The hall
                    (2) was one of the most spacious and magnificent apartments in mediaeval times,
                    measuring 170 feet by 70 feet Like the hall in the castle at Winchester, and
                    Westminster Hall, as originally built, it was divided by 18 pillars and arches,
                    with 3 aisles. Among other apartments, for the designation of which we must
                    refer to the ground-plan, was a domestic oratory or chapel, 46½ feet by 23 feet,
                    and a kitchen (7), 50 feet by 38 feet. The whole arrangements and character of
                    the building bespeak the rich and powerful feudal lord, not the humble father of
                    a body of hardworking brethren, bound by vows to a life of poverty and
                    self-denying toil. In the words of Dean Milman, “the superior, once a man bowed
                    to the earth with humility, care-worn, pale, emaciated, with a coarse habit
                    bound with a cord, with naked feet, had become an abbot on his curvetting
                    palfrey, in rich attire, with his silver cross before him, travelling to take
                    his place amid the lordliest of the realm.”— <hi rend="italic">(Lat.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Christ.,</hi> vol. iii. p. 330.)</p>
                <p>The buildings of the <hi rend="italic">Austin Canons</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Black Canons</hi> (so called from the colour of their habit) present few
                    distinctive peculiarities. This order had its first seat in England at
                    Colchester, where a house for Austin Canons was founded about <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1105, and it very soon spread widely. As an order of
                    regular clergy, holding a middle position between monks and secular canons,
                    almost resembling a community of parish priests living under rule, they adopted
                    naves of great length to accommodate large congregations. The choir is usually
                    long, and is sometimes, as at Llanthony and Christ Church (Twynham), shut off
                    from the aisles, or, as at Bolton, Kirkham, &amp;c., is destitute of aisles
                    altogether. The nave in the northern houses, not unfrequently, had only a north
                    aisle, as at Bolton, Brinkburn, and Lanercost. The arrangement of the monastic
                    buildings followed the ordinary type. The prior’s lodge was almost invariably
                    attached to the S.W. angle of the nave. The annexed plan of the Abbey of St
                    Augustine’s at Bristol, now the cathedral church of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n35/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0035-0020"/> that city, shows the arrangement of the
                    buildings, which departs very little from the ordinary Benedictine type. The
                    Austin Canons’ house at Thornton, in Lincolnshire, is remarkable for the size
                    and magnificence of its gate-house, the upper floors of which formed the
                    guest-house of the establishment, and for possessing an octagonal chapter-house
                    of Decorated date.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Preτnonstratensian</hi> regular canons, or White Canons,
                    had as many as 35 houses in England, of which the most perfect remaining are
                    those of Easby, Yorkshire, and Bayham, Sussex. The head house of the order in
                    England was Welbeck. This order was a reformed branch of the Austin canons,
                    founded, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1119, by Norbert (born at Xanten, on the
                    Lower Rhine, c. 1080) at Prémontré, a secluded marshy valley in the forest of
                    Coucy, in the diocese of Laon. The order spread widely. Even in the founder’s
                    lifetime it possessed houses in Syria and Palestine. It long maintained its
                    rigid austerity, till in the course of years wealth impaired its discipline, and
                    its members sank into indolence and luxury. The Premonstratensians were brought
                    to England shortly after <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1140, and were first
                    settled at Newhouse, in Lincolnshire, near the Humber. The ground-plan of Easby
                    Abbey, owing to its situation on the edge of the steeply-sloping banks of a
                    river, is singularly irregular. The cloister is duly placed on the south side of
                    the church, and the chief buildings occupy their usual positions round it. But
                    the cloister garth, as at Chichester, is not rectangular, and all the
                    surrounding buildings are thus made to sprawl in a very awkward fashion. The
                    church follows the plan adopted by the Austin canons in their northern abbeys,
                    and has only one aisle to the nave—that to the north; while the choir is long,
                    narrow, and aisleless. Each transept has an aisle to the east, forming three
                    chapels.</p>
                <p>The church at Bayham was destitute of aisle either to nave or choir. The latter
                    terminated in a three-sided apse. This church is remarkable for its exceeding
                    narrowness in proportion to its length. Extending in longitudinal dimensions 257
                    feet, it is not more than 25 feet broad. To adopt the words of Mr Beresford
                    Hope—“Stern Premonstratensian canons wanted no congregations, and cared for no
                    processions; therefore they built their church like a long room.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Carthusian</hi> order, on its establishment by St Bruno,
                    about <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1084, developed a greatly modified form and
                    arrangement of a monastic institution. The principle of this order, which,
                    combined the coenobitic with the solitary life, demanded the erection of
                    buildings on a novel plan. This plan, which was first adopted by St Bruno and
                    his twelve companions at the original institution at Chartreux, near Grenoble,
                    was maintained in all the Carthusian establishments throughout Europe, even
                    after the ascetic severity of the order had been to some extent relaxed, and the
                    primitive simplicity of their buildings had been exchanged for the magnificence
                    of decoration which characterises such foundations as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Certosas</hi> of Pavia and Florence. According to the rule of St Bruno, all the
                    members of a Carthusian brotherhood lived in the most absolute solitude and
                    silence. Each occupied a small detached cottage, standing by itself in a small
                    garden surrounded by high walls and connected by a common corridor or cloister.
                    In these cottages or cells a Carthusian monk passed his time in the strictest
                    asceticism, only leaving his solitary dwelling to attend the services of the
                    Church, except on certain days when the brotherhood assembled in the
                    refectory.</p>
                <p>The peculiarity of the arrangements of a Carthusian monastery, or <hi
                    rend="italic">charter-house,</hi> as it was called in England, from a corruption
                    of the French <hi rend="italic">chartreux,</hi> is exhibited in the plan of that
                    of Clermont, from Viollet le Duc. The whole establishment is surrounded with a
                    wall, furnished at intervals with watch towers (R). The enclosure is divided
                    into two courts, of which the eastern court, surrounded by a cloister, from
                    which the cottages of the monks (I) open, is much the larger. The two courts are
                    divided by the main buildings of the monastery, including the church, the
                    sanctuary (A), divided from (B), the monks’ choir, by a screen with two altars,
                    the smaller cloister to the south (S) surrounded by the chapter-house (E), the
                    refectory (X)—these buildings occupying their normal position—and the chapel of
                    Pontgibaud (K). The kitchen with its offices (V) lies behind the refectory,
                    accessible from the outer court without entering the cloister. To the north of
                    the church, beyond the sacristy (L), and the side chapels (M), we find the cell
                    of the sub-prior <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi>, with its garden. The lodgings of
                    the prior (G) occupy the centre of the outer court, immediately in front of the
                    west door of the church, and face the gateway of the convent (O). A small raised
                    court with a fountain (C) is before it. This outer court also contains the
                    guest-chambers (P), the stables, and lodgings of the lay brothers (N), the barns
                    and granaries (Q), the dovecot (H), and the bakehouse (T). At (Z) is the prison.
                    (In this outer court, in all the earlier foundations, as at Witham, there was a
                    smaller church in addition to the larger church of the monks.) The outer and
                    inner court are connected by a long passage (F), wide enough to admit a cart
                    laden with wood to supply the cells of the brethren with fuel. The number of
                    cells surrounding the great cloister is 18. They are all arranged on a uniform
                    plan. Each little dwelling contains three rooms: a sitting-room (C), warmed with
                    a stove in winter; a sleeping-room (D), furnished with a bed, a table, a bench,
                    and a bookcase; and a closet (E). Between the cell and the cloister gallery (A)
                    is a passage or corridor (B), cutting off the inmate of the cell from all sound
                    or movement which might interrupt his meditations. The superior had <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n36/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0036-0021"/> free access to this corridor, and through open
                    niches was able to inspect the garden without being seen. At (I) is the hatch or
                    turn-table, in which the daily allowance of food was deposited by a brother
                    appointed for that purpose, affording no view either inwards or outwards. (H) is
                    the garden, cultivated by the occupant of the cell. At (K) is the wood-house.
                    (F) is a covered walk, with the necessary at the end. These arrangements are
                    found with scarcely any variation in all the charter-houses of Western Europe.
                    The Yorkshire Charter-house of Mount Grace, founded by Thomas Holland the young
                    Duke of Surrey, nephew of Richard II., and Marshal of England, during the
                    revival of the popularity of the order, about <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    1397, is the most perfect and best preserved English example. It is
                    characterised by all the simplicity of the order. The church is a modest
                    building, long, narrow, and aisleless. Within the wall of enclosure are two
                    courts. The smaller of the two, the south, presents the usual arrangement of
                    church, refectory, &amp;c., opening out of a cloister. The buildings are plain
                    and solid. The northern court contains the cells, 14 in number. It is surrounded
                    by a double stone wall, the two walls being about 30 feet or 40 feet apart.
                    Between these, each in its own garden, stand the cells; low-built two-storied
                    cottages, of two or three rooms on the ground-floor, lighted with a larger and a
                    smaller window to the side, and provided with a doorway to the court, and one at
                    the back, opposite to one in the outer wall, through which the monk may have
                    conveyed the sweepings of his cell and the refuse of his garden to the “eremus”
                    beyond. By the side of the door to the court is a little hatch, through which
                    the daily pittance of food was supplied, so contrived by turning at an angle in
                    the wall that no one could either look in or look out. A very perfect example of
                    this hatch —an arrangement belonging to all Carthusian houses— exists at
                    Miraflores, near Burgos, which remains nearly as it was completed in 1480.</p>
                <p>There were only nine Carthusian houses in England. The earliest was that at
                    Witham in Somersetshire, founded by Henry II., by whom the order was first
                    brought into England. The wealthiest and most magnificent was that of Shene or
                    Richmond in Surrey, founded by Henry V. about <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    1414. The dimensions of the buildings at Shene are stated to have been
                    remarkably large. The great court measured 300 feet by 250 feet; the cloisters
                    were a square of 500 feet; the hall was 110 feet in length by 60 feet in
                    breadth. The most celebrated historically is the Charter-house of London,
                    founded by Sir Walter Manny <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1371. the name of
                    which is preserved by the famous public school established on the site by Thomas
                    Sutton <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1611.</p>
                <p>An article on monastic arrangements would be incomplete without some account of
                    the convents of the Mendicant or Preaching Friars, including the Black Friars or
                    Dominicans, the Grey or Franciscans, the White or Carmelites, the Eremite or
                    Austin Friars. These orders arose at the beginning of the 13th century, when the
                    Benedictines, together with their various reformed branches, had terminated
                    their active mission, and Christian Europe was ready for a new religious
                    revival. Planting themselves, as a rule, in large towns, and by preference in
                    the poorest and most densely populated districts, the Preaching Friars were
                    obliged to adapt their buildings to the requirements of the site. Regularity of
                    arrangement, therefore, was not possible, even if they had studied it. Their
                    churches, built for the reception of large congregations of hearers rather than
                    worshippers, form a class by themselves, totally unlike those of the elder
                    orders in ground-plan and character. They were usually long parallelograms
                    unbroken by transepts. The nave very usually consisted of two equal bodies, one
                    containing the stalls of the brotherhood, the other left entirely free for the
                    congregation. The constructional choir is often wanting, the whole church
                    forming one uninterrupted structure, with a continuous range of windows. The
                    east end was usually square, but the Friars Church at Winchelsea had a polygonal
                    apse. We not unfrequently find a single transept, sometimes of great size,
                    rivalling or exceeding the nave. This arrangement is frequent in Ireland, where
                    the numerous small friaries afford admirable exemplifications of these
                    peculiarities of ground-plan. The friars' churches were at first destitute of
                    towers; but in the 14th and 15th centuries, tall, slender towers were commonly
                    inserted between the nave and the choir. The Grey Friars at Lynn, where the
                    tower is hexagonal, is a good example. The arrangement of the monastic buildings
                    is equally peculiar and characteristic. We miss entirely the regularity of the
                    buildings of the earlier orders. At the Jacobins at Paris, a cloister lay to the
                    north of the long narrow church of two parallel aisles, while the refectory— a
                    room of immense length, quite detached from the cloister —stretched across the
                    area before the west front of the church. At Toulouse the nave also has two
                    parallel aisles, but the choir is apsidal, with radiating chapels. The refectory
                    stretches northwards at right angles to the cloister, which lies to the north of
                    the church, having the chapter-house and sacristy on the east. As examples of
                    English friaries, the Dominican house at Norwich, and those of the Dominicans
                    and Franciscans at Gloucester, may be mentioned. The church of the Black Friars
                    of Norwich departs from the original type in the nave (now St Andrew’s Hall), in
                    having regular aisles. In this it resembles the earlier examples of the Grey
                    Friars at Reading. The choir is long and aisleless <hi rend="italic">; an</hi>
                    hexagonal tower between the two, like that existing at Lynn, has perished. The
                    cloister and monastic buildings remain tolerably perfect to the north. The
                    Dominican convent at Gloucester still exhibits the cloistercourt, on the north
                    side of which is the desecrated church. The refectory is on the west side, and
                    on the south the dormitory of the 13th century. This is a remarkably good
                    example. There were 18 cells or cubicles on each side, divided by partitions,
                    the bases of which remain. On the east side was the prior’s house, a building of
                    later date. At the Grey or Franciscan Friars, the church followed the ordinary
                    type in having two equal bodies, each gabled, with a continuous range of
                    windows. There was a slender tower between the nave and choir. Of the convents
                    of the Carmelite or White Friars we have a good example in the Abbey of Hulme,
                    near Alnwick, the first of the order in England, founded <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> 1240. The church is a narrow <pb break="no"

                    only 26 feet wide. The cloisters are to the south, with the chapter-house,
                    &amp;c., to the east, with the dormitory over. The prior’s lodge is placed to
                    the west of the cloister. The guest-houses adjoin the entrance gateway, to which
                    a chapel was annexed on the south side of the conventual area. The nave of the
                    church of the Austin Friars or Eremites in London is still standing. It is of
                    Decorated date, and has wide centre and side aisles, divided by a very light and
                    graceful arcade. Some fragments of the south walk of the cloister of the Grey
                    Friars exist among the buildings of Christ’s Hospital or the Blue-Coat School.
                    Of the Black Friars all has perished but the name. Taken as a whole, the remains
                    of the establishments of the friars afford little warrant for the bitter
                    invective of the Benedictine of St Alban’s, Matthew Paris :—“The friars who have
                    been founded hardly 40 years have built residences as the palaces of kings.
                    These are they who, enlarging day by day their sumptuous edifices, encircling
                    them with lofty walls, lay up in them their incalculable treasures, imprudently
                    transgressing the bounds of poverty, and violating the very fundamental rules of
                    their profession.” Allowance must here be made for jealousy of a rival order
                    just rising in popularity.</p>
                <p>Every large monastery had depending upon it one or more smaller establishments
                    known as <hi rend="italic">cells.</hi> These cells were monastic colonies, sent
                    forth by the parent house, and planted on some outlying estate. As an example,
                    we may refer to the small religious house of St Mary Magdalene’s, a cell of the
                    great Benedictine house of St Mary’s, York, in the valley of the Witham, to the
                    south-east of the city of Lincoln. This consists of one long narrow range of
                    building, of which the eastern part formed the chapel, and the western contained
                    the apartments of the handful of monks of which it was the home. To the east may
                    be traced the site of the abbey mill, with its dam and mill-lead. These cells,
                    when belonging to a Cluniac house, were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Obedientioe.</hi></p>
                <p>The plan given by Viollet le Duc of the Priory of <hi rend="italic">St</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Jean des Bons Hommes,</hi> a Cluniac cell, situated between the
                    town of Avallon and the village of Savigny, shows that these diminutive
                    establishments comprised every essential feature of a monastery,—chapel,
                    cloister, chapter-room, refectory, dormitory, all grouped according to the
                    recognised arrangement.</p>
                <p>These Cluniac <hi rend="italic">obedientioe</hi> differed from the ordinary
                    Benedictine cells in being also places of punishment, to which monks who had
                    been guilty of any grave infringement of the rules were relegated as to a kind
                    of penitentiary. Here they were placed under the authority of a prior, and were
                    condemned to severe manual labour, fulfilling the duties usually executed by the
                    lay brothers, who acted as farm-servants.</p>
                <p>The outlying farming establishments belonging to the monastic foundations were
                    known as <hi rend="italic">villae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">granges.</hi> They
                    gave employment to a body of <hi rend="italic">conversi</hi> and labourers under
                    the management of a monk, who bore the title of <hi rend="italic">Brother
                    Hospitaller—</hi> the granges, like their parent institutions, affording shelter
                    and hospitality to belated travellers.</p>
