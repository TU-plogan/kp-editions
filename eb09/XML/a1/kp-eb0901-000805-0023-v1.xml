                    overthrow of the Ommiad dynasty. Merwan fled to Egypt, but was pursued and put
                    to death, and the vanquished family was treated with a severity which gained for
                    Abul-Abbas the surname of Al-Saffah, the Blood-shedder. From this time the house
                    of Abbas was fully established in the government, but the Spanish provinces were
                    lost to the empire by the erection of an independent caliphate of Cordova, under
                    Abderrahman.</p>
                <p>On the death of Abul-Abbas, Almansur succeeded to the throne, and founded Baghdad
                    as the seat of empire. He and his son Mohdi waged war successfully against the
                    Turkomans and Greeks of Asia Minor; but from this time the rule of the
                    Abbassides is marked rather by the development of the liberal arts than by
                    extension of territory. The strictness of the Mohammedan religion was relaxed,
                    and the faithful yielded to the seductions of luxury. The caliphs Harun
                    Al-Rashid (786-809) and Al-Mamun (813-833) attained a world-wide celebrity by
                    their gorgeous palaces, their vast treasures, and their brilliant and numerous
                    equipages, in all which their splendour contrasted strikingly with the poverty
                    of European sovereigns. The former is known as one of the heroes of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Arabian Nights;</hi> the latter more worthily still as a
                    liberal patron of literature and science. It is a mistake, however, to look in
                    the rule of these caliphs for the lenity of modern civilisation. “No Christian
                    government,” says Hallam, “except perhaps that of Constantinople, exhibits such
                    a series of tyrants as the caliphs of Baghdad, if deeds of blood, wrought
                    through unbridled passion or jealous policy, may challenge the name of
                    tyranny.”</p>
                <p>The territory of the Abbassides soon suffered dismemberment, and their power
                    began to decay. Rival sovereignties (Ashlabites, Edrisites, &amp;c.) arose in
                    Africa, and an independent government was constituted in Khorasan (820), under
                    the Taherites. In the West, again, the Greeks encroached upon the possessions of
                    the Saracens in Asia Minor. Ruin, however, came from a less civilised race. The
                    caliphs had continually been waging war with the Tartar hordes of Turkestan, and
                    many captives taken in these wars were dispersed throughout the empire.
                    Attracted by their bravery and fearing rebellion among his subjects, Motassem
                    (833-842), the founder of Samarah, and successful opponent of the Grecian forces
                    under Theophilus, formed bodyguards of the Turkish prisoners, who became from
                    that time the real governors of the Saracen empire. Mota-wakkel, son of
                    Motassem, was assassinated by them in the palace (861); and succeeding caliphs
                    became mere puppets in their hands. Radhi (934-941) was compelled by the
                    disorganised condition of his kingdom to delegate to Mohammed ben Rayek (936 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Emir-al-Omara,</hi> commander of the commanders, the government of the army
                    and the other functions of the caliphate. Province after province proclaimed
                    itself independent; the caliph’s rule became narrowed to Baghdad and its
                    vicinity; and the house of Abbas lost its power in the East for ever, when
                    Hulagu, prince of the Mongols, set Baghdad on fire, and slew Motassem, the
                    reigning caliph (20th Feb. 1258). The Abbassides continued to hold a semblance
                    of power in the merely nominal caliphate of Egypt, and feebly attempted to
                    recover their ancient seat. The last of them, Motawakkel III., was taken by
                    Sultan Selim I., the conqueror of Egypt, to Constantinople, and detained there
                    for some time as a prisoner. He afterwards returned to Egypt, and died at Cairo
                    a pensionary of the Ottoman government, in 1538.</p>
