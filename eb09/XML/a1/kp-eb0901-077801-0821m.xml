                    c</hi></label><hi rend="smallcaps">Λmr,</hi> one of the most famous of the first
                    race of Saracen leaders, was descended of Aasi, of the tribe of Koreish. In his
                    youth he wrote satirical verses against the person and doctrine of Mahomet. His
                    zeal in opposing the new religion prompted him to undertake an embassy to the
                    king of Ethiopia, in order to stimulate him against the converts whom he had
                    taken under his protection, but he returned a convert to the Mahometan faith,
                    and, along with Khaled, joined the fugitive prophet at Medina. When Abu-Bekr
                    resolved to make a new attack upon Syria, he entrusted Amru with a high command.
                    In this ho was so successful that he rose to the elevated station of chief in
                    Irak, when Khaled requested the attendance of all the Arabian generals before
                    Damascus. During the caliphate of Omar he also served in Palestine under
                    Abu-Obeïdah, taking the command in the siege of Caesarea, which yielded to him
                    in July G38 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> After the death of Obeïdah, Amru
                    assumed the chief command in Syria, in which he was confirmed by the caliph,
                    notwithstanding the opposition of Othman. Soon afterwards (639) he led an army
                    of 4000 Arabs into Egypt. During the progress of his march a messenger from Omar
                    arrived with a letter containing directions to return, if he should receive this
                    letter in the territories of Syria; but if he should receive it in those of
                    Egypt, he might advance, and all needful assistance would be instantly sent to
                    him. The contents of the letter were not made known to his officers until he was
                    assured that the army was on Egyptian soil, so that the expedition might be
                    continued under the sanction of Omar’s orders. Having taken Pharma, he advanced
                    to Misrah, the ancient <hi rend="italic">Memphis,</hi> and besieged it for seven
                    months. Although numerous reinforcements arrived, he would have found it very
                    difficult to storm the place previous to the inundation of the Nile, but for a
                    treacherous lessening of the forces of the citadel, which was consequently taken
                    by storm; and the Greeks who remained there were either made prisoners or put to
                    the sword. On the same spot Amru erected a city named Fostat, the ruins of which
                    are known by the name of Old Cairo. Amru pursued the Greeks to Alexandria, and
                    after an obstinate and bloody siege of fourteen months, the city was taken, 640
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> To Amru has generally been attributed the burning
                    of the famous Alexandrian library, by command of the caliph Omar. But with this
                    act of barbarism, so inconsistent with the character of Omar and his general, he
                    is for the first time charged by Abul-Faragius, a Christian writer, who lived
                    six centuries later. It is highly probable that few of the 700,000 volumes
                    collected by the Ptolemies remained at the time of the Arab conquest, when we
                    consider the various calamities of Alexandria from the time of Caesar to those
                    of Caracalla and Diocletian, and the disgraceful pillage of the library in 389
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> under the rule of a Christian bishop, Theophilus
                    (see Gibbon, c. 51). Amru died 663 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> In a pathetic
                    oration to his children on his death-bed he bitterly lamented his youthfid
                    offence in satirising the prophet, although Mahomet had forgiven him, and had
                    frequently affirmed that “there was no Mussulman more sincere and steadfast in
                    the faith than Amru.”</p>
