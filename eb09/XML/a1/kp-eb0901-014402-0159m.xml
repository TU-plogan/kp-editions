                    Μ. de Vintimille, archbishop of that province. On the translation of this
                    prelate to the archbishopric of Paris, about the year 1730, the elder Adanson
                    repaired thither with his five children, who were all provided for by their
                    father’s patron. A small canonry fell to the lot of Michel, the revenue of which
                    defrayed the expenses of his education at the college of Plessis. While there he
                    was distinguished for great quickness of apprehension, strength of memory, and
                    mental ardour; but his genius took no particular bent, until he received a
                    microscope from the celebrated Tuberville Needham, who was struck with
                    admiration of the talents and acquirements he displayed at a public examination.
                    From that time to the last hour of his life he persevered with a zeal almost
                    unexampled in the observation and study of nature. On leaving college, his
                    youthful ardour was well employed in the cabinets of Reaumur and Bernard de
                    Jussieu, as well as in the Jardin des Plantes. Such was his zeal, that he
                    repeated the instructions of the professors to his less apt fellow-students; and
                    before completing his nineteenth year he had actually described (for his own
                    improvement) 4000 species of the three kingdoms of nature. In this way he soon
                    exhausted the rich stores of accumulated knowledge in Europe; and having
                    obtained a small appointment in the colony of Senegal, he resigned his canonry,
                    and embarked on the 20th of December 1748 for Africa. Senegal, from the
                    unhealthiness of its climate, was a <hi rend="italic">terra incognita</hi> to
                    naturalists; and this determined his choice of that country as a field for
                    exploration. His ardour remained unabated during the five years of his residence
                    in Africa. He collected and described, in greater or less detail, an immense
                    number of animals and plants; collected specimens of every object of commerce;
                    delineated maps of the country; made systematic meteorological and astronomical
                    observations; and prepared grammars and dictionaries of the languages spoken on
                    the banks of the Senegal. On his return to Paris in February 1754 he found
                    himself without resources, but fortunately secured the patronage of Μ. de
                    Bombarde, who encouraged him in the publication of the scientific results of his
                    travels. In his <hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle du Sénégal</hi> (Paris,
                    1757) he made use of a small portion of the materials at his disposal; and the
                    work has a special interest from the essay on Shells, printed at the end of it,
                    where Adanson proposed his <hi rend="italic">universal method,</hi> a system of
                    classification distinct from those of Buffon and Linnaeus. He founded his
                    classification of all organised beings on the consideration of each individual
                    organ. As each organ gave birth to new relations, so he established a
                    corresponding number of arbitrary arrangements. Those beings possessing the
                    greatest number of similar organs were referred to one great division, and the
                    relationship was considered more remote in pro <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n160/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0160-0145"/> portion to the dissimilarity of organs. The chief
                    defect of this method consists in presupposing a knowledge of species and their
                    organisation altogether beyond the existing stage of knowledge. It gives,
                    however, distinct ideas of the degree of affinity subsisting between organised
                    beings, independent of all physiological science. Until the appearance of this
                    work, the Testacea had scarcely been made the subject of serious study.
                    Adanson’s methodical distribution, founded on not less than twenty of the
                    partial classifications already alluded to, is decidedly superior to that of any
                    of his predecessors. For the first time there was presented in this department
                    of natural history a classification of the animals themselves, and not merely of
                    the shells which contain them. Like every first attempt, however, it had its
                    imperfections, which arose chiefly from ignorance of the anatomical structure of
                    the animals. It was owing to this that he omitted, in his arrangement of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi> all molluscous animals without shells. He abandoned
                    his original plan of publishing his Senegal observations in eight volumes, and
                    applied himself entirely to his <hi rend="italic">Families des Plantes,</hi>
                    which he published in 1763. Here he developed the principle of arrangement above
                    mentioned, which, in its adherence to natural botanical relations, was based on
                    the system of Tournefort, and had been anticipated to some extent nearly a
                    century before by Ray. The success of this work was hindered by its innovations
                    in the use of terms, which were ridiculed by the defenders of the popular sexual
                    system of Linnaeus; but it did much to open the way for the establishment, by
                    means principally of Jussieu’s <hi rend="italic">Genera Plantarum</hi> (1789),
                    of the natural method of the classification of plants. In 1774 Adanson submitted
                    to the consideration of the Academy of Sciences an immense work, containing what
                    may be called the <hi rend="italic">universal application of his universal
                    method;</hi> for it extended to all known beings and substances. This work
                    consisted of 27 large volumes of manuscript, employed in displaying the general
                    relations of all these matters, and their distribution; 150 volumes more,
                    occupied with the alphabetical arrangement of 40,000 species; a vocabulary,
                    containing 200,000 words, with their explanations; and a number of detached
                    memoirs, 40,000 figures, and 30,000 specimens of the three kingdoms of nature.
                    The committee to which the inspection of this enormous mass was intrusted
                    strongly recommended Adanson to separate and publish all that was peculiarly his
                    own, leaving out what was merely compilation. He obstinately rejected this
                    advice; and the huge work, at which he continued to labour, was never published.
                    He had been elected a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1759, and he latterly
                    subsisted on a small pension it had conferred on him. Of this he was deprived on
                    the dissolution of the Academy by the Constituent Assembly, and was consequently
                    reduced to such a depth of poverty as to be unable to appear before the French
                    Institute when it invited him to take his place among its members. Government
                    afterwards conferred upon him a pension sufficient to relieve the simple wants
                    of the great naturalist. He died, after months of severe suffering, on the 3d of
                    August 1806, requesting, as the only decoration of his grave, a garland of
                    flowers gathered from the 58 families he had differentiated—“a touching though
                    transitory image,” says Cuvier, “of the more durable monument which he has
                    erected to himself in his works.” His zeal for science, his unwearied industry,
                    and his talents as a philosophical observer, are conspicuous in all his
                    writings. The serenity of his temper, and the unaffected goodness of his heart,
                    endeared him to the few who knew him intimately. On his return from Africa in
                    1754, he laid before the French Indian Company a scheme for the settlement of a
                    colony in Senegal, where articles of African produce might be cultivated by free
                    negroes. His propositions were unheeded by his countrymen, and by a misdirected
                    patriotism he refused to present them to the Abolitionists of England. A similar
                    feeling led him to refuse to settle in Austria, Russia, or Spain, on the
                    invitation of the sovereigns of those countries. His most important works are
                    his <hi rend="italic">Natural History of Senegal</hi> and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Families of Plants.</hi> He contributed a number of papers to the Memoirs of
                    the Academy of Sciences, on the Ship-worm, the Baobab tree (the largest tree
                    known, to which, in honour of Adanson, Linnaeus gave the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adansonia</hi><hi rend="italic">digitata),</hi> the origin of the varieties of
                    cultivated plants, gum-producing trees, and the <hi rend="italic">Oscillatoria
                    Adansonia,</hi> an animal regarded by him as a spontaneously moving plant.
                    Besides these essays, he contributed several valuable articles in natural
                    history to the earlier part of the Supplement to the first <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédie</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and he is also the reputed author of
                    an essay on the <hi rend="italic">Electricity of the Tourmaline</hi> (Paris,
                    1757), which bears the name of the Duke of Noya Caraffa.</p>
