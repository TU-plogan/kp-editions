                    theory than the practice of medicine; but he is known to have been a physician
                    at the court of Seif-Eddaula, and died when it was at Damascus in 950. Unlike
                    some of his successors, notably Avicenna, he was an ascetic, and his philosophy,
                    which has a slight Platonic infusion, bears traces of the contrast. He was
                    unsystematic, and the sketches and aphorisms of his which have come down to us
                    (many of his treatises are still in MS.) only partially enable us to reconstruct
                    his philosophy. In his opusculum <hi rend="italic">He</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Scientiis</hi> he enumerates six orders of sciences :—(1.) Language, by which
                    he means little more than grammar. (2.) Logic, which he names as an art,
                    conceives generally as a science, and confounds in its details with the
                    corresponding art, with rhetoric, and with criticism. (3.) The mathematical
                    sciences, embracing geometry, arithmetic, optics, the science of the stars,
                    music, and the sciences of weights and of capacities <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ingenia).</hi> Arithmetic is abstract and concrete; geometry is active,
                    passive, and speculative; and the science of the stars includes astronomy,
                    astrology, the science of climates, and of dreams and auguries. (4.) The natural
                    sciences, ten in number. (5.) Civil science, including judicial science and
                    rhetoric. (6.) Divine science, or metaphysics. This hierarchy has striking
                    approximations to the most modern classifications. Logic and mathematics, the
                    most abstract sciences, are near the beginning, if not quite first; what stands
                    for social science follows the physical concrete sciences; and the distinction
                    between abstract and concrete, which Comte made one of the bases of his
                    classification, and which has been more accurately discriminated by Spencer, is
                    on the whole clearly seized. But art is throughout confounded with science;
                    superstitions are mixed up with facts; physical and mental phenomena are not
                    always separated; the subjective and the objective (learning and science) are
                    confused, as they afterwards were by Bacon; and there is no science of man—man
                    was not yet conceived, metaphysically, as an individual. This agrees with
                    Al-Farabi’s science of politics as expounded in another work, in which he
                    follows his master, Aristotle, in denying the permanence of the individual soul,
                    and anticipates the Averrhoistic doctrine of the unity of souls. For his
                    metaphysics is Peripatetic, as Peripateticism was interpreted by the
                    Neo-Platonist commentators on Aristotle. Starting with the distinction between
                    the possible and the necessary, he assumes that there must be some supreme
                    necessary existence which accounts for all actual existence. This supreme
                    existence has infinite life, wisdom, power, beauty, goodness, &amp;c., but it is
                    an absolute unity, and is without distinguishable attributes. How does the
                    world, with its infinite <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n539/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0539-0502"/> multiplicity and diversity, issue from this
                    absolutely one and identical being? Here Al-Farabi neo-platonises. It proceeds
                    by emanation. The absolute Being knows itself, and in virtue of this knowledge
                    the first intelligence exists. He does not explain how self-consciousness comes
                    to be inseparable from necessary existence, but his dynamic, at this and all the
                    lower stages, is self-knowledge; and indeed the act of knowing and the resultant
                    existence appear at this height of abstraction to be all but identical. The
                    first intelligence, intrinsically a unity, contains multiplicity, because it is
                    no longer devoid of attributes. In so far as it necessarily exists, it evolves
                    the second intelligence; in so far as it is merely potential being, and knows
                    itself, it evolves the world-soul and the uppermost world-circle, which is moved
                    by that soul. Similarly descending intelligences, ever-wider world-circles and
                    the corresponding souls, are evolved by the same process of emanation, down to
                    the active reason, which is most nearly related to the earthly elements and
                    human souls. The active reason, by its contact with matter, impresses on it
                    forms, of which the human soul is one, with greater or less permanence according
                    to the degree in which it is immersed in, or rises above, matter. The forms
                    decline in permanence the further we descend below the active reason, and the
                    matter which has least form is the limit of emanation. There is here nothing
                    like what is now called evolution: the conception of the universe is, as in all
                    theories of emanation, really statical, not dynamical, for the ideas of cause
                    and perpetual causation do not yet exist; and of course the process is the
                    reverse of that implied in the modem development theory. (For information on
