                    districts of Agra, Etáwah, Mainpurí, Farrakkhábád, Etah, and Mathurá. It is
                    bounded on the N. by tho Aligarh district; on the W. by the Bhartpur, Dholpur,
                    and Gwalior states; on the S. by the Jalaun and Cawn-pur districts; and on the
                    E. by the Ganges. Agra division contains, according to the census of 1872, a
                    population of 5,038,136 souls; of whom 4,607,946 are Hindus, 427,834 Mahometans,
                    and 2356 Christians and others.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Agra District</hi> lies between 26° 43' 45'' and 27° 24'
                    15'' N. lat., and between 77° 28' and 78° 53' E. long.</p>

                <p>It is bounded on the N. by the district of Mathurá; on the E. by the Manipuri and
                    Etâwah districts; on the S. by the Gwalior territory and the Dholpur state; and
                    on the W. by the Bhartpur territory. Its area in 1872 was returned at 1873
                    square miles, and its population at 1,094,184 souls. The general appearance of
                    the district is that common to the Doab, a level plain intersected by
                    watercourses (nálás) and ravines. The only hills are the sandstone elevations in
                    the west and south-west of the district. The principal rivers are the Jamná,
                    Chambal, Uttangan, and Khari. The Jamná intersects the district, cutting off the
                    subdivisions of Itmadpur and Firozábád; and a branch of the Aligarh division of
                    the Ganges Canal passes through its northern parts. The general elevation of the
                    district is estimated at from 650 to 700 feet above the level of the sea. The
                    soil is sandy; many of the wells are brackish, and the local water supply is
                    scanty. The failure of the periodical rains during the monsoon suffices to
                    produce great scarcity, sometimes reaching the famine point. Only five towns are
                    returned by the census as containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants, viz., Agra
                    city (the capital of the district), population 149,008; Fathipur Sikrí, the site
                    of Akbar’s famous mosque and palace, 6878; Firozábád, 14,255; Pináhát, 6571; and
                    Saimrá, 5704. There are three municipalities, viz., Agra city, Firozábád, and
                    Fathipur Sikri. These muncipalities derive their local revenue from octroi and
                    from property within the municipal limits. The total municipal income and its
                    incidence per head of the population are as follows :—Agra city, municipal
                    income, £15,441, incidence per head, 2s. 0¾d.; Firozábád. £724— 1s. per head;
                    Fathipur Sikrí, £366—1s. per head. The land revenue of the whole district was
                    stated in 1871 at £162,882, and the gross revenue at £660,526. A scheme of rural
                    instruction by means of indigenous schools was introduced in 1848. In 1871-72
                    there were 431 schools in the district, attended by 10,823 pupils, of whom 8820
                    were Hindus, 1293 Mahometans, and 710 of other denominations. The educational
                    establishments within the city will be described below. The police force
                    consisted of 1358 regular police in 1871, equal to one man to every 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 37 square miles of area, or one to every 805
                    inhabitants; and a village watch or rural constabulary of 1921 men, being one
                    man to every 0∙97 square miles of area, or one to every 570 inhabitants. The
                    chief crimes of the district, in common with the rest of the Doab, are burglary
                    and theft.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Agra City,</hi> situated on the banks of the Jamná river, in
                    27° 10' N. lat., and 78° 5' E. long., is the head-quarters of the division and
                    capital of the district. Formerly it was the provincial capital also, but since
                    the mutiny the seat of government has been removed from Agra to Allahábád. The
                    city, which is about 4 miles in length by 3 in breadth, sweeps along the banks
                    of the river in a semicircle. The principal thoroughfares are a fine broad
                    street intersecting the town from north to south; and the Strand, which runs
                    along the banks of the river for a distance of 2 miles. This road measures 80
                    feet in width, and is said to have been constructed by the destitute poor during
                    the famine of 1838. In 1846 the population of the city was estimated at 66,000;
                    in 1872 it was ascertained to be 149,000. The conservancy and improvement of the
                    town are in the hands of a municipal committee, which derives its funds
                    principally from octroi duties. In 1871-72, the municipal income was returned as
                    follows:—Octroi duties, £13,587; miscellaneous receipts, such as rent from land
                    belonging to the municipality, &amp;c., £1854—total, £15,441. The details of
                    municipal expenditure were as follow :—Establishment and cost of collection,
                    £1667, 12s.; police, £4041, 12s.; conservancy, £1749, 12s.; lighting, £672,
                    14s.; watering, £255,10s.; original works,£3561, 16s.; repairs,£1429, 2s.;
                    education, £120; vaccination, £36, 6s.; dispensary, £360; charities, £240;
                    grants to cantonments, museum, &amp;c., £1465, 2s.—total, £15,599, 6s. The
                    principal educational establishment in Agra is the Government College, a
                    handsome building, situated in the civil lines a short distance from the town.
                    It was established in 1820; in 1872 it contained 385 pupils. The other chief
                    schools are the St John’s College, established by the Church Missionary Society
                    in 1854; the Victoria College, established in 1862; and St Peter’s Catholic
                    College. These three colleges in 1872 had 643 pupils on their rolls. There is
                    also a medical college, founded in 1853. The total number of students admitted
                    into it during the sixteen years from 1855 to 1870 inclusive, was 1168, of whom
                    235 passed the prescribed examination and received appointments in the
                    government medical service. The Agra fort has a very imposing appearance, but is
                    of no great strength. It occupies a large space of ground on the banks of the
                    river, enclosed by high walls and towers of red stone. The fortress was
                    constructed by the Emperor Akbar in the latter part of the 16th century, and
                    exceeds a mile in circuit. In 1803 the place was held by the Marhattás; but
                    being invested by Lord Lake’s army, it surrendered after a day’s bombardment.
                    During the mutiny of 1857 it formed a place of refuge for the European and
                    Christian community of Agra, and was threatened by the insurgent sepoys. The
                    buildings of most note within the walls of the fort are the palace and hall of
                    audience of Sháh Jahán, and the Motí Masjid, or “Pearl Mosque.”</p>
                <p>“In the centre of the palace,” says Mr Fergusson in his <hi rend="italic">History
                    of Architecture,</hi> vol. ii., pp. 699-700, “is a great court 500 feet by 370,
                    surrounded by arcades, and approached at the opposite ends through a succession
                    of beautiful courts opening into one another by gateways of great magnificence.
                    On one side of this court is the great hall of the palace, the Díwáni-Khás, 208
                    feet by 76, supported by three ranges of arcades of exquisite beauty. It is open
                    on three sides, and with a niche for the throne at the back. This hall is now
                    used as an arsenal. Behind it are two smaller courts, the one containing the
                    Díwáni-Am or hall of private audience, the other the harem. The hall in the
                    former is one of the most elegant of Shah Jahan’s buildings, being wholly of
                    white marble inlaid with precious stones, and the design of the whole being in
                    the best style of his reign.”</p>
                <p>The Motí Masjid or Pearl Mosque is the most elegant mosque of Indian-Mahometan
                    architecture. Mr Fergusson describes it as follows :—</p>
                <p>“Its dimensions are considerable, being externally 235 feet east and west, by 190
                    feet north and south, and the courtyard 155 feet square. The mass is also
                    considerable, as the whole is raised on a terrace of artificial construction, by
                    the aid of which it stands well out from the surrounding buildings of the fort.
                    Its chief beauty consists in its courtyard, which is wholly of white marble from
                    the pavement to the summit of its domes. In design it somewhat resembles the
                    great Dehli mosque, except that the minarets are omitted, and the side gateways
                    are only recesses. The western part, or mosque properly so called, is of white
                    marble inside and out; and, except an inscription from the Kuran inlaid with
                    black marble as a frieze, has no ornament whatever beyond the lines of its own
                    graceful architecture.”</p>
                <p>Agra, however, is even more famous for the Táj-Mahal, a splendid mausoleum built
                    by the Emperor Sháh Jahán for the remains of his favourite wife, Mumtázá Mahal,
                    and where he himself is also buried. The building is of white marble, with four
                    tall minarets of the same material, one at each corner. The whole rises from an
                    elevated marble terrace. The following account is extracted from Mr Fergusson’s
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Architecture,</hi> pp. 692-694:—</p>
                <p>“The enclosure, including the gardens and outer court, is a parallelogram of 1860
                    feet by more than 1000 feet. The outer court, surrounded by arcades and adorned
                    by four gateways, forms an oblong, occupying in length the whole breadth of the
                    inclosure, by about 450 feet in depth. The principal gateway, measuring 110 feet
                    by 140, leads from the court to the gardens, which, with their marble canals and
                    fountains and cypress trees, are almost as beautiful as the tomb itself. The
                    tomb stands on a raised platform 18 feet high, faced with white marble, and is
                    exactly 313 feet square.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n308/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0308-0287"/>
                <p>At each comer of this terrace stands a minaret 133 feet in height, and of the
                    most exquisite proportions—more beautiful, perhaps, than any other in India. In
                    the centre of thé marble platform stands the mausoleum, a square of 186 feet,
                    with the comers cut off to the extent of 33 feet 9 inches. The centre of this is
                    occupied by the principal dome, 58 feet in diameter and 80 feet in height, under
                    which is an inclosure formed by a screen of trellis-work of white marble, a <hi
                    rend="italic">chef-d'oeuvre</hi> of elegance in Indian art. Within this stand
                    the two tombs. These, however, as is usual in Indian sepulchres, are not the
                    true tombs; the bodies rest in a vault level with the surface of the ground,
                    beneath plainer tombstones placed exactly underneath those in the hall above. In
                    each angle of the building is a smaller dome of two storeys in height, 26 feet 8
                    inches in diameter, and connected by various passages and halls. The light to
                    the central apartment is admitted only through double screens of white marble
                    trellis-work of the most exquisite design, one on the outer and one on the inner
                    face of the walls. In our climate this would produce nearly complete darkness;
                    but in India, and in a building wholly composed of white marble, this was
                    required to temper the glare, which otherwise would have been intolerable. As it
                    is, no words can express the chastened beauty of that central chamber, seen in
                    the soft gloom of the subdued light which reaches it through the distant and
                    half-closed openings that surround it. When used as a pleasure palace, it must
                    have been the coolest and the loveliest of garden retreats; and now that it is
                    sacred to the dead, it is the most graceful and most impressive of the
                    sepulchres of the world. This building is an early example of that system of
                    inlaying with precious stones which became the great characteristic of the style
                    of the Mughuls after the death of Akbar. All the span-drils of the Táj, all the
                    angles and more important architectural details, are heightened by being inlaid
                    with precious stones, such as agates, bloodstones, jaspers, and the like. These
                    are combined in wreaths, scrolls, and frets, as exquisite in design as they are
                    beautiful in colour; and, relieved by the pure white marble in which they are
                    inlaid, they form the most beautiful and precious style of ornament ever adopted
                    in architecture. It is lavishly bestowed on the tombs themselves and the screens
                    that surround them, but more sparingly introduced on the mosque that forms one
                    wing of the Taj, and on the fountains and surrounding buildings. The judgment,
                    indeed, with which this style of ornament is apportioned to the various parts is
                    almost as remarkable as the ornament itself, and conveys a high idea of the
                    taste and skill of the Indian architects of this age.”</p>
                <p>Tavernier, in his <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> (vol. iii., p. 94), mentions
                    that 20,000 workmen were incessantly employed on this work during a period of
                    twenty-two years. The tomb of the Emperor Akbar is contained in a splendid
                    mausoleum at Sikandrá, a suburb of Agra city.</p>
