                    the same year he made an extended tour through Europe, visiting France, Italy,
                    and Greece. On his return he founded the Athenian Club, the membership of which
                    was confined to those who had travelled in Greece. This explains Lord Byron’s
                    reference in the <hi rend="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</hi> to
                    “the travelled Thane, Athenian Aberdeen.” Soon after his return he contributed a
                    very able article to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> (vol. vi), on
                    Gell’s <hi rend="italic">Topography of Troy.</hi> Another literary result of his
                    tour was the publication in 1822 of <hi rend="italic">An Inquiry into the
                    Principles of Beauty in Grecian Architecture,</hi> the substance of which had
                    appeared some years before in the form of an introduction to a translation of
                    Vitruvius’ <hi rend="italic">Civil Architecture.</hi> In 1806, having been
                    elected one of the representative peers for Scotland, he took his seat in the
                    House of Lords on the Tory side. He was already on terms of intimacy with the
                    leading members of the then predominant party, and in particular with Pitt,
                    through the influence of his relative, the celebrated Duchess of Gordon. In 1813
                    he was intrusted with a delicate and difficult special mission to Vienna, the
                    object being to induce the Emperor of Austria to join the alliance against his
                    son-in-law Napoleon. His diplomacy was completely successful; the desired
                    alliance was secured by the treaty of Töplitz, which the Earl signed as
                    representative of Great Britain in September 1813. On his return at the
                    conclusion of the war, he was raised to a British peerage, with the title of
                    Viscount Gordon. Lord Aberdeen was a member of the Cabinet formed by the Duke of
                    Wellington in 1828, for a short time as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,
                    and then as Foreign Secretary. He was Colonial Secretary in the Tory Cabinet of
                    1834-5, and again received the seals of the Foreign Office under Sir Robert
                    Peel’s administration of 1841. The policy of nonintervention, to which he
                    stedfastly adhered in his conduct of foreign affairs, was at once his strength
                    and his weakness. According to the popular idea, he failed to see the
                    limitations and exceptions to a line of policy which nearly all admitted to be
                    as a general role both wise and just. On the whole, his administration was
                    perhaps more esteemed abroad than at home. It has been questioned whether any
                    English minister ever was on terms of greater intimacy with foreign courts, but
                    there is no substantial warrant for the charge of want of patriotism which was
                    sometimes brought against him. On the two chief questions of home politics which
                    were finally settled during his tenure of office, he was in advance of most of
                    his party. While the other members of the Government yielded Catholic
                    Emancipation and the repeal of the Corn Laws as unavoidable concessions, Lord
                    Aberdeen spoke and voted for both measures from conviction of their justice. On
                    the 13th June 1843, he moved the second reading of his bill “to remove doubts
                    respecting the admission of ministers to benefices in Scotland,” and it was
                    passed into law in that session, though a similar measure had been rejected in
                    1840. As the first proposal did not prevent, so the passing of the Act had no
                    effect in healing, the breach in the Established Church of Scotland which
                    occurred in 1843. On the defeat of Lord Derby’s government in 1852, the state of
                    parties was such as to necessitate a coalition government, of which Lord
                    Aberdeen, in consequence of the moderation of his views, was the natural chief.
                    He had been regarded as the leader of the Peel party from the time of Sir
                    Robert’s death, but his views on the two great questions of home policy above
                    mentioned rendered him more acceptable to the Liberals, and a more suitable
                    leader of a coalition government than any other member of that party could have
                    been. His administration will chiefly be remembered in connection with the
                    Crimean war, which, it is now generally believed, might have been altogether
                    prevented by a more vigorous policy. The incompetence of various departments at
                    home, and the gross mismanagement of the commissariat in the terrible winter of
                    1854, caused a growing dissatisfaction with the government, which at length
                    found emphatic expression in the House of Commons, when a motion submitted by Mr
                    Roebuck, calling for inquiry, was carried by an overwhelming majority. Lord
                    Aberdeen regarded the vote as one of no-confidence, and at once resigned. From
                    this period Lord Aberdeen took little part in public business. In recognition of
                    his services he received, soon after his resignation, the decoration of the
                    Order of the Garter. He died December 13, 1860. Lord Aberdeen was twice
                    married,—first in 1805, to a daughter of the first Marquis of Abercorn, who died
                    in 1812, and then to the widow of Viscount Hamilton. He was succeeded in the
                    title and estates by Lord Haddo, his son by the second marriage.</p>
