                    >the Aberration of Light,</hi> is a remarkable phenomenon, by which stars appear
                    to deviate a little, in the course of a year, from their true places in the
                    heavens. It results from the eye of the observer being carried onwards by the
                    motion of the earth on its orbit, during the time that light takes to <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n63/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0063-0048"/> travel from the star to the earth. The effect of
                    this combination of motions may be best explained by a familiar illustration.
                    Suppose a rain-drop falling vertically is received in a tube that has a lateral
                    motion. In order that the drop may fall freely down the axis of the tube, the
                    latter must be inclined at such an angle as to move from the position AD to BE,
                    and again to CF, in the times the drop moves from D to G, and from G to C.</p>
                <p>The drop in this case, since it moves down the axis all the way, must strike the
                    bottom of the tube at C <hi rend="italic">in the direction</hi> FC. The light
                    proceeding from a star is not seen in its true direction, but strikes the eye
                    obliquely, for a precisely similar reason. If lines be taken to represent the
                    motions, so that the eye is carried from A to C during the time that light moves
                    from D to C, tho light will appear to the eye at C to come, not from D, but from
                    F. The angle DCF, contained by the true and apparent directions of the star, is
                    the <hi rend="italic">aberration.</hi> It is greatest when the two motions are
                    at right angles to each other, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> when the star’s
                    longitude is 90° in advance of, or behind, the heliocentric longitude of the
                    earth, or (which amounts to the same thing) 90° behind, or in advance of, the
                    geocentric longitude of the sun. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy.) Now,</hi>
                    in the right-angled triangle ACD, tan ADC (i.e., DCF) = <hi rend="superscript">
                    AC</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> DC</hi>; whence it appears that the tangent of
                    the angle of aberration (or, since the angle is very small, the aberration
                    itself) is equal to the ratio, <hi rend="superscript"> velocity of earth in
                    orbit</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> velocity of light</hi>. The rate of the
                    earth's motion being to the velocity of light in the proportion of 1 to 10,000
                    nearly, the maximum aberration is small, amounting to about 20∙4 seconds of
                    arc,—a quantity, however, which is very appreciable in astronomical
                    observations.</p>
                <p>Aberration always takes place in the direction of the earth’s motion; that is, it
                    causes the stars to appear nearer than they really are to the point towards
                    which the earth is at the moment moving. That point is necessarily on the
                    ecliptic, and 90° in advance of the earth in longitude. The effect is to make a
                    star at the pole of the ecliptic appear to move in a plane parallel to the
                    ecliptic, so as to form a small ellipse, similar to the earth’s orbit, but
                    having its major axis parallel to the minor axis of that orbit, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> As we proceed from the pole, the apparent orbits
                    the stars describe become more and more elliptical, till in the plane of the
                    ecliptic the apparent motion is in a straight line. The length of this line, as
                    well as of the major axes of the different ellipses, amounts, in angular
                    measure, to about 40"∙8. The stars thus appear to oscillate, in the course of
                    the year, 20"∙4 on each side of their true position, in a direction parallel to
                    the plane of the ecliptic, and the quantity 20"∙4 is therefore called the <hi
                    rend="italic">constant of aberration.</hi></p>
                <p>For the discovery of the aberration of light, one of the finest in modern
                    astronomy, we are indebted to the distinguished astronomer Dr Bradley. He was
                    led to it, in 1727, by the result of observations he made with the view of
                    determining the annual parallax of some of the stars; that is, the angle
                    subtended at these stars by the diameter of the earth’s orbit. He observed
                    certain changes in the positions of the stars that he could not account for. The
                    deviations were not in the direction of the apparent motion that parallax would
                    give rise to; and he had no better success in attempting to explain the
                    phenomenon by the nutation of the earth’s axis, radiation, errors of
                    observation, &amp;c. At last the true solution of the difficulty occurred to
                    him, suggested, it is said, by the movements of a vane on the top of a boat’s
                    mast. Roemer had discovered, a quarter of a century before, that light has a
                    velocity which admits of measurement; and Bradley perceived that the earth’s
                    motion, having a perceptible relation to that of light, must affect the
                    direction of the visual rays, and with this the apparent positions of the stars.
                    He calculated the aberration from the known relative velocities of the earth and
                    of light, and the results agreed entirely with his observations.</p>
                <p>The observed effects of aberration are of importance as supplying an independent
                    method of measuring the velocity of light, but more particularly as presenting
                    one of the few direct proofs that can be given of the earth’s motion round the
                    sun. It is indeed the most satisfactory proof of this that astronomy furnishes,
                    the phenomenon being quite inexplicable on any other hypothesis.</p>
