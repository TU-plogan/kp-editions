                    <hi rend="italic">Logic,</hi> is a word used in several distinguishable but
                    closely allied senses. First, in a comprehensive sense, it is often applied to
                    that process by which we fix the attention upon one part of what is present to
                    the mind, to the exclusion of another part; abstraction thus conceived being
                    merely the negative of <hi rend="smallcaps">Attention</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.
                    v.)</hi> In this sense we are able in thought to <hi rend="italic">abstract</hi>
                    one object from another, or an attribute from an object, or an attribute
                    perceived by one sense from those perceived by other senses. Even in cases when
                    thoughts or images have become inseparably associated, we possess something of
                    this power of abstracting or turning the attention upon one rather than another.
                    Secondly, the word is used, with a more special signification, to describe that
                    concentration of attention upon the resemblances of a number of objects, which
                    constitutes classification. And thirdly, not to mention other less important
                    changes of meaning, the whole process of generalisation, by which the mind forms
                    the notions expressed by common terms, is frequently, through a curious
                    transposition of names, spoken of as abstraction. Especially when understood in
                    its less comprehensive connection, the process of abstraction possesses a
                    peculiar interest. To the psychologist it is interesting, because there is
                    nothing he is more desirous to understand than the mode of formation and true
                    nature of what are called general notions. And fortunately, with regard to the
                    abstractive process by which these are formed, at least in its initial stages,
                    there is little disagreement; since every one describes it as a process of
                    comparison, by which the mind is enabled to consider the objects confusedly
                    presented<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n74/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0074-0059"/> to it in intuition, to recognise and attend
                    exclusively to tlιeir points of agreement, and so to classify them in accordance
                    with their perceived resemblances. Further, this process is admitted without
                    much dispute to belong to the discursive or elaborative action of the intellect;
                    although, perhaps — should the view of some modern psychologists be correct,
                    that all intelligence proceeds by the establishment of relations of <hi
                    rend="italic">likeness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">unlikeness</hi> —abstraction
                    will be better conceived as thus related to intelligence in general and typical
                    of all its processes, than as the action merely of a special and somewhat
                    indefinite faculty. No such harmony, however, exists regarding the nature of the
                    <hi rend="italic">product</hi> of abstraction; for that is the subjectmatter of
                    Nominalism and Realism, which has produced more controversy, and stimulated to
                    more subtlety of thought, than any other subject ever debated in philosophy. The
                    concept or abstract idea has been represented in a multitude of ways: sometimes
                    as an idea possessing an objective existence independent of particulars, even
                    more real and permanent than theirs; sometimes as an idea composed of all the
                    circumstances in which the particulars agree, and of no others; again, as the
                    idea of an individual, retaining its individualising qualities, but with the
                    accompanying knowledge that these are not the properties of the class; and yet
                    again, as the idea of a miscellaneous assemblage of individuals belonging to a
                    class. It is still impossible to say that the many-sided controversy is at an
                    end. The only conclusion generally admitted seems to be, that there exists
                    between the concept and the particular objects of intuition some very intimate
                    relation of thought, so that it is necessary, for all purposes of reasoning,
                    that the general and particular go hand in hand, that the idea of the class—if
                    such exists —be capable of being applied, in every completed act of thought, to
                    the objects comprised within the class.</p>
                <p>To the student of ontology, also, abstraction is of special interest, since,
                    according to many distinguished thinkers, the recognition of abstraction as a
                    powerful and universal mental process is to explain all ontology away, and give
                    the ontologist his eternal quietus. The thoroughgoing nominalist professes to
                    discover in the mind an inveterate tendency to abstraction, and a proneness to
                    ascribe separate existence to abstractions, amply sufficient to account for all
                    those forms of independent reality which metaphysics defend, and to exhibit them
                    all in their true colours as fictitious assumptions. In reply, the ontologist,
                    strengthened by the instinct of self-preservation, commonly contends that the
                    analogy between general notions and metaphysical principles does not hold good,
                    and that the latter are always more than simple abstractions or mere names. Only
                    after abstraction is understood can the question be settled.</p>
                <p>In like manner to logic, whether regarded as the science of the formal laws of
                    thought, or, more widely, as the science of scientific methods, a true
                    understanding of abstraction is of the greatest importance. It is important in
                    pure logic, because, as we have seen, every act of judgment and reasoning
                    postulates a concept or concepts, and so presupposes abstraction. Abstraction,
                    determining the possibility alike of reason and speech, creates those notions
                    that bear common names; it is indispensable to the formation of classes, great
                    or small; and just according as it ascends, increasing the extension and
                    diminishing the intension of classes, the horizon visible to reason and to logic
                    gradually recedes and widens. And to logic as the science of the sciences a true
                    doctrine of abstraction is not less necessary; because the process of extending
                    knowledge is, in all its developments, essentially the same as the first
                    rudimentary effort to form a concept and think of particulars as members of a
                    class; a “natural law,” at least in its subjective aspect, is invariably an
                    abstraction made by comparing phenomena—an abstraction under which phenomena are
                    classed in order to the extension of knowledge, just as under a concept are
                    grouped the particulars presented in intuition. As proof of this identity it is
                    found that the same differences exist regarding the objective or subjective
                    nature of the “natural law” as regarding that of the concept. Some affirm that
                    the law is brought ready-made by the mind and superinduced on the facts; others,
                    that it is never in any sense more than a mere mental conception, got by
                    observing the facts; while there are yet others who maintain it to be such a
                    subjective conception, but one corresponding at the same time to an external
                    relation which is real though unknowable.</p>
