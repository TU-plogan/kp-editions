                    control, possessed of great personal beauty, and the heir to great wealth — a
                    youth consequently universally honoured, courted, and caressed—was not in a
                    position to acquire a knowledge of the virtue of self-restraint in any shape or
                    form. Spoilt accordingly by flatteries and blandishments, the boy showed himself
                    self-willed, capricious, and passionate, and indulged in the wildest freaks and
                    most insolent, tyrannical behaviour. Nor did the instructors of his early
                    manhood supply the corrective which his boyhood lacked. The collection of moral,
                    political, and religious beliefs which the earlier Greeks, from custom,
                    convenience, or the promptings of common sense, had accepted as a standard by
                    which to regulate their own conduct and judge that of others, had been exposed
                    by the sophists to the keenest scrutiny and the widest scepticism. Negative
                    criticism, accompanied with showy novel paradoxes, are always attractive to a
                    young man of intellectual vigour; and thus Alcibiades learnt from Protagoras,
                    Prodicus, and others, to laugh at the common opinions about justice, temperance,
                    holiness, patriotism, &amp;c. The long, patient, laborious thought, the
                    self-sufficing and comparatively ascetic life of his master Socrates, he was
                    able to admire, but not to imitate or practise. On the contrary, his
                    ostentatious vanity, his amours, his debaucheries, and his impious revels,
                    became notorious throughout Athens. But great as were Alcibiades’s moral vices,
                    his intellectual abilities were still more conspicuous. He proved his courage at
                    the battle of Potidea (432 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> where, wounded, he
                    was rescued by Socrates; at the battle of Delium (424 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), where he protected his former deliverer; and on many subsequent
                    occasions. Though he was not a very fluent speaker, he always kept to the point.
                    His energy was immense, his ambition unbounded but selfish, and provided he
                    could gratify this passion, he never scrupled at the means or the price. He
                    could read the character of others, and adapt himself to it with a versatility,
                    adroitness, and flexibility which if any even of his shifty fellow-countrymen
                    equalled they never surpassed. Nor were his personal qualities his only
                    recommendation to popular favour. His ancestors and relatives had been for
                    generations the recognised leaders of the people; he had many admirers and
                    followers among the clubs of young nobles; he had numerous dependants who
                    partook of his wealth; and he gratified the populace by the lavish expenditure
                    with which he performed his various liturgical duties. On his first entering
                    prominently into public life, he succeeded by a clever but unscrupulous trick in
                    duping the Spartan ambassadors, and persuading the Athenians to conclude an
                    alliance with Argos, Elis, and Mantinea (420 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>
                    Next year he was appointed general, and for three years busily traversed the
                    Peloponnesus, endeavouring to advance the objects of the alliance. But to be the
                    first man in Athens was far too limited an object to satisfy the ambition of
                    Alcibiades: all Greece must be dazzled by his greatness. As the first step
                    towards the accomplishment of this scheme he fixed upon the conquest of Sicily,
                    which would necessarily be followed by that of the Peloponnesus and probably by
                    that of Carthage. With this view, he warmly advocated the adoption of measures
                    for the relief of Segesta. The Sicilian expedition being resolved on with great
                    enthusiasm, he, Nicias, and Lamachus, were appointed generals. But shortly
                    before the day appointed for the armaments setting sail there took place a
                    mysterious crime, which was destined to alter the whole complexion of
                    Alcibiades’s future, and with it that of the Athenian state. In the course of
                    one night (May, 415 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> all the busts of Hermes in
                    Athens were sacrilegiously mutilated. The enemies of Alcibiades (many of them
                    probably the actual perpetrators) endeavoured to connect him with the sacrilege;
                    and his well-known impieties gave plausibility to a charge which could never
                    have had any real foundation. Recalled to stand his trial almost as soon as he
                    reached Sicily, he escaped, and made his way to Sparta, where he revealed all
                    the plans of the Athenians, and induced the Spartans to send Gylippus to Sicily
                    and an army to fortify Decelea. He then passed over to Asia Minor, and prevailed
                    upon many of the Ionic allies of Athens to revolt. But in a few months he had
                    lost the confidence of the Spartans; and at the instigation of Agis II., whose
                    personal hostility he had excited, an order was sent from Lacedaemon for his
                    execution. Receiving timely information of this order, he crossed over to
                    Tissaphernes (412 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> and quickly worming himself
                    into the satrap’s confidence, he persuaded him to cease giving active assistance
                    to Sparta, so that the two Grecian parties, after wearing themselves out by
                    their mutual struggles, might both be easily expelled from Asia. But Alcibiades
                    was now bent on returning to Athens, and he used his supposed influence with
                    Tissaphernes to effect his purpose. In his negotiation with Peisander, though he
                    failed in his immediate object, he succeeded in producing the impression that,
                    whatever side he joined, he could make Tissaphernes help. Under this impression,
                    he was recalled by Thrasybulus and the armament at Samos, and appointed one of
                    the generals. His appointment was followed by the victories at Cynossema,
                    Abydos, and Cyzicus, and by the recovery of Chalcedon and Byzantium. On his
                    return to Athens after these successes he was welcomed with every demonstration
                    of joy (407 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>; all the proceedings against him
                    were cancelled, and he was appointed general with full powers. His ill success,
                    however, at Andros, and the defeat of his lieutenant at Notium, led the
                    Athenians to dismiss him from his command. He thereupon retired to the Thracian
                    Chersonesus; but after the battle of Aegospotami, and the establishment of the
                    Spartan supremacy throughout Greece, he crossed the Hellespont, and took refuge
                    with Pharnabazus in Phrygia. There an attack was made Upon him, but by whom or
                    for what cause historians are not agreed; his residence was set on fire, and on
                    rushing out on his cowardly assassins, dagger in hand, he was killed by a shower
                    of arrows, 404 B.C. By his wife Hipparete, Alcibiades left one son, who was
                    named after himself.</p>
