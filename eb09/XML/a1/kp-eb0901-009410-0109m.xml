                    usual name of Myrmidones also occurs); that in Aegina Zeus was styled
                    “Hellanios;” and that the name of Selloi, applied to the priesthood at Dodona,
                    is apparently identical with the name Hellenes. Whether from this local
                    connection the derivation of the name of Achilles from the same root as 'Aχ∈λωoς
                    should be preferred to the other derivations, such as 'Aχι-λεύs = 'Εχελαoς,
                    “ruler,” or 'Αχ-ιλ∈ύς, = “the bane of the Ilians,” remains undecided. But this
                    is gained, that we see in what manner the legend of Achilles had its root in the
                    earlier Pelasgic religion, his adherence to which in the prayer just cited would
                    otherwise appear very strange on the part of a hero who, through the influence
                    of Homer and his successors, is completely identified with the Olympian system
                    of gods. According to the genealogy, Aeacus had two sons, Peleus and Telamon, of
                    whom the former became the father of Achilles—the latter, of Ajax; but of this
                    relationship between Achilles and Ajax there is no sign in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad.</hi> Peleus ruled in Phthia; and the gods remarking his piety, rewarded
                    him with, among other presents, a wife in the person of the beautiful nereid
                    Thetis. After her son was born, Thetis appears to have returned to her life in
                    the sea. The boy was placed under his father’s friend, the centaur Cheiron. When
                    six years old he slew lions and boars, and could run down a stag. When nine, he
                    was removed from his instructor to the island of Scyrus, where, dressed as a
                    girl, he was to be brought up among the daughters of Lycomedes, his mother
                    preferring for him a long inglorious life to a brief but splendid career. The
                    same desire for his safety is apparent in other legends, which describe her as
                    trying to make him invulnerable when a child by placing him in boiling water or
                    in a fire, and then salving him with ambrosia; or again, in later story, by
                    dipping him in the river Styx, from which he came out, all but the heel which
                    she held, proof against wounds. When the aid of Achilles was found indispensable
                    to the expedition against Troy, Odysseus set out for Scyrus as a pedlar, spread
                    his wares, including a shield and spear, before the king’s daughters, among whom
                    was Achilles in disguise. Then he caused an alarm of danger to be sounded, upon
                    which, while the girls fled, Achilles seized the arms, and thus revealed
                    himself. Provided with a contingent of 50 ships, and accompanied by the aged
                    Phoenix and Patroclus, he joined the expedition, which after occupying nine
                    years in raids upon the towns in the neighbourhood of Troy and in Mysia, as
                    detailed in the epic poem entitled the <hi rend="italic">Cypria,</hi> culminated
                    in the regular siege of Troy, as described in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi>
                    the grand object of which is the glorification of our hero. Estranged from his
                    comrades, because his captive Briseis had been taken from him, Achilles remained
                    inexorable in his tent, while defeat attended the Greeks. At length, at their
                    greatest need, he yielded so far as to allow Patroclus to take his chariot and
                    to assume his armour. Patroclus fell, and the news of his death roused Achilles,
                    who, now equipped with new armour fashioned by Hephaestus, drove back the
                    Trojans, slew Hector, and after dragging his body thrice round the Trojan walls,
                    restored it to Priam. With the funeral rites of Patroclus the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> concludes, and the story is taken up by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aethiopis,</hi> a poem by Arctinus of Miletus, in which is described the combat
                    of Achilles first with the amazon Penthesilea, and next with Memnon. When the
                    latter fell, Achilles drove back the Trojans, and, impelled by fate, himself
                    advanced to the Scaean gate, where an arrow from the bow of Paris struck his
                    vulnerable heel, and he fell, bewailed through the whole camp. <hi
