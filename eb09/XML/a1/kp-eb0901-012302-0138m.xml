                    Paris. Fragments are contained in five other MSS., none of which is later than
                    the 9th century. These are all the uncial MSS. containing the Acts or portions
                    of it.</p>
                <p>The MSS. in Oxford and Cambridge differ widely from the others. This is
                    especially the case with the Cambridge MS., the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bezae,</hi> which is said to contain no less than six hundred
                    interpolations. Scrivener, who has edited this MS. with great care, says, “While
                    the general course of the history and the spirit of the work remain the same as
                    in our commonly received text, we perpetually encounter long passages in <hi
                    rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Bezae</hi> which resemble that text
                    only as a loose and explanatory paraphrase recalls the original form from which
                    it sprung; save that there is no difference in the language in this instance, it
                    is hardly an exaggeration of the facts to assert that Codex D <hi rend="italic"
                    >[i.e., Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Bezae]</hi> reproduces the <hi rend="italic"
                    >textus receptus</hi> of the Acts much in the same way that one of the best
                    Chaldee Targums does the Hebrew of the Old Testament, so wide are the variations
                    in the diction, so constant and inveterate the practice of expanding the
                    narrative by means of interpolations.” Scrivener here assumes that the additions
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Bezae</hi> are
                    interpolations, and this is the opinion of nearly all critics. There is one,
                    however, Bornemann, who thinks that the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bezae</hi> contains the original text, and that the others are
                    mutilated. But even supposing that we were quite sure that the additions were
                    interpolations, the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Bezae</hi>
                    makes it more difficult to determine what the real text was. Scrivener, with
                    good reason, supposes that the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Bezae</hi> is derived from an original which would most likely belong to the
                    third century at the latest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Authorship of the Work.—</hi> In treating this subject we begin
                    with the external evidence.</p>
                <p>The first mention of the authorship of the Acts in a well-authenticated book
                    occurs in the treatise of Irenaeus against heresies, written between the years
                    182 and 188 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Irenaeus names St Luke as the author,
                    as if the fact were well known and undoubted. He attributes the third Gospel to
                    him, and calls him “a follower and disciple of apostles <hi rend="italic">”
                    (H.</hi> iii. 10, 1). He states that “he was inseparable from Paul, and was his
                    fellow-worker in the gospel” (<hi rend="italic">H.</hi> iii. 14, 1 ). The next
                    mention occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Stromata</hi> of Clemens Alexandrinus,
                    written about 195 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> where part of St Paul's speech
                    to the Athenians is quoted with the words, “Even as Luke also, in the Acts of
                    the Apostles, records Paul as saying” <hi rend="italic">(Strom.</hi> v. xii. 82,
                    p. 696, Pott). The Acts of the Apostles is quoted by Tertullian as Scripture,
                    and assigned to St Luke <hi rend="italic">(Adv. Mar. v.</hi> 2 and 3). Origen
                    speaks of “Luke who wrote the Gospel and the Acts" Eus. <hi rend="italic">H.
                    E.</hi> vi. 25); and Eusebius includes the Acts of the Apostles in his summary
                    of the books of the New Testament <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Eccl.</hi> iii. 25).
                    The Muratorian canon, generally assigned to the end of the second or beginning
                    of the third century, includes the Acts of the Apostles, assigns it to St Luke,
                    and says that he was an eye-witness of the facts recorded. There is thus
                    unanimous testimony up to the time of Eusebius that St Luke was the author of
                    the Acts. This unanimity is not disturbed by the circumstance that some heretics
                    rejected the work, for they did not deny the authorship of the book, but refused
                    to acknowledge it as a source of dogmatic truth.</p>
                <p>After the time of Eusebius we find statements to the effect that the Acts was
                    little known. “The existence of this book,” Chrysostom says, “is not known to
                    many, nor the person who wrote and composed it.” And Photius, in the ninth
                    century, says, “Some maintain that it was Clement of Rome that was the writer of
                    the Acts, others that it was Barnabas, and others that it was Luke the
                    Evangelist.”</p>
                <p>Irenaeus makes such copious quotations from the Acts that we can feel sure that
                    he had before him substantially our Acts. We cannot go further back than
                    Irenaeus with certainty. If, as we shall see, the writer of the Acts was also
                    the writer of the third Gospel, we have Justin Martyr’s testimony (about 150 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> for the existence of the third Gospel in his day,
                    and therefore a likelihood that the Acts existed also. But we have no
                    satisfactory evidence that Justin used the Acts, and there is nothing in the
                    Apostolic Fathers, nor in any work anterior to the <hi rend="italic">Letter of
                    the Churches of Vienne and Lyons,</hi> written probably soon after 177 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> to prove the existence of the Acts.</p>
                <p>The weight of external evidence therefore goes entirely for St Luke as the author
                    of the Acts. But it has to be noticed, that the earliest testimony is more than
                    a hundred years later than the events described in the Acts. We have also to
                    take into account that Irenaeus was not critical. We find him calling the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pastor of</hi><hi rend="italic">Hermas</hi> Scripture; Clemens
                    Alexandrinus also calls the <hi rend="italic">Pastor</hi> inspired; and Origen
                    not merely attributes inspiration to the work, but makes the author of it the
                    Hernias mentioned in the Epistle to the Romans. All scholars reject the
                    testimony of Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, and Origen in this matter. The
                    question arises, How far are we to trust them in others of a similar nature?</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">We</hi> turn to the internal evidence. And in the very
                    commencement we find the author giving himself out as the person who wrote the
                    third Gospel. This claim has been almost universally acknowledged. There is a
                    remarkable similarity of style in both. The same peculiar modes of expression
                    continually occur in both; and throughout both there exist continual references
                    backward and forward<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n139/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0139-0124"/>, which imply the same authorship. There are some
                    difficulties in the way of this conclusion. Two of these deserve special notice.
                    If we turn to the last chapter of the Gospel, we find it stated there (ver. 13)
                    that two disciples met Jesus on the day of the resurrection, as they were going
                    to Emmaus. Towards nightfall (ver. 29) he entered the village with them; and as
                    he reclined with them, he became known to them, and disappeared. Whereupon “at
                    that very hour” (ver. 33) they rose up and returned to Jerusalem. They found the
                    eleven assembled, and told them what had happened to them. “While they were
                    saying these things, he himself stood in the midst cf them” (ver. 36). The
                    apostles gave him a piece of fish, and he ate it. “But he said to them” (ver.
                    44), so the narrative goes on, and it then relates his speech; and at ver. 50 it
                    says, “He led them out to Bethany,” and then disappeared from them. This
                    disappearance was final; and if the words used in the Gospel make us hesitate in
                    determining it to be his ascension, such hesitation is removed by the opening
                    words of the Acts. According to the Gospel, therefore, all the events now
                    related took place, or seem to have taken place, on the day of the resurrection,
                    or they may possibly have extended into the next morning, but certainly not
                    later. The Acts, on the contrary, states that Jesus was seen by the disciples
                    for forty days, and makes him deliver the speech addressed to his disciples and
                    ascend into heaven forty days after the resurrection. The other instance is
                    perhaps still more singular. In the Acts we have three accounts of the
                    conversion of St Paul—the first by the writer himself, the other two by St Paul
                    in his speeches. The writer states that (ix. 4, 7) when the light shone round
                    Paul, he fell to the ground, “but the men who were journeying with him stood
                    dumb/’’ St Paul himself says (xxvi. 14) that they all fell to the ground. The
                    writer says (ix. 7) that St Paul’s companions heard the voice, but saw no one.
                    St Paul himself says (xxii. 9) that his companions saw the light, but did not
                    hear the voice of him who spake to him. And finally, all these accounts differ
                    in their report of what was said on the occasion. Notwithstanding these
                    differences, even these very accounts contain evidence in them that they were
                    written by the same writer, and they do not destroy the force of the rest of the
                    evidence. The case would be quite different if Baur, Schwegler, and Wittichen
                    were right in supposing that the Gospel of Luke contained documents of opposite
                    tendencies. It would then be necessary to assume different authors for the
                    different parts of the Gospel, and still another for the Acts. But this theory
                    falls to the ground if the Tübingen theory of tendencies is rejected.</p>
                <p>The Acts itself claims to be written by a companion of St Paul. In chap. xvi. 10,
                    the writer, without any previous warning, passes from the third person to the
                    first. St Paul had reached the Troad. There he saw a vision inviting him to go
                    to Macedonia. “But when he saw the vision, straightway <hi rend="italic">we</hi>
                    sought to go out into Macedonia.” The use of the “we” continues until Paul
                    leaves Philippi. In chap. XX. Paul returns to Philippi, and the “we” is resumed,
                    and is kept up till the end of the work. Irenaeus <hi rend="italic">(H.</hi>
                    iii. 14, 1) quotes these passages as proof that Luke, the author, was a
                    companion of the apostle. The minute character of the narrative, the accurate
                    description of the various journeyings, the unimportance of some of the details,
                    and the impossibility of contriving all the incidents of the shipwreck without
                    experiencing them, are strong reasons for believing that we have the narrative
                    of an eye-witness. And if we allow this much, we can scarcely help coming to the
                    conclusion that this eye-witness was the author of the work; for the style of
                    this eye-witness is exactly the style of the writer who composed the previous
                    portions. Some have supposed that we have here the personal narrative of Timothy
                    or of Silas; but this supposition would compel us to believe that the writer of
                    the Acts was so careless as to tack documents together without remembering to
                    alter their form. Such a procedure on the part of the skilful writer of the Acts
                    is unlikely in the highest degree. The “we” is introduced intentionally, and can
                    be accounted for only in two ways: either by supposing that the writer was an
                    eye-witness, or that he wished to be thought an eye-witness, and borrowed the
                    narrative of an eye-witness to facilitate the deception. Zeller has adopted this
                    latter alternative; and this latter alternative is the only possible one for
                    those who assign a very late date to the Acts.</p>
                <p>We may test the writer’s claim to be regarded as a companion of St Paul by
                    comparing his statements with those of the other books of the New Testament. As
                    might be expected, the great facts recorded in the Gospels are reproduced
                    accurately in the Acts. There is only one marked difference. St Matthew says
                    (xxvii. 5, 7) that Judas cast the traitor’s money into the temple, and the
                    priests bought with it a field for the burial of strangers. St Peter in Acts (i.
                    18) says, that Judas himself purchased a field with the reward of his iniquity.
                    St Matthew says that he went and hanged himself, St Peter that he fell headlong
                    and burst in the middle. St Matthew says, or rather seems to say, that the field
                    was called the field of blood, because it was purchased with blood-money; St
                    Peter seems to attribute the name to the circumstance that Judas died in it.</p>
                <p>The Acts is divided into two distinct parts. The first deals with the church in
                    Jerusalem, and especially narrates the actions of St Peter. We have no external
                    means of testing this portion of the narrative. The Acts is the only work from
                    which information is got in regard to these events. The second part pursues the
                    history of the apostle Paul; and here we can compare the statements made in the
                    Acts with those made in the Epistles. Now here again we have a general harmony.
                    St Paul travels in the regions where his Epistles show that he founded churches.
                    The friends of St Paul mentioned in the Acts are also the friends acknowledged
                    in the Epistles. And there are many minute coincidences. At the same time, we
                    learn from this comparison that St Luke is not anxious to give minute details.
                    Timothy probably visited Athens while St Paul was there. This we learn from 1
                    Thess. iii. 1, but no mention is made of' this visit in the Acts. Again, we
                    gather from the Epistles to the Corinthians that St Paul paid a visit to
                    Corinth, which is not recorded in the Acts. Moreover, no mention is made of
                    Titus in the Acts. These, however, are slight matters; and it must be allowed
                    that there is a general agreement. But attention has been drawn to two
                    remarkable exceptions. These are the account given by St Paul of his visits to
                    Jerusalem in the Epistle to the Galatians and that given by St Luke; and the
                    character and mission of the apostle Paul, as they appear in his letters and as
                    they appear in the Acts.</p>
                <p>In regard to the first point, St Paul himself says in the Epistle to the
                    Galatians, that after his conversion straightway he held no counsel with flesh
                    and blood, nor did he go up to Jerusalem to the apostles who were before him;
                    but he went away to Arabia and returned to Damascus; that then after three years
                    he went up to Jerusalem to seek for Cephas, and he remained with him fourteen
                    days. He at that time saw only two apostles,—Peter, and James the brother of the
                    Lord. He then went away to Syria and Cilicia, and was unknown by face to the
                    churches of Judea. He says that fourteen years after this he went up to
                    Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with him. On this occasion he went up by
                    revelation. St Paul introduces these facts for a purpose, and this purpose is
                    that he might prove his independence as an apostle. He had acted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n140/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0140-0125"/> solely on the revelation given to himself. He had
                    neither required nor obtained sanction from the other apostles. He was an
                    apostle, not sent forth from men nor through men, but through Jesus and God.
                    When we turn to the Acts, we find that no mention is made of the journey to
                    Arabia. He stays some days at Damascus, and then begins to preach the gospel. He
                    continues at this work a considerable time; and then, in consequence of the
                    plots of the Jews, he secretly withdraws from Damascus and proceeds to
                    Jerusalem. The brethren there are suspicious in regard to him, and their fears
                    are not quieted until Barnabas takes him to the apostles; and after this
                    introduction he goes in and out amongst them, and holds discussions with the
                    Hellenists. Finally, when the Hellenists attempt to kill him, the brethren send
                    him to Tarsus. In the Epistle to the Galatians St Paul does everything for
                    himself, instigated by his inward feelings. In the Acts he is forced out of
                    Antioch, and sent by the brethren to Tarsus. In the Galatians St Paul stays only
                    a fortnight, and sees only St Peter and St James of the apostles, and was
                    unknown by face to the churches of Judea. In the Acts Barnabas takes him to the
                    <hi rend="italic">apostles,</hi> and he continues evidently for a period much
                    longer than a fortnight, going in and out amongst them. Then in chap. xi. 30, he
                    goes up a second time to Jerusalem,—a visit which seems inconsistent with the
                    narrative in the Epistle to the Galatians. And finally, when he goes up to
                    Jerusalem, the Acts does not represent him going up by an independent
                    revelation, but as being sent up; and it says nothing of his taking an
                    independent part, but represents him as submitting to the apostles.</p>
                <p>This, however, leads us to the treatment of the character of St Paul by the
                    writer of the Acts. Some of the Tübingen critics assert that the writer shows
                    ill-will to St Paul, but they are evidently wrong. On the contrary, the
                    character of the apostle as given in the Acts is full of grand and noble traits.
                    Yet still there are some singular phenomena in the Acts. St Paul claimed to be
                    an apostle by the will of God. He had as good a right to be an apostle as St
                    Peter or St James. Yet the writer of the Acts never calls him an apostle in the
                    strict sense of the term. He is twice called an apostle, namely, in Acts xiv. 4
                    and 14. On both occasions his fellow-apostle is Barnabas; but Barnabas was not
                    one of the twelve, and not an apostle in the strict sense of the term. And even
                    in these verses the reading is doubtful· The <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bezae</hi> omits the word <hi rend="italic">apostle</hi> in the
                    14th verse, and makes the 4th liable to suspicion by inserting an addition to
                    it. St Luke also brings prominently forward as the proper mark of an apostle,
                    that he should have companied with the Lord from his baptism to his ascension,
                    and describes the filling up of the number of the twelve by the election of
                    Matthias. And if St Luke’s narrative of St Paul’s conversion be minutely
                    examined, it will be perceived that not only does he not mention that St Paul
                    saw Jesus, but the circumstances as related scarcely permitted St Paul to see
                    Jesus. He was at once dazzled by the light, and fell to the ground. In this
                    prostrate condition, with his eyes shut, he heard the voice; but at first he did
                    not know whose it was. And when he opened his eyes, he found that he was blind.
                    The words of Ananias imply that St Paul really did see Jesus, but St Luke
                    abstains from any such statement. And St Paul is not treated by the Jewish
                    Christians in the Acts as an independent apostle. He is evidently under
                    submission to the apostles at Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the point on which St Paul specially insists in the Epistle to the
                    Galatians is, that he was appointed the apostle to the Gentiles as St Peter was
                    to the circumcision, and that circumcision and the observance of the Jewish law
                    were of no importance to the Christian. St Paul’s words on this point in all his
                    letters are strong and decided. But in the Acts it is St Peter that opens up the
                    way for the Gentiles. In St Peter’s mouth occurs the strongest language in
                    regard to the intolerable nature of the law. Not a word is said cf the quarrel
                    between St Peter and St Paul. The brethren in Antioch send St Paul and Barnabas
                    up to Jerusalem to ask the opinion of the apostles and elders. St Paul awaits
                    the decision of the apostles, and St Paul and Barnabas carry back the decision
                    to Antioch. And throughout the whole of the Acts St Paul never stands forth as
                    the champion of the Gentiles. He seems continually anxious to reconcile the
                    Jewish Christians to himself, by observing the law of Moses. He circumcises
                    Timothy, and he performs his vows in the temple. And he is particularly careful
                    in his speeches to show how deep his respect for the law of Moses is. In this
                    regard the letters of St Paul are very different from his speeches as given in
                    the Acts. In the Epistle to the Galatians he claims perfect freedom for himself
                    and the Gentiles from the observance of the law; and neither in it nor in the
                    Epistle to the Corinthians does he take any notice of the decision to which the
                    apostles are said to have come in their meeting at Jerusalem. And yet the
                    narrative of St Luke implies a different state of affairs from that which it
                    actually states in words; for why should the Jews hate St Paul so much more than
                    the other apostles if there was nothing special in his attitude towards
                    them?</p>
                <p>We may add to this, that while St Luke gives a rather minute account of the
                    sufferings of St Peter and the church in Jerusalem, he has not brought
                    prominently forward the perils of St Paul. St Paul enumerates some of his
                    sufferings in the second Epistle to the Corinthians (chap. xi. 23-28). St Luke
                    has omitted a great number of these. Thus, for instance, St Paul mentions that
                    he was thrice shipwrecked. St Luke does not notice one of these shipwrecks, that
                    recorded in the Acts having taken place after the Epistles to the Corinthians
                    were written. Some also think that St Luke details several occurrences which are
                    scarcely in harmony with the character of St Paul. They say that the dismissal
                    of John Mark, as recorded in the Acts, is a harsh act. St Paul’s remark, " I
                    wist not that he is the high priest” (xxiii. 5), they regard as doubtful in
                    point of honesty. And the way by which he gained the Pharisees to his side, in
                    opposition to the Sadducees, they describe as an expedient unworthy the
                    character of this fearless apostle (xxiii. 6).</p>
                <p>St Luke occasionally alludes, in the Acts, to events which took place outside of
                    the church. We can test his accuracy in recording these events by comparing his
                    narrative with the narratives of historians who treat of the same period. These
                    historians are Josephus, Tacitus, and Suetonius. Now, here again we find that
                    the accounts in the Acts generally agree. Indeed, Holtzmann has noticed that all
                    the external events mentioned in the Acts are also to be found in Josephus. We
                    may therefore omit Tacitus and Suetonius, and confine ourselves to Josephus.
                    Three narratives deserve minute examination. The first is the death of Herod
                    Agrippa. Josephus says (<hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> xix. 8, 2) that Herod was at
                    Caesarea celebrating a festival in honour of the Caesar. On the second day of
                    the spectacle, the king put on a robe made entirely of silver, and entered the
                    theatre early in the day. The sun’s rays fell upon the silver, and a strong
                    impression was produced on the people, so that his flatterers called out that he
                    was a god. He did not check their impiety, but soon, on looking up he saw an owl
                    perched above his head on a rope. He at once recognised in the bird the
                    harbinger of evil. Immediately he was attacked by violent pains in the bowels,
                    and after five days’ illness died. The Acts says that Herod was addressing a
                    deputation of Tyrians and Sidonians in Caesarea, seated on the tribunal and
                    arrayed in a royal <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n141/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0141-0126"/> robe. The people called out, “The voice of a god,
                    and not of a man.” “Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he gave
                    not God the glory, and becoming worm-eaten, he died” (xii. 21-23). Both accounts
                    agree in representing Herod as suddenly struck with disease because he did not
                    check the impiety of his flatterers, but they agree in almost nothing else; aud
                    it is difficult to conceive that the one writer knew the account of the other.
                    Which account is most to be trusted, depends upon the answer given to the
                    question which is the more credible historian.</p>
                <p>The second case relates to the Egyptian mentioned in the question of the tribune
                    to St Paul, in Acts xxi. 38, “You are not then the Egyptian who, some time ago,
                    made a disturbance, and led into the wilderness the four thousand of the
                    sicarii?” Josephus mentions this Egyptian, both in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiquities</hi> (xx. 8, 6) and in the <hi rend="italic">Jewish War</hi> (ii.
                    13, 5). In the <hi rend="italic">Jewish War</hi> (ii. 13, 3), Josephus describes
                    the sicarii, and then passes on, after a short section, to the Egyptian. He
                    states that he collected thirty thousand people, led them out of the wilderness
                    “to the mount called the Mount of Olives, which,” he says <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ant.</hi> xx. 8, 6) in words similar to those in Acts i. 12, “lies opposite to
                    the city five furlongs distant.” On this Felix attacked him, killed some,
                    captured others, and scattered the band. The Egyptian, however, escaped with
                    some followers. Hence the question in the Acts. There are some striking
                    resemblances between the words used by both writers. The numbers differ; but St
                    Luke gives the numbers of the sicarii, Josephus the numbers of the entire
                    multitude led astray.</p>
                <p>The third case is the one which has attracted most attention. In the speech which
                    Gamaliel delivers, in Acts V. 35-39, it is said, “Some time before this, Theudas
                    rose up, saying that he was some one, to whom a number of about four hundred men
                    attached themselves, who was cut off, and all who followed him were broken up
                    and came to nought. After him rose up Judas the Galilean, in the days of the
                    registration, and he took away people after him; and he also perished, and all
                    that followed him were scattered.” On turning to Josephus we find that both
                    Theudas and Judas the Galilean are mentioned. The circumstances related of both
                    are the same as in the Acts, but the dates are different. According to Josephus,
                    Theudas gave himself out as a prophet, in the reign of Claudius, more than ten
                    years after the speech of Gamaliel had been delivered, while Judas appeared at
                    the period of the registration, and therefore a considerable time before
                    Theudas. To explain this difficulty, some have supposed that there may have been
                    another Theudas not mentioned by Josephus, or that Josephus is wrong in his
                    chronology. Others suppose that St Luke made a mistake in regard to Theudas, and
                    is right in regard to Judas. Keim maintains that St Luke has made the mistake,
                    and suggests that possibly it may be based upon the passage of Josephus; and
                    Holtzmann has gone more minutely into this argument. Holtzmann draws attention
                    to the nature of the sections of Josephus which contain the references to
                    Theudas and Judas <hi rend="italic">(Ant. xx.</hi> 5, 1, 2). He says that nearly
                    all the principal statements made in these short sections emerge somewhere in
                    the Acts: the census of Quirinus, the great famine, Alexander as a member of a
                    noble Jewish family, and Ananias as high priest. Moreover, St Luke has preserved
                    the order of Josephus in mentioning Theudas and Judas; but Josephus says “the
                    sons of Judas," whereas St Luke says “Judas.” “Is it not likely,” Holtzmann
                    argues, “that St Luke had before his mind this passage of Josephus, but forgot
                    that it was the sons of Judas that were after Theudas, and not the father?” He
                    adds also, that in the short passage in the Acts there are five peculiar
                    expressions, identical or nearly identical with the expressions used by
                    Josephus, and comes to the conclusion that St Luke knew the works of Josephus.
                    He finds further traces of this knowledge in the circumstance that, in Acts
                    xiii. 20-21, St Luke agrees in his statements with Josephus where both differ
                    from the Old Testament. He also adduces certain Greek words which he supposes St
                    Luke derived from his reading of Josephus. Max Krenkel, in making an addition to
                    this argument, tries to show, from a comparison of passages, that St Luke had
                    Josephus before his mind in the narrative of the childhood of Christ; and he
                    supposes that the expedient attributed to the apostle Paul, of setting the
                    Pharisees against the Sadducees (Acts xxiii. 6), is based upon a similar
                    narrative given in Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Bell. Jud.</hi> ii. 21, 3, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Vita,</hi> 26 ff.). The importance of this investigation is
                    great; for if Holtzmann and Krenkel were to prove their point, a likelihood
                    would be established that the Acts of the Apostles, or at least a portion of it,
                    was written after 93 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the year in which the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiquities</hi> of Josephus was published, according to a passage
                    occurring in the work itself. Meanwhile, the fact that important portions of the
                    narrative must have been written by an eye-witness of the events recorded,
                    combined with the unity of style and purpose in the book, are cogent arguments
                    on the other side.</p>
                <p>The speeches in the Acts deserve special notice. The question occurs here, Did St
                    Luke follow the plan adopted by all historians of his age, or is he a singular
                    exception? The historians of his age claimed the liberty of working up, in their
                    own language, the speeches recorded by them. They did not dream of verbal
                    accuracy; even when they had the exact words of the speakers before them, they
                    preferred to mould the thoughts of the speakers into their own methods of
                    presentation. Besides this, historians do not hesitate to give to the characters
                    of their history speeches which they never uttered. The method of direct speech
                    is useful in producing a vivid idea of what was supposed to pass through the
                    mind of the speaker, and therefore is used continually to make the narrative
                    lively. Now it is generally believed that St Luke has followed the practice of
                    his contemporaries. There are some of his speeches that are evidently the
                    summaries of thoughts that passed through the minds of individuals or of
                    multitudes. Others unquestionably claim to be reports of speeches really
                    delivered. But all these speeches have, to a large extent, the same style as
                    that of the narrative. They have passed to a large extent through the writer’s
                    mind, and are given in his words. They are, moreover, all of them the merest
                    abstracts. The speech of St Paul at Athens, as given by St Luke, would not
                    occupy more than a minute and a half in delivery. The longest speech in the
                    Acts, that of the martyr Stephen, would not take more than ten minutes to
                    deliver. It is not likely that either speech lasted so short a time. But this
                    circumstance, while destroying their verbal accuracy, does not destroy their
                    authenticity; and it must strike all that, in most of the speeches, there is a
                    singular appropriateness, there is an exact fitting-in of the thoughts to the
                    character, and there are occasionally allusions of an obscure nature, which
                    point very clearly to their authenticity. The one strong objection urged against
                    this inference, is that the speeches of St Peter and St Paul show no doctrinal
                    differences, such as are said to appear in the Epistles; but the argument has no
                    force, unless it be proved that St Paul’s doctrine of justification is different
                    from the creed of St Peter or St James.</p>
                <p>Not the least important of the questions which influence critics in determining
                    the authorship of the Acts is that of miracles. Most of those who think that
                    miracles are impossible, come to the conclusion that the narratives containing
                    them are legendary, and accordingly they maintain that the first portion of the
                    Acts, relating to the early <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0142-0127"/> church in. Jerusalem and to St Peter, is in the
                    highest degree untrustworthy. The writer, it is maintained, had no personal
                    knowledge of those early days, and received the stories after they had gone
                    through a long process of transmutation. They appeal, for instance, to the
                    account of the Pentecost, where the miracle of speaking with tongues is
                    described. They say that it is plain, on a comparison of the Epistle to the
                    Corinthians with the Acts, that St Paul meant one thing by the gift of tongues,
                    and the writer of the Acts another. And the inference is at hand that, if the
                    writer had known St Paul, he would have known what the gift of tongues was; and
                    the possibility of such a mistake, it is said, implies a considerable distance
                    from the time of the apostles and the primitive church. They point also to the
                    curious parallelism between the miracles of St Peter and those of St Paul. St
                    Peter begins his series of miracles by healing a lame man (iii. 2); so does St
                    Paul (xiv. 8). St Peter exorcises evil spirits (v. 16; viii. 7); so does St Paul
                    (xix. 15; xvi. 18). If St Peter deals with the magician Simon, St Paul
                    encounters Elymas. If St Peter punishes with death (v. 1 ff.), St Paul punishes
                    with blindness (xiii. 6 ff.). If St Peter works miracles by his shadow (v. 15),
                    not less powerful are the aprons and napkins of St Paul (xix. 12). And, finally,
                    if St Peter can raise Tabitha from the dead (ix. 36), St Paul is equally
                    successful in the case of Eutychus (xx. 9). It is easy to see, also, that since
                    there is no contemporary history with which to compare the statements in the
                    Acts, and since many of the statements are of a summary nature, and very few
                    dates are, given, a critic who believes the narratives legendary will have no
                    difficulty in finding many elements in the narratives confirmatory of his
                    belief. But to those who believe in miracles the rest of the narrative seems
                    plain and unvarnished. The parallelism between the miracles of St Peter and St
                    Paul is accounted for by the fact that they acted in similar circumstances, and
                    that actual events were at hand on which to base the parallelism. At the same
                    time, some who believe in the possibility of miracles think that the Acts
                    presents peculiar difficulties in this matter. They say that the healing by
                    means of shadows and aprons is of a magical nature; that the death of Ananias
                    and Sapphira, and the other destructive miracles, are out of harmony with the
                    rest of the miracles of the New Testament; and that the earthquakes that release
                    St Peter and St Paul seem purposeless. The difficulties on this head, though
                    real, are not however of great importance, nor do they tell very seriously
                    against the received opinion that St Luke is the author of the work.</p>
                <p>We have thus given a general summary of the questions which come up in
                    investigating the authorship of the Acts, and of the arguments used in settling
                    this point. The conclusions based upon this evidence are very different. Some
                    join the traditional opinion of the church to the modern idea of inspiration,
                    and maintain that St Luke was the author of the work, that every discrepancy is
                    merely apparent, and that every speech contains the real and genuine words of
                    the speaker. Others maintain that St Luke is the writer, and that the book is
                    justly placed in the canon; that the narrative is, on the whole, thoroughly
                    trustworthy, and that neither its canonicity nor credibility is affected by the
                    existence of real discrepancies in the narrative. Others hold that St Luke is
                    the author, but that we have got in the book an ordinary narrative, with
                    portions credible and portions incredible; that for the early portions of the
                    work he had to trust mainly to his memory, dulled by distance from the scene of
                    action and by lapse of time, and that he has given what he knew with the
                    uncritical indifference to minute accuracy in time, circumstance, and word,
                    which characterises all his contemporaries. Others maintain that St Luke is the
                    author, but that, being a credulous and unscientific Christian, he recorded
                    indeed in honesty all that he knew, but that he was deluded in his belief of
                    miracles, and is often inaccurate in his statement of facts. Others think that
                    St Luke was not the author of the work. He may have been the original author of
                    the diary of the Apostle Paul’s travels in which the “we”, occurs; but the
                    author of the Acts did not write the diary, but inserted it into his narrative
                    after altering it for a special purpose, and the narrative was written long
                    after St Paul and St Luke were dead. Others think that in the Acts we have the
                    work of Timothy or of Silas, or of some one else. A considerable number imagine
                    that St Luke had different written documents before him while composing, and a
                    very few think that the work is the work of more than one writer. But as we have
                    intimated, the weight of testimony is in favour of St Luke’s authorship.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Purpose.—</hi> We have seen that the Acts of the Apostles is
                    the work of one author possessed of no inconsiderable skill. This author
                    evidently omits many things that he knew; he gives a short account of others of
                    which he could have supplied accurate details, and, as in the case of St Paul,
                    he has brought forward one side of the character prominently, and thrown the
                    other into the shade. What motive could have led him to act thus? What object
                    had he in inserting what he has inserted, and omitting what he has omitted? Most
                    of the answers given to these questions have no important bearing on the
                    question of the authorship of the Acts. But the case is different with the
                    answer of the Tübingen school. The Tübingen school maintains that St Paul taught
                    that the law was of no avail to Jew and Gentile, and that, therefore, the
                    observance of it was unnecessary; that St Peter and the other apostles taught
                    that the observance of the law was necessary, and that they separated from St
                    Paul on this point; and that the early Christians were divided into two great
                    classes—those who held with St Paul, or the Gentile Christians, and those who
                    held with St Peter, or the Jewish Christians. They further maintain that there
                    prevailed a violent controversy between these two parties in the church, until a
                    fusion took place towards the middle of the second half of the second century,
                    and the Catholic Church arose. At what stage of this controversy was the Acts
                    written? is the question they put. St Peter, we have seen, is represented in the
                    Acts as opening the church to the Gentiles. St Peter and the rest of the
                    apostles at Jerusalem admit the Gentiles on certain gentle conditions of
                    refraining from things offered to idols, from animals suffocated, from blood,
                    and from fornication. What could be the object of such statements but to
                    convince the Jewish Christians that they were wrong in pertinaciously adhering
                    to their entire exclusion of the Gentiles, or insisting on their observance of
                    the entire law? But St Paul is represented as observing the law, as sent forth
                    by St Peter and the other apostles, as going continually to the Jews first, and
                    as appearing in the temple and coming up with collections for the Jerusalem
                    church. Was not this also intended to reconcile the Jewish Christians to St
                    Paul? Then the great doctrines of St Paul all but vanish—free grace,
                    justification by faith alone, redemption through the blood of Christ,—all that
                    is characteristic of St Paul disappears, except his universalism, and that is
                    modified by the decree of the apostles, the circumcision of Timothy, and St
                    Paul’s observance of the law. The object of all this, they affirm, must be to
                    reconcile the Jewish party by concessions. But there is said to be also another
                    object, of minor importance indeed, but still quite evident and falling in with
                    the other. Throughout the Acts St Paul is often accused of turning the world
                    upside down and causing disturbances. The Jewish Christians may have thought
                    that St Paul was to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n143/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0143-0128"/> blame in this matter, and that St Paul’s opinions
                    were peculiarly calculated to stir up persecution against the Christians. The
                    stories in the Acts were devised to convince them that they were mistaken in
                    this supposition. On every occasion in which St Paul is accused before
                    magistrates, and especially Roman magistrates, he is acquitted. Gallio, the
                    town-clerk of Ephesus, Lysias, Felix, and Festus, all declare that St Paul has
                    done nothing contrary to the law. And while the Romans thus free him from all
                    blame, it is the Jews who are always accusing him.</p>
                <p>We have here reproduced the argument of Zeller, who has given the most thorough
                    exposition of an opinion held also by Baur, Schwegler, and others. The argument
                    fails to have effect if the assumption that St Paul and St Peter differed
                    radically is rejected. It also suffers from the circumstance, that there is no
                    historical authentication of the church being in such a state in the first half
                    of the second century, that this attempt at reconciliation could take place
                    within it. Moreover, the writing of a fictitious production seems an
                    extraordinary means for any one to employ in order to effect reconciliation,
                    especially if, as Zeller imagines, the church in Rome was specially
                    contemplated. The church in Rome and the other Christian churches had St Paul’s
                    Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, and Galatians before them. They could be in
                    no doubt as to what were his sentiments. They must also have had some history of
                    his career; and no object could be effected by attempting to palm upon them a
                    decree of apostles which never existed, or a history of St Peter and St Paul
                    contradicted by what they knew of both.</p>
                <p>Overbeck, finding this solution of Zeller unsatisfactory, thinks that the object
                    of the Acts is to help the Gentile-Christian Church of the first half of the
                    second century, now far removed from Paulinism and strongly influenced by
                    Judaism, to form a clear idea of its own past, especially of its own origin and
                    of its founder St Paul. It is thus, he maintains, an historical novel, somewhat
                    like the <hi rend="italic">Clementines,</hi> devised to realise the state of the
                    church at an earlier period.</p>
                <p>It would be tedious to enumerate all the other objects which have been set forth
                    as the special aim of the Acts. Some think that it was a work written for the
                    private use of Theophilus, and aimed, therefore, at giving him the special
                    information which he required. Others think that it is intended to describe the
                    spread of the gospel from Jerusalem to Rome. Others believe that the writer
                    wished to defend the character of the Apostle Paul. Some of the more recent
                    members of the Tübingen school think that it was intended to distort the
                    character of St Paul, and that the image of him given in the Acts is an
                    intermediate stage between the real Paul and the caricature supposed by them to
                    be made of him under the name of Simon in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clementines.</hi><hi rend="italic">Date.—</hi> There are no sure data for
                    determining the date. Appeal used to be made to Acts viii. 26, “Unto the way
                    which goeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.” But most probably it
                    is the way which is here said to be desert or lonely. But even if the word
                    “desert” or “lonely” be applied to Gaza, we get nothing out of it. Accordingly,
                    in the absence of data very various dates have been assigned. Some think that it
                    was written at the time mentioned in the last chapter of Acts, when St Paul had
                    been two years in Rome. Some think that it must have been written after the fall
                    of Jerusalem, as they believe that the gospel was written after that event.
                    Irenaeus thought that it was written after the death of St Peter and St Paul
                    (<hi rend="italic">H.</hi> iii. 1). Others think that St Luke must have written
                    it at a late period of his life, about the year 80 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> The Tübingen school think that it was written some time in the second
                    century, most of them agreeing on the second or third decade of that century,
                    about 125 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> They argue that a late date is proved
                    by the nature of the purpose which occasioned the work, by the representation
                    which it gives of the relation of the Christians to the Roman state, and by the
                    traces of Gnosticism (xx. 29), and of a hierarchical constitution of the church
                    (i. 17, 20; viii. 14, ff.; xv. 28; xx. 17, 28) to be found in the Acts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Place.—</hi> There is no satisfactory evidence by which to
                    settle the place of composition. Later fathers of the church and the
                    subscriptions of late MSS. mention Achaia, Attica, Alexandria, Macedonia, and
                    Rome. And these places have all had their supporters in modern times. Some have
                    also tried to show that it was written in Asia Minor, probably at Ephesus. The
                    most likely supposition is that it was written at Rome; Zeller has argued with
                    great plausibility for this conclusion.</p>
                <p>There is a large literature on the subject of this article, but the most
                    important treatises are those of Schwanbeck, Schneckenburger, Lekebusch, Zeller,
                    Trip, Klostermann, and (Ertel. Zeller’s work deserves special praise for its
                    thoroughness. Various other writers have discussed the subject in works dealing
                    with this among others; as Baur in his <hi rend="italic">Paulus;</hi> Schwegler
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Nachapostolisches Zeitalter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> Ewald in his <hi rend="italic">History of Israel;</hi> Renan in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Apostles;</hi> Hausrath in his <hi rend="italic">New Testament
                    History;</hi> and, in a more conservative manner, Neander, Baumgarten, Lechler,
                    Thiersch, and Lange. Of commentaries, the best on the Tübingen side is that of
                    De Wette, remodelled by Overbeck, and that of the more conservative Meyer is
                    especially good. In English we have an able treatment of the subject in Dr
                    Davidson’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Study of the New
                    Testament;</hi> we have commentaries by Biscoe, Humphry, Hackett, Cook,
                    Wordsworth, Alford, and Gloag; and dissertations by Paley, Birks, Lewin,
                    Conybeare, and Howson.</p>
                <p>There are various other treatises claiming to be Acts of Apostles. One or two of
                    these must have existed at an early date, though, no doubt, they have since
                    received large interpolations. But most of them belong to a late period, and all
                    of them are acknowledged to be apocryphal. They are edited by Tischendorf in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Apostolorum</hi><hi rend="italic"
