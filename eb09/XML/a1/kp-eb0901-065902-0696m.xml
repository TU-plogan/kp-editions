                    rend="italic">;</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic">Bernstein)</hi> is a hard, brittle
                    substance with a resinous lustre, sometimes found perfectly transparent, but
                    more usually of varying degrees of translucency, and possessing a prevailing
                    yellow colour, passing from a pale straw tint to a deep orange. It occurs in
                    irregular masses, and has neither taste nor, at ordinary temperatures, odour. It
                    develops electrical phenomena by friction, a property which doubtless early drew
                    attention to amber, and invested it with the romantic interest which attached to
                    it in ancient times. The popular regard for the substance among the nations of
                    antiquity was further maintained by the fabulous tales of the manner in which
                    amber was formed and the mystery connected with its occurrence.</p>
                <p>The earliest notice of amber we find occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>
                    of Homer, where in the list of jewels offered by Phoenician traders to the Queen
                    of Syra occurs “the gold necklace hung with bits of amber" <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Od.</hi> xv. 460). Thales of Miletus, 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    noticed that amber when rubbed attracted light bodies, and that remote and
                    simple observation is the foundation of the modem science of <hi rend="italic"
                    >electricity,</hi> so named from the Greek ηλεκτρov. Among the Greek fables
                    purporting to account for the origin of amber, it is narrated that the Heliadae,
                    on seeing their brother Phaethon hurled by the lightning of Jove into the
                    Eridanus, were by the pitying gods transformed into poplar trees, and the tears
                    they shed were dropped as amber on the shores of the river. Hence arose the
                    Greek term for amber, 'Hλ <hi rend="italic">∈</hi><hi rend="italic">κτωρ</hi>
                    being one of the names of the sun god. A less poetical theory of its origin
                    states that it was formed from the condensed urine of the lynx inhabiting
                    northern Italy, the pale varieties being produced by the females, while the
                    deeper tints were attributed to males. In such repute was amber in Rome in the
                    time of Pliny that he sarcastically remarks, “the price of a small figure in it,
                    however diminutive, exceeds that of a living healthy slave.” Besides its
                    application to jewellery and carved ornaments, and its use, partly decorative
                    and partly prophylactic, as necklaces, peculiar virtues were attributed to it.
                    Pliny observes—“True it is that a collar of amber beads worn about the necks of
                    young infants is a singular preservative to them against secret poison, and a
                    counter-charm for witchcraft and sorceries.” As an article of personal
                    ornamentation, the same authority states that amber was used to produce
                    imitations of precious stones by artificial staining, a use to which it was
                    peculiarly adapted owing to its brilliant lustre combined with the ease with
                    which it could be worked and polished.</p>
                <p>The great source of supply of amber in all ages appears to have been the Baltic
                    coasts, from which the supplies of commerce still continue to be drawn. During
                    the reign of Nero an expedition was sent from Rome to explore the
                    amber-producing country, and so successful was the party that a present of
                    13,000 lb of amber was brought back to the emperor, including a piece weighing
                    13 lb. It occurs in regular veins along the Baltic coast, but in greatest
                    abundance between Pillau and Grosz Hubenicken, on the Prussian coast. Professor
                    Phillips thus describes the mines :—</p>
                <p>“Near the sea-coast in Prussia there are regular mines for the working of amber:
                    under a stratum of sand and clay, about 20 feet thick, a stratum of bituminous
                    wood occurs, from 40 to 50 feet thick, of a blackish brown colour, and
                    impregnated with pyrites. Parts of these trees are impregnated with amber, which
                    sometimes is found in stalactites depending from them. Under the stratum of
                    trees were found pyrites, sulphate of iron, and coarse sand, in which were
                    rounded masses of amber. The mine is worked to the depth of 100 feet; and from
                    the circumstances under which the amber is found it seems plain that it
                    originates from vegetable juices.”</p>
                <p>After heavy storms large quantities are usually found thrown up on the coast at
                    the localities where it is regularly excavated, and the assumption is, that
                    amberifer-ous deposits crop up in the shallow waters near the shores, from which
                    pieces become detached during the violent commotion of the water. It is further
                    sparingly cast on the Swedish and Danish coasts, and occasionally pieces are
                    picked up along the shores of Norfolk, Essex, and Sussex in England. It occurs
                    at numerous localities inland throughout Europe, among which may be noted the
                    neighbourhood of Basle in Switzerland, the departments of Aisne, Loire, Gard,
                    and Bas Rhin in France, and in the Paris clay it is associated with bituminous
                    deposits. In England it has been found in the sandy deposits of the London clay
                    at Kensington. The coasts of Sicily and the Adriatic likewise afford amber. The
                    most beautiful specimens are perhaps those which are found at Catania. They
                    often possess a beautiful play of colour, approaching to purple, not to be
                    observed in the product of other places. Professor Dana gives the following note
                    on its occurrence in America :—</p>
                <p>“It has been found in various parts of the greensand formation of the United
                    States, either loosely embedded in the soil or engaged in marl or lignite, as at
                    Gay Head or Mather’s Vineyard, near Trenton, and also at Camden, in New Jersey,
                    and at Capo Sable, near Magothy river, in Maryland.” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n697/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0697-0660"/> It is said to be taken in large quantities from
                    the north of Burmah to the markets of China, where it is highly prized.</p>
                <p>The appearance of enclosed foreign bodies, such as insects, leaves, twigs,
                    &amp;c., which amber very often presents, and the markings on its surface, very
                    early led to correct inferences as to its origin* Pliny states that “amber is an
                    exudation from trees of the pine family, like gum from the cherry and resin from
                    the ordinary pine; and in accordance with this opinion is its Latin name <hi
                    rend="italic">succinum,</hi> the gum-stone. The opinion expressed by Pliny is
                    that which at the present day may be fairly held as established; but of course
                    amber differs from other resins owing to changes induced by its fossilised
                    condition. Sir David Brewster has pointed out that in optical properties it
                    agrees with other resinous exudations. The insects found enclosed in amber are
                    for the most part of extinct species, and so also are the remains of plants. A
                    species of conifer has been established provisionally as the amber-yielding
                    tree, <hi rend="italic">Pinites succinifer,</hi> but Göppert has shown that many
                    trees may have yielded the exudation, and these not all necessarily belonging to
                    the pine order.</p>
                <p>The close relation of amber to ordinary resins is further brought out by its
                    chemical properties and composition. According to Berzelius, it consists mainly
                    of a resin, succinite, insoluble in alcohol, in combination with small
                    proportions of two others, isomeric with the first, but soluble in alcohol and
                    ether. By dry distillation it gives off at a low temperature water, succinic
                    acid, and oil of amber, which last substance was formerly used in medicine in
                    combination with alcohol and ammonia under the name of <hi rend="italic">eau de
                    luce;</hi> but now amber and all its products have disappeared from the standard
                    pharmacopoeias. Its composition is, according to Schrötter—</p>
                <p> Carbon 78 94 </p>
                <p>Hydrogen 10 ∙ 53</p>
                <p>Oxygen . 10 ∙ 53</p>
                <p>and mineralogically it belongs to Dana’s class of oxygenated hydrocarbons. It
                    burns with a pale yellow flame, with a good deal of black smoke, evolving an
                    agreeable odour, and leaving a shining black carbonaceous residue.</p>
                <p>It is said that by exposing amber covered with sand in an iron pot to the
                    influence of heat for forty hours, or boiling it for twenty hours in rape oil,
                    it will become transparent, and pieces will cement and mould together. The great
                    size of vessels of amber which have come down from ancient times suggests the
                    probability of some such art being practised in remote periods. It is now
                    applied to few useful purposes among western nations beyond forming the
                    mouthpieces for tobacco-pipes and cigar-holders. Fine pieces are in some demand
                    for public collections and for the purposes of the carver. In the East, besides
                    its being highly prized for ornamental purposes, a feeling of veneration for its
                    mystic properties still enhances its value. The Turks esteem it highly as a
                    mouthpiece for tobacco pipes, and believe that it resists the transmission of
                    infection. The principal demand for the amber of commerce is among the
                    Armenians, through whom it is conveyed to Egypt, Persia, China, and Japan; and a
                    great quantity is purchased to be consumed at the shrine of Mahomet by the
                    pilgrims bound to Mecca. The value of amber depends upon its colour, its lustre,
                    and its size. In 1576 a mass weighing 11 lb was found in Prussia, and deemed
                    worthy of being presented to the emperor; later, a mass of 13 lb was found, for
                    which it is said 5000 dollars were refused. In the royal cabinet at Berlin a
                    piece is shown weighing 18 lb; but such masses are of very great rarity.</p>
