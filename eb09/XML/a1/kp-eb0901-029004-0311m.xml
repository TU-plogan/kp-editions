                    accompanied Luther to the great assembly of German divines at Leipsic, and acted
                    as recording secretary. After teaching for some time in Wittenberg, he went to
                    Frankfort in 1525 to establish the worship according to the reformed religion.
                    He had resided there only a month when he was induced to go to Eisleben, where
                    he remained till 1526 as teacher in the school of St Andrew, and preacher in the
                    Nicolai church, enjoying great popularity in the latter capacity. In 1536 he was
                    recalled to Wittenberg to fill a professorial chair, and was welcomed by Luther.
                    Almost immediately afterwards, however, a controversy, which had been begun ten
                    years before and been temporarily silenced, broke out afresh with greater
                    violence. Agricola was the first to teach the views which Luther was the first
                    to stigmatise by the now well-known name <hi rend="italic">Antinomian.</hi> He
                    held that while the unregenerate were still under the law, Christians were
                    entirely free from it, being under the gospel alone. He denied that Christians
                    owed subjection to any part of the law, even the Decalogue, as a rule of life.
                    Luther conducted the argument with his usual vehemence, and there was in the
                    heat of controversy probably a good deal of misrepresentation on both sides. In
                    1540 Agricola left Wittenberg secretly for Berlin, where he published a letter
                    addressed to the elector of Saxony, which was generally interpreted as a
                    recantation of his obnoxious views. Luther, however, seems not to have so
                    accepted it, and Agricola remained at Berlin. The elector Joachim II. of
                    Brandenburg having taken him into his favour, appointed him court preacher and
                    general superintendent. He held both offices until his death in 1566, and his
                    career in Brandenburg was one of great activity and great influence. Along with
                    tho Catholic bishops Von Pflug and Michael Halding he prepared the Augsburg
                    Interim of 1548. Agricola wrote a number of theological works which are now of
                    little interest. He was the first to make a collection of German proverbs, which
                    he illustrated with an appropriate commentary. The most complete edition is that
                    published at Wittenberg in 1592.</p>
