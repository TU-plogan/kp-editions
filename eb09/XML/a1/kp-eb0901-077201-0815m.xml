                    which they were connected; and hence in later times, by an inverse process, the
                    name was derived from Amphictyon, one of the fabulous kings of Attica.</p>
                <p>Similar religious confederations existed in Greece at a very early period, and
                    there is reason to believe that at their stated assemblies they discussed
                    questions of international law and matters affecting their political union as
                    well as religious subjects. Gradually, however, the political influence of the
                    Amphictyonies died away. As states of great power stood on an equality with
                    insignificant tribes in the number of votes, they naturally prevented the
                    settlement of important political matters in such an assembly. Accordingly,
                    during the flourishing period of Greek history the Amphictyonies almost
                    disappear. They are not mentioned in Thucydides and Xenophon. But they appear
                    again in vigour in the time of Philip, and become engines by which political
                    parties, under pretence of religious zeal for the interests of the gods, wreak
                    their vengeance on their rivals and antagonists.</p>
                <p>Th13 is especially true of the Amphictyony of Delphi, the most important of all
                    these associations. Though we know better about this confederation than about
                    any other, yet many particulars are hidden in obscurity, and considerable doubts
                    gather around others of which we know something. The Amphictyony existed in very
                    early times, and Aeschines states that it arose when the temple at Delphi was
                    first built. It is more likely, however, that it was originally connected with
                    Thermopylae and the temple of Demeter Amphictyonis which was there. The
                    Amphictyony consisted of a union of twelve tribes, each of which had a right to
                    two votes. These tribes were for the most part Thessalian or bordering on
                    Thessaly; and it is probable that the others, as the Dorians and Ionians, gained
                    admission in consequence of colonies that came to them from Thessaly. <hi
                    rend="italic">~∙ι</hi></p>
                <p>There are nine lists of the tribes that constituted the Delphic Amphictyony in
                    the classical writers and in inscriptions. Of these only one is complete', and
                    the «rest differ from each other in some particulars. The one that is complete
                    was found on a Delphic stone containing a decree of the Amphictyonie council
                    ⅛⅛regard to money due to the Delphic treasury. On this stone are given the votes
                    of each tribe, and the final decision of the council in harmony with the
                    majority of votes for one of the opinions held. The list is as follows :—The
                    Delphians, two votes; Thessalians, two votes; Phocians, two votes; Dorians from
                    Metropolis, one vote; the Dorians from Peloponnesus, one vote; the Athenians,
                    one vote; the Eubceans, one vote; the Boeotians, two votes; the Achaean
                    Phthiots, two votes; the Malians, one vote; the CEteans, one vote; the
                    Dolopians, one vote; the Perrhaebians, one vote; the Magnetes, two votes; the
                    Aenianes, two votes; the Locri Hypocnemidii, one vote; the Locri Hesperii, one
                    vote. The exact date of the decree recorded on the Delphic stone is matter of
                    dispute, but the most probable conjecture places it about the year 130 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> We have therefore clear testimony as to the
                    constitution of the Amphictyonie council at this date; and, starting from this,
                    we can form some idea of the changes which took place in the members of the
                    council. It is generally believed that no change took place in the tribes
                    forming the league till the time of the second sacred war, 345 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Of these tribes Aeschines gives us a list, with the
                    omission of one. They are the Thessalians, Boeotians, Dorians, Ionians,
                    Perrhaebians, Magnetes, Locri, Oeteans, Phthiots, Malians, Phocians; and there
                    can be little doubt that it is the Dolopians who have been by some mistake
                    omitted. The confusions in some of the other lists have arisen probably from the
                    ignorance of transcribers, who did not know that the Aenianes and Oeteans lived
                    close to each other, and were often comprehended under the same name, and who
                    made two tribes of the Achaean Phthiots, Achaeane and Phthiots. Aeschines says
                    that all these tribes had equal right of voting; but the inscription on the
                    Delphic stone shows that the two votes of one tribe might be divided among two
                    different portions of it. At the conclusion of the Phocian war the Phocians were
                    excluded, and the Macedonians received their votes; and the vote of the
                    Lacedaemonians was given to the other Doric tribes of Peloponnesus. The
                    Delphians also obtained votes, either at this time or after the third sacred
                    war, 338 B.C., by some of the smaller tribes that had two votes being restricted
                    to one. In the same way, and also by the exclusion of the Locri Ozolae, the
                    Aetolians secured a place in the council in 338 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    and gradually took possession of a great number of votes. The Phocians were
                    restored to their place in 279 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> on account of
                    their gallant resistance to the Gauls. Finally, the Aetolians and Macedonians
                    were excluded from the council, and the constitution of the council as given in
                    the Delphic stone was formed. The last change mentioned in classical writers is
                    detailed by Pausanias, but the passage is evidently corrupt. Augustus wished to
                    give votes to Nicopolis, and for this purpose so altered the constitution of the
                    council as to make the votes thirty in number.</p>
                <p>The objects of the league are distinctly expressed in the oath which the
                    Amphictyons had to take, and which is preserved in Aeschines’s oration “De Falsa
                    Legatione.” This oath bound the Amphictyons not to destroy any of the
                    Amphictyonie towns, not to turn away its running waters either in time of war or
                    in time of peace; and if any one should attempt to rob the temple of Delphi (the
                    common centre of the confederacy), to employ their hands, feet, tongue, and
                    their whole power to bring him to punishment The humanising influence which this
                    and other enactments of the confederacy were intended to exercise, is
                    perceptible in the part relating to war. The framer of the law evidently
                    regarded war only as an unavoidable means of settling disputée between two
                    states; but it was to be carried on only for the purpose of bringing the dispute
                    to a decision, and not for destruction and devastation. Another enactment
                    probably was that the inhabitants of a conquered city should not be sold as
                    slaves. But the chief care of the Amphictyons appears to have been to watch over
                    the temple, to punish those who were guilty of a crime against it, and to reward
                    those who did anything to increase its splendour and glory.</p>
                <p>There is difficulty in determining how often the Amphictyons met. But the most
                    likely inference from the somewhat indefinite statements of ancient writers is,
                    that they went twice every year both to Delphi and Thermopylae, in spring and in
                    autumn. There is also some difficulty in determining the relative positions of
                    the two sets of officials named in connection with the Amphictyony, the
                    Hieromnemones and the Pylagoroi or Pylagorai. But there can scarcely be a doubt
                    that the Hieromnemon was the principal official. There were as many
                    Hieromnemones as there were votes; and the Hieromnemones were alone entitled to
                    vote. The assembly proper consisted therefore only of the Hieromnemones. It is
                    most likely that the Hieromnemones were elected annually by lot. In the case of
                    the smaller states it is probable that the right to elect <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n816/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0816-0773"/> went round by turns, while the more important
                    states sent their representatives every year. There might be several Pylagoroi
                    from each state. Aeschiues mentions that there were on one occasion three from
                    Athens. They were elected by vote. Their function seems to have been to advise
                    with the Hieromnemon, to address the assembly when anything relating to their
                    own state was discussed, and to bring all their influence to bear on the
                    assembly on behalf of their own state. The office of Hieromnemon remained in
                    high honour till a late period. When the Dionysiae theatre in Athens was
                    excavated in 1862, a chair of honour was found with the inscription <hi
                    rend="italic">lepoμ,vημovoζ,</hi> and as it is certain that dramatic exhibitions
                    took place in this theatre in the time of the Antonines, the office of
                    Hieromnemon must have existed at that period. ∙'∙∙∙ ~ ·</p>
                <p>The meetings, however, were attended not only by the deputies, but by thousands
                    of others who flocked to Delphi or Thermopylae for religious and mercantile
                    purposes, or only for the sake of amusement. This occasioned popular meetings
                    <hi rend="italic">(eκκληcriai)</hi> distinct from those of the regular deputies.
                    But we cannot suppose that all the Greeks indiscriminately were allowed to take
                    part in those popular assemblies, which must have consisted of visitors from the
                    states which were members of the Amphictyony.</p>
                <p>Wise and humane as were the objects of the Amphic-tyons, yet wherever they
                    actively interfered in the affairs of Greece during the historical period, we
                    find that they were more powerful for evil than for good; and the holy wars
                    which were carried on by them in the defence of the Delphic temple and the
                    honour of its god, contributed not a little to the demoralisation of the
                    Greeks.</p>
                <p>The very first time that the Amphictyons interfered in the affairs of Greece we
                    find them acting in direct opposition to the spirit of their institution. We
                    allude to the Crissaean or first sacred war, which broke out in 594, and lasted
                    till 585 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The inhabitants of Crissa (or Cirrha),
                    on the Corinthian Gulf, were charged with extortion and violence towards the
                    strangers who landed at their port, or passed through their territory on their
                    way to Delphi. For this the Amphictyons declared war against Crissa, and it was
                    vigorously carried on by the Thessalians and Cleisthenes, the tyrant of Sicyon.
                    They even pretended to have the sanction of Apollo to dedicate the Crissaeans
                    and their territory to the god, to enslave them, and make their land a waste for
                    ever. The war is said to have been terminated by a stratagem of Solon, who
                    poisoned the waters of the river Pleistos, from which the town was supplied.
                    When the town was taken, the vow of the Amphictyons was literally carried into
                    effect: Crissa was razed to the ground, its harbour choked up, and its fertile
                    plain changed into a wilderness. Such was the terrible vengeance taken by a body
                    of confederates, whose original object was to prevent those very things which
                    they now perpetrated to uphold the honour of the deity presiding over them. The
                    second sacred war, which likewise lasted for ten years, from 355 to 346 B.C.,
                    was carried on with unparalleled exasperation for all that period, and nearly
                    all the Greeks took part in it. The Thebans had set their hearts upon conquering
                    Phocis, but screened their designs behind a charge preferred against the
                    Locrians, alleging that they had robbed the temple of Delphi, because they had
                    taken into cultivation a tract of land belonging to the Delphic temple. The
                    Amphictyonie council, before which the charge was brought, condemned the
                    Phocians to pay a heavy fine, and to destroy the crops of the sacred fields. No
                    sooner was this verdict pronounced than the Thebans, Thessalians, Locrians, and
                    CEteans took up arms to execute it. The Phocians were joined by Athens and
                    Sparta, and took possession of the temple of Delphi and its treasures, which
                    they were obliged to employ in defraying the expenses of the war. The war was
                    carried on with unexampled cruelty, for even the surrender of the dead for
                    burial was refused, and all Phocian captives were put to death. This war also
                    afforded Philip of Macedonia an opportunity to interfere in the affairs of
                    Greece. Being invited by the Thessalians to co-operate with them against the
                    Phocians, Philip and his Macedonians acted as the champions of the god, and
                    defeated the Phocians in a bloody battle near Magnesia. Three thousand captive
                    Phocians were put to death. The latter, however, remained undaunted until at
                    length they were compelled by treachery to surrender. The Amphictyons now
                    excluded them for ever from the league, their arms and horses were to be
                    delivered up, their towns to be destroyed, and the people were henceforth to
                    live in small villages, and to pay annually to the god sixty talents (about
                    £15,000) until the temple should be completely indemnified. Macedonian and
                    Theban troops carried the judgment into execution; twenty-two towns disappeared
                    from the face of the earth, and the otherwise fertile country remained for many
                    years a wilderness. A third sacred war was decreed against the town of Amphissa,
                    because its inhabitants had taken into cultivation the plain of Crissa; but in
                    reality the war was brought about by the venal creatures who endeavoured to
                    promote the ambitious schemes of Philip of Macedon, who was bent upon making
                    himself master of Greece. This war broke out in 338 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and its unfortunate consequences led to the catastrophe which
                    deprived Greece of her independence in the battle of Chaeronea. Such is a brief
                    outline of the history of the Delphic Amphictyony, which not only itself
                    violated its first principles, but is not known to have ever raised its voice to
                    condemn the wanton destruction of other Amphictyonie towns, such as Plataeae and
                    Thebes.</p>
                <p>There were many other confederations of a similar kind, some of which, however,
                    do not bear the name of Amphictyonies in the authorities from which we derive
                    our information regarding them. The following were among the most noted :— -</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Amphictyony of Calauria,</hi> an island near Troezen,
                    consisted of the seven states of Hermione, Epidaurus, Aegina, Athens, Prasiae,
                    Nauplia, and the Minyan Orchomenos. These states took part in the sacrifices
                    which were offered up in the temple of Poseidon, situated on the island. Sparta
                    and Argos displaced Nauplia and Prasiae when these lost their independence. It
                    is difficult to see what object could unite states so widely apart. Some suppose
                    that the tribes forming the league were originally Ionian; others, that they all
                    were interested in the defence of seaports against inland states.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Amphictyony of Onchestos,</hi> in the territory of Haliartus
                    in Boeotia, was likewise connected with the temple of Poseidon. As at all other
                    Amphictyonies, the meetings of the members were celebrated with various
                    religious rites, solemnities, and public games. We do not know the nations that
                    constituted this league.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Amphictyony of Amarynthos,</hi> in Euboea, connected with
                    the temple of Artemis. We know that the two towns of Eretria and Chalcis were
                    members of it, and that there existed an ancient treaty by which these two
                    cities pledged themselves not to use against each other any missiles thrown from
                    afar. '</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Amphictyony of Delos,</hi> connected with the temple of
                    Apollo, was a league formed among the inhabitants of the Cyclades and the
                    Ionians in the neighbourhood. Its institution was ascribed to Theseus. The
                    solemnities connected with its meetings gradually fell into disuse, until they
                    were revived and increased in 426 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when the
                    island of Delos was purified by the Athenians. The Athenian¾ after this time,
                    regularly sent an annual embassy to Delos, and <pb break="no"

                    superintendence of the temple and the administration of its treasures.</p>
