                    theologian and philosopher, was born in 1647 at Westminster, and was educated at
                    the collegiate school there, under Dr Busby. In 1662 he entered Christ Church
                    College, Oxford, with which he continued to be intimately connected during his
                    whole life. He took so conspicuous a part in the controversy with the Roman
                    Catholics during the reign of James IL, that at the Revolution the deanery of
                    Christ Church was conferred upon him, Massey, the popish dean, having fled to
                    the continent. In 1702 he was appointed rector of Wem in Shropshire, but
                    continued to reside at Oxford, where he died on the 14th Dec. 1710. He was
                    buried in the cathedral without any memorial, at his own desire. Aldrich was a
                    man of unusually varied gifts. He is best known as the author of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Compendium Artis</hi><hi rend="italic">Logicae,</hi> a work of
                    almost no value in itself, but historically important as being for upwards of a
                    century the manual in exclusive use at Oxford. His claims to distinction as a
                    musician and an architect, though not so widely recognised, are much better
                    founded than his reputation as a logician. He composed a number of anthems and
                    church services of very considerable merit, which are still frequently sung in
                    cathedrals. He also adapted much of the music of Palestrina and Carissimi to
                    English words with great skill and judgment. The catch “Hark, the bonny Christ
                    Church bells” is one of his most admired compositions in the lighter style.
                    Aldrich wrote a treatise on architecture; and practical evidence of his skill in
                    the art may be seen in the church and campanile of All Saints, Oxford, and in
                    three sides of the so-called Peckwater Quadrangle of Christ Church College,
                    which were erected after his designs.</p>
                <p>In classical scholarship Dr Aldrich had some reputation. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musae Anglicanoe</hi> contains two specimens of his Latin verse, the subjects
                    being the accession of King William and the death of the Duke of Gloucester. A
                    humorous Latin version by Aldrich of the popular ballad—</p>

                    by the following epigram, entitled “Causae Bibendi,” which some, however, have
                    ascribed to Père Sirmond :—</p>
