                    Greek Bible. The MS. was presented in the year 1628 to King Charles I. through
                    his ambassador at the Porte, Sir Thomas Rowe, by Cyrillus Lucaris, patriarch of
                    Constantinople. There seems no good reason to doubt that Cyrillus had brought
                    the document from Alexandria, where he had held the office of patriarch,
                    although Wetstein is of opinion, upon what seems inadequate evidence, that he
                    procured it from the monastery of Mount Athos, where he had resided prior to his
                    coming to Alexandria. It was transferred in 1753 from the king’s private library
                    to that of our national museum, where the volume containing the text of the New
                    Testament is now, or was lately, open to public inspection under a glass case.
                    The entire MS. consists of four small folio volumes, three of which contain the
                    text of the Old, and one that of the New Testament. The portion, however,
                    containing the Old Testament is more complete than that which contains the New,
                    the <hi rend="italic">lacunae</hi> in the former occurring chiefly in the book
                    of Psalms; while in the New Testament the following portions are wanting—viz.,
                    the whole of Matthew’s Gospel up to chap. xxv. 6, from John vi. 50 to viii. 52,
                    and from 2 Cor. iv. 13 to xii. 6. Occasionally, also, single letters, as well as
                    the titles of certain divisions, have been destroyed by the operations of the
                    bookbinder. The material of which the MS. is composed is very thin vellum, the
                    page being about 13 inches high by 10 broad, containing from 50 to 52 lines in
                    each page, each line consisting of about 20 letters. The number of pages is 773,
                    of which 640 are occupied with the text of the Old Testament, and 133 with that
                    of the New. The characters are <hi rend="italic">uncial,</hi> but larger than in
                    the Vatican MS. B. There are no accents or breathings, no spaces between the
                    letters or words save at the end of a paragraph; and the contractions, which are
                    not numerous, are only such as are found in the oldest MSS., and are indicated
                    by a line drawn over the word which is abbreviated, as ΘΣ for Θεoς. The
                    punctuation consists of a point placed at the end of a sentence, usually on a
                    level with the top of the preceding letter. As regards the date of the MS. very
                    opposite opinions have been held. One critic placed it as low down as the 10th
                    century, but this supposition has been justly characterised by Tregelles as so
                    opposed to all that is known of palaeography as not to deserve a serious
                    refutation. From the circumstance that the MS. does not exhibit any traces of
                    <hi rend="italic">stichometry—</hi> a mode of arranging the text in lines
                    consisting of a larger or smaller number of words, at the end of which the
                    reader was to pause, which was applied to the Pauline epistles by Euthalius of
                    Alexandria in the year 458, and which soon came into general use—it has been
                    inferred that the MS. is not of later date than the middle of the 5th century.
                    Again, the presence, in the text of the Gospels of the Ammonian sections and
                    Eusebian canons, and of the epistle of Athanasius (who died in 373) to
                    Marcellinus, which is prefixed to the Psalms, shows that it could not be older
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n534/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0534-0497"/> than the end of the 4th century. In addition to
                    this external testimony, palaeographic reasons, such as the general style of the
                    writing, and the formation of certain letters, would seem to refer the MS. to
                    about the middle of the 5th century, and this date is now generally acquiesced
                    in by scholars. There is an Arabic inscription, indeed, written on the page
                    which contains the list of the various books of the Old and New Testament, which
                    states that the MS. was written by the hand of the martyr Thecla, while a Latin
                    inscription by Cyril himself gives the tradition that the Thecla who wrote the
                    MS. was a noble Egyptian lady who lived shortly after the Council of Nice. No
                    reliance, however, can be placed on these statements, for, according to
                    Scrivener,</p>
                <p>“Tregelles explains the origin of the Arabic inscription on which Cyril’s
                    statement appears to rest, by remarking that the New Testament in our MS. at
                    present commences with Matt. xxv. 6, this lesson (Matt. xxv. 1-13) <hi
                    rend="italic">being that appointed by the Greek Church for the festival of St
                    Thecla.</hi> The Egyptian, therefore, who wrote this Arabic note, observing the
                    name of Thecla in the now mutilated upper margin of the codex, where such
                    rubrical notes are commonly placed by later hands, hastily concluded that she
                    wrote the book, and thus has perplexed our biblical critics. It is hardly too
                    much to say that Tregelles’s shrewd conjecture seems to be certain, almost to
                    demonstration.”</p>
                <p>This MS. contains the last twelve verses of St Mark’s Gospel. It is defective in
                    that part of St John’s Gospel where the <hi rend="italic">pericope</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">adulterae</hi> occurs in the ordinary text, but Scrivener shows by
                    an enumeration of the letters in each page that the two missing leaves did not
                    contain the suspected passage. It is almost unnecessary to say that 1 John v. 7
                    is not found in this or in any uncial MS. of the New Testament. The reading of
                    the MS. in 1 Tim. iii. 16 has given rise to a good deal of discussion. Woide in
                    his fac-simile edition gave the reading ΘΣ for ΘEOΣ. The element of uncertainty
                    was whether the cross bar of the theta had not been added by a later hand, so
                    that the original reading may have been OΣ. Bishop Ellicott carefully examined
                    the passage with the aid of a strong lens, and the result of his investigation,
                    as given in a note appended to his Critical Commentary on First Timothy, in his
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Pastoral Epistles,</hi> was to satisfy him that
                    the original reading was ός, the cross bar of the theta having arisen from the
                    central line of ∈ in the word ε <hi rend="italic">υσ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ε</hi><hi rend="italic">βεία</hi>, which is directly opposite, shining through
                    the leaf, and being mistaken by a scribe for part of the theta, and being
                    touched up accordingly,—a view which was maintained by Wetstein. On the other
                    hand, both Tregelles and Scrivener, who made the same investigation, are of
                    opinion that the stroke of the epsilon cuts the theta much too high to be
                    mistaken by any ordinary scribe for the cross bar of the theta. When critics of
                    such distinguished reputation differ, the question of the original reading will
                    probably remain for ever uncertain.</p>
                <p>The first use that was made of the MS. for critical purposes was by Bishop
                    Walton, who had the various readings which it presents inserted in his great
                    Polyglott Bible, under the texts of the Septuagint and New Testament
                    respectively. It was collated by both Mill and Wetstein for their editions of
                    the Greek Testament. In 1786 the New Testament was published in a fac-simile
                    edition by Dr Woide, at that time librarian to the British Museum; the types of
                    this edition were cut so as to represent the general appearance of the letters;
                    and the edition exhibits the MS. page for page, line for line, and letter for
                    letter. The work was accompanied by valuable prolegomena on the history, age,
                    &amp;c., of the MS.; and is allowed to have been executed with remarkable
                    accuracy. In 1828 the Rev. H. H. Baber completed the publication of the Old
                    Testament portion in three large folio volumes (1816-1828) also in fac-simile,
                    with useful prolegomena and notes.</p>
                <p>Tischendorf considers the editorial accuracy of Baber as inferior to that of
                    Woide, and enumerates a number of instances where the readings of the original
                    have been incorrectly given by Baber (Prolegomena to Tischendorf’s 4th ed. of
                    the Septuagint, p. 69, <hi rend="italic">sq</hi>.) In 1860 the text of the New
                    Testament was published in common type by B. H. Cowper, the defective portions
                    being supplied from Küster’s edition of Mill’s Greek Testament, and some
                    inaccuracies in Woide’s edition corrected from the original. In 1864 there was
                    published at Oxford, under the editorship of Mr Hansell, the text of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Alexandrinus,</hi> along with that of
                    three of the most ancient MSS., viz., <hi rend="italic">Codd.</hi> B, C, D, with
                    the Dublin <hi rend="italic">Cod.</hi> Z, and a collation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cod. Sinaiticus.</hi> The work is arranged in parallel columns,
                    and thus presents, at one view, the readings of four of our earliest authorities
                    for the text of the New Testament. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. c.)</hi></p>
