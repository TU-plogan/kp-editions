                    public, and they found what they wanted in Almon. He had become personally known
                    to the leaders through various publications of his own which had a great though
                    transient popularity; the more important of these being <hi rend="italic">The
                    Conduct of a late Noble Commander</hi> [Lord George Sackville] <hi rend="italic"
                    >Examined</hi> (1759); a <hi rend="italic">Review of the Reign of George
                    II.,</hi> published on the death of that monarch; a <hi rend="italic">Review of
                    Mr Pitt’s Administration</hi> (1761); and a collection of letters on political
                    subjects. The review of Pitt’s administration passed through four editions, and
                    secured for its author the friendship of Lord Temple, to whom it was dedicated.
                    Being thus in the counsels of the party, he was persuaded in 1763 to open a
                    bookseller’s shop in Piccadilly, chiefly for the publication and sale of
                    political pamphlets. As he generally received with every pamphlet a sum
                    sufficient to secure him against all contingencies, it cannot be said that he
                    acted entirely from disinterested or patriotic motives. At the same time, he
                    deserves the credit of intrepidity; and it cannot be denied that, whether he
                    knew the full value of the principle for which he was contending or not, he did
                    very much to secure the freedom of the press. The government of course were not
                    unobservant of Almon’s proceedings, and, as has often been the case,
                    strengthened his influence by the very measures they took to repress it. In 1765
                    the Attorney-General moved to have him tried for the publication of the pamphlet
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Juries and Libels,</hi> but the prosecution failed;
                    and in 1770, for merely selling a copy of the <hi rend="italic">London
                    Museum</hi> containing Junius’s celebrated “Letter to the King,” he was
                    sentenced by Lord Mansfield to pay a fine of ten marks, and give security for
                    his good behaviour. It was this trial that called forth the letter to Lord
                    Mansfield, one of the most bitter of the Junius series. Almon himself published
                    an account of the trial, and of course did not let slip the opportunity of
                    reprinting the matter that had been the ground of indictment, but no further
                    proceedings were taken against him. In 1774 Almon commenced the publication of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Register,</hi> and he also issued an
                    abstract of the debates from 1742, when Chandler’s Reports ceased, to 1774.
                    About the same time, having earned a competency, he retired to Boxmoor in
                    Hertfordshire, though he still continued to write on political subjects. He
                    afterwards became proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">General Advertiser,</hi>
                    in the management of which ho lost his fortune, and was declared insolvent. To
                    these calamities was added an imprisonment for libel and a sentence of outlawry.
                    Being enabled at last to return to Boxmoor, he continued for some years a career
                    of undiminished literary activity. His last work, a Life of Wilkes, in five
                    volumes (1805), was perhaps his worst, being entirely wanting in proportion and
                    arrangement. He died on the 12th December 1805. A complete list of Almon’s
                    works, most of which appeared anonymously, is given in Watt’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliotheca Britannica.</hi> Though their literary merit is not great, they are
                    of very considerable value to the student of the political history of the
                    period.</p>
