                    Themiscyra, on the river Thermodon, as its capital. From this centre they made
                    warlike excursions, sometimes northward, but chiefly against the people on the
                    coast of Asia Minor. From the traditions that to repel and conquer them was
                    assigned as a task to Bellerophon by the King of Lycia, and again to Hercules by
                    Eurystheus, it may be inferred that they were regarded by the Greeks at least as
                    a permanent source of danger. But equally, if the task of conquering them is to
                    be strictly compared with the other tasks in which these heroes were generally
                    opposed to monsters and beings impossible in themselves, but possible as
                    illustrations of permanent danger and damage, it would follow that the Amazons
                    were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coast
                    of Asia Minor. Their impossibility as actual beings is further recognised in
                    works of art, in which combats between them and Greeks are placed on the same
                    level as, and often associated with, combats of Greeks and centaurs. The belief
                    in the existence of the Amazons, however, having been once accepted and
                    introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround
                    them as far as possible with the appearance of not unnatural beings. Their
                    occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield,
                    nearly in the shape of a crescent, called <hi rend="italic">pelta,</hi> and in
                    early art a helmet, the model before the Greek mind having apparently been the
                    goddess Athene (Minerva). In later art they approach the model of Artemis
                    (Diana), wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted
                    vases their dress is often peculiarly Persian—that is, close-fitting trousers,
                    and a high cap called the <hi rend="italic">kidaris.</hi> They fought partly on
                    foot, partly on horseback, and always without quarter; so that the epithet of
                    <hi rend="italic">άνδροκτόνοι,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">oiorpata,</hi> which is
                    the Scythian equivalent (Herod. iv. 110), was applied to them. To maintain their
                    stock, annual visits were paid to the neighbouring peoples; and when, in
                    consequence of this, children were born, the males were either sent over the
                    borders or retained and brought up crippled, and in the condition of slaves,
                    while the female children were assiduously trained to hunting and war. So as to
                    have freedom in the use of the bow, the right breast was either removed by
                    burning and other processes, or was checked in its growth; hence the ancient
                    derivation of the name Amazon from <hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-μάζος,</hi> "breastless.” But instead of there being any indication of this in
                    works of art, it is noticeable that in the case of wounded Amazons the wound is
                    in the breast, as if the artist conceived them as truly womanly in that region.
                    The other derivations are—(1) from <hi rend="italic">a-μΛζoς,</hi> in the sense
                    of “strong-breasted,” so as to compare with their deity Artemis <hi
                    rend="italic">Polymazos;</hi> (2) from d-μάσσω, “not touching (men);” (3) from
                    the Scythian <hi rend="italic">am azzen,</hi> a “virago.” The deities of the
                    Amazons were Ares (Mars) and Artemis, the former being consistently assigned to
                    them as a god of war, and as a god of Thracian and generally northern origin. In
                    the case of Artemis, it was not here the usual Greek goddess of that name, but
                    an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent, but different, among other
                    points, in this, that troops of women <hi rend="italic">(hiero-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">duloe)</hi> were associated with her worship, especially as it
                    existed at Ephesus in historical times. That it may have been so also in the
                    early myth-making age, and that accordingly the idea of the Amazons as a race
                    may have originated in the ecstatic lawless life of these women, has been
                    conjectured. With regard to Ephesus, it was said that a body of Amazons, under a
                    princess named Lampedo, had founded that town, and established the worship of
                    Artemis; though in another account they appear as enemies of this religion, and
                    as having burnt the temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Several other towns of Asia
                    Minor claimed to have been founded by Amazons; but according to Diodorus (ii.
                    52, 55), the Amazons in this case were a race of women who inhabited the west of
                    Libya, and who once, led by their queen Myrina, advanced through Asia Minor and
                    on to Thrace, where they were defeated by Mopsus, and compelled to return. Other
                    memorials of the expeditions and battle-fields of the Amazons were recognised in
                    the tumuli in the Troad and elsewhere in Asia Minor. These ancient local
                    traditions derived a strong colour of reality afterwards, when inroads of
                    barbarians, under a female leader, occurred, as in the time of Cyrus, or when
                    Thalestris appeared before Alexander the Great, announcing herself as the queen
                    of the Amazons; but chiefly when it was observed that certain characteristics of
                    the Amazons actually existed among the women of Sarmatia. The effect of this
                    mixture of fact and legend may be seen in the account given by Herodotus (iv.
                    110) of the collapse of the Amazonian state, or in the origin of it as related
                    by Justin (ii. 4). On the other hand, the Persian war seems to have freshened,
                    as if to supply a mythical prototype, the national legends of combats between
                    Greeks and Amazons. These legends recounted the defeat of the Amazons, first by
                    Bellerophon, and secondly by Hercules, who had been ordered by Eurystheus to
                    bring him the girdle of their queen Hippolyte, or, in other words, since the
                    girdle of their queen would in Greek eyes be the most sacred object, to conquer
                    the whole race of Amazons. It is supposed that he was accompanied by his friend
                    Theseus, and that this was the occasion on which the latter became possessed of
                    the Amazon princess Antiope. From his possession of her originated a third
                    legend, which described an invasion of Attica by a body of Amazons, with the
                    view of carrying off Antiope. Their utter defeat by Theseus must have seemed, in
                    the light of Marathon and Salamis, as a forecast of the glory then won by
                    Athens. The fourth legend, which deals with the appearance of an army of
                    Amazons, led by their queen Penthesilea on the side of the Trojans in the Trojan
                    war, was developed by Arctinus of Miletus in his poem the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aethiopis.</hi> Achilles and the queen meet in battle, and she falls by his
                    hand; but the hero is smitten with grief, and lifts her gently before she dies.
                    It is this feeling of regret on the part of a hero who is compelled to kill a
                    woman in his own defence, that gives the principal tone to the existing works of
                    Greek art, in which combats with Amazons are represented, and especially to
                    works of sculpture. Of this class there exist (besides a number of reliefs,
                    among which those from the temple of Apollo at Phigalia, now in the British
                    Museum, are conspicuous for many touching motives of this kind), several statues
                    of wounded Amazons, the sad expression of which, combined with the nobility of
                    form and power of limb, shows what was the highest conception of them in the
                    best days of Greek art. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. s. μ.)</hi></p>
