                <p><label type="entry">ADMIRALTY, <hi rend="smallcaps">High Court of</hi></label>.
                    This is a court of law, in which the authority of the lord high admiral is
                    exercised in his <hi rend="italic">judicial</hi> capacity. Very little has been
                    left on record of the ancient prerogative of the admirals of England. For some
                    time after the first institution of the office they judged all matters relating
                    to merchants and mariners, which happened on the main sea, in a summary way,
                    according to the laws of Oleron (so called because promulgated by Richard I. at
                    that place). These laws, which were little more than a transcript of the Rhodian
                    laws, became the universally-received customs of the western part of the world.
                    “All the seafaring nations,” says Sir Leoline Jenkins, “soon after their
                    promulgation, received and entertained these laws from the English, by way of
                    deference to the sovereignty of our kings in the British ocean, and to the
                    judgment of our countrymen in sea affairs.”</p>
                <p>In the patents granted to the early admirals between the latter years of the
                    reign of Henry III. and the close of that of Edward III., no mention is made of
                    marine perquisites or of civil power, nor does it appear that the admirals
                    enjoyed either; but after the death of the latter, new and extraordinary powers
                    were granted to them, and it would appear that they usurped others. The preamble
                    to the 13 Richard II. stat. 1, c. 5, sets forth that “a great and common clamour
                    and complaint hath been oftentimes made before this time, and yet is, for that
                    the admirals and their deputies hold their sessions within divers places of this
                    realm, as well within the franchise as without, accroaching to them greater
                    authority than belongeth to their office, in prejudice of our lord the king and
                    the common law of the realm, and in diminishing of divers franchises, and in
                    destruction and impoverishing of the common people and the statute therefore
                    directs that the admirals and their deputies shall not meddle from henceforth of
                    any thing done within the realm, but only of a thing done upon the sea. Two
                    years afterwards (15 Rich. II. c. 3), in consequence, as stated in the preamble
                    of the statute, “of the great and grievous complaint of all the commons,” it was
                    ordained that the admiral’s court should have no cognisance of any contracts,
                    pleas, or quarrels, or of any thing done or arising within the bodies of
                    counties, whether by land or by water, nor of wreck of the sea; but that the
                    admiral should have cognisance of the death of a man, and of mayhem done in
                    great ships being and hovering in the main stream of great rivers, yet only
                    beneath the bridges of the same rivers nigh to the sea. He may also arrest ships
                    in the great flotes for the great voyages of the king and of the realm, saving
                    always to the king all manner of forfeitures and profits thereof coming, and
                    have jurisdiction over the said flotes, but during the said voyages only. But if
                    the admiral or his lieutenant exceed that jurisdiction, then, by 2 Henry IV. c.
                    11, the statute and the common law may be holden against them; and if a man
                    pursues wrongfully in the admiralty court, his adversary may recover double
                    damages at common law, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n174/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0174-0159"/> and the pursuant, if attainted, shall incur the
                    penalty of £10 to the king.</p>
                <p>The place which, according to Spelman, is absolutely subject to the jurisdiction
                    of the admiral is the sea; which, however, comprehends public rivers, fresh
                    waters, creeks, and all places whatsoever, within the ebbing and flowing of the
                    sea, at the highest water, the shores or banks adjoining, from all the first
                    bridges to the seaward; and in these, he observes, the admiralty hath full
                    jurisdiction in all causes, criminal and civil, except treasons and the right of
                    wreck. Lord Coke observes (5 Rep. 107), that between the high-water mark and the
                    low-water mark the admiral hath jurisdiction <hi rend="italic">super aquam, ad
                    plenitudinem maris,</hi> and as long as it flows, though the land be <hi
                    rend="italic">infra corpus comitatus</hi> at the reflow, so as of one place
                    there is <hi rend="italic">divisum imperium</hi> interchangeably.</p>
                <p>But though the statute restraineth the lord high admiral that he shall not hold
                    plea of a thing rising in the body of a county, he is not restrained from making
                    execution upon the land, but is empowered to take either body or goods upon the
                    land; otherwise his jurisdiction would often prove a dead letter. He also can
                    and does hold his court in the body of a county. So, likewise, the civil power
                    may apprehend and try persons who may have been guilty of offences cognisable at
                    common law, though committed in the fleet, in any port or harbour of Great
                    Britain, or at sea, provided such persons have not already been tried for such
                    offences either by court-martial or in the admiralty court; and in all ports,
                    harbours, creeks, &amp;c., lying in any county, the high admiral and the
                    sheriff, or coroner, as the case may be, have concurrent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>By the 6 and 7 Will. IV. c. 53 the admiralty jurisdiction is extended to Prince
                    of Wales’ Island, Singapore, and Malacca; and under the 3 and 4 Vict. c. 65, the
                    court has jurisdiction in the following cases: —</p>
                <p>Whenever a vessel is arrested by process issuing from the said court, or the
                    proceeds of any vessel are brought into the registry, to take cognisance of all
                    claims in respect of any mortgage of such vessel.</p>
                <p>To decide all questions as to the title to, or ownership of, such vessel, or the
                    proceeds thereof remaining in the registry, arising in any cause of possession,
                    salvage, damage, wages, or bottomry, instituted in the said court.</p>
                <p>To decide all claims and demands whatsoever in the nature of salvage, or in the
                    nature of towage, or for necessaries supplied to any foreign vessel, and enforce
                    the payment of the same, whether such vessel may have been in the body of the
                    county or upon the high seas at the time when the service was rendered, or
                    damage received, or necessaries furnished, in respect of which claim is
                    made.</p>
                <p>To decide all matters and questions concerning booty of war on shore, or the
                    distribution thereof, which it shall please her Majesty, by the advice of the
                    privy council, to refer to the judgment of the said court, who shall proceed
                    therein as in cases of prize of war.</p>
                <p>And under § 40 of the 9 and 10 Vict. c. 99, to decide on all claims and demands
                    whatsoever in the nature of salvage for services performed, whether on sea or
                    land.</p>
                <p>The high court of Admiralty has jurisdiction upon the high seas all over the
                    world. It has an instance jurisdiction which is civil, and a prize jurisdiction
                    in time of war. The latter jurisdiction does not extend to the admiralty courts
                    of Ireland or Scotland, which never had prize commissions sent to them. It is of
                    the highest importance in war time, when questions of seizure or detention of
                    neutral ships arise, to have but one court of which to inquire concerning all
                    causes, so as to expedite the action of the Foreign Office in dealing with
                    representations from neutral powers. The causes which arise in time of peace are
                    causes of collisions, of seamen’s wages, bottomry, wearing unlawful colours,
                    salvage, and causes of possession, where one part owner or minor claims to have
                    security from those other owners who are going to send the ship on a foreign
                    voyage that the ship shall return again. Causes under the Slave Act treaties are
                    also cognisable here. The evidence is all documentary. In 1803 there were 1125
                    prize cases before the court; in 1804, 1144; in 1806, 2286; in 1807, 2789; and
                    so on, above 1000 causes each year, down to the year 1811.</p>
                <p>The criminal jurisdiction, which formerly comprehended all crimes whatever
                    committed at sea, from larceny to homicide, which were triable at common law at
                    the assizes if committed on shore, was much modified upon the report of the
                    select committee on the high court of admiralty in 1833. Such offences are now
                    triable at common law on surrender to the jurisdiction; but the judge of the
                    admiralty court may still sit with other commissioners of oyer and terminer. He
                    has no longer any independent criminal jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>The instance jurisdiction is permanent; the prize jurisdiction is by virtue of a
                    special commission, <hi rend="italic">pro re nat</hi><hi rend="italic">â</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi> Its issue is one of the first acts done on the outbreak of
                    war. Appeals formerly lay from the civil decisions to the high court of
                    delegates or specially-appointed commissioners; from the prize decisions to the
                    prize commissioners. By the Acts 2 and 3 Will. IV. c. 92, and 3 and 4 Will. IV.
                    c. 41, all appeals from admiralty court decisions of any kind lie to the
                    sovereign, who is authorised to refer them to the judicial committee of the
                    privy council.</p>
                <p>The lord high admiral was assisted in his <hi rend="italic">judicial</hi>
                    functions by the following principal officers:—1. The vice-admiral; 2. The
                    judge; 3. The registrar; 4. The advocate-general; 5. The counsel and
                    judge-advocate; 6. The solicitor; 7. The procurator; 8. The marshal,—which
                    officers are continued.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Vice-Admiral.</hi> This officer is the admiral’s deputy
                    or lieutenant mentioned in the statutes of 13th and 15th Richard II., and was
                    the person, most probably, who presided in the court. At present the office of
                    vice admiral of England is a perfect sinecure, generally conferred on some naval
                    officer of high rank and distinguished character in the service. The salary of
                    £434, 1s. 9d. per annum, attached to it in addition to half-pay, was abolished
                    by order in council, 22d February 1870. The salary and office of rear-admiral of
                    England were abolished by the same order in council. The salary was £342, 9s.
                    per annum. Each county of England has its vice-admiral, which is little more
                    than an honorary distinction, though the patent gives to the holder all the
                    powers vested in the admiral himself. Similar powers were also granted to the
                    judges of the admiralty county courts; but this was found so inconvenient and
                    prejudicial to those who had suits to commence or defend before them, that the
                    Duke of York, when lord high admiral, in 1663 caused instructions to be drawn up
                    in order to assign to each his province, whereby the whole judicial power
                    remained with the judge, and the upholding of the rights of the admiral, and
                    levying and receiving the perquisites, &amp;c., appertained to the
                    vice-admiral.</p>
                <p>Each of the four provinces of Ireland has its vice-admiral. There is one
                    vice-admiral for all Scotland, and one for the Shetland and Orkney Islands. The
                    governor of most of our colonies had a commission of vice-admiral granted to him
                    by the lord high admiral or lords commissioners of the admiralty, and generally
                    a commission from the king under the great seal, grounded on the 11 and 12
                    William III. c. 7, and further confirmed by 46 Geo. III. c. 54, by which he was
                    authorised to try all treasons, piracies, felonies, robberies, murders,
                    conspiracies, and other offences, of what nature or kind soever, committed on
                    the seas, where the parties were taken into custody in places remote from
                    England. The court consisted of seven persons at the least, of whom the
                    governor, the lieutenant-governor, the vice-admiral, the flag-officer, or
                    commander-in-chief of the squadron, the members of the council, the
                    chief-justice, judge of the vice-admiralty court, captains of men-of-war, and
                    secretary of the colony, were specially named in the commission; but any three
                    of these, with four others selected from known merchants, factors, or planters,
                    captains, lieutenants, or warrant officers of men-of-war, or captains, masters,
                    or mates of merchant ships, constituted a legal court of piracy. By the 12 and
                    13 Vict. c. 96, all persons charged in any colony with offences committed on the
                    sea may be dealt with in the same manner as if the offences had been committed
                    on waters within the local jurisdiction of the courts of the colony.</p>

                <p>The vice admiralty courts in the colonies are of two descriptions. The one has
                    power to inquire into the causes of detention of enemies or neutral vessels, to
                    try and condemn the same for the benefit of the captors, as well as to take
                    cognisance of all matters relating to the office of the lord high admiral. The
                    other has only power to institute inquiries into misdemeanours committed in
                    merchant vessels, and to determine petty suits, &amp;c., and to guard the
                    privileges of the admiral. The former are usually known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">prize courts,</hi> the latter by that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >instance courts.</hi> Appeals from vice-admiralty courts abroad lay formerly to
                    the high court of admiralty in England, and from that, if need were, to the high
                    court of delegates, or in prize cases to the prize commissioners. By an Act of
                    her present Majesty, all such appeals lie direct to the sovereign, who refers
                    them to the judicial committee of the privy council.</p>
                <p>The following are the colonies and foreign possessions in which vice-admiralty
                    courts are now. (1874) established. Others are constituted as occasion may
                    require, in case of war :—</p>

                <p>By the provisions of the Vice-admiralty Courts Act of 1863, The governor of a
                    colony is <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> vice-admiral, and the chief-justice
                    <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> judge of the vice-admiralty court.</p>
                <p>In none of the patents to the lord high admiral, vice-admiral, or judge, is any
                    mention made of prize jurisdiction. Lord Mansfield had occasion to search into
                    the records of the court of admiralty in Doctors’ Commons, to ascertain on what
                    foundation this jurisdiction was exercised by the judge of the admiralty; but he
                    could not discover any prize-act books farther back than 1643; no sentences
                    farther back than 1648. The registrar could go no farther back than 1690. “The
                    prior records,” says his lordship,</p>
                <p>“are in confusion, illegible, and without index.” The prize jurisdiction may
                    therefore be considered as of modern authority, and distinct altogether from the
                    ancient powers given to the admiral. To constitute the authority for trying
                    prize causes, a commission under the great seal issues to the lord high admiral
                    at the commencement of every war, to will and require the court of admiralty,
                    and the lieutenant and judge of the said court, his surrogate or surrogates, to
                    proceed upon all manner of captures, seizures, and reprisals, of all ships and
                    goods that are or shall be taken; and to hear and determine according to the
                    course of the admiralty, or the law of nations; and a warrant issues to the
                    judge of the admiralty accordingly.</p>
                <p>The admiralty court being in this respect a court in which foreigners of all
                    nations may become suitors, an appeal may be had from its decisions to a
                    committee of the lords of the privy council, who hear and determine according to
                    the established laws of nations.</p>
                <p>At the breaking out of a war, the lord high admiral also receives a special
                    commission from the crown, under the great seal, to empower him to grant letters
                    of marque and reprisals against the enemy, he having no such power by his
                    patent. These letters are either general or special: general, when granted to
                    private men to fit out ships at their own charge to annoy the enemy; special,
                    when in the case of any of our merchants being robbed of their estates or
                    property by foreigners, the king grants them letters of reprisal against that
                    nation, though we may be in amity with it. Before the latter can be sued for,
                    the complainant must have gone through the prosecution of his suit in the courts
                    of the state whose subjects have wronged him; where, if justice be denied, or
                    vexatiously delayed, he must first make proof of his loses and charges in the
                    admiralty court here; whereupon, if the Crown is satisfied he has pursued all
                    lawful means to obtain redress, and his own interceding should produce no better
                    effect, special letters of reprisal are granted; not, however, as must be
                    evident, until a very strong case has been made out. This custom, which we may
                    now consider as obsolete, seems to be a remnant of the law of ancient Greece,
                    called <hi rend="italic">androlepsia,</hi> by which, if a man was slain, the
                    friends and relations of the deceased might seize on any three citizens of the
                    place where the murderer took refuge, and make them slaves, unless he was
                    delivered up. Both Oliver Cromwell and King Charles II. granted letters of
                    reprisal. In 1638 the Duc d’Epernon seized on the ship “Amity” of London, for
                    the service of the French king against the Spaniards, promising full
                    satisfaction; but none being made, the owners obtained letters of reprisal from
                    the Protector, and afterwards, in 1665, from Charles II. In 1666 Captain Butler
                    Barnes had letters of reprisal against the Danes. The Dutch having burnt six
                    English merchant vessels in the Elbe, within the territories of Hamburg, which
                    city, instead of giving any assistance or protection, hindered the English from
                    defending themselves, letters of reprisal were granted to the sufferers against
                    that city. Lastly, one Justiniani, a noble Genoese, being indebted in a large
                    sum to Joseph Como, a merchant in London, which he had several years solicited
                    for without obtaining satisfaction, Captain Scott, commander of his Majesty’s
                    ship the “Dragon,” stationed at that time in the Mediterranean, received orders
                    to make reprisals upon the ships of that republic; upon which the debt was
                    paid.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Judge.—</hi> The patents to the judge of the admiralty
                    and vice-admiralty courts run pretty nearly in the same manner as those of the
                    lord high admiral, and point out the several matters of which he can take
                    cognisance. The Parliament of 1640 established the office of judge of the
                    admiralty court in three persons, with a salary of £500 a-year to each. At the
                    Restoration there were two judges of the high court of admiralty, which
                    sometimes proved inconvenient; for when they differed in opinion, no judgment
                    could be had. These judges, before the Revolution, held their appointment only
                    during pleasure. At that period, and under the provisions of the Bill of Rights,
                    Sir Charles Hedges was constituted judge under the great seal of England, <hi
                    rend="italic">guamdiu se bene</hi><hi rend="italic">gesserit,</hi> with a salary
                    of £400 a-year, and an additional £400 out of the proceeds of prizes and
                    perquisites of the admiralty; but in the year 1725 the latter sum was diminished
                    from the ordinary estimate by the House of Commons. The salary of Sir James
                    Marriott, from 1778 to 1782, during the American war, was £800 a year, and £3700
                    added for fees. From 1794 to 1798, the salary was £1780, and £2500 for fees.
                    During the sixteen years that Sir William Scott (Lord Stowell) was judge, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n176/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0176-0161"/> from 1798 to 1814-, the salary was £2500, and the
                    fees averaged £2800 a-year. Under the 3 and 4 Vict. c. 66, § 1, the salary is
                    fixed at £4000 per annum. All fees of whatever kind, formerly payable to the
                    judge, are now paid to the consolidated fund.</p>
                <p>The court of admiralty is at present (1873), and pending the erection of the new
                    law courts, held in Westminster. In the time of Henry IV. it was held in
                    Southwark, either at a quay on the south side of the Thames, or in the ere-while
                    church of St Margaret-on-Hill, most likely the former. Stow, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Survey</hi> 1598), says—“A part of this parish church of St
                    Margaret is now a court, wherein the assizes and sessions be kept; and the court
                    of admiralty is also there kept.” Pepys also, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diary</hi> (17th March 1663), describes the court as sitting there. But it is
                    probable that the sittings in St Margaret’s Church were commenced shortly before
                    Stow’s time; for in the Rolls of Parliament, 11 Hen. IV. No. 61, the Commons
                    complain that people are summoned by the officers of the admiral <hi
                    rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">Loundres</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">le</hi><hi rend="italic">Key de William, Horton, Suthwerke.</hi>
                    Further, it would appear from an appeal made to the king, Henry IV., that the
                    rule then was for the admiral’s court to be held upon some wharf or quay within
                    the flux and reflux of the tide. In the reign of Henry VIII., Horton’s Quay,
                    near London Bridge, is mentioned in the records of the high court of admiralty
                    (3d Nov. 1541) as its usual place of sitting.</p>
                <p>The judges of the vice-admiralty courts in certain of the colonies, limited by 41
                    George III. c. 96, are allowed a salary not exceeding to each the sum of £2000
                    a-year, to be paid out of the consolidated fund of Great Britain; together with
                    profits and emoluments not exceeding to each the further sum of £2000 per annum,
                    out of the fees to be taken by the said judges, of which a table is directed to
                    be hung up in some conspicuous place in the court; and no judge is to take any
                    fee beyond those specified, directly or indirectly, on pain of forfeiture of his
                    office, and being proceeded against for extortion; and on his retirement from
                    office after six years’ service, or from some permanent infirmity, the Crown
                    may, by authority of the Act above mentioned, grant unto such judge an annuity
                    for the term of his life not exceeding £1000 per annum. This liberal provision
                    puts the judges of the colonial courts of vice-admiralty above all suspicion of
                    their decisions being influenced by unworthy motives—a suspicion they were not
                    entirely free from when their emoluments depended mainly on their fees.</p>
                <p>During the war of 1793-1815 a session of oyer and terminer to try admiralty
                    causes was held at the Old Bailey, now the central criminal court, twice a-year.
                    The commission for this purpose was of the same nature with those which are
                    granted to the judges when they go on circuit; that is to say, to determine and
                    punish all crimes, offences, and misdemeanours, and abuses; the <hi
                    rend="italic">end</hi> of both being the same, their <hi rend="italic"
                    >limits</hi> different; the one relating to things done upon the land, the other
                    to things done upon the water. The lords commissioners of the admiralty, all the
                    members of the privy council, the chancellor and all the judges, the lords of
                    the treasury, the secretary of the admiralty, the treasurer and commissioners of
                    the navy, some of the aldermen of London, and several doctors of the civil law,
                    were the members of this commission; any four of whom made a court.</p>
                <p>The proceedings of the court, now probably obsolete, were continued <hi
                    rend="italic">de die in diem,</hi> or, as the style of the court was, from tide
                    to tide.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Registrar of the Admiralty</hi> formerly held his place
                    by patent from the Crown. The patent was issued ander the great seal of the
                    court of admiralty, and the appointment was afterwards confirmed by patent under
                    the great seal of the United Kingdom. The appointment was for life, and was
                    often granted in reversion. The registrar had no salary, the amount of his
                    emoluments depending on the captures, droits, &amp;c., condemned by the court,
                    which during the war of 1793-1815 were so enormous that in 1810 an Act was
                    passed for regulating the offices of registrars of admiralty and prize courts,
                    by which it is enacted “that no office of registrar of the high court of
                    admiralty, or of the high court of appeals for prizes, or high court of
                    delegates in Great Britain, shall, after the expiration of the interest now
                    vested in possession or reversion therein, be granted for a longer term than
                    during pleasure, nor be executed by deputy; that an account be kept in the said
                    offices respectively of all the fees, dues, perquisites, emoluments, and profits
                    received by and on account of the said registrars, out of which all the expenses
                    of their offices are to be paid; that one-third of the surplus shall belong to
                    the registrar and to his assistant (if an assistant should be necessary), and
                    the remaining two-thirds to the consolidated fund of Great Britain, to be paid
                    quarterly into the exchequer; the account of such surplus to be presented to the
                    court at least fourteen days before each quarter-day, and verified on oath.”
                    Under the 3 and 4 Vict. c. 66, § 2, a yearly salary of £1400 is substituted for
                    “all fees, dues, perquisites, emoluments, and profits,” and which may be
                    increased in time of war to £2000. The duties of the registrar are—1. To keep a
                    public registry, to give attendance therein, and to preserve in a regular manner
                    the registers, acts, records, and documents belonging to the office; 2. To
                    attend all sittings of the court of admiralty, and to attend the judge at
                    chambers; 3. To draw and sign all warrants, monitions, commissions, &amp;c.,
                    issuing from the court; to attend other courts with minutes, &amp;c., of the
                    admiralty court when required; 4. To have the custody of all moneys paid into
                    court or paid out of court.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Advocate-General.—</hi> This officer is appointed by
                    warrant of the lords commissioners of the admiralty. His duties are—to appear
                    for the lord high admiral in his court of admiralty, court of delegates, and
                    other courts; to move and debate in all causes wherein the rights of the admiral
                    are concerned; for which he had anciently a salary of 20 marks (£13, 6s. 8d.)
                    a-year. In May 1803, Dr William Battine, who was appointed in 1791, had an
                    addition of £200 to his salary, “for his extraordinary trouble and attendance
                    during the present hostilities.” His salary was continued to him and his
                    successor, Dr Arnold, till 1816; since that time the allowance has been reduced
                    to its original amount of £13, 6s. 8d. Formerly the admiral’s advocate was
                    always retained as leading counsel, but after the droits were transferred to the
                    crown, he was gradually supplanted by the king’s advocate, who was generally
                    retained in all cases, the admiralty advocate acting only as junior counsel; and
                    while the former during the war made sometimes from £15,000 to £20,000 a-year,
                    the latter rarely received from his professional duties more than from £1500 to
                    £2000 a-year.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Counsel and Judge-Advocate for the affairs of the
                    Admiralty and Navy</hi> is the law officer who is chiefly consulted on matters
                    connected with the military duties of the lord high admiral. He advises also on
                    all legal questions. His salary is £100 a-year, besides his fees, which in time
                    of war may be reckoned to amount to from £1200 to £1800 a-year. Till the present
                    reign the offices of counsel of the admiralty and judge-advocate of the fleet
                    were separate and distinct, the latter being a sinecure appointment, with a
                    salary of £182, 10s. attached to it. The salary is now abolished. The duties are
                    very light, the veritable work of the office being discharged by deputy
                    judges-advocate appointed on each occasion of a court-martial, and by resident
                    law agents at Portsmouth and Plymouth, who receive salaries in lieu of all fees
                    and charges.</p>

                    admiralty. He is the general legal adviser, in the first instance, of the lords
                    commissioners; and since 1869 there have been added to his other functions those
                    of registrar of public securities and custodian of all public securities and
                    bonds belonging to the admiralty. His salary is £1600 a-year in lieu of all
                    fees, bills, and disbursements, with an allowance of £1300 a-year for assistance
                    of clerks. His office is provided for him.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">The Procurator.—</hi> The admiralty’s proctor stands
                    precisely in the same situation to the queen’s proctor that his advocate does to
                    that of the queen, though there is not quite so great a difference in their
                    emoluments. They act as the attorneys or solicitors in all causes concerning the
                    queen’s and the lord high admiral’s affairs in the high court of admiralty and
                    other courts. All prize causes are conducted by the queen’s proctor. It is
                    supposed that in some years of war, in the early part of the century, the
                    proctor did not receive less than £20,000 a-year.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">The Marshal.—</hi> This officer receives his appointment
                    from the lord high admiral or lords commissioners of the admiralty. His
                    appointment is under the seal of the high court of admiralty during pleasure,
                    and is confirmed by letters patent from the Crown. His duties are to arrest
                    ships and persons; to execute all processes or orders issuing from the court; to
                    attend, in person or by deputy, the judge with the silver oar (the ancient
                    emblem of maritime jurisdiction); and formerly also to attend executions. It is
                    also the duty of the marshal or his deputy to arrest, under warrant from the
                    admiralty, any officer not beneath the rank of post captain who may be ordered
                    for trial by court-martial; and to see to the delivery of sentenced prisoners to
                    their place of punishment. His emoluments formerly depended on the number of
                    prizes brought into port for condemnation, and the number of ships embargoed,
                    and might probably be reckoned in time of war, <hi rend="italic"
                    >communibus</hi><hi rend="italic">aunis,</hi> from £1500 to £2000 a-year, out of
                    which he had to pay about £400 a-year to a deputy. He had no salary. The office
                    can, however, be no longer performed by deputy, except in case of illness, § 9
                    of the 3 and 4 Vict. c. 66. The marshal is now paid by a salary of £500, in
                    addition to his travelling expenses.</p>

                    jurisdiction and orders of the lord high admiral, or lords commissioners for
                    executing the office, of Great Britain. For judicial purposes, however, an
                    admiralty court sits in the Four Courts, Dublin, having a judge, a registrar, a
                    marshal, and other officers. In peace time and war time alike it exercises only
                    an instance jurisdiction. No prize commission has ever issued to it.</p>

                    functions of the lord high admiral were merged in the English office, there
                    remained a separate court of admiralty, with subsidiary local courts, having
                    civil and criminal jurisdictions in maritime questions. The separate courts were
                    abolished in 1831, and their powers merged in the courts of session and
                    justiciary, and the local courts.</p>
