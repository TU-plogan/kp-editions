                <p><label type="entry">AMALEKITES</label>, an ancient people, widely spread
                    throughout the country lying on the south and east of Palestine, often mentioned
                    in the Jewish Scriptures, and celebrated also in Arabian tradition. In Scripture
                    they occur first in Gen. xiv. 7, occupying the territory around Kadesh, and
                    suffering from the invasion of Chedorlaomer and his confederates. They appear
                    next assaulting the Israelites, shortly after the exodus from Egypt, at
                    Rephidim, in the neighbourhood of Mount Sinai (Ex. xvii. 8; cf. Deut. XXV. 17).
                    They again occur falling upon a party of the Israelites on the southern verge of
                    the promised land (Num. xiv. 45; cf. xiii. 29). In the time of the judges they
                    are found associated with the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Midianites, and “the
                    children of the east,” in repeated attacks upon the Israelites, invading their
                    territory from the eastern side of Jordan (Judges iii. 13; vi. 3). Saul, by
                    divine command, led an expedition into the country of Amalek, waging against
                    them an exterminating war, “smiting them from Havilah until thou comest to Shur,
                    that is over against Egypt” (1 Sam. XV. 1). David also “invaded the Geshurites,
                    and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites; for these nations were of old the
                    inhabitants of the land as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt” (1
                    Sam. xxvii. 8). The last notice occurs in 1 Chron. iv. 43, from which we learn
                    that in the days of Hezekiah a body of Simeonites “went to mount Seir” and
                    “smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped;” a notice showing the
                    accomplishment of the doom of extermination which had been denounced against
                    them (Ex. xvii. 14-16; Num. xxv. 20), and finding an echo in the words of an
                    Arabian poet, “The race of Amlak has disappeared, and there is left of it
                    neither mean man nor mighty” (Maçoudi, <hi rend="italic">Les Prairies d'Or,</hi>
                    par Meynard et Courteille, vol. iii. 104). We twice hear of Agag as the name of
                    the king of the nation (Num. xxiv. 7; 1 Sam. xv. 8); and it is reasonably
                    supposed that this, like Pharaoh in Egypt, was a name common to all their kings.
                    It has been generally supposed that the Haman of the book of Esther, called “the
                    Agagite,” belonged to the royal line of the Amalekites; but it is now found,
                    from Assyrian records, that Agagi was the name of a country east of Assyria,
                    from which it may be assumed that the title was derived. See Lenormant, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">Ass. i.</hi> 45.</p>
                <p>Josephus agrees with Scripture in assigning to the Amalekites the territory
                    immediately to the south of Palestine. Thus he speaks of them as inhabiting
                    “Gobolitis and Petra” (Gobolitis = Gebal, in Ps. lxxxiii. 7; cf. Reland, <hi
                    rend="italic">Palaestina,</hi> p. 71); and as reaching “from Pelusium to the Red
                    Sea” <hi rend="italic">(Ant. Jud.</hi> iii. 2, 1; vi. 7, 3; cf. ii. 1, 2). The
                    country which they are thus represented as occupying is suited only to a nomadic
                    population; and accordingly the indications of the Scripture narrative point to
                    this as the general character of the Amalekite people. They appear as the
                    Bedouins of ancient times, rapid and devastating in their movements (1 Sam. xxx.
                    1); and in their expeditions “coming up with their cattle and their tents” (Jud.
                    vi. 5). At the same time, in the more fertile portions of their territory they
                    doubtless had settled abodes. We read in 1 Sam. xv. 5 of “a city of Amalek;”'
                    and Josephus speaks, apparently in an exaggerated way, of their cities being
                    captured by means of elaborate siege operations <hi rend="italic">(Ant.
                    Jud.</hi> vi. 7, 2).</p>
                <p>The ethnical character and relation of this people, and their complete national
                    history, it is impossible satisfactorily to make out from the fragmentary
                    materials in our hands. They are not mentioned in the table of nations in Gen.
                    x., while in Gen. xxxvi. 12, 16, their ancestry seems to be referred to Esau. At
                    the same time, the existence of the nation is noticed in Gen xiv., long before
                    Esau and it seems unnatural to understand this, with Hengstenberg and others, in
                    a proleptic sense, especially as there are other independent grounds for
                    referring the beginning of their history to an earlier date. It is certain that
                    the genealogical tables of Scripture, like those of Arabia, include cases of
                    adoption or affiliation as well as of direct descent, and probably it is in this
                    sense that the notice referring Amalek to Esau should be understood. In Balaam’s
                    prophecy Amalek is called “the first of nations” (גדים <hi rend="superscript">
                    דאשית</hi><hi rend="italic">proestan·</hi><hi rend="italic">tissima
                    gentium,</hi> Gesenius), Num. xxiv. 20, an expression scarcely reconcilable in
                    the circumstances with descent from Jacob’s brother. Again, though found in
                    Jewish scripture located in the immediate south and east of the Israelitish
                    territory, yet there are indications in Scripture itself that at one time they
                    had had a wider extension. “The mount of the Amalekites” is mentioned as
                    situated in “the land of Ephraim” (Jud. xii. 15), apparently warranting the
                    inference that they once held possessions on the west of the Jordan (see
                    Stanley, <hi rend="italic">Sin. and Pal.,</hi> p. 237, n.) “Amalek” also is
                    found in some copies of the LXX., as the translation of Maacah, in 2 Sam. x. 6,
                    8, giving some ground for the belief that a section of the same race had once
                    been settled on the north-east of Palestine (see Ewald, <hi rend="italic">Gesch.
                    Israel's,</hi> Bd. I. 335). There is little in the Bible to illustrate their
                    linguistic affinity; but so far as appears their language was Shemitic,
                    identical with or very closely allied to the Hebrew. Samuel and the captive Agag
                    (1 Sam. xv. 32), and David and the Amalekite youth (2 Sam. i. 13) converse
                    together; and it has been attempted also to explain the names Amalek and Agag by
                    Shemitic analogies (Meier, <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d. morg. Ges.,</hi> Bd. xvii. p. 577). By Philo (<hi rend="italic">Vita</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mosis,</hi> § 39) the Amalekites of the Sinaitic peninsula are
                    called Phoenicians.</p>
                <p>The traditions of the Arabians regarding this race are confused and conflicting,
                    yet certainly are not to be summarily rejected as destitute of any claim to
                    historic credibility; and with all their entanglement they speak strongly for
                    the ancient and far-extended power of the people in question, and also more
                    doubtfully for their Shemitic affinities. In these traditions, Amlak or Amlik,
                    the father of the Amalekites, is represented sometimes as the son of Laud <hi
                    rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> Lud), the son of Shem; sometimes as the son of Aram,
                    the son of Laud; while sometimes also he is spoken of as a son of Ham. They
                    belong, with the Adites, Thamudites, and others, to the primitive races of
                    Arabia. They are said to have been expelled from Babylonia by the Assyrian
                    conquerors, and driven westward into Arabia and Syria, to have built and reigned
                    in Aleppo, to have conquered and for some centuries retained possession of
                    Egypt, and to be the ancestors of the Berbers in North Africa (see Abulfeda, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Ante-Isl.,</hi> pp. 16, 178; Maçoudi, <hi rend="italic">op.

                    rend="italic">Arabes,</hi> vol. i., p. 18); Knobel, <hi rend="italic"

                    Bd. ii., p. 422). With these Arabian accounts it is natural to bring into
                    connection the facte narrated by Manetho, and now in substance ascertained from
                    old Egyptian records, regarding the conquest of the Nile valley by an Arabian
                    race, called Hycsos by the former, and <hi rend="italic">Menti,</hi> or
                    shepherds, in the latter (see Bunsen, <hi rend="italic">Egypt's Place,</hi> vol.
                    iii., p. 266; Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist. d'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Egypte,</hi> vol. i., p. 75; Chabas, <hi rend="italic">Les Pasteurs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">en Egypte,</hi> p. 9) Now, from the time of the eighteenth
                    dynasty, northern Arabia is found in Egyptian monuments to be in possession of a
                    people called Shasu, a name which Egyptologers generally compare with the second
                    syllable of Hycsos, and which also, perhaps, corresponds with Zuzim of Gen. xiv.
                    5. These Shasu may with confidence be identified with the Amalekites of
                    Scripture; their <hi rend="italic">locale</hi> and their habits are the same;
                    and of them we learn that “they were spread over a vast territory, quite like
                    the wandering Arabs of our day. They are found near Djor, on the northeast
                    frontier of Egypt, as well as in the defiles of Lebanon, where their
                    depredations made themselves felt fourteen centuries before our era” (Chabas,
                    <hi rend="italic">Etudes</hi><hi rend="italic">sur l'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiquité Historique,</hi> p. 114; cf. his <hi rend="italic">Voyage</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d'un Egyptien,</hi> p. 111). “They wear short tunics, a
                    turban-like head-dress, and are armed with spears and axes. A characteristic
                    feature is the long beard, as among the Canaanitish nations” (Brugsch, <hi
                    rend="italic">Geog.</hi><hi rend="italic">Inschriften,</hi> Bd. ii. 53).</p>
                <p>The notices occurring in Arabian writers, which speak of Amalekites as spread
                    over various more southern portions of Arabia, may probably be referred to the
                    period subsequent to their expulsion from their northern seats by the Israelites
                    and other enemies. The Benu-Kerker, who dwell around Mecca, are by some referred
                    to this stock; the same is true of the Benu-Amila, who, before migrating
                    northwards into Syria, dwelt in Yemen. We hear of Amalekites also in “Cheibar,
                    Jatrib, and other parts of Hedjaz” (Abulfeda, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi>
                    p. 179); in regard to which notice a certain degree of confirmation is afforded
                    by the mention by Pliny of an Arabian town, the name of which reads Marippa
                    Palmalacum, but which probably should be read Jatrippa Alamalacum, that is,
                    Jatrib the Amalekite (see Pliny, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Nat.</hi> vi. 32; Blau,
                    <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift</hi><hi rend="italic">d. m. Ges.,</hi> Bd. xxii.
                    668; cf. Noldeke, <hi rend="italic">Uber d. Amalekiter,</hi> 37). According to
                    some (Tuch, Blau, and others), the famous Sinaitic inscriptions, ascertained to
                    be written in a Shemitic dialect, are to be ascribed to the Amalekite race.
                    Doubtless their authors dwelt in the country once inhabited by this people, but
                    that they belonged to them, and not to some succeeding race, has not yet been
                    demonstrated.</p>
                <p>From the cuneiform records we have gained as yet no illustration of this subject,
                    unless the people Malikhu, or Malaku, mentioned in the inscriptions of
                    Sennacherib among certain Aramaean tribes inhabiting the valley of the
                    Euphrates, may be identified with Amalek (see <hi rend="italic">Records of the
                    Past,</hi> vol. i., pp. 26, 57).</p>
