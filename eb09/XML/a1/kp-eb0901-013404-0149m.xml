                <p><label type="entry">ADAM</label>, ארם, an appellative noun, meaning the first
                    man. In Genesis ii. 7, 25, iii. 8, 20, iv. 1, &amp;c., it assumes the nature of
                    a proper name, and has the article, <hi rend="italic">the man,</hi> the only one
                    of his kind; yet it is appellative, correctly speaking. In Genesis i. 26, 27, v.
                    2, it is simply appellative, being applied to both progenitors of the human
                    race; not to the first man alone as in the second, third, and fourth chapters.
                    The etymology of the word is uncertain, but it is probably connected with a root
                    signifying <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> so that the idea is one <hi rend="italic"
                    >red</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ruddy.</hi></p>
                <p>The early part of Genesis contains two accounts of man’s creation. These
                    narratives need not be examined at present farther than man’s origin is
                    concerned. In Genesis i. 26, 27, we read, “And God said, Let us make man in our
                    image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
                    and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and
                    over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in
                    his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> image; in the image of God created he him; 'male
                    and female created he them.” At the end of the sixth day of creation man
                    appears, the noblest of earth’s inhabitants. In Genesis ii. 7, 8, we also read,
                    “And the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> formed man <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
                    became a living soul. And the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> God planted a
                    garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.” The woman’s
                    creation is thus narrated in subsequent verses of the same chapter—20, 21, 22,
                    23, “And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every
                    beast of the field: but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. And
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam,
                    and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
                    thereof. And the rib, which the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> God had taken
                    from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, This <hi
                    rend="italic">is</hi> now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be
                    called Woman, because she was taken out of man.” Between these accounts some
                    discrepancy exists. The first represents the man and woman to have been created
                    together, after the various creatures which the earth sustains on its surface;
                    the second makes Adam to have been created first, then the various animals, with
                    the woman last of all. The creation of animals separates the origin of the man
                    and the woman. The first narrator states that man was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n150/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0150-0135"/> made in the image and form of God, without
                    explaining his meaning more particularly. Hence interpreters differ in
                    attempting to define it. The language need not be restricted either to man’s <hi
                    rend="italic">spirit</hi> or to his <hi rend="italic">body,</hi> but may refer
                    to his united whole, including spiritual qualities and bodily form. The ancient
                    Hebrew did not think of God without a certain form, but transferred the human
                    one to him, divesting it of grossness, and giving it an ethereal luminousness of
                    surpassing glory. The image of God, therefore, in which Adam is said to have
                    been created, includes the whole man, with special reference to the spiritual
                    nature within him. We cannot tell whether the writer thought of immortality as
                    involved in the Godlikeness. He may have done so. But the second account teaches
                    that man was only mortal at first, because he is sent out of Paradise lest he
                    should become immortal by eating of the tree of life.</p>
                <p>The narrative in the first chapter is arranged according to a definite plan. Six
                    days are allotted to the creation of the heavens and earth, with all their
                    furniture animate and inanimate. After due preparation had been made by the
                    formation of light, atmosphere, and land separated from water, life is called
                    into existence, first vegetable, then animal, terminating in man the lord of
                    this lower world. The narrative in chapters ii,-iv. does not present such
                    orderly progress. In it man is the central figure, to whom all is subordinated.
                    He is created first. For him plants and trees are made to spring up. He is
                    placed in a delightful garden. The Lord God perceiving his solitary condition
                    creates the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air; but when brought to
                    the protoplast, they were insufficient to supply his mental void, so that woman
                    was made, in whom he found a suitable partner. A number of questions connected
                    with the first pair, not necessarily entering into the writer’s main purpose in
                    describing man’s origin, but complementary and new, are, the means by which the
                    ground yielded vegetable productions, the materials from which the man and the
                    woman were formed, the cause of their intimate union, the place of their abode,
                    the simplicity of their condition, and the way in which animals first received
                    their names. By these traits preparation is made for the history of what befell
                    the protoplasts in their primitive abode.</p>
                <p>According to the second narrative, Jehovah planted a garden in Eden, eastward,
                    and put the first man there. A spring or stream rising in Eden, and flowing
                    through the garden, supplied it with water. In issuing from the garden it
                    divided itself into four rivers, each having its own course. The writer gives
                    their names, and the countries washed by three of them. This garden, usually
                    termed <hi rend="italic">Paradise</hi> after the Septuagint and Vulgate, has
                    been eagerly sought for; but it has baffled curiosity. Though two of the rivers,
                    the Euphrates and Tigris, are well known, the other two, Pison and Gihon, can
                    only be identified with difficulty. They seem to be rivers of Northern India.
                    The Tigris and Euphrates took their rise in the high land of Northern Armenia;
                    the Pison, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Indus, rises in the Himalayas; and the
                    Gihon, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Oxus, is connected with Ethiopia or Cush.
                    The writer appears to have considered them all as having their source in the
                    northern highlands of Asia, and flowing south, and therefore he placed Eden
                    somewhere in the north of Asia. The names of two rivers belonging to a foreign
                    tradition, and little known to the Hebrews because intercourse with India was
                    then remote, were associated with those of two known ones incorporated in the
                    national tradition. If the interpreter had to do with pure history, it might not
                    be amiss to search for Eden in some definite locality; but, as the case stands,
                    the examination would probably be fruitless.</p>
                <p>The garden has two remarkable productions—the tree of life, and the tree of
                    knowledge of good and evil. The former derives its name from the virtue of its
                    fruit to impart perpetual life or immortality. The fruit of the latter
                    communicates the knowledge of good and evil. It awakens moral consciousness. The
                    one had to do with physical, the other with spiritual life. Such were the
                    miraculous powers of the two trees in the midst of the garden.</p>
                <p>The third chapter gives an account of the first pair falling away from the state
                    in which they were created. What that state was may be clearly gathered from the
                    words. It was one of innocent simplicity. The protoplasts had a childlike
                    unconsciousness of evil; no knowledge of right and wrong, virtue and vice. They
                    were in the happy condition, of infancy. Their moral existence had not begun.
                    Perfection, uprightness, righteousness, could not be predicated of them. But the
                    world presents vice and its concomitant misery in strong colours. Misery and
                    evil abound. The eyes of an Oriental especially must have been vividly struck
                    with the phenomena of toilsome work, the pains of child-bearing, the slavery of
                    woman, and the inevitable necessity of death. The Hebrews, accordingly,
                    meditated on the cause. The writer seeks to connect with the problem incidental
                    phenomena, as the love of man and wife, the form of the serpent different from
                    that of other animals, the mutual hatred of man and serpents, &amp;c. It is an
                    old question, the introduction of evil into the world. As all the posterity of
                    the first pair participate in sin and suffering, the cause must be looked for in
                    connection with-these. Yet it must not proceed from themselves. God. had made
                    them innocent and happy. The origin of evil must come from without. A serpent
                    becomes the instrument of their temptation. That cunning and mischievous animal
                    seduces them. The writer thought of nothing but the creature itself. Those who
                    suppose that the devil employed the serpent as his instrument, or that the devil
                    alone is spoken of, are confronted by the fact that the idea of Satan was of
                    later introduction among the Hebrews than the age of the writer. The curse
                    pronounced on the tempter sufficiently shows that none but the agent expressly
                    named was thought of.</p>
                <p>Are these narratives of the creation, primal abode, and. fall of man, literal
                    history? So some have always believed,. with Augustine and the Reformers. The
                    difficulties in the way of this interpretation are great. As it cannot be
                    carried out consistently, its advocates resort to various expedients. They
                    forsake the literal for the figurative; wherever necessity demands. Thus they
                    put a figurative construction on the language of the curse, because they allege
                    that a literal one would be frigid, utterly unworthy of the solemn occasion,
                    highly inconsistent with the. dignity of the speaker and the condition of the
                    parties addressed. Sometimes they even incline to regard the narrative as a sort
                    of poem, or give it a poetical character.. The atmosphere in which the accounts
                    move is different from the literal one. Instead of assuming that God. created
                    the world and all it contains in a moment of time, and in harmonious
                    arrangement, the first writer attributes creation to six successive days,
                    represents the Almighty as addressing the newly-formed existences, looking upon
                    them with satisfaction, pronouncing them good, and resting on the seventh day.
                    He naturally chose the six days of the Hebrew week, with which he was familiar,
                    for successive gradations of the creative power. In the second account we find a
                    speaking serpent, God. walking in a human way in the cool of the day through the
                    garden, his jealousy of the aspiring Adam who had attained a higher knowledge,
                    his cursing the serpent, and cherubim with a flaming sword. To explain all this
                    as literal history, were to attribute other perfections to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n151/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0151-0136"/> Deity than infinite power, spirituality, and
                    wisdom. Hence the Church of England, according to Horsley, does not demand the
                    literal understanding of the document contained in the second and third
                    chapters, as a point of faith.</p>
                <p>Are the narratives allegorical? So Philo<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De mundi Opificio</hi>, p. 37, vol. i. ed.

                    Clement and Origen,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Philocalia,</hi> cap. 1, and contra Cels.</p></note> as well as by
                    Ambrose. In modern times Coleridge read the whole as an allegory.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Aids to
                    Reflection,</hi> p. 241, note (Burlington edition of 1840).</p></note> So did
                    Donaldson in his <hi rend="italic">Jashar.</hi> There is no indication, however,
                    that allegories were intended. Had this been the case, the truths meant to be
                    conveyed would have been easily discovered. The embarrassment and capriciousness
                    of the allegorical interpreters prove that they have followed a wrong method.
                    The outward form is set aside, and an idea discovered beneath it with which the
                    envelope has no necessary connection. Both should be retained; the shell
                    suggesting the kernel, and the kernel showing itself to be the necessary
                    evolution of central ideas.</p>
                <p>According to another interpretation, more commonly accepted among scholars at the
                    present day, both accounts are supposed to be, like the early records of other
                    nations, traditional and mythical. This does not imply that they are fables or
                    fictions; far from it. It is true that the oldest traditions of peoples are
                    mainly subjective, the result of the national mind; but they are nevertheless
                    real. Variable, developed in different forms, influenced by the characteristics
                    of the people and by their intercourse with others, they are all that
                    constitutes the earliest history of nations, the shapings of oral tradition
                    before written records appeared. A mythological age stands at the head of all
                    national histories; and that of the Hebrews seems to be no exception. The two
                    narratives present philosophical mythi in a historical form. They represent the
                    best ideas of the Hebrews at a certain stage of their history in explanation of
                    the creation of man, his primeval abode and state, and the cause of his
                    degeneracy. The first account is plain and simple. It assigns a high dignity to
                    man, and traces all human beings to a single pair, in harmony with the best
                    evidence of modern science that points to unity of origin, rather than to
                    different centres of creation. There is a naturalness in the narrative that
                    cannot be mistaken, while the writer adheres to generalities. (Sec Gabler’s <hi

                <p>On the other hand, the narrator in the second, third, and fourth chapters
                    manifests a more reflective spirit, seeking to explain causes, and to trace
                    connections. Supplying particulars wanting in the older narrative, and
                    correcting others, he enters into details, and though more anthropomorphic, has
                    a finer perception of circumstances associated with the protoplasts. Tholuck
                    himself admits his narrative to be a mythus. It is usual to designate the first
                    writer the Elohist; the second, the Jehovist; because the one commonly uses
                    Elohim as the name of God; the other Jehovah, or Jehovah Elohim in the second
                    and third chapters.</p>
                <p>The Adam in the second and third chapters, according to this view, is the
                    progenitor and representative of humanity, who brought misery into the world by
                    self-will. He is ideal man, becoming historical in every individual who, as soon
                    as his moral nature is awakened, feels the power and the possibility of rising
                    higher through reason and perception. Adam’s procedure repeats itself in each
                    individual, who has his paradise, eats of the tree of knowledge, and feels
                    within him the roots of apostasy from God. On the other hand, his restoration
                    and happiness are supposed to be in his own power. His salvation is practicable
                    through the victory of reason over instinct, of faith over sense.<note

                <p>The traditions of ancient nations present analogies to the creation of man given

                    excess and absurdity. Among those myths in which the formation of men is
                    described without allusion to any primordial distinction of castes, we may quote

                    only one, formed animals from his breaths, <hi rend="italic">a man</hi> from his
                    soul. The soul is the first of the breaths. Since he formed a man from his soul,
                    therefore they say, “man is the first of the animals, and the strongest.” The
                    soul is all the breaths; for all the breaths depend upon the soul. Since he
                    formed man from his soul, therefore they say, “man is all the animals;” for all
                    these are man’s.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Muir’s

                <p>The Greek myths are remotely parallel. Hesiod describes the primitive state as

                    easily obtained, though poor, sustenance. But cunning Prometheus deceived Zeus,
                    and stole fire from heaven. The latter, by way of punishment, sent a beautiful
                    woman, Pandora, whom Epimetheus accepted as a gift. Having with her a vessel
                    into which all sorts of misery had been put, she opened it out of curiosity, and
                    evils flew forth in abundance, filling the earth. Hope alone remained at the
                    bottom.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The story is supplemented and modified in the <hi rend="italic">Theogony.</hi>
                    There Prometheus is twice punished, and woman becomes the source of man’s evils,
                    merely as the original mother of the race. There is also a reconciliation
                    between Zeus and Prometheus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In Aeschylus mankind are presented in the ignorance of infancy till Prometheus
                    implanted in them the power of intellect, and the capability of knowledge. The
                    fire from heaven is not the cause of the evils that broke in upon them; rather
                    is it the teacher of every art, and the opener up of infinite resources; but
                    Prometheus himself must endure fearful punishment for his self-will, in paying
                    too much regard to mortals. Still there is an intimation of future
                    reconciliation between the opposing powers, Zeus and Prometheus.</p>
                <p>The points of similarity between the Old Testament and this Greek representative
                    of man’s fall are tolerably plain. In both there is an original state marked by
                    freedom from sorrow, by complete earthly enjoyment and undisturbed peace with
                    God. Both attach the origin of evil to the act of a free being putting himself
                    in opposition to God— evil being the punishment of that act, arising by means of
                    a woman. As the Old Testament narrative implies that the step taken by man was
                    not a mere degeneracy, so Aeschylus’s description admits that it was for
                    humanity the beginning of a richer and higher life, since man’s proper destiny
                    could not be worked out in a condition of childlike incapacity. Pandora reminds
                    us of Eve; Epimetheus of Adam. Prometheus and the serpent both wish to make men
                    like God in knowledge and happiness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Buttmann's <hi rend="italic">Mythologus,</hi> Band i. p.
                    48, &amp;c.</p></note> The tragic poet seems to regard Prometheus as the
                    archetype of man, so that his fate is theirs. Like every strong-willed mortal,
                    Prometheus flounders on the rock of presumption. He persists in acting contrary
                    to the commands of Deity, and endures torture till he submits to a higher will,
                    accepting the symbols of repentance and restraint within certain limits. Thus,
                    like Adam, he is the representative of humanity.</p>
                <p>The fundamental difference between the Hebrew and Greek narratives is, that the
                    distinction between God and the world, spirit and nature, maintained with all
                    sharpness in the one, is not carried out in the other. On the contrary, the
                    Greek myth mixes the two spheres, so that the world appears as the original,
                    independent element, of which spirit and deity are mere products. In the Hebrew
                    narrative the spiritual features are presented clearly and simply; in the Greek
                    they are indistinct, because transferred to the sensuous world and covered with
                    a luxuriant growth of outer nature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    this; such as the covering of fig leaves, the springing of four rivers from a
                    common source, and the names of two of them which point to India. The tree of
                    life and the seducing spirit have their place in the Persian and Indian
                    religions. But its essence is adapted to the Hebrew theology, and contains
                    genuine Hebrew traits; though it stands tolerably isolated in the circle of
                    ideas which the Old Testament presents. Not till the Book of Wisdom do we find
                    express reference to it (chap. ii. 23, 24), though the tree of life is spoken of
                    in the Proverbs. Yet there is diversity amid similarity. As elaborated by the
                    Hebrew mind, the narrative is a profound theory, with noble features worthy of
                    the subject. Its verisimilitude is apparent. It shows a thoughtful contemplation
                    of human nature, a fine sense of its capacities and weakness, of its aspirations
                    and needs. Its lines are drawn with great discernment. The problem need expect
                    no better solution in this life; for its depths cannot be fathomed by the
                    sounding-line of a finite understanding. Here is the one philosophy of the
                    subject that has taken the deepest hold of the human mind, engrafting itself on
                    the religious systems of very different races, and enlisting the sympathies of
                    the most civilised nations. Originating in the East, it has been transferred to
                    the West, where it lives in pristine vigour. It is the essence of the best ideas
                    and traditions of Eastern Asia, improved and enlarged by the Hebrew mind at a
                    certain period. The more the narrative is examined, the more clearly will it
                    appear the result of enlightened reason. It embodies national traditions of
                    Hebrew reflectiveness. Free from the pantheism and dualism inherent in the
                    mythologies of other peoples, the monotheism which distinguished the Hebrews as
                    the depositaries of a divine truth pervades it. The tradition has two sides. It
                    represents the transition of man to freedom and humanity, as Schiller describes
                    it; his elevation by the awakening exercise of reason; his advance from nature’s
                    cradlingseason to a consciousness of the divine within him; but it represents at
                    the same time the inclination to follow his own will, to aspire to the forbidden
                    contrary to his better conviction, to push reason beyond the limits within which
                    alone it can be legitimately used; in short, to break away from the will of God
                    in self-sufficient independence. While the fact was one of the most fortunate in
                    man’s history, it was also one of the saddest. When moral good was made
                    possible, moral evil was introduced. A knowledge of the one brings that of the
                    other.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Schelling’s

                <p>After Adam fell, God drove him from paradise, whose gates were guarded by
                    cherubim to prevent access to the tree of life. The protoplasts had first three
                    sons—Cain, Abel, Seth; then other sons and daughters. Adam died at the age of
                    930. According to the Elohist, the later race of men descended from Seth, the
                    first born (Genesis v.); according to the Jehovist from Cain, who was the first
                    born (Genesis iv.) A Jewish tradition represents him as buried in Hebron with
                    the patriarchs; a Christian one makes Golgotha his resting-place.</p>
                <p>A number of absurd fables, the fancies of Jewish writers, have gathered round the
                    simple narratives of the Old Testament, and are incorporated in the Talmud. In
                    these Adam is said to have been made as a man-woman out of dust collected from
                    every part of the earth; his head reached to heaven, and the splendour of his
                    face surpassed the sun. The very angels feared him, and all creatures hastened
                    to pay him devotion. The Lord, in order to display his power before the angels,
                    caused a sleep to fall upon him, took away something from all his members, and
                    when he awoke commanded the parts that had been removed to be dispersed over the
                    globe, that the whole earth might be inhabited by his seed. Thus Adam lost his
                    size, but not his completeness. His first wife was Lilith, mother of the demons.
                    But she flew away through the air; and then the Lord created Eve from his rib,
                    brought her to Adam in the most beautiful dress, and angels descending from
                    heaven played on heavenly instruments; sun, moon, and stars dancing. He blessed
                    the pair, and gave them a feast upon a table of precious stone. Angels prepared
                    the most costly viands. But Adam’s glory was envied by the angels; and the
                    seraph Sammael succeeded in seducing him. The pair were driven out of paradise
                    into the place of darkness, and wandered through the earth.<note anchored="true"

                <p>According to the Koran, God created man of dried clay like an earthen vessel,
                    animating the figure, and enduing it with an intelligent soul. When he had
                    placed him in paradise, he formed Eve out of his left side. All the angels
                    worshipped the new man except Eblis, who refused and became an unbeliever. Satan
                    caused them to forfeit paradise, and turned them out of their state of
                    happiness. On Adam’s repentance, God pitied him, and had him taught the divine
                    commandments by the archangel Gabriel; whereupon he was conducted to Arafat, a
                    mountain near Mecca, and found Eve after a separation of 200 years. He was
                    buried on Mount Abukais, near Mecca.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the gnosis of the Mandaeans, Adam is represented as one of the first and holiest
                    aeons. Both catholic and heretical literature indulged in fictions respecting
                    Adam. <hi rend="italic">A Life of Adam</hi> was translated from the Ethiopic
