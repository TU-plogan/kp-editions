                <p><label type="entry">ALLITERATION</label>. As Milton defined rhyme to be “the
                    jingling sound of like endings,” so alliteration is the jingle of like
                    beginnings. All language has a tendency to jingle in both ways, even in prose.
                    Thus in prose we speak of “near and dear,” “high and dry,” “health and wealth.”
                    But the initial form of jingle is much more common—“safe and sound,” “thick and
                    thin,” “weal or <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n623/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0901-0623-0586"/> woe,” “fair or foul,” “spick and span,”
                    “fish, flesh, or fowl,” “kith and kin.” The poets of nearly all times and
                    tongues have not been slow to seize upon the emphasis which could thus be
                    produced. Accordingly we read in Shakespeare :—</p>
                <p>“Full fathom five thy father lies: Of his bones are corals made.”</p>
                <p>In Pope :—</p>
                <p>“Here files of pins extend their shining rows</p>
                <p>Puffs, powders, patches, bibles, billet-doux</p>
                <p>In Gray :—</p>
                <p>“Weave the warp and weave the woof,</p>
                <p>The winding-sheet of Edward’s race.”</p>
                <p>In Coleridge :—</p>
                <p>“The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,</p>
                <p>The furrow followed free;</p>
                <p>We were the first that ever burst</p>
                <p>Into that silent sea.”</p>
                <p>Churchill describes himself as one</p>
                <p>“Who often, but without success, had prayed</p>
                <p>For apt alliteration’s artful aid,—”</p>
                <p>an example which is itself a proof of his failure; for alliteration is never
                    effective unless it runs upon consonants.</p>
                <p>As thus far considered, alliteration is a device wholly dependent on the poet’s
                    fancy. He may use it or not, or use it much or little, at his pleasure. But
                    there is an extensive range of poetry whose metrical laws are entirely based on
                    alliteration. This, for example, is the principle on which Icelandic verse is
                    founded; and we have a yet nearer interest in it, because it furnishes the key
                    to Anglo-Saxon and a large portion of early English verse. For a specimen take
                    the following lines, the spelling modernised, from the beginning of <hi
                        rend="italic">Piers the Ploughman:—</hi></p>
                <p>“But in a <hi rend="italic">M</hi> ay <hi rend="italic">m</hi> orning ∣ on <hi
                        rend="italic">M</hi> alvern hills,</p>
                <p>Me be <hi rend="italic">f</hi> el a <hi rend="italic">f</hi> erly ∣ of <hi
                        rend="italic">f</hi> airy methought;</p>
                <p>I was weary of wandering ∣ and went me to rest</p>
                <p>Under a <hi rend="italic">b</hi> road <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ank ∣ <hi
                        rend="italic">by</hi> a <hi rend="italic">b</hi> urn-side;</p>
                <p>And as I <hi rend="italic">l</hi> ay and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> eaned ∣ and <hi
                        rend="italic">l</hi> ooked on the waters,</p>
                <p>I slumbered in a sleeping ∣ it sounded so merry.”</p>
                <p>The rule of this verse is indifferent as to the number of syllables it may
                    contain, but imperative as to the number of accented ones. The line is divided
                    in the middle by a pause, and each half ought to contain two accented syllables.
                    Of the four accented syllables, the first three should begin with the same
                    letter; the fourth is free, and may start with any letter. Those who wish for a
                    more minute analysis of the laws of alliterative verse, as practised by the
                    Anglo-Saxon and early English poets, may consult an exhaustive essay on the
                    subject by the Rev. W. W. Skeat, prefixed to vol. iii. of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bishop Percy's Folio Manuscript;</hi> only the reader must be on his guard
                    against an error which pervades it, and which this able writer seems to have
                    derived from Rask. The question arises—What is the nature of the cadence in
                    alliterative verse? Now all metrical movement is of two kinds, according as the
                    beat or emphasis begins the movement or ends it. If the beat is initial, we say
                    in classical language that the movement is trochaic or dactylic, according to
                    the number of its syllables; and if the beat is final, we in like manner say
                    that the movement is iambic or anapaestic. Mr Skeat and many others object with
                    some reason to use the classical terms, and therefore brushing them aside, let
                    us put the question in the simplest form—Has the movement of alliterative verse
                    got the initial or the final beat? In the middle of last century Bishop Percy
                    decided this question with sufficient accuracy, though he mixed up his statement
                    with a blunder which it is not easy to account for. He points out how the poets
                    began to introduce rhyme into alliterative verse, until at length rhyme came to
                    predominate over alliteration, and “thus was this kind of metre at length
                    swallowed up and lost in our common burlesque Alexandrine or anapaestic verse,
                    as</p>
                <p>A cobbler there was, and he lived in a stall.”</p>
                <p>Percy made a serious mistake when he gave the name of Alexandrine to anapaestic
                    verse; but he is quite right in his general statement that alliterative verse
                    became lost in a measure, the movement of which had the final beat. Conybeare
                    has stated the fact still more accurately. “In the Saxon poetry a trochaic
                    character is predominant. In <hi rend="italic">Piers Plowman</hi> there is a
                    prevailing tendency to an anapaestic cadence.” It is the result of a change in
                    the language—the loss of inflection. Take the word <hi rend="italic">man.</hi>
                    The genitive in Saxon would be <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >annes,</hi> a trochee; in English, <hi rend="italic">of man,</hi> an
                    iambus. The tendency of the language was thus to pass from a metrical movement,
                    in which the beat was initial, to one in which it was final. It may therefore be
                    quite right to speak of Anglo-Saxon alliterative poetry as trochaic or dactylic,
                    and quite wrong to apply the same terms to the cadence of our later alliterative
                    verse. And this is precisely the error into which Mr Skeat has fallen. He
                    says—“Lines do not always begin with a loud syllable, but often one or two and
                    sometimes (in early English especially) even three soft syllables precede it.
                    These syllables are necessary to the sense, <hi rend="italic">but not to the
                        scansion of the line.”</hi> That is just the point at issue. By leaving out
                    of account the light syllable or syllables at the beginning of a line, and
                    taking his start from the first syllable that has the alliterative beat, Mr
                    Skeat may certainly prove that all the later alliterative poetry has a movement
                    of initial beat. But English ears will not submit to this rule. It is those
                    light syllables of no account which have altered the rhythm of English descant
                    from one of initial to one of final beat. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. s.
