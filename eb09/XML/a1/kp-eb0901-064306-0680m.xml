                <p><label type="entry">ALUM</label>, a compound salt employed in dyeing and various
                    other industrial processes. It is soluble in water, has an astringent, acid, and
                    sweetish taste; reddens vegetable blues, and crystallises in regular
                    octahedrons. When heated, it liquefies; and if the heat be continued, the water
                    of crystallisation is driven off, the salt frothes and swells, and at last a
                    white matter remains, known by the name of <hi rend="italic">burnt
                    alum.</hi></p>
                <p>Its constituents are sulphuric acid, alumina, an alkali, and water. The alkali
                    may be either <hi rend="italic">potash, soda,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ammonia.</hi> Hence there are three distinct species of alum, depending upon
                    the nature of the alkali which each contains. <hi rend="italic">Potash alum</hi>
                    (in which the alkali is potash) is the common alum of this country, although
                    both soda alum and ammoniacal alum are manufactured. The term alum is now used
                    in chemistry as a generic one, and is applied to the class of double salts
                    formed by the union of the sulphates of alumina, chromium, or iron with the
                    sulphates of the alkalies. The composition of the ordinary potash alum is
                    represented by the formula AlK(SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ∙ 12H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O.</p>
                <p>The progress made by chemists in the discovery of the constitution of alum was
                    very slow. The species first investigated was potash alum. That it contained
                    sulphuric acid as a constituent was known even to the alchemists. Pott and
                    Marggraff demonstrated that alumina was another constituent. Pott, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lithogeognosia,</hi> showed that the earth of alum, or the
                    precipitate obtained when an alkali is poured into a solution of alum, is quite
                    different from lime and chalk, with which it had been confounded by Stahl.
                    Marggraff went much farther. He not only showed that alumina is one of the
                    constituents of alum, but that this earth possesses peculiar properties, is
                    different from every other substance, and is one of the ingredients in common
                    clay (“Expériences faites sur la Terre d’Alun,” Marggraff’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Opusc.</hi> ii. 111). Marggraff showed likewise, by many experiments, that
                    crystals of alum cannot be obtained by dissolving alumina in sulphuric acid, and
                    evaporating the solutions. The crystals formed are always soft, and quite
                    different in their appearance from alum crystals. But when a solution of potash
                    or ammonia is dropt into this liquid, it immediately deposits perfect crystals
                    of alum (“Sur la Régénération de l’Alun,” Marggraff’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Opusc.</hi> ii. 86). He mentions likewise that manufacturers of alum in general
                    were unable to procure the salt without a similar addition, that at first it had
                    beer customary to add a quantity of putrid urine, and that afterwards a solution
                    of carbonate of potash was substituted in its place. But subsequent chemists do
                    not seem to have paid much attention to these important observations of
                    Marggraff: they still continued, without any rigid examination, to consider alum
                    as a sulphate of alumina.</p>
                <p>Bergmann indeed had observed that the addition of potash or ammonia made the alum
                    crystallise, but that the same effect was not produced by the addition of soda
                    or of lime (“De Confectione Aluminis,” Bergmann’s <hi rend="italic">Opusc.</hi>
                    i. 225). He had observed likewise that sulphate of potash is frequently found in
                    alum. He decomposed the solution of alum by means of ammonia, evaporated the
                    filtered liquid to dryness, and exposed the residue to a red heat. A quantity of
                    sulphate of potash often remained behind in the crucible (<hi rend="italic"
                    >ibid.,</hi> p. 326). From these facts he drew <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n681/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0681-0644"/> the conclusion that sulphate of potash readily
                    combines with sulphate of alumina.</p>
                <p>After Klaproth had discovered the existence of potash as an ingredient in <hi
                    rend="italic">leucite</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lepidolite,</hi> it occurred to
                    Vauquelin that it was probably an ingredient likewise in many other minerals. He
                    . recollected that alum crystals often make their appearance during the analysis
                    of stony bodies; and, considering that alum cannot be obtained in crystals
                    without the addition of potash, he began to suspect that this alkali constituted
                    an essential ingredient in the salt. A set of experiments, undertaken on purpose
                    to elucidate this important point, soon satisfied him that his conjecture was
                    well-founded. Accordingly, in the year 1797 he published a dissertation
                    demonstrating that alum is a double salt, composed of sulphuric acid, alumina,
                    and potash <hi rend="italic">(Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">de Chimie,</hi>
                    xxii. 258). Soon after, Chaptal published the analysis of four different kinds
                    of alum, namely, Roman alum, Levant alum, British alum, and alum manufactured by
                    himself. This analysis led to the same result as that of Vauquelin <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ann. de Chim.</hi> xxii. 280).</p>
                <p>Since that time alum has been admitted by chemists to be a triple salt, and
                    various analyses of it have been made to determine its constituents. Vauquelin
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ann. de Chim.</hi> 1. 167), Thenard and Board <hi
                    rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> tom. lix. 72), Curaudau <hi rend="italic">(Journal de
                    Physique,</hi> lxvii. 1), and Berzelius <hi rend="italic">(Ann. de Chim.</hi>
                    lxxxii. 258), successively published the results of their experiments. These
                    analyses gradually led to an accurate knowledge of the composition of this
                    salt.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable differences between the three species of alum is the
                    solubility of each in water. At the temperature of 60°, 100 parts of water
                    dissolve—</p>
                <p>9∙37 parts of ammoniacal alum, 14∙79 parts of potash alum, 327∙6 parts of soda
                    alum.</p>
                <p>This great solubility of soda alum renders the manufacture of it very difficult.
                    It does not easily crystallise; indeed, when the weather is hot, crystals of it
                    can hardly be obtained. Its great solubility would render it more convenient and
                    more economical for dyers and calico-printers, provided it could be furnished at
                    the same rate with common alum. But the greater difficulty attending the making
                    of it would probably prevent it from being saleable at a price sufficiently low
                    to make it available as a mordant.</p>
                <p>Soda alum was first mentioned by Mr Winter in 1810, in his account of the Whitby
                    alum processes (Nicholson’s <hi rend="italic">Jour.</hi> XXV. pp. 254, 255); but
                    before that time it had been made by Mr Charles Macintosh of Crossbasket. Mr
                    William Wilson, at Hurlet, near Glasgow, afterwards made it in considerable
                    quantities. Specimens of it have been sent by Dr Gillies from the neighbourhood
                    of Mendoza, in South America, where it occurs native in considerable
                    quantity.</p>
                <p>These three different species of alum differ also somewhat from each other in
                    their specific gravities, which are as follows :—</p>
                <p>Ammoniacal alum 1 ∙ 56</p>
                <p>Potash alum...'. 1 ∙ 75</p>
                <p>Soda alum 1 ∙ 88<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The soda
                    alum whose specific gravity is here given was the native, from the province of
                    St Juan, on the north of Mendoza. It contains less water, and therefore is
                    probably heavier than common soda alum.</p></note></p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">alumen,</hi> which we translate <hi rend="italic"
                    >alum,</hi> occurs in Pliny’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History.</hi> In the
                    15th chapter of his 35th book he gives us a detailed description of it. By
                    comparing this with the account of <hi rend="italic">στvπτηρίa</hi> given by
                    Diosco-rides in the 123d chapter of his 5th book, it is obvious that the two are
                    identical. Pliny informs us that alumen was found naturally in the earth. He
                    calls it <hi rend="italic">salsugo</hi><hi rend="italic">terroe.</hi> Different
                    substances, he informs us, were distinguished by the name of alumen; but they
                    were all characterised by a certain degree of astringency, and were all employed
                    in dyeing and medicine. The light-coloured alumen was useful in brilliant dyes,
                    the dark-coloured only in dyeing black or very dark colours. One species was a
                    liquid, which was apt to be adulterated; but when pure it had the property of
                    striking a black with the juice of the pomegranate. This property seems to
                    characterise a solution of sulphate of iron in water. It is quite obvious that a
                    solution of our alum would possess no such property. Pliny says that there is
                    another kind of alum which the Greeks call <hi rend="italic">schistos.</hi> It
                    forms in white threads upon the surface of certain stones. From the name <hi
                    rend="italic">schistos,</hi> and the mode of formation, there can be little
                    doubt that this species was the salt which forms spontaneously on certain slaty
                    minerals, as alum slate and bituminous shale, and which consists chiefly of
                    sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina. Possibly in certain places the
                    sulphate of iron may have been nearly wanting, and then the salt would be white,
                    and would answer, as Pliny says it did, for dyeing bright colours. Several other
                    species of alumen are described by Pliny, but we are unable to make out to what
                    minerals he alludes.</p>
                <p>The alumen of the ancients, then, was not the same with the alum of the moderns.
                    It was most commonly a sulphate of iron, sometimes probably a sulphate of
                    alumina, and usually a mixture of the two. But the ancients were unacquainted
                    with our alum. They were acquainted with sulphate of iron in a crystallised
                    state, and distinguished it by the names of <hi rend="italic">misy, sory,
                    chalcanthum</hi> (Pliny, xxxiv. 12). As alum and green vitriol were applied to a
                    variety of purposes in common, and as both are distinguished by a sweetish and
                    astringent taste, writers, even after the discovery of alum, do not seem to have
                    discriminated the two salts accurately from each other. In the writings of the
                    alchemists we find the words <hi rend="italic">misy, sory, chalcanthum,</hi>
                    applied to alum as well as to sulphate of iron; and the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >atramentum sutorium,</hi> which ought to belong, one would suppose, exclusively
                    to green vitriol, applied indifferently to both.</p>
                <p>When our alum was discovered is entirely unknown. Beckmann devoted a good deal of
                    attention to the history of this salt, and published a curious dissertation on
                    the subject; but his attempts to trace its origin were unsuccessful. The
                    manufacture of it was discovered in the East, but at what time or place is
                    totally unknown. It would appear that, about four or five hundred years ago,
                    there was a manufactory of it at Edessa in Syria, at that time called
                    Rocca,—hence, it is supposed, the origin of the term <hi rend="italic">rock
                    alum,</hi> commonly employed in Europe; though others allege that the term
                    originated at Civita Vecchia, where alum is made from a yellow mineral which
                    occurs in the state of a hard rock.</p>
                <p>Different alum works existed in the neighbourhood of Constantinople. About the
                    time of the fall of the Grecian empire the art of making alum was transported
                    into Italy, at that period the richest and most manufacturing country in Europe.
                    Bartholomew Pernix, a Genoese merchant, discovered alum ore in the island of
                    Ischia, about the year 1459. Nearly at the same time John di Castro, who was
                    well acquainted with the alum works in the neighbourhood of Constantinople,
                    suspected that a mineral fit for yielding alum existed at Tolfa, because it was
                    covered with the same trees that grew on the alum mineral near Constantinople.
                    His conjecture was verified by trials, and the celebrated manufactory at Tolfa
                    established. Another was begun in the neighbourhood of Genoa; and the
                    manufacture flourished in different parts of Italy. To <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n682/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0682-0645"/> this country it was confined for the greater part
                    of a century. Various manufactories of it were established in Germany by the
                    year 1544.</p>
                <p>England possessed no alum works till the reign of Charles I. Thomas Chaloner, son
                    of Dr Chaloner, who had been tutor to Charles, while hunting on a common in
                    Yorkshire took notice of the soil and herbage, and tasted the water. He found
                    them similar to what he had seen in Germany where alum works were established.
                    In consequence of this he got a patent from Charles for an alum work. Since that
                    time various alum works have been established in different parts of Great
                    Britain,— the most important now in operation being the Whitby works, originally
                    established by Mr Chaloner; and the works at Pendleton, near Manchester, and
                    Goole, Yorkshire, and at Hurlet and Campsie, both in the neighbourhood of
                    Glasgow.</p>
                <p>Several alum works exist in Sweden, particularly in West Gothland. There is one,
                    for example, at Haensaeter, near the borders of the Wener Lake. But for a
                    description of the Swedish works we refer to Bergmann’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Op</hi><hi rend="italic">uscula,</hi> i. 284, or English translation, i.
                    342.</p>
                <p>Various minerals are employed in the manufacture of alum, but by far the most
                    important of them are the following three: <hi rend="italic">alum-stone,
                    alum-slate, bituminous shale.</hi></p>
                <p>Alum-stone or Alunite was first observed at Tolfa, near Rome, in the 15th
                    century, and afterwards in Hungary and several other places, chiefly in trachyte
                    or other volcanic rocks. It appears to be produced by the action of sulphureous
                    vapours on the felspars they contain, and generally occurs in compact, granular,
                    or earthy masses, mixed with quartz or felspar. Small crystals are found in
                    cavities, and are either rhombohedrons with angles of 89° 10', and thus nearly
                    cubes, or these with the polar angles replaced by the basal plane. The specific
                    gravity ranges from 2∙58 to 2∙752, the compact varieties being the lighter. Its
                    hardness is 3 ∙ 5 to 4, or rather softer than fluor spar. It has a distinct
                    cleavage perpendicular to the axis of the rhombohedron, and conchoidal fracture
                    in other directions. The pure varieties are white and colourless, but it is
                    often coloured greyish, yellowish, or reddish. The crystals decrepitate before
                    the blowpipe, but are infusible, as well as the compact alunite. The alum is
                    extracted from this mineral by repeated roasting and treating with water. The
                    absence of iron accounts for the superior purity for which the Roman alum was
                    long celebrated.</p>
                <p>Alum-slate is a far more abundant substance, occurring in beds in different
                    formations. Thus it is common in the older Palaeozoic or Silurian strata of
                    Scandinavia and Scotland. Generally it is distinctly slaty, but sometimes forms
                    rounded balls or concretions. It contains much carbonaceous matter, and hence
                    its colour is greyish or bluish-black. It has a dull lustre, is soft and
                    sectile. It contains much disseminated iron pyrites, and on decomposition in the
                    air yields sulphate of iron, and alum as an efflorescence on the surface.</p>
                <p>Many of the shales or slate clays in the coal formation also contain much iron
                    pyrites, and thus also produce alum when acted on by the atmosphere. Such are
                    those used for manufacturing alum at Campsie and other places near Glasgow.
                    Where they contain much bituminous matter they show a shining resinous streak
                    and greyish-black colour, and are named bituminous shales. These burn when
                    heated, with a pale flame and sulphureous odour.</p>
                <p>The alum slates at Whitby in Yorkshire belong to the Lias, and are used in the
                    alum works in that neighbourhood. In other places, as in many parts of Germany,
                    similar beds are found in Tertiary formations, particularly in connection with
                    the brown coal deposits. When fresh dug they often show no trace of alum, which
                    only appears after exposure to the air, or when the decomposition of the iron
                    pyrites is assisted by the action of heat.</p>
                <p>Several native varieties of sulphate of alumina and soda alum occur in South
                    America, some of the most remarkable of which it may be proper to specify.</p>
                <p>1. Sulphate of alumina, or Alunogene, was first found at Rio Saldanha, but is now
                    obtained from several places in Europe and America. The colour is white, here
                    and there tinged yellow, obviously from external impurities. It occurs in fine
                    crystalline needles; lustre silky; taste that of alum, but stronger; specific
                    gravity, 1∙6 to 1∙7; soft; before the blowpipe behaves like alum.</p>
                <p>2. Soda-alum. It occurs native in the province of St Juan, situated to the north
                    of Mendoza, on the east side of the Chilian Andes, at about 30° S. lat. The alum
                    is white, and composed of fibres adhering longitudinally, and having a certain
                    breadth, but very thin. It bears some resemblance to fibrous gypsum, but it is
                    harder, not being scratched by the nail, though the knife scratches it with
                    great ease. It is sectile. The outer fibres are white and only slightly
                    translucent, as if they had lost a portion of their water; but the internal
                    fibres are transparent, and have a silky aspect. It tastes precisely like alum,
                    and is very soluble, water at the temperature of 62° dissolving 3∙773 parts of
                    it, and boiling water dissolving any quantity whatever. When exposed to heat, it
                    behaves very nearly as common alum.</p>
                <p>3. There is a mineral called <hi rend="italic">aluminite,</hi> which was observed
                    in the environs of Halle many years ago, and which was afterwards detected by Mr
                    Webster in clay resting on chalk at Newhaven in Sussex. This, if it were
                    sufficiently abundant, would constitute an excellent material for the
                    manufacture of alum. Its colour is snow-white. It occurs in reniform pieces of
                    greater or smaller size; fracture fine earthy; dull; streak glistening; opaque;
                    adheres feebly to the tongue; soils very slightly; very soft; feels fine, but
                    meagre; specific gravity, 1 ∙ 7054. It consists of alumina, sulphuric acid, and
                    water.</p>
                <p>Four different processes are employed in the manufacture of alum, according to
                    the nature of the mineral from which the alum is to be extracted.</p>
                <p>The process employed at Tolfa is the simplest of all. If the Tolfa stone be kept
                    constantly moistened with water for about two months, it falls to powder of
                    itself, and yields alum by lixiviation. But this is not the process employed by
                    the manufacturers. The alum-stone is broken into small pieces, and piled on the
                    top of a perforated dome, in which a wood fire is kindled. The smoke and flame
                    of the wood penetrate through the pieces of alum-stone, and a sulphureous odour
                    is disengaged, owing to the decomposition of a portion of the sulphuric acid in
                    the stone. This roasting is twice performed; the pieces of ore which the first
                    time were at the edge of the dome, being the second time put in the middle. The
                    process of roasting this stone requires considerable attention. If the heat be
                    too great, the quality of yielding alum is destroyed: if the heat be too small,
                    the stone does not readily fall to powder. There can be little doubt that the
                    unroasted stone would yield more alum than the roasted; but probably the
                    additional labour requisite in the latter case would more than swallow up the
                    increase of product.</p>
                <p>The roasted stone, which has now acquired a reddish colour, is placed in rows
                    between trenches filled with water. This liquid is so frequently sprinkled on it
                    that the stone is always moist. In two or three days it falls to powder, like
                    slacked quicklime; but the daily watering is continued for a month. The success
                    of this part of the operation is said to depend very much on the weather. When
                    the weather is rainy, the alum is all washed <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n683/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0683-0646"/> out, and little or nothing left for the
                    manufacturer to extract.</p>
                <p>When the stone has by this process been reduced to a sufficiently fine powder, it
                    is thrown into a leaden boiler filled two-thirds with water. During the boiling
                    the powder is frequently stirred up, and the water that evaporates is replaced.
                    When the boiling has been continued for a sufficient time, the fire is
                    withdrawn, and time allowed for the earthy matter to subside to the bottom. A
                    cock is then opened, which allows the clear liquor to flow out into deep wooden
                    square vessels, so made that they can be easily taken to pieces. Here the alum
                    gradually crystallises, and attaches itself to the sides and bottom of the
                    vessel. The mother liquid is then drawn off into shallower wooden troughs, where
                    more alum crystals are deposited. The liquid has now a red colour, and is muddy;
                    and the last alum crystals are mixed with this red matter. They are washed clean
                    in the mother liquor, which is finally pumped into a trough, and used in
                    subsequent processes.</p>
                <p>The alum obtained at Tolfa is known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Roman
                    alum,</hi> and is in very high estimation. It is always mixed with a little
                    reddish powdery matter, which is easily separated from it.</p>
                <p>Alum-slate, being very different in its composition, requires a different
                    treatment to fit it for yielding alum. If the alum-slate contain a notable
                    quantity of lime or magnesia, it does not answer the purposes of the
                    manufacturer so well. The essential ingredients in alum-slate, for the
                    alum-makers, are alumina and iron pyrites.</p>
                <p>The first process is to roast the ore. In Sweden, where the fuel is wood, and
                    consequently expensive, it is customary to use the alum-slate itself as fuel for
                    roasting the ore. For this purpose a small layer of brushwood is covered with
                    pieces of alum-slate, and set on fire; and, as the combustion proceeds, new
                    layers of alum-slate are added. It is usual to place alternate layers of roasted
                    and unroasted alum-slate. The combustion continues for a month or six weeks. At
                    Whitby, coal is employed for roasting the alum-slate. Indeed the alum-slate of
                    Whitby is lighter coloured than that of Sweden, and probably would not burn of
                    itself. So great is the quantity of combustible matter in the Swedish alum-slate
                    that it is employed as fuel for burning limestone. Great quantities of limestone
                    are burnt in this manner at Hunneberg, near the south side of the lake Wener.
                    The roasted ore has usually a brown colour. When it is red the quantity of alum
                    which it yields is considerably diminished.</p>
                <p>By this roasting the pyrites is oxidised into sulphate of iron and sulphuric
                    acid, thus :—</p>
                <p>FeS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + O <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> + H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = FeSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>The sulphuric acid as it is produced is, however, at once neutralised by the
                    large excess of alumina producing sulphate, so that the result of the action is
                    to produce a mixture of the sulphates of iron and alumina.</p>
                <p>The roasted ore has an astringent taste, owing to the sulphate of iron and
                    sulphate of alumina which it contains. The next process is to lixiviate it with
                    water, in order to dissolve these salts. For this purpose it is put into
                    reservoirs made of wood or masonry, with a stopcock at the bottom to draw off
                    the water. The usual method is to keep the water for twelve hours in contact
                    with ore that has been twice lixiviated; then to draw it off, and allow it to
                    remain for an equal period on ore that has been once lixiviated. Lastly, it is
                    run upon fresh ore, and allowed to remain on it for twelve hours longer. If the
                    specific gravity of the liquid thus treated be 1 ∙ 25 at the temperature of 55°,
                    it may be considered as saturated with sulphate of alumina and sulphate of iron;
                    but probably this specific gravity is not often obtained.</p>
                <p>The Equid, thus impregnated with salt, is now boiled down in leaden vessels to
                    the proper consistency for crys-tallisation. In Sweden the fuel employed for
                    this purpose is alum-slate. By this means a double effect is produced—the liquid
                    is evaporated, and the alum-slate is roasted. During the boiling abundance of
                    oxide of iron falls, mixed with selenite, if Erne be one of the constituents of
                    the alum-slate. When the Equid is sufficiently concentrated it is let into a
                    square reservoir, in order to crystallise. Great quantities of sulphate of iron
                    crystals are usually deposited in this vessel. These are collected by drawing
                    the Equid off into another reservoir. When all the sulphate of iron that can be
                    obtained has been separated, a quantity of sulphate of potash or ammonia,
                    muriate of potash, or putrid urine, is mixed with the Equid. The sulphate of
                    potash is procured from the sulphuric acid makers, and the muriate of potash
                    from the soap-makers. By this addition alum is formed in the Equid, and it
                    gradually deposits itself in crystals on the sides of the vessel. These crystals
                    are collected, and dissolved in the smallest quantity of boiling water that will
                    take them up. This solution is poured into large wooden casks. In a fortnight or
                    three weeks the alum crystal-lises, and covers the sides and bottom of the cask.
                    The hoops are now taken off, and the staves of the cask removed. A mass of alum
                    crystals, having the shape of the cask, remains. This mass is pierced, the
                    mother liquor allowed to run out, and preserved for a subsequent process. The
                    alum, being now broken in pieces, is fit for sale.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of alum from bituminous shale and slate-clay bears a considerable
                    resemblance to the manufacture from alum-slate, but differs in several
                    particulars. We shall give a sketch of the processes followed in two works of
                    this kind that are in operation in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. The bituminous
                    shale and slateclay employed are obtained from old coal-pits, which are very
                    extensive near Glasgow. The air in these coal-pits is moist, and its average
                    temperature about 62°. The shale having been exposed for many years, has
                    gradually opened in the direction of its slaty fracture, so as to resemble in
                    some respects a half-shut fan; and all the chinks in it are filled with a saline
                    efflorescence in threads. This salt is white, with a shade of green, has a
                    sweetish astringent taste, and consists of a mixture of sulphate of iron and
                    sulphate of alumina. In order to obtain these salts in a state of solution,
                    nothing more is requisite than to lixiviate this shale with water. The
                    lixiviated ore being left exposed to the weather, forms more salt, which is
                    gradually washed out of it by the rain-water, and this water is collected and
                    preserved for use.</p>
                <p>The next step in the process is to boil down the liquid to a sufficient state of
                    concentration. At Campsie all the boilers are composed of stone, and the heat is
                    applied to the surface. This is a great saving, as leaden vessels are not only
                    much more expensive, but require more frequent renewal. When the liquid is
                    raised to a sufficiently high temperature in the stone reservoir, pounded
                    sulphate of potash, or muriate of potash, as they can be procured, is mixed with
                    it; and there is an agitator in the vessel, by which it is continually stirred
                    about. This addition converts the sulphate of alumina into alum. The Equid is
                    now let into another trough, and allowed to remain till it crystallises. In this
                    Equid there are two salts contained in solution—viz., sulphate of iron and alum;
                    and it is an object of great consequence to separate them completely from each
                    other. The principal secret consists in drawing off the mother liquor at the
                    proper time; for the alum is much less soluble in water than the sulphate of
                    iron, and therefore crystallises first. The first crystals of alum formed are
                    very impure. They have a yellow colour, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n684/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0684-0647"/> seem to be partly impregnated with sulphate of
                    iron. They are dissolved in hot water, and the solution poured into troughs, and
                    allowed to crystallise a second time. These second crystals, though much purer,
                    are not quite free from sulphate of iron; but the separation is accomplished by
                    washing them repeatedly with cold water; for sulphate of iron is much more
                    soluble in that liquid than alum. These second crystals are now dissolved in as
                    small a quantity of hot water as possible, and the concentrated liquid poured
                    while hot into large casks, the surface of which is covered with two cross
                    beams. As the liquor cools, a vast number of alum crystals form on the sides and
                    surface. The casks are allowed to remain till the liquid within is supposed to
                    be nearly of the temperature of the atmosphere. This, in winter, requires eleven
                    days; in summer, fourteen or more. The liquid, after standing eleven days in
                    summer, has been observed to be still above blood heat. The hoops are then
                    removed, precisely as in the manufacture of alum from alum-slate.</p>
                <p>There always remains in the boilers a yellowish substance, consisting chiefly of
                    peroxide of iron. This is exposed to a strong heat in a reverberatory furnace,
                    and it becomes red. In this state it is washed, and yields more alum. The red
                    residue is ground to a fine powder, and dried. It then answers all the purposes
                    of Venetian red as a pigment. By altering the temperature to which this matter
                    is exposed, a yellow ochre is obtained instead of a red.</p>
                <p>In France, where alum ores are by no means abundant, alum is manufactured from
                    clay. This method of making the salt was first put in practice by Chaptal when
                    professor of chemistry at Montpellier. His methods have been since gradually
                    improved, and brought to a state of considerable perfection. The first process
                    tried was this: The clay was reduced to a fine powder in a mill, and then mixed
                    with sulphuric acid. After remaining some days, it was exposed for twenty-four
                    hours to a temperature of about 130°. It was then lixiviated, and the liquid
                    mixed with urine or potash. This method being found inconvenient, was abandoned
                    for the following:—The clay being well ground, was mixed with half its weight of
                    the saline residue from a mixture of sulphur and nitre. This residue is little
                    else than sulphate of potash. The mixture was formed into balls about 5 inches
                    in diameter, which were calcined in a potter’s furnace. They were then placed on
                    the floor of a chamber in which sulphuric acid was made. The acid vapour caused
                    them to swell, and to open on all sides. In about a month they were sufficiently
                    penetrated with the acid. They were then exposed to the air, under shades, that
                    the saturation might become more complete. Finally, they were lixiviated, and
                    the liquid being evaporated, yielded pure alum.</p>
                <p>This process was considerably improved by Berard, of the Montpellier alum work.
                    Instead of exposing the calcined balls to the fumes of sulphuric acid, he
                    sprinkled them with a quantity of sulphuric acid of the specific gravity 1 ∙
                    367, equal to the weight of the clay employed; but it is obvious that the
                    proportion must vary with the nature of the clay. The solution takes place with
                    the greatest facility, and crystals of alum are obtained by evaporating the
                    liquid.</p>
                <p>Another process was put in practice by Chaptal, in the neighbourhood of Paris. A
                    mixture is made of 100 parts of clay, 50 parts of nitre, and 50 parts of
                    sulphuric acid of the specific gravity 1 ∙ 367; and this mixture is put into a
                    retort and distilled. Aquafortis comes over, and the residue in the retort being
                    lixiviated with water, yields abundance of excellent alum.</p>
