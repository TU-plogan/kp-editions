                    K.B., Lieutenant-General in the British army, was the eldest son of George
                    Abercromby of Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, and was born in October 1734. After
                    passing some time at an excellent school at Alloa, he went to Rugby, and in
                    1752-53 he attended classes in Edinburgh University. In 1754 he was sent to
                    Leipsic to study civil law, with a view to his proceding to the Scotch bar, of
                    which it is worthy of notice that both his grandfather and his father lived to
                    be the oldest members. On returning from the Continent he expressed a strong
                    preference for the military profession, and a cornet’s commission was
                    accordingly obtained for him (March 1756) in the 3d Dragoon Guards. He rose
                    through the intermediate gradations to the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the
                    regiment (1773), and in 1781 he became colonel of the 103d infantry. When that
                    regiment was disbanded in 1783 he retired upon half-pay. That up to this time he
                    had scarcely been engaged in active service, was owing mainly to his disapproval
                    of the policy of the Government, and especially to his sympathies with the
                    American colonists in their struggles for independence; and his retirement is no
                    doubt to be ascribed to similar feelings. But on France declaring war against
                    England in 1793, he hastened to resume his professional duties; and, being
                    esteemed one of the ablest and most intrepid officers in the whole British
                    forces, he was appointed to the command of a brigade under the Duke of York, for
                    service in Holland. He commanded the advanced guard in the action on the heights
                    of Cateau, and was wounded at Nimeguen. The duty fell to him of protecting the
                    British army in its disastrous retreat out of Holland, in the winter of 1794-5.
                    In 1795 he received the honour of knighthood, the Order of the Bath being
                    conferred on him in acknowledgment of his services. The same year he was
                    appointed to succeed Sir Charles Grey, as commander-in-chief of the British
                    forces in the West Indies. In 1796, Grenada was suddenly attacked and taken by a
                    detachment of the army under his orders. He afterwards obtained possession of
                    the settlements of Demerara and Essequibo, in South America, and of the islands
                    of St Lucia, St Vincent, and Trinidad. He returned in 1797 to Europe, and, in
                    reward for his important services, was appointed to the command of the regiment
                    of Scots Greys, intrusted with the governments of the Isle of Wight, Fort
                    George, and Fort Augustus, and raised to the rank of lieutenant-general. He
                    held, in 1797-8, the chief command of the forces in Ireland. There he laboured
                    to maintain the discipline of the army, to suppress the rising rebellion, and to
                    protect the people from military oppression, with a care worthy alike of a great
                    general and an enlightened and beneficent statesman. When he was appointed to
                    the command in Ireland, an invasion of that country by the French was
                    confidently anticipated by the English Government. He used his utmost efforts to
                    restore the discipline of an army that was utterly disorganised; and, as a first
                    step, he anxiously endeavoured to protect the people, by re-establishing the
                    supremacy of the civil power, and not allowing the military to be called out,
                    except when it was indispensably necessary for the enforcement of the law and
                    the maintenance of order. Finding that he received no adequate support from the
                    head of the Irish Government, and that all his efforts were opposed and thwarted
                    by those who presided in the councils of Ireland, he resigned the command. His
                    departure from Ireland was deeply lamented by the reflecting portion of the
                    people, and was speedily followed by those disastrous results which he had
                    anticipated, and which he so ardently desired and had so wisely endeavoured to
                    prevent. After holding for a short period the office of Commander-in-Chief in
                    Scotland, Sir Ralph, when the enterprise against Holland was resolved upon in
                    1799, was again called to command under the Duke of York. The difficulties of
                    the ground, the inclemency of the season, unavoidable delays, the disorderly
                    movements of the Russians, and the timid duplicity of the Dutch, defeated the
                    objects of that expedition. But it was confessed by the Dutch, the French, and
                    the British alike, that even victory the most decisive could not have more
                    conspicuously proved the talents of this distinguished officer. His country
                    applauded the choice, when, in 1801, he was sent with an army to dispossess the
                    French of Egypt. His experience in Holland and the West Indies particularly
                    fitted him for this new command, as was proved by his carrying his army in
                    health, in spirits, and with the requisite supplies, in spite of very great
                    difficulties, to the destined scene of action. The debarkation of the troops at
                    Aboukir, in the face of an opposing force, is justly ranked among the most
                    daring and brilliant exploits of the English army. A battle in the neighbourhood
                    of Alexandria (March 21, 1801) was the sequel of this successful landing, and it
                    was Sir R. Abercromby's fate to fall in the moment of victory. He was struck by
                    a spent ball, which could not be extracted, and died seven days after the'
                    battle. The Duke of York paid a just tribute to the great soldier’s memory in
                    the general order issued on the occasion of his death :—“His steady observance
                    of discipline, his ever-watchful attention to the health and wants of his
                    troops, the persevering and unconquerable spirit which marked his military
                    career, the splendour of his actions in the field, and the heroism of his death,
                    are worthy the imitation of all λvho desire, like him, a life of heroism and a
                    death of glory.” By a vote of the House of Commons, a monument was erected in
                    honour of Sir Ralph Abercromby in St Paul’s Cathedral. His widow was created a
                    peeress, and a pension of £2000 a year was settled on her and her two successors
                    in the title. It may be mentioned that Abercromby was returned, after a keen
                    contest, as member of Parliament for his native county of Clackmannanshire in
                    1773; but a parliamentary life had no attractions for him, and he did not seek
                    re-election. A memoir of the later years of his life (1793-1801), by his son,
                    Lord Dunfermline, was published in 1861.</p>
