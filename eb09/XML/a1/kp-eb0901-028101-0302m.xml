                    the name, son of Archidamus II., was, through the influence of Lysander, raised
                    to the throne in 398 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> in opposition to the
                    superior claim of his nephew Leoty-chides. Immediately on his accession he
                    advised the Lacedaemonians to anticipate the king of Persia, who was making
                    great preparations for war, and attack him in his own dominions. He was himself
                    chosen for this expedition, and gained so many advantages over the enemy that,
                    if the league which the Athenians and the Thebans formed against the
                    Lacedaemonians had not obliged him to return home, it seems probable that he

                    empire. But he readily gave up all these triumphs to come to the succour of his
                    country, which he happily relieved by his victory over the allies at Chaeronea,
                    in Bceotia, 394 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> He obtained another near Corinth;
                    but, to his great mortification, the Thebans afterwards gained several victories
                    over the Lacedaemonians. This at first raised a clamour against him. He had been
                    ill when the course of victory turned in favour of the enemy; but as soon as he
                    was able to act in person his valour and prudence prevented the Thebans from
                    reaping the advantages of their successes; so that it was generally believed
                    that, had he been in health at the beginning, the Lacedaemonians would have
                    sustained no losses, and that without him all would have been lost. It cannot be
                    denied, however, that his fondness for war occasioned many losses to his
                    countrymen, and led them into enterprises which in the end contributed much to
                    weaken their power. He died in the third year of the 103d Olympiad, being the
                    84th year of his age and 38th of his reign, and was succeeded by his son
                    Archidamus. Agesilaus, though a vigorous ruler and great general, was of small
                    stature, and lame from his birth. His accession to the throne was, indeed,
                    opposed on this ground, an oracle having foretold evils to Sparta under a lame
                    sovereignty. As we have seen, the oracle was <pb break="no"

                    state during his reign. Few of these, however, are traceable to the policy of
                    the king, whose public life was illustrated by a series of brilliant victories
                    over the enemies of his country. In character, Agesilaus seems to have possessed
                    the Spartan virtues of courage, temperance, and fortitude, without the Spartan
                    vices of hardness, cupidity, and injustice. His life aud merits have been
                    commemorated by Xenophon, Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, and Cornelius Nepos.</p>
