                    continental part of the kingdom of the two Sicilies, afterward subdivided into
                    Abruzzo Ulteriore I., Abruzzo Ulteriore II., and Abruzzo Citeriore, which were
                    so named from their position relative to Naples, and now form three of the
                    provinces of the kingdom of Italy. The district, which was the most northerly
                    part of the kingdom of the two Sicilies, is bounded by the Adriatic on the E.,
                    and by the provinces of Ascoli Piceno on the N., Umbria and Rome on the W., and
                    Terra di Lavoro, Molise, and Capitanata on the S. The Abruzzi provinces have an
                    area of nearly 4900 English square miles, and extend from N. lat. 41° 40' to 42°
                    55'. Though presenting to the Adriatic a coast of about 80 miles in length, they
                    have not a single good port This territory is mostly rugged, mountainous, and
                    covered with extensive forests, but contains also many fertile and well-watered
                    valleys. The Apennines traverse its whole extent, running generally from N.W. to
                    S.E., and here attaining their greatest elevation. Near Aquila is Monte Como,
                    the loftiest peak of that chain, called <hi rend="italic">Il gran Sasso
                    d’Italia,</hi> or the great rock of Italy, which rises to the height of 9813
                    feet. Monte Majella and Monte Velino attain the height of 9500 and 8792 feet
                    respectively. From the main range of the Apennines a number of smaller branches
                    run off towards the west. The country is watered by numerous small rivers, most
                    of which fall into the Adriatic. They are often suddenly swollen by the rains,
                    especially in the spring, and thus cause considerable damage to the lands
                    through which they pass. The principal rivers are the Tronto, Trentino, Pescara,
                    and Sangro. In Abruzzo Ulteriore II. is lake Celano or Lago di Fucino, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lacus Fucinus</hi> of the Romans, now reduced to about one-third
                    of its former extent. The climate varies with the elevation, but, generally
                    speaking, is temperate and healthy. Agriculture is but little understood or
                    attended to, although in many of the lower parts of the country the land is
                    fertile. The rivers are not embanked, nor is irrigation practised; so that the
                    best of the land is frequently flooded during the rainy season, and parched in
                    the heat of summer. The principal productions are corn, hemp, flax, almonds,
                    olives, figs, grapes, and chestnuts. In the neighbourhood of Aquila saffron is
                    extensively cultivated, although not to such an extent as formerly. The rearing
                    and tending of sheep is the chief occupation of the inhabitants of the
                    highlands; and the wool, which is of a superior quality, is an important article
                    of commerce, while the skins are sent in large quantities to the Levant. Bears,
                    wolves, and wild boars inhabit the mountain fastnesses; and in the extensive oak
                    forests numerous herds of swine are fed, the hams of which are in high repute.
                    The manufactures are very inconsiderable, being chiefly woollen, linen, and silk
                    stuffs, and earthen and wood wares. Abruzzo was of great importance to the
                    kingdom of Naples, being its chief defence to the north, and presenting almost
                    insurmountable difficulties to the advance of an enemy. The country is now free
                    of the daring brigands by whom it was long infested. The inhabitants are a
                    stout, well-built, brave, and industrious race. Their houses are generally
                    miserable huts; their food principally maize, and their drink bad wine. The
                    railway from Ancona to Brindisi passes through Abruzzo Ulteriore I. and Abruzzo
                    Citeriore, skirting the coast; and a line has been projected from Pescara, by
                    Popoli, the Lago di Fucino, and the valley of the Liris, to join the railway
                    from Rome to Naples, and thus open up the interior of the country. The line is
                    open for traffic between Pescara and Popoli.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abruzzo</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Ulteriore</hi> I. is the
                    most northerly of the three provinces, and has an area of 1283 square miles,
                    with a population in 1871 of 245,684. The western part of the province is very
                    mountainous, the highest crest of the Apennines dividing it from Abruzzo
                    Ulteriore II. The valleys possess a rich soil, well watered by rivulets and
                    brooks in the winter and spring, but these are generally dried up in the summer
                    months. The streams run mostly into the Pescara, which bounds the province
                    towards Abruzzo Citeriore, or into the Tronto, which is the northern boundary.
                    The city of Teramo is the capital of the province.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abruzzo</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Ulteriore</hi> II. is an
                    inland district, nearly covered with mountains of various heights, one of which
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Gran Sasso.</hi> There are no plains; but among the
                    mountains are some beautiful and fruitful valleys, watered by the various
                    streams that run through them. None of the rivers are navigable. The province
                    has an area of 2510 square miles, and in 1871 contained 332,782 inhabitants. Its
                    chief town is Aquila.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abruzzo Citeriore</hi> lies to the south and east of the
                    other two provinces. It is the least hilly of the three, but the Apennines
                    extend through the south-west part. They, however, gradually decline in height,
                    and stretch away into plains of sand and pebbles. The rivers all run to the
                    Adriatic, and are very low during the summer months. The soil is not very
                    productive, and agriculture is in a very backward state; the inhabitants prefer
                    the chase and fishing. The province contains 1104 square miles, with a
                    population of 340,299 in 1871. Its chief town is Chieti.</p>
