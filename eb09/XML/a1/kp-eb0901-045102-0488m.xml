                    On the 13th Feb. 1511 he joined the Teutonic order; and a few days after, though
                    scarcely twenty-one years old, was chosen grand master, it being expected that,
                    as nephew of Sigismund of Poland, he would be able to secure the privileges and
                    immunities which the order were at the time claiming from that monarch. The
                    refusal of Albert to swear allegiance to Sigismund led, after protracted
                    negotiations, which proved fruitless, to a war with Poland in 1520. A four
                    years’ truce being concluded at Thorn in 1521, Albert repaired to the diet at
                    Nuremberg to invoke the aid of his brother German princes on behalf of his
                    order. The diet found itself unable to render him any assistance, and at the
                    same time he received advice from Luther which altogether changed his purpose.
                    Embracing the doctrines of the Reformation, he was declared Duke of Prussia,
                    consented to hold the duchy as a fief from Poland, and took the oath of
                    allegiance at Cracow on the 9th April 1525. At the same time he resigned the
                    grand mastership of the order. In 1527 he married Anne Dorothea, daughter of the
                    king of Denmark. His subsequent reign was marked by zealous efforts, amid many
                    difficulties, to promote the welfare of his duchy. He interested himself
                    especially in the advancement of learning, inviting men of letters to his court,
                    and promoting the publication of their writings. In 1544 he founded the
                    university of Königsberg, in spite of great opposition, chiefly from the pope.
                    Keen theological disputes between the professors of this university were among
                    the many troubles of his later years. He died of the plague on the 20th of March
                    1568. His second wife, the Princess Anna Maria of Brunswick, who had been
                    attacked by the same disease, survived him only a single day.</p>
