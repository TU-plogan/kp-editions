                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0612-0575"/> has its foundation in mistaken views of political
                    economy. It arose from the impression that the produce of the energy and
                    enterprise of any community is a limited quantity, of which each man’s share
                    will be the less the more competitore there are; superseding the just view that
                    the wealth of a state depends on the number and energy of the producers. Thus
                    the skilled workmen who would increase its riches have often been jealously kept
                    out of a country. But, on the other hand, special temptations, including the
                    gift of citizenship, have often been offered to skilled foreigners by states
                    desiring to acquire them as citizens. Britain has occasionally received
                    industrious and valuable citizens, driven forth by the folly or tyranny of other
                    powers, as in the memorable instance of the revocation of the edict of Nantes,
                    which sent the Spitalfields colony and many other Frenchmen to this country.
                    Looking on the full benefit of British citizenship as a transcendent boon, the
                    principle of our older legislation on the subject has been to allow friendly
                    aliens to possess at least a portion of it. There never existed in Britain a law
                    so harsh as the <hi rend="italic">Droit d'</hi><hi rend="italic">Aubaine</hi> of
                    France, which confiscated to the crown all the property of a deceased alien. The
                    courts of justice have ever been opened to them, and they have thus been
                    entitled to protect themselves from any inequalities which do not apply to them
                    by special law. It seems to be a rule of the general public law that an alien
                    can be sent out of the realm by exercise of the crown’s prerogative; but in
                    modern practice, whenever it has seemed necessary to extrude foreigners, a
                    special Act of Parliament has been obtained for the purpose. (See Phillimore’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Internat.</hi><hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> vol. i., p. 133;
                    Forsyth’s <hi rend="italic">Cases and Opinions on Const. Law,</hi> p. 181.)</p>
                <p>Our law, save with the special exceptions mentioned afterwards, admits to the
                    privileges of subjects all who are born within the British dominions. In the
                    celebrated question of the <hi rend="italic">post-nati</hi> in the reign of
                    James I. of England, it was found, after solemn trial, that natives of Scotland
                    born before the union of the crowns were aliens in England, but that those born
                    subsequently enjoyed the privileges of English subjects. A child born abroad,
                    whose father or whose grandfather on the father’s side was a British subject,
                    may claim the same privilege, unless at the time of his birth his father was a
                    traitor or felon, or engaged in war against the British empire (4th Geo. II. c.
                    22). Owing to this exceptional provision, some sons of Jacobite refugees, born
                    abroad, who joined in the rebellion of 1745, were admitted to the privilege of
                    prisoners of war, because, as the conduct of their fathers deprived them of the
                    privileges of citizenship, they were held not to be liable to its burdens.</p>
                <p>It has been enacted with regard to the national status of women and children that
                    a married woman is held to be a citizen of the state of which her husband is for
                    the time being a subject; that a natural-born British woman, having become an
                    alien by marriage, and thereafter being a widow, may be rehabilitated by
                    certificate of the Secretary of State; that where a father or a widow becomes an
                    alien, the children in infancy becoming resident in the country where the parent
                    is naturalised, and being naturalised by the local law, are held to be subjects
                    of that country; that those of a father or of a widow readmitted to British
                    nationality become British subjects also; and that the children of a father or
                    of a widow who obtains a certificate of naturalisation, becoming resident with
                    such parent in the United Kingdom, become naturalised (33 and 34 Vict. c. 14, s.
                    10). The same statute provides that a declaration of alienage before a justice
                    of peace or other competent judge, having the effect of divesting the declarant
                    of ths character of a British subject, may be made by a naturalised British
                    subject desiring to resume the nationality of the country to which he originally
                    belonged, if there be a convention to that effect with that country; by
                    natural-born subjects who were also born subjects of another state according to
                    its law; or by persons born abroad having British fathers.</p>
                <p>The main characteristic disabilities to which aliens have been subjected are
                    incompetency to exercise political privileges, such as that of electing or being
                    elected to sit in Parliament, and incapacity to hold landed property. The
                    privilege of sitting on a jury was also counted among the political rights from
                    which they are excluded; but when a foreigner is on trial, he had in England the
                    privilege of the jury <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >medietate</hi><hi rend="italic">linguoe,</hi> in which half the panel consisted
                    of foreigners, a privilege which was taken away in 1870, and never existed in
                    Scotland. An alien enemy can neither by himself nor assignee sue for the
                    recovery of a debt due to him in this country, unless by the Queen’s special
                    licence. But his right to do so revives when the war is terminated. (See Mr
                    Justice Story’s judgment in <hi rend="italic">Society for Propagation of the
                    Gospel</hi> v <hi rend="italic">.</hi><hi rend="italic">Wheeler,</hi> 2
                    Gallison’s Reports, 127, and Phillimore’s <hi rend="italic">International
                    Law,</hi> iii. 121).</p>
                <p>Many of the special disabilities to which aliens were subject under the
                    Navigation Act and other laws connected with our old restrictive commercial
                    policy, have been removed or neutralised by the free trade measures of later
                    years; but it is still impossible for an alien to be the owner of a British
                    ship. In other respects the tendency has been to communicate some of the rights
                    of citizenship to aliens, and to widen the definition of subjects.</p>
                <p>Most of the acts of Parliament passed with regard to aliens during the last and
                    the present centuries have been repealed by 33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 14—the
                    Naturalisation Act, 1870. It enables aliens to take, acquire, hold, and dispose
                    of real and personal property of every description (except British ships), and
                    to transmit a title to land, in all respects as natural-born British subjects.
                    But the act expressly declares that this relaxation of the law does not qualify
                    aliens for any office or any municipal, parliamentary, or other franchise, or
                    confer any right of a British subject other than those above expressed in regard
                    to property, nor does it affect interests vested in possession or expectancy
                    under dispositions made before the act, or by devolution of law on the death of
                    any one dying before the act.</p>
                <p>The Act 6 &amp; 7 Will. IV. c. 11 has not been repealed by the Act of 1870. It
                    requires masters of vessels to intimate the arrival of all aliens, who are
                    thereby bound to have their names registered and to obtain certificates of
                    registration. It is believed that these conditions have seldom been complied
                    with or enforced.</p>
                <p>It may be remarked that the repealed Act of 1864 (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 66) was the
                    first considerable relaxation of the alien law. It communicated to the children
                    born abroad of a British mother the privilege of acquiring land by purchase or
                    succession. It gave friendly aliens the privilege of holding leases for any time
                    not exceeding twenty-one years. Before this act the rights of citizenship could
                    only be conferred on aliens by statute; and it was enacted at the commencement
                    of the Hanover succession, that no private naturalisation bill should be brought
                    in unless it contained a clause disqualifying the person it applied to from
                    being a privy councillor or a member of Parliament, and from holding any office,
                    civil or military, and from being a freeholder; but this restriction is repealed
                    by the act of 1844. Limited privileges could formerly be given by the
                    sovereign’s letters of denization; but by the act of 1844 an alien intending to
                    reside and settle in Britain was enabled, by application to the Home Secretary,
                    to obtain a certificate giving him all the rights of a natural-born subject,
                    with certain exceptions. Naturalisation, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n613/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0613-0576"/> which is accompanied by political and other
                    rights, privileges, and obligations, may now, under the act of 1870, be obtained
                    by applying to the Home Secretary and producing evidence of having resided for
                    not less than five years in the United Kingdom, or of having been in the service
                    of the crown for not less than five years, and of intention to reside in the
                    United Kingdom or serve under the crown. Such a certificate may be granted by
                    the Secretary of State to one naturalised previously to the passing of the act,
                    or to a British subject as to whose nationality a doubt exists, or to a
                    statutory alien, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> one who has become an alien by
                    declaration in pursuance of the act 1870. The laws of a British colony with
                    regard to naturalisation have effect only within the limits of that colony.
                    Naturalisation is also effected by the operation of the law upon the acts of
                    individuals, as a woman by marriage acquires the nationality of her husband. The
                    naturalisation of a father carries with it that of his children in minority; and
                    Foelix holds that that of a widow has the same effect upon her minor children.

                <p>In the United States an alien desiring to be naturalised must declare on oath his
                    intention to become a citizen of the United States; two years afterwards must
                    declare on oath his intention to support the constitution of the United States
                    and renounce allegiance to every foreign power, including that of which he was
                    before a subject; must prove residence in the United States for five years, and
                    in the state where his application is made for one year, as a good citizen; and
                    must renounce any title of nobility. In France an alien desiring naturalisation
                    must obtain permission to establish his domicile in France; three years after
                    (in special cases one year) he is entitled to apply for naturalisation, which
                    involves the renunciation of any existing allegiance. (See further, <hi
