                    rend="italic">Furioso</hi> is among metrical romances—not the oldest of its
                    kind, but the best.” We, of course, in England would place the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Morte</hi><hi rend="italic">d' Arthur</hi> above all romances of the kind; and
                    the praise that we allow to <hi rend="italic">Amadis of Gaul</hi> is precisely
                    that which Cervantes bestows upon it—of being the earliest and best of the
                    Spanish romances. When the licentiate and the barber burnt the library of Don
                    Quixote, they spared from the flames only three romances— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amadis of Gaul, Palmerin of England,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tirante</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">the White.</hi> “I have heard,” said the licentiate, " that <hi
                    rend="italic">Amadis of Gaul</hi> was the first book of chivalry printed in
                    Spain, and that all the rest sprung from it; I think, therefore, as head of so
                    pernicious a sect, we ought to condemn him to the fire without mercy.” “Not so,
                    sir,” said the barber, “for I have heard also that it is the best of all the
                    books of this kind; and therefore— as being unequalled in its way—it ought to be
                    spared.” “You are right,” said the priest, “and for that reason its life is
                    granted.” Although Cervantes speaks of the romance as a Spanish one, and
                    although Southey translated it from the oldest extant edition, which is also
                    Spanish, it is currently supposed to have been originally written in Portuguese
                    by Vasco Lobeira, himself a good knight, who received his spurs on the field of
                    battle from King Joam, and who died in 1403. The work, however, has been claimed
                    as of French origin by the Comte de Tressan. Southey ridicules this theory, and
                    insists upon the claims of the Portuguese author. It is quite certain that the
                    Comte de Tressan attempted to prove too much; but, on the other hand, Southey
                    has not allowed weight enough to the fact that the <hi rend="italic">Amadis of
                    Gaul</hi> is but the first work of romance which appeared in the Portuguese and
                    Castilian languages; that it was preceded for more than a century by other
                    romances of Anglo-Norman origin; and that, if not in its names and personages,
                    yet in its idea—in the character of its incidents and in much of its
                    geography—it belongs to the world of Anglo-Norman romance. What though we cannot
                    lay our hands on the French original from which Lobeira translated, any more
                    than we can lay our hands on Lobeira’s own work from which the Castilian version
                    has been made, we still know that all the ideas and materials, all the design,
                    all the machinery of <hi rend="italic">Amadis of Gaul,</hi> belong to the
                    Anglo-Norman cycle of romance which was in vogue before Lobeira was born. And in
                    this creed we cheat him of nothing when we say that we know not to what extent
                    he is entitled to the praise of originality. Knowing what we do of these
                    romances, it is not enough to say, for the establishment of Lobeira’s claims,
                    that we cannot trace the <hi rend="italic">Amadis of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >G</hi><hi rend="italic">aul</hi> to any one before him. Expressions of his own
                    throughout his work show that if he was not a literal translator, he was at
                    least a borrower. Thus, towards the end of his third chapter he writes—“The
                    author ceaseth to speak of this, and returneth to the child whom Gandales
                    brought up.” The Spanish translator, Montalus, confesses to have taken liberties
                    with the Portuguese version from which he worked, altering, adding, and
                    abridging. The Comte de Tressan maintains that the original French work must
                    have ended with the third book and the rescue of Oriana; and that from this
                    point we can distinctly trace the work of Spanish hands. Southey, again, thinks
                    that the work, as it left the hands of Lobeira, ended in the fourth book with
                    the marriage of Amadis and Oriana, and that all which follows is due to the
                    tasteless accretions of Montalus. Although this is mere conjecture, still it is
                    natural that we should attach no little force to the correct feeling of Southey.
                    For the story itself, it is impossible to give a summary of it—the plot being
                    too disconnected; but he who has read one such tale, or even a few chapters of
                    one, may have a general impression of all— hacking and hewing in every page,
                    knights always at war and seeking adventures, giants in the path, lions in the
                    forest, damsels in durance, castles to be attacked, wizards and witches with
                    hate in their hearts, kings everywhere plentiful as blackberries, and lovely
                    ladies abounding in tenderness. The sentiment of the work is very noble, and
                    some of the descriptions are full of fire; but the reader owes more than he is
                    aware to the curtailments of Southey.</p>
