                    Scriptures, and in one of the books of the Apocrypha. In every case the
                    identification of the person thus named with those found in profane history is
                    matter of controversy. The hypothesis of Fürst and others, that in all the
                    passages one and the same person is meant, viz., the well-known Xerxes, may be
                    set aside as quite inapplicable to the facts; and it becomes necessary to glance
                    at the particular places.</p>
                <p>In Dan. ix. 1, Ahasuerus appears as the father of Darius the Mede, who “was made
                    king over the realm of the Chaldeans" after the conquest of Babylon and death of
                    Belshazzar. Who this Darius was is one of the most difficult and disputed
                    questions of ancient history. If, as is very generally supposed, he is Astyages,
                    the grandfather of the great Cyrus, and the last independent king of Media, then
                    Ahasuerus is to be identified with Cyaxares, the father of Astyages. The passage
                    in Tobit where the name occurs (xiv. 15) lends confirmation to this view. It is
                    there stated that Nineveh was captured and destroyed by “Nabuchodonosor and
                    Assuerus.” According to Herodotus (i. 106 <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Rawlinson’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Her.,</hi> vol. i. 412), it was the Medes under Cyaxares who
                    took Nineveh.</p>
                <p>In Ezra iv. 6 Ahasuerus is mentioned as a king of Persia, to whom the enemies of
                    the Jews sent representations opposing the rebuilding of the temple at
                    Jerusalem. Here the sequence of the reigns in the sacred writer and in the
                    profane historians—in the one, Cyrus, Ahasuerus, Artaxerxes, Darius; in the
                    other, Cyrus, Cambyses, Smerdis, Darius—leads naturally to the identification of
                    Ahasuerus with Cambyses. Other circumstances, especially the known policy of the
                    usurper Smerdis, and its reversal by Darius (see Inscr. of Behistun, coh i. §
                    14), corroborate this conclusion.</p>
                <p>In the Book of Esther, Ahasuerus is the name borne by that king of Persia,
                    certain events of whose court and empire (which will be noticed elsewhere, see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Esther)</hi> form the subject of the whole narrative.
                    (Throughout this book the LXX. render the name by 'Aρταξ-έρξης.) The hypothesis
                    of certain writers, that this Ahasuerus is the Cyaxares, king of Media, already
                    referred to, may be at once dismissed. That of others, identifying him with
                    Artaxerxes Longimanus, the son and successor of Xerxes, though countenanced by
                    Josephus, deserves scarcely more consideration. Recent inquirers are all but
                    universally of opinion that he must be a monarch of the Achaemenian dynasty,
                    earlier than this Artaxerxes; and opinion is divided between Darius Hystaspis
                    and his son and successor Xerxes. In support of the former view it is alleged,
                    among other things (see Tyrwhitt’s <hi rend="italic">Esther and Ahasuerus,</hi>
                    p. 162), that Darius was the first Persian king of whom it could be said, as in
                    Esther i. 1, that he “reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and
                    seven and twenty provinces and that it was also the distinction of Darius that
                    (Esther x. 1) he “laid a tribute upon the land and upon the isles of the sea”
                    (<hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. Herod. iii. 89). In support of the latter view it is
                    alleged—(1.) That the Hebrew <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n457/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0457-0422"/><hi rend="italic">Ahashverosh</hi> is the natural
                    equivalent of the old Persian <hi rend="italic">Khshayarsha,</hi> the true name
                    of the monarch called by the Greeks Xerxes, as now read in his inscriptions;
                    (2.) That there is a striking similarity of character between the Xerxes of
                    Herodotus and the Ahasuerus of Esther; (3.) That certain coincidences in dates
                    and events corroborate this identity, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> “In the
                    third year of his reign Ahasuerus gave a grand feast to his nobles, lasting one
                    hundred and eighty days (Esther i. 3); and Xerxes in <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
                    third year also assembled his chief officers to deliberate on the invasion of
                    Greece (Herod. vii. 8). Again, Ahasuerus married Esther at Shushan in the
                    seventh year of his reign; in the same year of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> reign
                    Xerxes returned to Susa with the mortification of his defeat, and sought to
                    forget himself in pleasure. Lastly, the tribute imposed on the land and isles of
                    the sea also accords with the state of his revenue, exhausted by his insane
                    attempt against Greece” (Kitto’s <hi rend="italic">Cyclopοedia, s.v.</hi>
                    Ahasuerus). To this it may be added that the interval of four years between the
                    divorce of Vashti and the marriage of Esther is well accounted for by the
                    intervention of an important series of events fully occupying the monarch’s
                    thoughts, such as the invasion of Greece. It may be added that by the advocates
                    of both views appeal is made, with more or less of confidence, to the names of
                    the queens of the respective sovereigns; Atossa, wife of Darius, answering to
                    Hadassah, and Amestris, wife of Xerxes, to Esther (Esther ii. 7); and also to
                    the number of generations. indicated in the genealogy of Mordecai from the
                    deportation of the Jews into Babylon (Esther ii. 5; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi>
                    Tyrwhitt, p. 95, with Rawlinson, <hi rend="italic">Bampton Lect.,</hi> p. 186).
                    If, as seems probable, the name Ahasuerus is the transcription of the Persian
                    <hi rend="italic">Khshayarsha</hi> (written <hi rend="italic">Hisiarsa</hi> in
                    Babylonian) which, according to Sir H. Rawlinson, means “venerable king” (see
                    Rawlinson’s <hi rend="italic">Her.</hi> iii. 363), then this name may be
                    reasonably supposed to have been originally an appellative, and its application,
                    especially by foreigners like the Jews, to different royal persons, is
                    explained.</p>
