                <p><label type="entry">ALDERNEY</label>, one of the Channel Islands, and the most
                    northerly of the four, lies between 49° 41' and 49° 45' N. lat., and 2° 9' and
                    2° 14' W. long., 7 miles to the westward of Cape la Hogue, and is separated from
                    the French coast by a narrow channel called the Race of Alderney. The passage
                    through this strait is rendered very dangerous in stormy weather by its
                    conflicting currents; but through it the scattered remnant of the French fleet
                    under Tourville succeeded in escaping after the defeat of La Hogue in 1692. The
                    harbour of Alderney is 20 miles distant from St Peter Port, Guernsey, 45 miles
                    from St Helen’s, Jersey, and 60 miles from Portland Bill, the nearest point of
                    England. There is regular steam communication with Guernsey. The length of the
                    island from N.E. to S.W. is 3½ miles; its width about 1 mile; its greatest
                    elevation is 280 feet; and the area is about 4 square miles.</p>
                <p>The greater part of Alderney is a level table-land, more or less cultivated. The
                    land continues flat to the edge of the south-eastern and southern cliffs, which
                    present a magnificent succession of broken and perpendicular walls of rock.
                    Towards the north-west, north, and east, the coast is less rocky, and is
                    indented by several bays of tame and naked aspect, of which those of Crabby,
                    Braye, and Longy are the most noticeable. Sandstone, granite, and porphyry are
                    the chief geological formations. From the importance of the island in a military
                    sense, it has been fortified by a chain of defensive works, extending round the
                    northern coast from the Clanque Fort on the west to Fort Essex on the east. The
                    cliffs of the southern shore form a very strong natural bulwark. An extensive
                    granite breakwater has been constructed, protecting the bay of Braye towards the
                    west, intended to form an additional defence, and to convert the bay into a
                    secure harbour of refuge. The works have cost upwards of a million and a quarter
                    sterling; but the new harbour is not much resorted to, and the value of the
                    breakwater as a means of defence has been questioned. Fort Touraille stands on
                    the eastern side of the new harbour, and is a strong fortification, mounting 50
                    heavy guns, with bomb-proof barracks and powder magazine.</p>
                <p>The population of Alderney has increased rapidly of recent years, on account of
                    the extensive public works. In 1841 it was only 1030, in 1871 it was 2738. The
                    inhabitants are Protestants, and Alderney forms part of the diocese of
                    Winchester. Though a French <hi rend="italic">patois</hi> lingers in the island,
                    English is generally spoken and universally understood. The climate is healthy,
                    and there is abundance of good water. Corn is grown, but much of the sandy soil
                    is in grass, affording excellent pasture to the diminutive but pretty cows for
                    which Alderney is famous. The only exports are cattle and early potatoes. St
                    Anne’s, the town of the island, is situated at some distance from the beach,
                    overlooking the new harbour. It is plainly built, but has a fine new church in
                    the early English style, erected as a memorial of the family of Le Mesurier,
                    long the hereditary governors of the island. The only other architectural
                    feature worthy of notice is a Gothic arch built as a memorial of the late Prince
                    Albert of England.</p>
                <p>Alderney seems to have been known to the Romans as <hi rend="italic">Riduna,</hi>
                    and Roman as well as Celtic remains have been discovered. It is subject to the
                    British crown, and is a dependency of Guernsey. For its history and relation to
                    English legislation, see the article on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Channel
                    Islands.</hi> The internal government is vested in a judge appointed by the
                    crown, and six <hi rend="italic">jurats,</hi> chosen for life by the people; and
                    these, with twelve <hi rend="italic">douzainiers,</hi> who are popular
                    representatives, but have not the power of voting, form the legislature. Justice
                    is administered by the same judge <hi rend="italic">jurats,</hi> and several
                    other officers. In civil cases an appeal may be taken to the royal court of
                    Guernsey, while all criminal cases are referred to Guernsey for decision. Two
                    companies of infantry and a battery of artillery compose the local militia.</p>
                <p>Off the western coast of Alderney there are many uninhabited rocky islands; and
                    six miles to the westward lie <pb break="no"

                    dangerous to ships coming up the English Channel. On these rocks there are three
                    lighthouses, with revolving lights 112 feet above the water.</p>
