                    Breton house. The name <hi rend="italic">Abaelardus</hi> (also written <hi
                    rend="italic">Abailardus, Abaielardus,</hi> and in many other ways) is said to
                    be a corruption of <hi rend="italic">Habelardus,</hi> substituted by himself for
                    a nickname <hi rend="italic">Bajolardus</hi> given to him when a student. As a
                    boy, he showed an extraordinary quickness of apprehension, and, choosing a
                    learned life instead of the active career natural to a youth of his birth, early
                    became an adept in the art of dialectic, under which name philosophy, meaning at
                    that time chiefly the logic of Aristotle transmitted through Latin channels, was
                    the great subject of liberal study in the episcopal schools. Roscellin, the
                    famous canon of Compiègne, is mentioned by himself as his teacher; but whether
                    he heard this champion of extreme Nominalism in early youth, when he wandered
                    about from school to school for instruction and exercise, or some years later,
                    after he had already begun to teach for himself, remains uncertain. His
                    wanderings finally brought him to Paris, still under the age of twenty. There,
                    in the great cathedral school of Notre-Dame, he sat for a while under the
                    teaching of William of Champeaux, the disciple of St Anselm and most advanced of
                    Realists, but, presently stepping forward, he overcame the master in discussion,
                    and thus began a long duel that issued in the downfall of the philosophic theory
                    of Realism, till then dominant in the early Middle Age. First, in the teeth of
                    opposition from the metropolitan teacher, he proceeded to set up a school of his
                    own at Melun, whence, for more direct competition, he removed to Corbeil, nearer
                    Paris. The success of his teaching was signal, though for a time he had to quit
                    the field, the strain proving too great for his physical strength. On his
                    return, after 1108, he found William lecturing no longer at Notre-Dame, but in a
                    monastic retreat outside the city, and there battle was again joined between
                    them. Forcing upon the Realist a material change of doctrine, he was once more
                    victorious, and thenceforth he stood supreme. His discomfited rival still had
                    power to keep him from lecturing in Paris, but soon failed in this last effort
                    also. From Melun, where he had resumed teaching, Abelard passed to the capital,
                    and set up his school on the heights of St Geneviève, looking over Notre-Dame.
                    When he had increased his distinction still further by winning reputation in the
                    theological school of Anselm of Laon, no other conquest remained for him. He
                    stepped into the chair at Notre-Dame, being also nominated canon, about the year
                    1115.</p>
                <p>Few teachers ever held such sway as Abelard now did for a time. Distinguished in
                    figure and manners, he was seen surrounded by crowds—it is said thousands—of
                    students, drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching, in which
                    acuteness of thought was relieved by simplicity and grace of exposition.
                    Enriched by the offerings of his pupils, and feasted with universal admiration,
                    he came, as he says, to think himself the only philosopher standing in the
                    world. But a change in his fortunes was at hand. In his devotion to science, he
                    had hitherto lived a very regular life, varied only by the excitement of
                    conflict: now, at the height of his fame, other passions began to stir within
                    him. There lived at that time, within the precincts of Notre-Dame, under the
                    care of her uncle, the canon Fulbert, a young girl named Heloise, of noble
                    extraction and born about 1101. Fair, but still more remarkable for her
                    knowledge, which extended beyond Latin, it is said, to Greek and Hebrew, she
                    awoke a feeling of love in the breast of Abelard; and with intent to win her, he
                    sought and gained a footing in Fulbert’s house as a regular inmate. Becoming
                    also tutor to the maiden, he used the unlimited power which he thus obtained
                    over her for the purpose of seduction, though not without cherishing a real
                    affection which she returned in unparalleled devotion. Their relation
                    interfering with his public work, and being, moreover, ostentatiously sung by
                    himself, soon became known to all the world except the too-confiding Fulbert;
                    and, when at last it could not escape even his vision, they were separated only
                    to meet in secret. Thereupon Heloise found herself pregnant, and was carried off
                    by her lover to Brittany, where she gave birth to a son. To appease her furious
                    uncle, Abelard now proposed a marriage, under the condition that it should be
                    kept secret, in order not to mar his prospects of advancement in the church; but
                    of marriage, whether public or secret, Heloise would hear nothing. She appealed
                    to him not to sacrifice for her the independence of his life, nor did she
                    finally yield to the arrangement without the darkest forebodings, only too soon
                    to be realised. The secret of the marriage was not kept by Fulbert; and when
                    Heloise, true to her singular purpose, boldly then denied it, life was made so
                    unsupportable to her that she sought refuge in the convent of Argenteuil.
                    Immediately Fulbert, believing that her husband, who aided in the flight,
                    designed to be rid of her, conceived a dire revenge. He and some others broke
                    into Abelard’s chamber by night, and, taking him defenceless, perpetrated on him
                    the most brutal mutilation. Thus cast down from his pinnacle of greatness into
                    an abyss of shame and misery, there was left to the brilliant master only the
                    life of a monk. Heloise, not yet twenty, consummated her work of self-sacrifice
                    at the call of his jealous love, and took the veil.</p>
                <p>It was in the Abbey of St Denis that Abelard, now aged forty, sought to bury
                    himself with his woes out of sight. Finding, however, in the cloister neither
                    calm nor solitude, and having gradually turned again to study, he yielded after
                    a year to urgent entreaties from without and. within, and went forth to reopen
                    his school at the Priory of Maisoncelle (1120). His lectures, now framed in a
                    devotional spirit, were heard again by crowds of students, and all his old
                    influence seemed to have returned; but old enmities were revived also, against
                    which he was no longer able as before to make head. No sooner had he put in
                    writing his theological lectures (apparently the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introductio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologiam</hi> that
                    has come down to us), than his adversaries fell foul of his rationalistic
                    interpretation of the Trinitarian dogma. Charging him with the heresy of
                    Sabellius in a provincial synod held at Soissons in 1121, they procured by
                    irregular practices a condemnation of his teaching, whereby he was made to throw
                    his book into the flames, and then was shut up in the convent of St Médard.
                    After the other, it was the bitterest possible experience that could befall him,
                    nor, in the state of mental desolation into which it plunged him, could he find
                    any comfort from being soon again set free. The life in his own monastery
                    proving no more congenial than formerly, he fled from it in secret, and only
                    waited for permission to live away from St Denis before he chose the one lot
                    that suited his present mood. In a desert place near Nogent-sur-Seine, he built
                    himself a cabin of stubble and reeds, and turned hermit. But there fortune came
                    back to him with a new surprise. His retreat becoming known, students flocked
                    from Paris, and covered the wilderness around him with their tents and huts.
                    When he began to teach again, he found consolation, and in gratitude he
                    consecrated the new oratory they built for him by the name of the Paraclete <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n50/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0050-0035"/> Upon the return of new dangers, or at least of
                    fears, Abelard left the Paraclete to make trial of another refuge, accepting an
                    invitation to preside over the Abbey of St Gildas-de-Rhuys, on the far-off shore
                    of Lower Brittany. It proved a wretched exchange. The region was inhospitable,
                    the domain a prey to lawless exaction, the house itself savage and disorderly.
                    Yet for nearly ten years he continued to struggle with fate before he fled from
                    his charge, yielding in the end only under peril of violent death. The misery of
                    those years was not, however, unrelieved; for he had been able, on the
                    breaking-up of Heloise’s convent at Argenteuil, to establish her as head of a
                    new religious house at the deserted Paraclete, and in the capacity of spiritual
                    director he often was called to revisit the spot thus made doubly dear to him.
                    All this time Heloise had lived amid universal esteem for her knowledge and
                    character, uttering no word under the doom that had fallen upon her youth; but
                    now, at last, the occasion came for expressing all the pent-up emotions of her
                    soul. Living on for some time in Brittany after his flight from St Gildas,
                    Abelard wrote, among other things, his famous <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Calamitatum,</hi> and thus moved her to pen her first <hi
                    rend="italic">Letter,</hi> which remains an unsurpassed utterance of human
                    passion and womanly devotion; the first being followed by the two other <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters,</hi> in which she finally accepted the part of
                    resignation which, now as a brother to a sister, Abelard commended to her. He
                    not long after was seen once more upon the field of his early triumphs,
                    lecturing on Mount St Geneviève in 1136 (when he was heard by John of
                    Salisbury), but it was only for a brief space: no new triumph, but a last great
                    trial, awaited him in the few years to come of his chequered life. As far back
                    as the Paraclete days, he had counted as chief among his foes Bernard of
                    Clairvaux, in whom was incarnated the principle of fervent and unhesitating
                    faith, from which rational inquiry like his was sheer revolt, and now this
                    uncompromising spirit was moving, at the instance of others, to crush the
                    growing evil in the person of the boldest offender. After preliminary
                    negotiations, in which Bernard was roused by Abelard’s steadfastness to put
                    forth all his strength, a council met at Sens, before which Abelard, formally
                    arraigned upon a number of heretical charges, was prepared to plead his cause.
                    When, however, Bernard, not without foregone terror in the prospect of meeting
                    the redoubtable dialectician, had opened the case, suddenly Abelard appealed to
                    Rome. The stroke availed him nothing; for Bernard, who had power,
                    notwithstanding, to get a condemnation passed at the council, did not rest a
                    moment till a second condemnation was procured at Rome in the following year.
                    Meanwhile, on his way thither to urge his plea in person, Abelard had broken
                    down at the Abbey of Cluni, and there, an utterly fallen man, with spirit of the
                    humblest, and only not bereft of his intellectual force, he lingered but a few
                    months before the approach of death. Removed by friendly hands, for the relief
                    of his sufferings, to the Priory of St Marcel, he died on the 21st of April
                    1142. First buried at St Marcel, his remains soon after were carried off in
                    secrecy to the Paraclete, and given over to the loving care of Heloise, who in
                    time came herself to rest beside them. The bones of the pair were shifted more
                    than once afterwards, but they were marvellously preserved even through the
                    vicissitudes of the French Revolution, and now they lie united in the well-known
                    tomb at Père-Lachaise.</p>
                <p>Great as was the influence exerted by Abelard on the minds of his contemporaries
                    and the course of mediaeval thought, he has been little known in modern times
                    but for his connection with Heloise. Indeed, it was not till the present
                    century, when Cousin in 1836 issued the collection entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ouvrages inédits d’Abélard,</hi> that his philosophical performance could be
                    judged at first hand: of his strictly philosophical works only one, the ethical
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">Scito</hi><hi rend="italic">te ipsum,</hi> having
                    been published earlier, namely, in 1721. Cousin’s collection, besides giving
                    extracts from the theological work <hi rend="italic">Sic et Non</hi> (an
                    assemblage of opposite opinions on doctrinal points, culled from the Fathers as
                    a basis for discussion), includes the <hi rend="italic">Dialectica,</hi>
                    commentaries on logical works of Aristotle, Porphyry, and Boethius, and a
                    fragment, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Generibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et Speciebus.</hi> The last-named work, and also the psychological
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De Intellectibus,</hi> published apart by Cousin (in
                    <hi rend="italic">Fragmens</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophiques,</hi> vol. ii.),
                    are now considered upon internal evidence not to be by Abelard himself, but only
                    to have sprung out of his school. A genuine work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glossuloe</hi><hi rend="italic">super Porphyrium,</hi> from which Μ. de
                    Rémusat, in his classical monograph <hi rend="italic">Abélard</hi> (1845), has
                    given extracts, remains in manuscript.</p>
                <p>The general importance of Abelard lies in his having fixed more decisively than
                    any one before him the scholastic manner of philosophising, with its object of
                    giving a formally rational expression to the received ecclesiastical doctrine.
                    However his own particular interpretations may have been condemned, they were
                    conceived in essentially the same spirit as the general scheme of thought
                    afterwards elaborated in the 13th century with approval from the heads of the
                    church. Through him was prepared in the Middle Age the ascendency of the
                    philosophical authority of Aristotle, which became firmly established in the
                    half-century after his death, when first the completed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Organon,</hi> and gradually all the other works of the Greek thinker, came to
                    be known in the schools: before his time it was rather upon the authority of
                    Plato that the prevailing Realism sought to lean. As regards the central
                    question of Universals, without having sufficient knowledge of Aristotle’s
                    views, Abelard yet, in taking middle ground between the extravagant Realism of
                    his master, William of Champeaux, or of St Anselm, and the not less extravagant
                    Nominalism (as we have it reported) of his other master, Roscellin, touched at
                    more than one point the Aristotelian position. Along with Aristotle, also with
                    Nominalists generally, he ascribed full reality only to the particular
                    concretes; while, in opposition to the “<hi rend="italic">insana
                    sententia</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi> of Roscellin, he declared the Universal
                    to be no mere word <hi rend="italic">(vox),</hi> but to consist, or (perhaps we
                    may say) emerge, in the fact of predication <hi rend="italic">(sermo).</hi>
                    Lying in the middle between Realism and (extreme) Nominalism, this doctrine has
                    often been spoken of as Conceptualism, but ignorantly so. Abelard, preeminently
                    a logician, did not concern himself with the psychological question which the
                    Conceptualist aims at deciding as to the mental subsistence of the Universal.
                    Outside of his dialectic, it was in ethics that Abelard showed greatest activity
                    of philosophical thought; laying very particular stress upon the subjective
                    intention as determining, if not the moral character, at least the moral value,
                    of human action. His thought in this direction, wherein he anticipated something
                    of modern speculation, is the more remarkable because his scholastic successors
                    accomplished least in the field of morals, hardly venturing to bring the
                    principles and rules of conduct under pure philosophical discussion, even after
                    the great ethical inquries of Aristotle became fully known to them. <hi
