                    sect, was the son of a lamplighter in the great mosque at Sous-el-Aksa. He
                    studied at Cordova, and afterwards visited Cairo and Baghdad, where he became
                    the disciple of the famous philosopher Algazali. In order to establish his power
                    with his countrymen, he connected himself with Abd-el-Mumen, a young Mussulman
                    of great abilities, whom he sent forth as his apostle to propagate the new
                    doctrine (1116-17); while in his own person he affected an unusual degree of
                    piety and mortification, appearing in tattered garments, and interdicting the
                    use of wine and music and every gratification of the senses. His fame spread
                    rapidly among the mountain tribes of Mahgreb, and the ignorant multitude adopted
                    his opinions with eager zeal. His followers saluted him as the Al-Mehedi on the
                    28th November 1121. Entering the city of Marocco, this new prophet foretold the
                    downfall of the existing dynasty, and mocked the authority of the reigning
                    prince Ali-Ibn-Yussef. Ali, lulled in security, despised his predictions as the
                    mere ravings of a fanatic; and it was not without some difficulty that he was at
                    length prevailed on to banish him from the city. Mohammed retired to the
                    mountains, and fortified the town of Tinmal, which he defended against every
                    assault of his enemies (1123). His retreat became the rendezvous of a numerous
                    sect, who assumed the title of Almoahedi, or Almohades, and asserted that they
                    alone of all the Mussulmans maintained the religion of Islam in its original
                    purity. Many Arab and Berber tribes acknowledged him as their political chief,
                    and 20,000 soldiers rallied around his standard. Ali only perceived the error he
                    had committed when it was too late: his armies, at each encounter, were
                    panic-struck, and fled. Yet notwithstanding the great success of the Almohades,
                    the vast empire of the Almoravides was not at once subdued: and Mohammed, after
                    an ineffectual attempt to reduce the city of Marocco, died in the year 1130,
                    having failed to accomplish the object of his ambition, the possession of a
                    throne. He was succeeded by Abd-el-Mumen, who assumed the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Emir-el-Mumenin,</hi> or Commander of the Faithful. During the
                    thirty years that he reigned, and under his descendants, Yussef and Yakub,
                    called Almanzor-Billah, the dynasty of the Almohades was exceedingly
                    illustrious, and the arts flourished greatly. They rendered themselves masters

                    Tunis; and passing into Spain, they overran Andalusia, Valencia, and a part of
                    Aragon and Portugal, as far the Ebro on one side and the Tagus on the other. But
                    this vast empire was not of long continuance; for in the year 1212, when the
                    Moslems under Mohammed were defeated by the Christian princes of Spain in the
                    great battle of Las Navas, near Tolosa, the governors of the several provinces
                    took advantage of that disaster to throw off their allegiance, and declared
                    themselves independent—an example that was the signal for a general revolt. The
                    dynasty of the Almohades became extinct in Spain in the year 1257, and in Africa
                    in 1269. The last sovereign of this race, Abu Dabus Edris, who had with
                    difficulty maintained a shadow of power in the city of Marocco, was assassinated
                    by a slave. They were succeeded by the dynasties of the Hassides, the Mevanides,
                    and the Merinides. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Almoravides.</hi></p>
