                    species of poetical composition, so constructed that the initial letters of the
                    lines, taken consecutively, form certain names or other particular words. This
                    fancy is of considerable antiquity, one of the most remarkable examples of it
                    being the verses cited by Lactantius and Eusebius in the 4th century, and
                    attributed to the Erythraean sibyl, the initial letters of which form the words
                    <hi rend="italic">’Ιησούς</hi> Χ <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ι</hi><hi rend="italic">στ</hi><hi rend="italic">ό</hi><hi rend="italic">ς</hi>
                    Θεov υ <hi rend="italic">ί</hi><hi rend="italic">ός</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >σωτήρ:</hi> “Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Saviour,” with the addition,
                    according to some, of <hi rend="italic">σταυρός,</hi> “the cross.” The initials
                    of the shorter form of this again make up the word ί <hi rend="italic"
                    >χθυς,</hi> to which a mystical meaning has been attached (Augustine, <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Civitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei,</hi>
                    18, 23), thus constituting another kind of acrostic. The arguments of the
                    comedies of Plautus, with acrostics on the names of the respective plays, are
                    probably of still earlier date. Sir John Davies (1570- 1626) wrote twenty-six
                    elegant <hi rend="italic">Hymns to</hi><hi rend="italic">Astroea,</hi> each an
                    acrostic on “Elizabetha Regina;” and Mistress Mary Fage, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fame's</hi><hi rend="italic">Roule,</hi> 1637, commemorated 420 celebrities of
                    her time in acrostic verses. The same form of composition is often to be met
                    with in the writings of more recent versifiers. Sometimes the lines are so
                    combined that the final letters as well as the initials are significant. Edgar
                    Allan Poe, with characteristic ingenuity, worked two names—one of them that of
                    Frances Sargent Osgood—into verses in such a way that the letters of the names
                    corresponded to the first letter of the first line, the second letter of the
                    second, the third letter of the third, and so on.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, acrostic verse is not of much value, and is held in slight
                    estimation. Dr Samuel Butler says, in his “Character of a Small Poet,” “He uses
                    to lay the outsides of his verses even, like a bricklayer, by a line of rhyme
                    and acrostic, and fill the middle with rubbish.” Addison <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Spectator,</hi> No. 60) found it impossible to decide whether the inventor of
                    the anagram or the acrostic were the greater blockhead; and, in describing the
                    latter, says, “I have seen some of them where the verses have not only been
                    edged by a name at each extremity, but have had the same name running down like
                    a seam through the middle of the poem.” And Dryden, in <hi rend="italic">Mac
                    Flecknoe,</hi> scornfully assigned Shadwell the rule of</p>
                <l part="N"> “Some peaceful province in acrostic land.” </l>
                <p>The name acrostic is also applied to alphabetical or “abecedarian” verses. Of
                    these we have instances in some of the Hebrew psalms <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> Ps. xxv. and xxxiv.), the successive verses of which begin with the
                    letters of the alphabet in their order. The structure of Ps. cxix. is still more
                    elaborate, each of the verses of each of the twenty-two parts commencing with
                    the letter which stands at the head of the part in our English translation.
                    Alphabetical verses have been constructed with every word of the successive
                    lines beginning with the successive letters of the alphabet.</p>
                <p>By an extended use of the term acrostic, it is applied to the formation of words
                    from the initial letters of other words. 'Ιχ0ύς, referred to above, is an
                    illustration of this. So also is the word “Cabal,” which, though it was in use
                    before, with a similar meaning, has, from the time of Charles II., been
                    associated with a particular ministry, from the accident of its being composed
                    of Clifford, Ashley, Buckingham, Arlington, and Lauderdale. Akin to this are the
                    names by which the Jews designated their Rabbis; thus Rabbi Moses ben Maimon
                    (better known as Maimonides), was styled “Rambam,” from the initials R. Μ. B.
                    Μ.; Rabbi David Kimchi (R. D. K.), “Radak,” &amp;c.</p>
                <p>A species of puzzle, scarcely known twenty years ago, but very common now (see
                    <hi rend="italic">English Catalogue,</hi> 1863-71, <hi rend="italic">s. v.</hi>
                    Acrostics), is a combination of enigma and double acrostic, in which words are
                    to be guessed whose initial and final letters form other words that are also to
                    be guessed. Thus Sleep and Dream may have to be discovered from the first and
                    last letters of Sound, Lover, Europe, Elia, and Palm, all expressed
                    enigmatically.</p>
