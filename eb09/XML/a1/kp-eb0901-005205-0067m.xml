                <p><label type="entry">ABRAHAM or ABRAM</label>, father of the Israelite race, was
                    the first-born son of Terah, a Shemite, who left Ur of the Chaldees, in the
                    north-east of Mesopotamia, along with Abram, Sarai, and Lot, and turned
                    westwards in the direction of Canaan. Abram had married his half-sister Sarai,
                    who was ten years younger than himself; and though such relationship was
                    afterwards forbidden by the law, it was common in ancient times, both among
                    other <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n68/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0068-0053"/> peoples, and among the Hebrews themselves at
                    least before Moses. The cause of Terah’s removing from his native country is not
                    given. Having come to Haran, he abode there till his death, at the age of 205.
                    According to Genesis xii., Abram left Saran when he was 75 years of age, that
                    is, before the death of his father, in consequence of a divine command, to which
                    was annexed a gracious promise, “And I will make of thee a great nation, and I
                    will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing. And I
                    will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee
                    shall all families of the earth be blessed” (xii. 2, 3). Another tradition makes
                    him leave Haran only after Terah’s decease (Acts vii. 4). The later account is
                    that Abram’s departure was the result of religious considerations, because he
                    had already become emancipated from surrounding idolatry. Perhaps the desire of
                    a nomadic life, the love of migration natural to an Oriental, had more to do
                    with his pilgrimage than a spiritual impulse from within; but it is likely that
                    his culture advanced in the course of his sojournings, and that he gradually
                    attained to purer conceptions of duty and life. Traditions subsequent to the
                    Jehovistic represent him as driven forth by the idolatrous Chaldeans (Judith v.
                    6, &amp;c.) on account of his monotheistic doctrines, and then dwelling in
                    Damascus as its king (Josephus’s <hi rend="italic">Antiquities,</hi> i. 7). The
                    true cause of departure may be suggested by Nicolaus of Damascus saying that he
                    came out of Chaldea with an army. The leader of a horde, worsted in some
                    encounter or insurrection, he emigrated at the head of his adherents in quest of
                    better fortunes. The word <hi rend="italic">redeemed,</hi> in Isaiah xxix. 22,
                    out of which Ewald conjectures so much, as if Abram had been rescued from great
                    bodily dangers and battles, does not help the portrait, because it means no more
                    than the patriarch’s migration from heathen Mesopotamia into the Holy Land.
                    Journeying south-west to Canaan with his wife and nephew, he arrived at Sichem,
                    at <hi rend="italic">the oak of the seer</hi> or <hi rend="italic">prophet,</hi>
                    where Jehovah appeared to him, assuring him for the first time that his seed
                    should possess the land he had come to. He travelled thence southward, pitching
                    his tent east of Bethel. Still proceeding in the same direction, he arrived at
                    the Negeb, or most southern district of Palestine, whence a famine forced him
                    down to Egypt. His plea that Sarai was his sister did not save her from Pharaoh;
                    for she was taken into the royal harem, but restored to her husband in
                    consequence of divine chastisments inflicted upon the lawless possessor of her
                    person, leading to the discovery of her true relationship. The king was glad to
                    send the patriarch away under the escort and protection of his men. A similar
                    thing is said to have subsequently happened to Sarai at Gerar with the
                    Philistine king Abimelech (Genesis xx.), as also to Rebekah, Isaac’s wife
                    (xxvi.) The three narratives describe one and the same event in different
                    shapes. But the more original (the junior Elohistic)<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Three documents at least are traceable in the
                    Pentateuch; the Elohistic, the junior Elohistic, and the Jehovistic. These were

                    Deuteronomist.</p></note> is that of the 20th chapter, so that Gerar was the
                    scene, and Abimelech the offender; while the later Jehovistic narrative (xii.)
                    deviates still more from verisimilitude. Though this occurrence, however,
                    belongs to the southern borders of Palestine, we need not doubt the fact of
                    Abram’s sojourn in Egypt, especially as he had an Egyptian slave (Genesis xvi.)
                    How long the patriarch remained there is not related; nor are the influences
                    which the religion, science, and learning of that civilised land had upon him
                    alluded to. That they acted beneficially upon his mind, enlightening and
                    enlarging it, can scarcely be doubted. His religious conceptions were
                    transformed.</p>
                <p>The manifold wisdom of Egypt impressed him. Intercourse with men far advanced in
                    civilisation taught him much. Later tradition speaks of his communicating to the
                    Egyptians the sciences of arithmetic and astronomy (Josephus i. 7); but this is
                    founded upon the notion entertained at the time of the civilised Chaldeans of
                    Babylon, whereas Ur of the Chaldees was a district remote from the subsequent
                    centre of recondite knowledge. Abram received more than he imparted, for the
                    Egyptians were doubtless his superiors in science. He found the rite of
                    circumcision in use. There, too, he acquired great substance—flocks and herds,
                    male and female slaves. After returning to Canaan, to his former locality, Abram
                    and Lot separated, because of disputes between their herdsmen, there not being
                    sufficient room for all their cattle in common. After this separation the
                    possession of Canaan was again assured to Abram and to his seed, who should be
                    exceedingly numerous. This is the third theocratic promise he received. He is
                    also commanded by Jehovah to walk through it in its length and breadth as a
                    token of inheritance,—a later Jehovistic tradition that must be judged according
                    to its inherent verisimilitude. Abram settled again at the oak of Mamre near
                    Hebron. This was his headquarters. After Lot had been taken prisoner in the
                    expedition of the kings of Shinar, Ellasar, Elam, and Goyim, against the old
                    inhabitants of Basan, Ammonitis, Moabitis, Edomitis, and others besides, Abram
                    gave chase to the enemy, accompanied by his 318 slaves and friendly neighbours,
                    rescuing his nephew at Hobah, near Damascus. On his return, the royal priest
                    Melchizedek of Salem came forth to meet him with refreshments, blessed the
                    patriarch, and received from him the tithe of the spoils. The king acted
                    generously towards the victor, and was still more generously treated in
                    return.</p>
                <p>Jehovah again promised to Abram a numerous offspring, with the possession of
                    Canaan. He also concluded a covenant with him in a solemn form, and revealed the
                    fortunes of his posterity in Egypt, with their deliverance from bondage. In
                    consequence of the barrenness of Sarai, she gave her handmaid Hagar to Abram,
                    who, becoming pregnant by him, was haughtily treated by her mistress, and fled
                    towards Egypt. But an angel met her in the desert and sent her back, telling of
                    a numerous race that should spring from her. Having returned, she gave birth to
                    Ishmael, in the 86th year of Abram’s age.</p>
                <p>Again did Jehovah appear to the patriarch, promising as before a multitudinous
                    seed, and changing his name in conformity with such promise. He assured him and
                    his posterity of the possession of Canaan, and concluded a covenant with him for
                    all time. At the institution of circumcision on this occasion, Sarai’s name was
                    also changed, because she was to be the maternal progenitor of the covenant
                    people through Isaac her son. Abram, and all the males belonging to him, were
                    then circumcised. He had become acquainted with the rite in Egypt, and
                    transferred it to his household, making it a badge of distinction between the
                    worshippers of the true God and the idolatrous Canaanites—the symbol of the
                    flesh’s subjection to the spirit. Its introduction into the worship of the
                    colony at Mamre indicated a decided advance in Abram’s religious conceptions. He
                    had got beyond the cruel practice of human sacrifice. The gross worship of the
                    Canaanites was left behind; and the small remnant of it which he retained
                    comported with a faith approaching monotheism. Amid prevailing idolatry this
                    institution was a protection to his family and servants—a magic circle drawn
                    around them. But, though powerful and respected wherever his name was known, he
                    confined the rite to his own domestics, without attempting to force it on the
                    inhabitants of the land where he sojourned. The punishment of death <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n69/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0069-0054"/> for neglecting it, because the uncircumcised
                    person was thought to be a breaker of the covenant and a despiser of its Author,
                    seems a harsh measure on the part of Abram; yet it can hardly be counted an
                    arbitrary transference of the later Levitical severities to the progenitor of .
                    the race, since it is in the Elohist.</p>
                <p>Accompanied by two angels, Jehovah appeared again to Abram at the oak of Mature,
                    accepted his proposed hospitality, and promised him a son by Sarai within a
                    year. Though she laughed incredulously, the promise was definitely repeated.
                    When the angels left, Jehovah communicated to Abram the divine purpose of
                    destroying the dwellers in Siddim because of their wickedness, but acceded to
                    the patriarch’s intercession, that the cities of the plain should be spared if
                    ten righteous men could be found in them. The two angels, who had gone before,
                    arrived at Sodom in the evening, and were entertained by Lot, but threatened
                    with shameful treatment by the depraved inhabitants. Seeing that the vengeance
                    of Heaven was deserved, they proceeded to execute it, saving Lot with his wife
                    and two daughters, and sparing Zoar as a place of refuge for them. Jehovah
                    rained down fire and brimstone from heaven, turning all the Jordan district to
                    desolation, so that when Abram looked next morning from the spot where Jehovah
                    and himself had parted, he saw a thick smoke ascend from the ruins.</p>
                <p>Abram then journeyed from Hebron to the Negeb, settled between Kadesh and Shur in
                    Gerar, where Sarai is said to have been treated as a prior account makes her to
                    have been in Egypt. At the patriarch’s prayer the plague inflicted on the king
                    and his wives was removed. This is a duplicate of the other story. Whatever
                    historical truth the present narrative has belongs to an earlier period of
                    Abram’s life. His second removal to Gerar originated in the former journeying
                    through it into Egypt. He must have remained in the neighbourhood of Hebron, his
                    first settlement, where Isaac was born according to the Elohistic account. After
                    the birth of the legitimate heir, succeeding events were the expulsion of Hagar
                    and Ishmael from the paternal home, and the making of a covenant between
                    Abimelech and Abram at Beersheba. Here Abram “called on the name of the Lord,”
                    and is said to have planted a noted tamarisk in commemoration of the event.</p>
                <p>Abram was now commanded by God to offer up Isaac in the land of Moriah.
                    Proceeding to obey, he was prevented by an angel just as he was about to slay
                    his son, and sacrificed a ram that presented itself at the time. In reward of
                    his obedience he received the promise of a numerous seed and abundant
                    prosperity. Thence he returned to Beersheba.</p>
                <p>Sarai died and was buried in the cave of Machpelah near Hebron, which Abram
                    purchased, with the adjoining field, from Ephron the Hittite. The measures taken
                    by the patriarch for the marriage of Isaac are circumstantially described. His
                    steward Eliezer was sent to the country and kindred of Abram to find a suitable
                    bride, which he did in Haran, whither he was divinely conducted. Rebekah
                    appeared as the intended one; she parted from Bethuel and her family with their
                    full approbation, was brought to Isaac, and became a maternal ancestor of the
                    chosen , people.</p>
                <p>It is curious that, after Sarah’s death, Abram should have contracted a second
                    marriage with Keturah, and begotten six sons. The Chronicles, however, make her
                    his concubine (1 Chron. i. 32), so that these children may have been born
                    earlier. Probably the narrative intends to account for the diffusion of Abram’s
                    posterity in Arabia. Keturah’s sons were sent away with gifts from their home
                    into Arabia, and all the father’s substance was given to Isaac. The patriarch
                    died at the age of 175 years, and was buried by Isaac and Ishmael beside Sarai
                    in Machpelah. The book of Genesis gives two lists of Arab tribes, descended
                    partly from Abram and Keturah, partly from him and Hagar or Ishmael. These dwelt
                    in Arabia Deserta and Petraea, as also in the northern half of Arabia Felix.</p>
                <p>1. We cannot adopt the opinion of Von Bohlen and Dozy that Abram is a mythical
                    person. He must be regarded as a historical character, though the accounts of
                    his life have mythical elements intermingled with much that is traditional or
                    legendary. The difficulty of separating the historic from the merely
                    traditional, hinders the presentation of a natural portrait. Later legends have
                    invested him with extraordinary excellence. They have made him a worshipper of
                    Jehovah, a prophet, the friend of God, favoured with visible manifestations of
                    His presence, and receiving repeated promises of the most far-reaching
                    character. He is the typical ancestor of the chosen race, living under the
                    constant guidance of God, prospering in worldly goods, delivered from imminent
                    perils. A superhuman halo surrounds him. It is the Jehovist in particular who
                    invests him with the marvellous and improbable, connecting him with altars and
                    sacrifices—a cultus posterior to both his time and mental development—making him
                    the subject of theophanies, talking familiarly to Jehovah himself, and feeding
                    angels with flesh. The Elohist’s descriptions are simpler. His patriarchs are
                    usually colourless men, upright and plain. They have neither characteristic
                    features nor distinct outline. Abram stands out an honest, peaceable, generous,
                    high-minded patriarch; a prince, rich, powerful, and honoured, fitted for rule,
                    and exercising it with prudence. We need not expect a full history of the man
                    from writers long posterior, the representatives of popular traditions. Only
                    fragments of the life are given, designed to show his greatness. Legend assigned
                    ideal lineaments to the progenitor whom a remote antiquity shrouded with its
                    hoary mantle, and thus he became a model worthy of imitation.</p>
                <p>2. The biblical sources of his biography are three at least; and sometimes all
                    appear in a single chapter, as in Gen. xxii., which describes the severest trial
                    of faith. The oldest or Elohim-document is seen in verses 20-24, which link on
                    to chap. xxi. 2-5, from the same. The rest of the chapter belongs to the junior
                    Elohist, except verses 14-18, added by the Jehovist to connect Abram’s sacrifice
                    with Jerusalem. These different documents, out of which the general narrative
                    was finally put together by a redactor, create diversities and contradictions.
                    Thus the Elohist makes Abram laugh at the announcement of a son by Sarai (xvii.
                    17); the Jehovist, jealous for the patriarch’s honour, assigns the laughter to
                    the woman as a sign of incredulity (xviii. 12).</p>
                <p>3. The account of the change of names given to Abram and Sarai when circumcision
                    was instituted, cannot be regarded as historical. The Elohist says that <hi
                    rend="italic">Abram</hi> became <hi rend="italic">Abraham,</hi> the latter
                    meaning <hi rend="italic">father of much people.</hi> But the Hebrew tongue has
                    no word <hi rend="italic">rah</hi><hi rend="italic">â</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >m,</hi> and no root with the three letters רהם. Hence the Jews found the
                    etymology a puzzle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Beer’s <hi rend="italic">Leben Abrahams,</hi> pp. 150, 151.</p></note> The old
                    reading was undoubtedly <hi rend="italic">Abram</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sarai,</hi> though the later Jews expressly forbade <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abram</hi> either in speaking or writing. The difference is one of mere
                    orthography. The forms רהם and רום are cognate ones, as are שרי and שרה. The
                    etymologising propensity of the Elohist is well known. The names signify <hi
                    rend="italic">father of height</hi> and <hi rend="italic">princess</hi>
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>4. The religion of Abram was not pure Jehovism. According to Exodus vi. 3, the
                    name Jehovah was unknown before Moses. Pure Jehovism was a growth not reached
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n70/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0070-0055"/> before the prophets. It was a late development,
                    the creed of the most spiritual teachers, not of the people generally. Abram was
                    a distinguished Oriental sheikh, who laid aside the grossness of idolatry, and
                    rose by degrees, through contact with many peoples and his own reflection, to
                    the conception of a Being higher than the visible world, the God of the light
                    and the sun. He was a civilised nomad, having wider and more spiritual
                    aspirations than the peoples with whom he lived. As a worshipper of God, his
                    faith was magnified by later ages throwing back their more advanced ideas into
                    his time, because he was the founder of a favoured race, the type of Israel as
                    they were or should be.</p>
                <p>5. The leading idea forming the essence of the story respecting Abram’s sacrifice
                    of Isaac, presents some difficulty of explanation. The chapter did not proceed
                    from the earliest writer, but from one acquainted with the institution of animal
                    sacrifices. That the patriarch was familiar with human sacrifices among the
                    peoples round about is beyond a doubt. Was he tempted from within to comply, on
                    one occasion, with the prevailing custom; or did the disaffected Canaanites call
                    upon him to give such proof of devotion to his God? Perhaps there was a struggle
                    in his mind between the better ideas which led to the habitual renunciation of
                    the barbarous rite, and scruples of the universal impropriety attaching to it.
                    The persuasion that it could never be allowed may have been shaken at times. The
                    general purport of the narrative is to place in a strong light the faith of one
                    prepared to make the most costly sacrifice in obedience to the divine command,
                    as well as God’s aversion to human offerings.</p>
                <p>6. It is impossible to get chronological exactness in Abram’s biography, because
                    it is composed of different traditions incorporated with one another, the
                    product of different times, and all passing through the hands of a later
                    redactor for whom the true succession of events was not of primary importance.
                    The writers themselves did not know the accurate chronology, having to do with
                    legends as well as facts impregnated with the legendary, which the redactor
                    afterwards altered or adapted. The Elohist is much more chronological than the
                    other writers. It is even impossible to tell the time when Abram lived.
                    According to Lepsius, he entered Palestine 1700-1730 B.c.; according to Bunsen,
                    2886; while Schenkel gives 2130-2140 B.C. In Beer’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leben</hi><hi rend="italic">Abraham’s</hi> his birth is given 1948 A.M., <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 2040 B.c.</p>
                <p>7. The Midrashim contain a good deal about Abram which is either founded on
                    biblical accounts or spun out of the fancy. Nimrod was king of Babylon at the
                    time. The patriarch’s early announcement of the doctrine of one God, his zeal in
                    destroying idols, including those worshipped by his father, his miraculous
                    escape from Nimrod’s wrath, his persuading Terah to leave the king’s service and
                    go with him to Canaan, are minutely told. During his life he had no fewer than
                    ten temptations. Satan tried to ruin him, after the fiend had appeared at the
                    great feast given when Isaac was weaned, in the form of a poor bent old man, who
                    had been neglected. We can only refer to one specimen of rabbinic
                    dialogue-making. God appeared to Abram by night, saying to him, “Take thy
                    son”—(Abram interrupting), “Which? I have two of them.” The voice of God—“Him
                    who is esteemed by you as your only son.” Abram—“Each of them is the only son of
                    his mother.” God’s voice—“Him whom thou lovest.” Abram—“I love both.” God’s
                    voice—“Him whom thou especially lovest.” Abram—“I cherish my children with like
                    love.” God’s voice—“Now, then, take Isaac.” Abram—“And what shall I begin with
                    in him?” God’s voice—“Go to the land where at my call mountains will rise up out
                    of valleys to Moriah, and offer thy son Isaac as a holocaust.” Abram—“Is it a
                    sacrifice I shall offer, Lord? Where is the priest to prepare it ?” “Be thou
                    invested with that dignity as Shem was formerly.” Abram—“But that land counts
                    several mountains, which shall I ascend ?” “The top of the mountain where thou
                    shalt see my glory veiled in the clouds,” &amp;c. (Beer, pp. 59, 60.)</p>
                <p>The Arabic legends about Ibrahim are mostly taken from the Jewish fountain, very
                    few being independent and preIslamite. Mohammed collected all that were current,
                    and presented them in forms best suited to his purpose. His sources were the
                    biblical accounts and later Jewish legends. Those about the patriarch building
                    the Kaaba along with Ishmael, his giving this son the house and all the country
                    in which it was, his going as a pilgrim to Mecca every year, seeing Ishmael, and
                    then returning to his own land, Syria, his foot-print on the black stone of the
                    temple, and similar stories, are of genuine Arabic origin. The rest are Jewish,
                    with certain alterations. The collected narratives of the Arabic historians are
                    given by Tabari, constituting a confused mass of legends drawn from the Old
                    Testament, the Koran, and the Rabbins. (See Ewald’s <hi rend="italic"
