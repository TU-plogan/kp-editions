                    <hi rend="italic">ανά</hi> and <hi rend="italic">βaτrτlζu&gt;),</hi> a name
                    sometimes applied indiscriminately to all denominations of Christians that deny
                    the validity of infant baptism, but restricted in general usage to certain sects
                    which became prominent in Germany and elsewhere at the period of the
                    Reformation. In both cases the designation originates with opponents, and is
                    repudiated by the great majority of those to whom it is applied. Believing, as
                    they do, that the baptism of infants is no baptism, they naturally object to a
                    name which implies that their baptism of such persons as may have been baptised
                    in infancy is a second administration of the rite. It is therefore desirable to
                    avoid the use of the term as descriptive of those who hold what are otherwise
                    known as antipaedobaptist views. In its more limited sense the word has been too
                    long in use, and is too well known to be now discarded, though it is open to the
                    further objection, in addition to that already stated, that it describes a sect
                    by one of the least important of its distinctive doctrines and practices. The
                    Anabaptists of Germany are historically noteworthy, not because they insisted on
                    re-baptism as the condition of admission to their communion, but because the
                    enthusiasm of the Reformation manifested itself in them in a form and manner
                    altogether peculiar. Their views as to the true constitution of the church and
                    its relation to the state, and the efforts they made to realise these views,
                    furnish a problem, partly theological, partly historical, of which a
                    satisfactory solution is not easy. To one who looks merely at the extravagance
                    and lawlessness which appear on the surface, fanaticism and madness may furnish
                    a sufficient explanation of the whole Anabaptist movement, but a deeper insight
                    will find many elements in it that are quite inconsistent with the supposition
                    of nothing more than barefaced imposture in the leaders, and blind delusion in
                    the followers. There is an obvious genetic, though not historical connection
                    between the Anabaptists and those earlier sects (Novatians, Donatists,
                    Albigenses, Waldenses) which did not practise infant baptism. It is more
                    important, however, to trace the relation between the Anabaptists and the great
                    body of the Reformers. Anabaptism, as a system, may be defined as the
                    Reformation doctrine carried to its utmost limit; the Anabaptists were the
                    extreme left in the army of the Reformers. It is true that they regarded each
                    other as in different camps; but their mutual denunciations cannot conceal the
                    fact that even the most peculiar doctrines of the Anabaptists were to them only
                    corollaries, illegitimately drawn, as the more orthodox Reformers thought, from
                    the fundamental principle, common to both, of the independence of the individual
                    judgment, and the supreme importance of the subjective element, personal faitb,
                    in religion. The connection of this principle with their theory of the church
                    and its relation to the state, their doctrine of the sacraments, and even their
                    political rising, is so obvious that it need not be dwelt upon. The history of
                    the Anabaptist movement in its outward development is brief but eventful. In
                    1521 their first rising took place at Zwickau, under the leadership of Thomas
                    Münzer, the Lutheran pastor of that place. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mûnzee.)</hi> Compelled to leave Zwickau, Münzer visited Bohemia, resided two
                    years at Altstadt and Thuringia, and in 1524 spent some time in Switzerland.
                    During this period he proclaimed his revolutionary doctrines in religion and
                    politics with growing vehemence, and, so far as the lower orders were concerned,
                    with growing success. The crisis came in the so-called Peasants’ War in South
                    Germany, in 1525. In its origin a revolt against feudal oppression, it became,
                    under the leadership of Münzer, a war against all constituted authorities, and
                    an attempt to establish by force his ideal Christian commonwealth, with absolute
                    equality and the community of goods. The total defeat of the insurgents at
                    Frankenfiausen (May 15, 1525), followed as it was by the execution of Münzer and
                    several other leaders, proved only a temporary check to the Anabaptist movement.
                    Here and there throughout Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands there were
                    zealous propagandists, through whose teaching many were prepared to follow as
                    soon as another leader should arise. A second and more determined attempt to
                    establish a theocracy was made at Münster, in Westphalia (1532-5). Here the sect
                    had gained considerable influence, through the adhesion of Rothmann, the
                    Lutheran pastor, and several prominent citizens; and the leaders, Johann
                    Matthyszoon or Matthiesen, a baker of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0830-0787"/> Haarlem, and Johann Bockhold, a tailor of Leyden,
                    had little difficulty in obtaining possession of the town and deposing the
                    magistrates. Vigorous preparations were at once made, not only to hold what had
                    been gained, but to proceed from Münster as a centre to the conquest of the
                    world. The town being besieged by Count Waldeck, its expelled bishop (April
                    1534), Matthiesen, who was first in command, made a sally with only thirty
                    followers, under the fanatical idea that he was a second Gideon, and was cut off
                    with his entire band. Bockhold, better known in history as John of Leyden, was
                    now supreme. Giving himself out as the successor of David, he claimed royal
                    honours and absolute power in the new “Zion.” He justified the most arbitrary
                    and extravagant measures by the authority of visions from heaven, as others have
                    done in similar circumstances. With this pretended sanction he legalised
                    polygamy, and himself took four wives, one of whom he beheaded with his own hand
                    in the market-place in a fit of frenzy. As a natural consequence of such
                    licence, Münster was for twelve months a scene of unbridled profligacy. After an
                    obstinate resistance the town was taken by the besiegers on the 24th June 1535,
                    and in January of the following year Bockhold and some of his more prominent
                    followers, after being cruelly tortured, were executed in the market-place. The
                    outbreak at Münster was the crisis of the Anabaptist movement. It never again
                    had the opportunity of assuming political importance, the civil powers naturally
                    adopting the most stringent measures to suppress an agitation whose avowed
                    object was to suppress them. It is difficult to trace the subsequent history of
                    the sect as a religious body. The fact that, after the Münster insurrection, the
                    very name Anabaptist was proscribed in Europe, is a source of twofold confusion.
                    The enforced adoption of new names makes it easy to lose the historical identity
                    of many who really .belonged to the Münster Anabaptists, and, on the other hand;
                    has led to the classification of many with the Münster sect who had no real
                    connection with it. The latter mistake, it is to be noted, has been much more
                    common than the former. The Men-nonites, for example, have been identified with
                    the earlier Anabaptists, on the ground that they included among their number
                    many of the fanatics of Münster. But the continuity of a sect is to be traced in
                    its principles and not in its adherents, and it must be remembered that Menno
                    and his followers expressly repudiated the distinctive doctrines of the Münster
                    Anabaptists. They have never aimed at any social or political revolution, and
                    have been as remarkable for sobriety of conduct as the Münster sect was for its
                    fanaticism. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mennonites.)</hi> In English history
                    frequent reference is made to the Anabaptists during the 16th and 17th
                    centuries, but there is no evidence that any considerable number of native
                    Englishmen ever adopted the principles of the Münster sect. Many of the
                    followers of Münzer and Bockhold seem to have fled from persecution in Germany
                    and the Netherlands to be subjected to a persecution scarcely less severe in
                    England. The mildest measure adopted towards these refugees was banishment from
                    the kingdom, and a large number suffered at the stake. It has already been
                    explained that the application of the term Anabaptist to those English sects
                    that had nothing in common with the German Anabaptists except the practice of
                    adult baptism, is unjustifiable. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Baptists.)</hi></p>
