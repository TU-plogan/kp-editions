                <p>BY an alphabet we mean a list of symbols which represent conventionally to the
                    eye the sounds which are heard in the speech of a nation. An alphabet will
                    therefore be perfect if the number of its symbols exactly corresponds to the
                    number of simple sounds which are commonly distinguishable in the spoken
                    language. But this perfection has probably never yet been reached: all known
                    alphabets have failed, either by defect, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from not
                    representing all the simple sounds; or by redundancy, in having more than one
                    symbol for the same sound. They must also necessarily become imperfect by lapse
                    of time. No nation keeps the sound of its language unaltered through many
                    centuries: sounds change as well as grammatical forms, though they may endure
                    longer, so that the symbols no longer retain their proper values; often, too,
                    several different sounds come to be denoted by the same symbol; and in
                    strictness the alphabet should be changed to correspond to all these changes.
                    But little inconvenience is practically caused by the tacit acceptance of the
                    old symbol to express the new sound; indeed the change in language is so gradual
                    that the variation in the values of the symbols is imperceptible. It is only
                    when we attempt to produce the exact sounds of the English language less than
                    three centuries ago that we realise the fact that if Shakespeare could now stand
                    on our stage he would seem to us to speak in an unknown tongue; though one of
                    his plays, when written, is as perfectly intelligible now as then. Such changes
                    of sound are most developed in countries where many different dialects, through
                    conquest, immigration, or otherwise, exist side by side: they are checked by the
                    increase of education and by facility of locomotion—both of which causes tend to
                    assimilate all dialects to that one which by some lucky chance has become the
                    literary speech of the nation.</p>
                <p>The term alphabet has come to us from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >alphabetum,</hi> which, however, occurs in no prose writer before Tertullian.
                    It could not have been used, for metrical reasons, by Juvenal, when he wrote,
                    “Hoc discunt omnes ante alpha et beta puellae ”—their <hi rend="smallcaps">a b
                    c.</hi> But there is no reason why it should not have existed earlier: the word
                    was borrowed from the Greek, as seems clear from the compound <hi rend="italic"
                    >αναλφάβητος,</hi> which is as old as the comedian Philyllius (Meineke, <hi
                    rend="italic">Com. Frag.</hi> ii. 857), and he was alive in 392 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It does not seem likely that this compound adjective
                    would have been coined if the noun itself had not already existed in the same
                    sense which it now bears.</p>
                <p>The symbols of our alphabet are nearly those of the Latin; these in their turn
                    were borrowed from a Greek alphabet; and there seems no reasonable ground for
                    doubting the common tradition that the Greeks derived their characters from a
                    Phoenician source. All these borrowings will be fully described hereafter. At
                    this point absolute certainty ends. We cannot prove to demonstration the origin
                    of our alphabet; but positive facts and analogical arguments may be adduced
                    which enable us to attain a very high degree of probability. It is now commonly
                    believed that the characters were originally hieroglyphics, and in that ultimate
                    form were devised in Egypt. There, for convenience of writing, they took a
                    simpler form (called hieratic). In this shape they were borrowed by the
                    Phoenicians; and thus, in their long course down to us, they passed gradually
                    from being the written expression of an idea into the written expression each of
                    a single sound. It is true that the proof is not clear throughout: sometimes the
                    links are feeble, and here we have to employ the analogy of other languages, in
                    which the particular step which we want to prove has undoubtedly been made under
                    similar circumstances. Still, it may with some truth be said that we can only
                    prove the possibility of such a process, while any given alphabet may have had a
                    perfectly independent origin; the Phoenician alphabet <hi rend="italic">may</hi>
                    have been developed in Phoenicia itself, and never been hieroglyphic at all. But
                    this is very difficult to conceive. The <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> argument
                    for the derivation of phonetic from hieroglyphic characters is strong.
                    Hieroglyphics have unquestionably been the first attempt of many nations in a
                    rude state to record their thoughts in a permanent and universally intelligible
                    form. It is also certain that these hieroglyphics have undergone progressive
                    degradation of shape, so that their visible connection with the thing signified
                    was often lost; they became in many cases the expression of those combinations
                    of sounds by which the things were denoted in the spoken language, though they
                    still generally retained their original value as well. Here, at all events, a
                    certain connection between hieroglyphics and sounds establishes itself; and <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> it is more probable that all alphabets should have
                    derived the single sounds of which they consist from hieroglyphics, through the
                    medium of their derived phonetic values, than that any alphabet should have been
                    produced independently of hieroglyphics (which are admitted to have existed), by
                    some arbitrary process of formation for which absolutely no testimony can be
                    adduced. As we have said above, such a process is not impossible, and may be
                    true for any particular alphabet; but the opposite theory has the most internal
                    probability and all the evidence of which the case admits. Against this it seems
                    insufficient to urge (as has been done) that there exist upon earth savages who
                    have never developed any alphabetic writing out of their rude attempts—a fact
                    which may be readily granted; or that civilised men often return to the simple'
                    methods employed by uncivilised nations, such as cutting notches on sticks or
                    tying knots in strings—such return being apparently adduced to prove that two
                    totally different methods of expression can co-exist without there being any
                    tendency to pass from one to the other; nay, it is added that in Egypt the
                    hieroglyphic and the common (or demotic) character did certainly exist side by
                    side; and if the latter were borrowed from the former, it would have superseded
                    it, which it did not do. Now, in answer to this, reasons will appear shortly why
                    the hieroglyphic characters lingered so persistently, even when the later
                    phonetic character was in common use—nay, in the very same inscription or
                    document with the hieroglyphic. Still, the argument would have some weight if it
                    were not grounded on the false assumption that the demotic alphabet was a <hi
                    rend="italic">purely</hi> phonetic one, totally unconnected with its more aged
                    rival. But modern research has proved incontestably that the demotic characters
                    can be traced back to their original hieroglyphic shape through the medium of
                    the hieratic; in fact, that the cumbrous hieroglyphics were successively put
                    into more and more abbreviated shapes, for convenience of writing, as its use
                    increased.</p>
                <p>Excluding, then, attempts of savages such as have been mentioned above, which
                    were neither durable nor intelligible enough to make them of service, except for
                    the smallest number of men during the most limited time— excluding these as not
                    deserving the name, we derive all real writing from hieroglyphics, such
                    hieroglyphics being either purely pictorial, the expression of visible objects
                    in the external world; or symbolic, when some external object is conventionally
                    chosen to represent some action or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n639/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0639-0602"/> some abstract idea. These two methods were
                    probably nearly contemporaneous in their origin, because the necessity of
                    writing at all supposes a considerable advance in civilisation, and therefore a
                    considerable development of ideas. To this system as a whole the convenient term
                    <hi rend="italic">ideography</hi> is now generally applied. From this men have
                    passed to phonetic writing, first, apparently, in the form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >syllabism,</hi> in which each syllable of a word is regarded as an independent
                    whole and represented by a single sign; then from this to <hi rend="italic"
                    >alphabetism,</hi> in which the syllable is no longer denoted by an indivisible
                    symbol, but is resolved into vowel and consonant, each with its own accepted
                    sign.</p>
                <p>It seems probable that all known alphabets (with one or two possible exceptions)
                    may be traced back to four or five parents. These have differed much in
                    fruitfulness, but all were originally hieroglyphic. These five systems of
                    writing are the Egyptian, the cuneiform, the Chinese, the Mexican or Aztec, and
                    the curiously cumbrous characters of Yucatan and central America: these last may
                    be seen interspersed with figurative paintings in a facsimile given by Μ. de
                    Rosny at p. 20 of his very useful little summary, <hi rend="italic">Les

                    extension; and the first, if the Phoenician, and by consequence the European
                    alphabets, were derived from it, far exceeds in importance all the rest
                    together. These systems were perfectly independent, and developed themselves,
                    each in the same course, but in its own manner, and each in the main to a
                    different degree. At certain points in their history all but one became
                    crystallised, and remained to show us the steps by which the progress to
                    phonetism can be made. We do not propose to describe here fully any of these
                    systems of hieroglyphics. We are only concerned to point out their relative
                    degrees of development, their deficiencies, and the consequent motives which
                    must have impelled men by degrees to the production of a genuine alphabet.<note

                <p>There are obvious deficiencies even in the most highly developed hieroglyphics.
                    In the first place, they must have been excessively burdensome to the memory.
                    They speedily lost their original form, which was in most cases too cumbrous to
                    be retained when writing became frequent; their pictorial value was therefore
                    lost, and the new form could not generally have been intelligible to a learner,
                    who was thus obliged to acquire by memory an enormous number of symbols,
                    compared with which even the Sanskrit alphabet may be regarded as easy.
                    Secondly, it is impossible by hieroglyphics to express grammatical relations:
                    the order, indeed, in which the symbols are placed may denote the distinction
                    between subject and object; plurality may be expressed by the repetition of a
                    symbol; some even of the relations in space, denoted in more advanced languages
                    by cases, may be pictorially rendered; but all these helps do not go far to
                    remedy this obvious want. Experience, however, shows how much inconvenience a
                    nation will undergo rather than make any radical change in its phonetic system.
                    We have only to look at our own alphabet, with its numerous and universally
                    confessed deficiencies and redundancies, and then remember the fruitless
                    attempts which have been made to work a reform in it, to be convinced that no
                    people will of its own accord strike out a thoroughly new system of writing.
                    Such revolutions can only be produced by the meeting of two different
                    civilisations, and the reception by the one of the arts and ideas of the other.
                    But such a meeting may, and more commonly does, only stimulate the inferior race
                    to some partial development. For the new ideas new names are required: these may
                    be metaphorically represented out of the old vocabulary, as when the Romans
                    called the unknown elephant the Lucanian ox, and of course wrote it so. But
                    suppose the inferior people to be one which has not yet advanced beyond
                    hieroglyphic writing; their simplest and most obvious plan will be to take the
                    strange name, and express it by those symbols out of their old stock which
                    denote the nearest sounds to that of the name required. Such symbols then cease
                    to represent ideas only, as they used to do; they are consciously employed to
                    represent mere sounds, and thus arise the first beginnings of phonetism. A good
                    example of this process may be found in the Aztec (Lenormant, i. 29; De Rosny,
                    p. 19, who also gives others). When Christianity was introduced into Mexico, the
                    Lord’s Prayer was reduced to writing in the following manner :—The Mexican
                    symbols nearest to the two syllables of <hi rend="italic">pater</hi> were a flag
                    (sounded a <hi rend="italic">s pantli),</hi> and a rock (<hi rend="italic">tetl)
                    :pater</hi> was therefore represented pictorially by a flag and a rock; we
                    cannot tell whether it was sounded as <hi rend="italic">pan-tetl,</hi> or only
                    as <hi rend="italic">pa-te—</hi> the nearest possible equivalent in the Mexican
                    language, which has no <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> Similarly, <hi rend="italic"
                    >noster</hi> was phonetically represented by <hi rend="italic">noch-tetl,</hi>
                    pictorially by the Indian fig <hi rend="italic">(nochtli)</hi> and the rock as
                    before. Here, then, we have the application of symbols to denote sound without
                    regard to the original sense; just as we might draw the figures of an eye, a
                    saw, and a horse, and convey by them the idea, “I saw a horse.” The Aztec would
                    not long have the ideas of a flag, a rock, and a fig presented to his mind when
                    he read these symbols; and so the first conception of phonetism was gained, the
                    first move from hieroglyphic to alphabetic writing. Yet he had not attained the
                    first real step in the progress— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> syllabic
                    writing—because if he had decomposed his new words, <hi rend="italic">pan</hi>
                    would not have represented to his mind merely so much sound—a syllable by itself
                    meaningless: it would have given him only the idea of a flag. And further than
                    this the Aztec language did not pass: probably it only reached this stage
                    incompletely with a small number of words. The great advance to syllabic writing
                    is to be found elsewhere; first in the Chinese, perhaps through the accident of
                    the monosyllabic nature of the language; but with a clearly-developed purpose in
                    the Aramaic cuneiform inscriptions.</p>
                <p>In the Chinese written character we find a considerable number of symbols which
                    were unquestionably at first pictorial. Though but very slight vestiges of their
                    original meaning can now be seen in them, yet they can be traced back to older
                    forms which are unmistakeable; and their origin is further attested by the name
                    “images,” which the Chinese give them, as distinguished from others which they
                    call “letters.” These symbols were simple, and denoted very ingeniously natural
                    objects—the sun (by a circle with a dot inside), the moon (by a crescent with a
                    line inside), a mountain (by three peaks side by side), rain (by drops under an
                    overarching line), a child (thus ), a mother ( , a figure expressing the arms
                    and bosom effectively enough), &amp;c. These symbols could be combined: thus the
                    symbols for water and eye combined denoted tears, an ear and a door expressed
                    hearing and understanding<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n640/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0640-0603"/>; but such combinations of pure hieroglyphics were
                    rare, as they would have been liable to be confused with combinations of the
                    same kind used in a different way, as will be seen immediately. There were also
                    some hieroglyphs used symbolically; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a hand to
                    denote a workman, the two valves of a shell-fish to denote friends. These also
                    are few in number, and not very ingenious. Last in this class come some symbols
                    which are essentially pictorial, though they represent no visible object; <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> “above” was expressed by a dot above a horizontal line;
                    "below,” by a dot below it; the numerals one, two, three, by so many horizontal
                    lines; “right,” by the symbol "left,” by , &amp;c. So far, we have simple
                    hieroglyphs, or ideograms (a more convenient term),—pictorial representations,
                    expressing not merely visible objects, but also abstract ideas, and even
                    actions; but each of these could also have the phonetic value of the name of the
                    object which it depicted.</p>
                <p>Distinct from these are the “letters ”—in use, though not in origin. These have
                    two parts—one, a symbol which was originally an ideogram, and which could still
                    be used as such, but which in this particular combination lost its ideographic
                    value, and retained only the phonetic value of the name of its object; the
                    other, an ideogram, which laid aside its phonetic value, and only restricted to
                    a particular class the phonetic symbol which it accompanied. Thus, for example,
                    the ideogram of a ship had also the phonetic value <hi rend="italic"
                    >tcheu—i.e.,</hi> the name denoting ship in the spoken language; the ideogram of
                    fire had the phonetic value <hi rend="italic">hv</hi><hi rend="italic">ó</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi> these two symbols combined were still pronounced <hi
                    rend="italic">tcheu,</hi> and meant the flickering of flame. The second symbol
                    dropped its phonetic value altogether, but kept the generic idea of fire: the
                    ship was lost, but the idea of undulating motion modified that of fire, and the
                    complex symbol combined the two ideas, with the one sound <hi rend="italic"
                    >tcheu.</hi> Similarly, the ideogram ship and speech combined expressed
                    loquacity, and this in the spoken language was also <hi rend="italic"
                    >tcheu,</hi> the phonetic value of the symbol for speech being dropped, just
                    like that of the symbol fire above. In this way there are ten different ideas
                    given by Endlicher (p. 10), all called in the spoken language <hi rend="italic"
                    >tcheu,</hi> and all expressed to the eye by different complex symbols formed on
                    this principle. These symbols, he reckons, form at least <hi rend="superscript">
                    29</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 30</hi> ths of the written language.</p>
                <p>This is a very imperfect sketch of the Chinese system of writing, and into the
                    history of the “keys,” which indeed belong rather to Chinese lexicography, we do
                    not propose to enter. But it is enough to throw light on some questions
                    connected with our subject. First of all, we see ideography and phonetism
                    existing side by side; and even the same symbol, having in most cases (not in
                    all) either an ideographic or a phonetic value at will. Therefore, in this case
                    the passage from the one system to the other may be considered as certain; but
                    how it was made there is not sufficient evidence to show. It must have been
                    earlier than the combination of pure ideograms mentioned above. It was probably
                    greatly facilitated by the Chinese being a monosyllabic language; each syllable
                    is a complete word in itself, expressing a complete notion: hence the idea of
                    completeness and individuality would attach to such a combination of sound more
                    easily than would be possible in polysyllabic language; and it would seem more
                    natural to give that sound a symbol for itself, quite apart from its ideographic
                    meaning. Further, as the whole number of single syllables of which the language
                    consists is only 450, the effort of remembering the symbols could not be great,
                    and the memory must have been already trained in that direction, because the
                    symbols (even in their ideographic acceptation) had lost their obviously
                    pictorial character, and must have been kept by the memory, not recognised each
                    time by the eye; just as children, in learning to read, commonly remember short
                    and familiar words as a whole, without analysing them into the component
                    letters.</p>
                <p>The explanation of the cumbrous “letters” described above is simple; and it will
                    show us, secondly, how so apparently monstrous a system of writing could be
                    maintained, and has been in its essence maintained, down to the present day.
                    With so few radical sounds in the language, it was inevitable that many
                    different objects must have been expressed, as ideas grew and multiplied, by the
                    same sound, as we saw above that there were eleven different ideas (including
                    the ship itself) all called <hi rend="italic">tcheu.</hi> These could be
                    distinguished in the spoken language by tone or accent, and actually were so
                    distinguished. But how were they to be distinguished in writing? Now, writing is
                    but the visible exponent of language, and therefore is naturally formed under
                    the same conditions—those conditions which, because the effect is obvious while
                    the reason is often difficult to detect, we vaguely call the genius of the
                    language: and it must accommodate itself to the defects as well as the strength
                    of the language. There is an inherent evil in Chinese speech—inevitable in a
                    monosyllabic language with a limited number of radicals—that the same
                    combination of sound should serve to express many different ideas. A
                    combination, therefore, of symbols is absolutely necessary, which shall
                    represent to the mind through the eye the fact that the sound which is heard has
                    changed its meaning to meet that of another sound which is not heard—that <hi
                    rend="italic">tcheu</hi> no longer means a ship, but means the flickering of
                    flame, or something else quite different. It would have been easy enough to have
                    had different symbols for the different meanings of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tcheu;</hi> but it would not practically have been so convenient, because it
                    would not have represented so well the facts of the language. If the Chinese had
                    chosen in their speech to do universally what they did occasionally, to form
                    compounds like “ear-dooring” for “hearing” a thing, the native genius for
                    pictorial representation would have produced a symbolism which might have
                    supplied all its wants down to the present day. But that was not the bent of the
                    language; and the writing therefore remains to the present day a mixture of
                    ideography and phonetism, and is perhaps better so. Still, a great deal of
                    confusion is possible. In modern writing, according to Endlicher, each syllable
                    has several symbols, partly because of the extraordinary number of meanings
                    belonging, as we have seen, to each combination of sound, partly from
                    considerations of calligraphy, because it is not every symbol which will combine
                    neatly with every other; and therefore for particular combinations a different
                    symbol with the same phonetic value is required, so that the shapes of the mixed
                    symbols increase in number. Also, the pictorial symbols being comparatively few,
                    and many of these being employed phonetically for the same syllable, it is
                    obvious that, with the growth of ideas, many new symbols must have been
                    required. To meet this want, the mixed symbols so often mentioned were employed
                    purely phonetically, each in new combination on the old principle with an
                    ideogram, whose meaning was disregarded. Generally these symbols kept their
                    phonetic worth, but sometimes in combination with particular ideograms they
                    change. Thus we see a double evil arise in the language. Not only have we
                    several symbols for each combination of sound, but also the same symbol can
                    under certain circumstances have different phonetic values. But the difficulties
                    thus caused seem greater to a stranger than to a native; and the Chinese have
                    never been moved thereby to exchange their <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n641/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0641-0604"/> picturesque but unwieldy system. The impure
                    syllabism marked out for them by the genius of their language has been their
                    furthest development. It was reserved for the Japanese to borrow the Chinese
                    characters, and, expelling all ideographic associations, to employ them simply
                    as syllables, thus advancing to a pure syllabic writing. This borrowing and
                    extension of a system by a foreign nation will be more fully dwelt upon
                    hereafter. It should perhaps be added that the expression of many different
                    senses by one symbol, which has so largely modified the Chinese writing, is not
                    peculiar to monosyllabic language. It is found in all languages, though not to
                    the same extent: roots of different sense have been worn down by phonetic decay
                    till they reach the same form, and this cause may have operated to some extent
                    in China, though it cannot have been very important.</p>
                <p>The cuneiform writing, so called from the wedge-like shape of the characters, or
                    V, which compose it, was employed by different nationalities. It was first
                    deciphered by Grotefend on inscriptions of Persepolis, and was found to be the
                    exponent of the Aryan spoken by the conquering Persians, which belonged, as is
                    well known, to the Indo-European family of languages. But cuneiform inscriptions
                    in three languages were found on a monument at Behistun: the first was the
                    Persian, and much the simplest in form; the second and third were composed of
                    elements of the same shape in much more unwieldy combinations.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A part of this trilingual
                    inscription is printed in De Rosny's <hi rend="italic">Ecritures
                    Figuratives,</hi> p. 70.</p></note> It was obvious that the three inscriptions
                    were identical in meaning, but in different languages; and principally by the
                    help afforded by recurring proper names, whose value could be compared with the
                    known values in Persian, the characters of the last two inscriptions were
                    deciphered, and found to belong, one to the language of the Assyrian and
                    Babylonian subjects of Darius, the other to the old Scythian population of
                    Media, who used a Turanian speech. Other languages, the old Armenian and that of
                    Susa, were found afterwards to be represented by the same characters; and to
                    these different systems the collective name <hi rend="italic">Anarien (i.e.</hi>
                    non-Aryan) has been given by French writers (Oppert, &amp;c.), to distinguish
                    them from the Aryan-Persian, which is a purely phonetic character.</p>
                <p>It seems clear that the origin of this system was Turanian, and that it was
                    borrowed by the Semitic races who used it. It was originally hieroglyphic,
                    though the stiff combinations of wedges give but little indication of such an
                    origin. But both in Assyrian and Babylonian there is an older character and a
                    newer one, and the older forms can again be traced back to a still more archaic
                    shape, which was unquestionably the original of both, and which is not
                    cuneiform, but composed of straight lines only.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For specimens, see Oppert, vol. ii., p.
                    63.</p></note> These show little of the brilliancy of invention of the Chinese;
                    they seem to appeal to the reason rather than to the eye; they are obviously
                    intended to recall the image of the object, but they must have been first
                    explained in order to be intelligible at all, and then they might be remembered.
                    For example, a house was denoted by ∣ j ∣--1; a town by</p>
                <p>Neither of these are symbols which will be intelligible as soon as seen by a
                    person who has not been taught them. This is probably due to the fact that they
                    were produced, not by the hair-pencil of the Chinese, but by the chisel; they
                    were intended to be written on rock, and for this straight lines are more
                    convenient; and the wedge shape which they assumed afterwards may be explained
                    by the ease with which it can be made by two strokes of the chisel—perhaps no
                    other figure so clear can be produced with such facility.</p>
                <p>This system seems to have reached syllabism before it was adopted by the Aramaic
                    peoples. But the syllabism was still mixed up with ideography, just as we have
                    seen was the case in China—that is, the same symbol denoted ideographically the
                    object, and phonetically the sound, of the name of the object; as though in
                    English we should denote by the symbol B both the insect <hi rend="italic"
                    >bee</hi> and the sound <hi rend="italic">be.</hi> But there is a difference
                    between this idiom and the Chinese; it was polysyllabic, whereas Chinese was
                    syllabic. When, then, the name of the object contained more than one syllable,
                    the first alone was taken to be denoted phonetically by the symbol. The evidence
                    for this is small in quantity, owing to the scanty remains of the language of
                    that Turanian element of the Chaldee nation from which the cuneiform writing was
                    borrowed. To this language the name Accadian has been given by Dr Hincks, and
                    this name seems to be now generally received. But the Medo-Scythic, mentioned
                    above, which is a closely-connected dialect, supplies us with forms sufficiently
                    close to the old Scythian spoken originally by all the Turanian stock in that
                    part of Asia. Thus one symbol in Assyrian denotes ideographically God and
                    phonetically <hi rend="italic">an;</hi> now the name for God in Medo-Scythic is
                    <hi rend="italic">Annap.</hi> Another denotes a city and <hi rend="italic">but;
                    batin</hi> is a city in Scythian. Another is a father and <hi rend="italic"
                    >at;</hi> in Scythian a father is <hi rend="italic">atta.</hi> (Oppert, ii. 79;
                    Lenormant, i. 41.) This evidence will doubtless be strengthened with time, but
                    even now it is conclusive; and the principle thus established, the arbitrary
                    selection of the first part of a name to have a particular phonetic value, seems
                    to be exactly the principle which we should <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> have
                    expected to find if we had tried to conceive the possible ways in which
                    ideography could pass into phonetism.</p>
                <p>The confusion which was occasioned by the imperfection of Assyrian writing was
                    immensely increased by the fact of their characters being borrowed, not
                    indigenous, as in China. There is first of all the obvious difficulty of
                    adapting Turanian symbols to a Semitic language, in which the short vowels were
                    not written, and the meaning of the radical group of consonants in any
                    particular place had to be determined by the context. Instead of being able to
                    retain the same symbol to express a root in its modified forms, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in the conjugation of a verb, a new symbol would be
                    necessary for each person-form, which could be expressed by mere vowel change in
                    the root, and these symbols might be totally unconnected, so that all sense of
                    the connection of different parts of a verb would be lost. This is bad enough,
                    but it is an evil inherent in the borrowing of such a system of writing to
                    express a language whose genius was so essentially different. But there was
                    another evil, much greater, which might have been avoided, and was not. This is
                    polyphony—the expression of many different sounds by the same symbol. When the
                    Assyrians took an Accadian symbol, they should have taken only its phonetic
                    value, or one of them, if it had more than one, and in this way they might have
                    acquired a purely syllabic character, as the people of Susa afterwards actually
                    did. But, as was not unnatural at the time, they took it with all its values,
                    ideographic and phonetic, and added more of their own. A striking example given
                    by Oppert (ii. 85) will make this plain. In Accadian this symbol was the
                    ideogram for an open hand, doubtless originally in a more elaborate form. In the
                    spoken language a hand was called <hi rend="italic">kurpi,</hi> and therefore,
                    by the principle mentioned above, this symbol had also the phonetic value <hi
                    rend="italic">kur.</hi> But by a metaphor the hand symbol had the further
                    ideographic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n642/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0642-0605"/> values of seizing, possessing, and understanding.
                    To seize in the spoken language must have been <hi rend="italic">mat</hi>, or
                    something very like it <hi rend="italic">(imid</hi> occurs in this sense in the
                    Scythian), for this phonetic value also belonged to one symbol. But further, in
                    Accadian a mountain was called <hi rend="italic">kur;</hi> sunrise, <hi
                    rend="italic">hurra;</hi> earth was <hi rend="italic">mat;</hi> to go was <hi
                    rend="italic">mit;</hi> and these sounds, identical or nearly identical, were
                    every one expressed by the same symbol, which thus had eight ideographic and two
                    phonetic values, <hi rend="italic">k</hi><hi rend="italic">ur</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">mat;</hi> and in this wretched condition it was taken by the
                    Assyrians, and employed by them in all these different senses. But this was not
                    all. In the Assyrian language <hi rend="italic">kur</hi> was the name of a
                    furnace, and <hi rend="italic">mat</hi> meant to die; and as it must have been
                    to obtain a visible exponent for these sounds that the foreign symbol was
                    adopted, both of these ideas were necessarily denoted by it. Again, in Assyrian,
                    “to understand” was pronounced as <hi rend="italic">nat,</hi> and to “possess”
                    was <hi rend="italic">nal;</hi> and so were added two more phonetic values by
                    reason of the metaphoric value of <hi rend="italic">mat</hi> in Accadian. Lastly
                    was added the phonetic value <hi rend="italic">shat,</hi> because that was the
                    Assyrian name for a mountain, which we saw was denoted in Accadian by <hi
                    rend="italic">kur.</hi> Thus, when an Assyrian came upon this little
                    plainlooking symbol he had to determine whether it meant the earth, a mountain,
                    sunrise, a furnace, or seizing, possessing, understanding, going, or dying; or
                    whether it had only one of the phonetic values, <hi rend="italic">kur, mat,
                    shat, nal,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nat.</hi> And a large list of other symbols
                    is given by Μ. Oppert, which, in a similar way, have two, three, four, and even
                    six different phonetic values. It may seem incredible that a people under such
                    difficulties should ever have been able to express what they wished to say, much
                    less to understand what was written. It is a great witness to the strength of
                    the feeling which must have existed in these old people that ideography was the
                    natural and proper method of writing, and phonetics were only a supplement to
                    eke out its deficiencies. To us such a feeling is at first incomprehensible, but
                    after such an example we cannot doubt its existence. With respect, indeed, to
                    the difficulty caused by one symbol having many ideographic values, we have only
                    to think of the many different significations expressed in our own language by
                    the same combination of sound, without any confusion arising, because the
                    particular meaning is marked out by the context; for instance, when the one
                    sound <hi rend="italic">but</hi> denotes a conjunction, a verb; and a noun with
                    two senses—one original and one derived, but now quite different,—we should
                    therefore only see in the Assyrian an aggravated case of this want of clearness.
                    But the difficulty is much more serious when the same symbol has different
                    phonetic values; and much help cannot have been obtained from the grammatical
                    lists which have actually been dug out under the superintendence of Mr Layard,
                    in which the Assyrian kings state, avowedly for the instruction of their
                    subjects, the different values which each symbol could possess. (See Oppert, ii.
                    53.) By these lists some limit might undoubtedly be put to the further
                    multiplication of values for the same sign, but it could not help a reader to
                    trace which of all the authorised values he was to give to a symbol at any
                    particular time. It would appear that in the cuneiform, as unquestionably in the
                    Egyptian, conventional phonetic symbols could be used as complements to other
                    symbols, which might represent an idea or a mere syllable, and by these phonetic
                    complements the special sense could be defined with some approach to exactness.
                    But into these remedies of the ills of polyphony we need not further enter.</p>
                <p>It is far beyond the scope of the present article to describe fully the
                    development of hieroglyphism in Egypt, the country in which the last step to
                    alphabetism—the separation of the vowel-symbols from those which mark the
                    consonants—was undoubtedly taken, though with much faltering, and even turning
                    back. According to Μ. Lenormant, the Egyptians passed through every stage which
                    we have already seen successively reached by different peoples; and at one of
                    which every one of these peoples halted, without ever achieving for themselves
                    the triumph of alphabetic writing. And evidence of each stage, more or less
                    distinct, certainly lingers in the Egyptian, producing an extraordinary medley,
                    little suited for popular or even literary use, but well adapted for the
                    transmission of occult records and rituals, the purpose for which the Greeks not
                    unnaturally supposed the whole hieroglyphic system to have been invented by the
                    priests. As we have already described the phenomena of each stage with some
                    fulness, it is not necessary to do more here than to indicate their occurrence
                    in Egyptian. The hieroglyphs themselves are certainly the finest of their kind.
                    Whether they represent the full contour of the object with all the assistance of
                    vivid colouring, or whether they are simply formed by lines which convey its
                    essential character—a practice which doubtless owed its origin to the increased
                    use of writing— it is impossible not to admire the extraordinary completeness of
                    the representation. Nothing can be more perfectly pictorial than the portraiture
                    of the different emotions, each by the figure of a man affected by it: the
                    position of the body and the gestures of the arms are simply perfect. These
                    belong in the main to the <hi rend="italic">symbolic</hi> use of the
                    hieroglyphs: this use we saw in Chinese was but slight, but in Egypt it was
                    immense. Thus, the sun, with rays streaming from it, denoted to the Egyptian
                    light and clearness; the moon, with its horns turned downward, denoted the
                    month,—in these cases the cause is put for the effect. Sometimes the part is put
                    for the whole: two arms, one holding a shield and one an offensive weapon,
                    express battle; two legs with the feet denote movement, forward or backward
                    according to the direction of the feet, <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi> ∕∖ or</p>
                <p>Δ.; an arm holding a stick denotes force. Sometimes the symbol is purely
                    metaphorical: as when a king is expressed by a bee; knowledge by a roll of
                    papyrus; or justice by the feather of an ostrich, because all feathers of that
                    bird were supposed to be of equal length. Such symbols are clearly of later
                    origin than the other; they imply the existence of conventional rules, which
                    could acquire currency for meanings quite unintelligible in themselves. These
                    symbolic ideograms were not very often used alone; most commonly they
                    accompanied other symbols used phonetically, merely to determine their special
                    meaning in each place: as such they are commonly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >determinatives;</hi> this practice we also saw in China, less skilfully
                    employed. Thus, for example, on the Rosetta stone—whose trilingual inscription,
                    hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek, is the basis of all our knowledge of Egyptian
                    writing—the word for a decree is expressed by characters, consonant and vowel,
                    which denote the sounds of which it is composed, just as in any modern writing;
                    but at the end of these, forming part of the word, though adding nothing to its
                    pronunciation, is the figure of a man with his hand raised to his mouth, which
                    adds the idea of passive obedience to the phonetic combination, and limits it to
                    the idea of a decree. In like manner, the arm with the stick, which as we said
                    denotes force, is added as a determinative to express actions which require
                    force; and the ideogram of motion is also very frequent. This seems to us
                    unnecessary and cumbrous; but when a phonetic combination might have two
                    different meanings, they could hardly have been differentiated in a more
                    intelligible manner. A good list of these symbols may be seen in De Rosny, p.
                    46.</p>
                <p>The traces of the <hi rend="italic">rebus</hi> stage which we saw in the Aztec,

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0643-0606"/> in which a symbol could be transferred from one
                    object to another, because the names of the two had the same sound in the spoken
                    language, are not very distinct, and have not been fully examined; on this point
                    we may hope for more light from Μ. Lenormant He points out that the same symbol
                    denotes “holiness” and a “slave.” No metaphorical explanation seems possible
                    here; but both are sounded <hi rend="italic">hen</hi> in the spoken language,
                    and the community of symbol becomes at once intelligible. In such a practice as
                    this we see at once a cause of great confusion, especially when the same symbol
                    was employed to denote two things the names of which were not exact homophones,
                    and yet sufficiently near in sound to allow themselves to be expressed by the
                    same symbol; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> when the circle which denoted the sun
                    was also taken to denote the idea of day, the sun was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ra</hi>, the day <hi rend="italic">hru,</hi> and so the symbol became a
                    polyphone; it had two not very different sounds. It is true that here the
                    application of the symbol for the sun to denote the day was not caused only by
                    the similarity of sound in the two words—it was probably employed at first
                    metaphorically; but there can be little doubt that it was helped to its double
                    use by the indistinctness of the Egyptian vowel-sounds, which caused the two
                    words to be sounded nearly alike. From this and similar causes arose that
                    polyphony which necessitated the use of the determinatives described above.
                    Vestiges of the syllabic stage in Egyptian exist beyond a doubt, and they point
                    to a slowly-effected transition from the older to the newer form of writing.
                    Thus the symbol of a fish represented at the syllabic stage the syllable <hi
                    rend="italic">an;</hi> later on, the letter <hi rend="italic">a</hi> alone came
                    to be denoted by a reed, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> by a waving line. Now we
                    find the syllable <hi rend="italic">an</hi> represented not merely by its own
                    simple exponent, the fish, but also by the reed and fish together, that is, in
                    phonetic value, by <hi rend="italic">A . an;</hi> by the reed above the waving
                    line (<hi rend="italic superscript"> an</hi> / <hi rend="italic subscript">
                    n</hi>); and even by all three <hi rend="italic">(A</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> an</hi> / <hi rend="italic subscript"> n</hi>) <hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi></p>
                <p>(Lenormant, ii. 44). This surely points to a stage at which the alphabetic values
                    of the reed and line were not yet so firmly fixed that the writer could dispense
                    with the older and more familiar sign of the fish to specialise the other two.
                    Of Egyptian alphabetism proper it is not necessary to give examples; we are
                    sufficiently acquainted with the use of letters pure and simple, and their use
                    in Egypt is not denied.</p>
                <p>To what cause are we to assign the progress of the Egyptian beyond the Assyrian
                    method of writing? What circumstances enabled the one nation to develop at least
                    an imperfect alphabetism, while the other never advanced beyond syllabism? No
                    certain answer can be given; but at least a probable suggestion is made by Μ.
                    Lenormant. The Egyptian vowel-sounds were indistinct: the consonants were clear
                    and definite. Therefore it was natural (as Lepsius pointed out) that in each
                    syllable the consonant should come to be regarded as the important element, and
                    should finally extrude the following vowel altogether. Thus a large number of
                    symbols, which originally represented syllables beginning with the same
                    consonant but followed by different vowels, would become in time absolutely
                    identical in value, the different representatives of the same consonant. And a
                    great abundance of such homophones is actually found in Egyptian. The method,
                    therefore, which was followed in passing from the syllable to the mere
                    alphabetic sign, was identical with that which we have already pointed out in
                    Assyrian, by which the symbol of a polysyllabic word was taken to have the
                    phonetic value of the first syllable of that word; in each case it denoted the
                    first element of the name—the syllable in Assyrian, the single sound in
                    Egyptian. And in each language the symbol thus applied to a new use still
                    retained for a long time its old value as the hieroglyphic or at least
                    conventional exponent of a material object or of an idea. Thus in Egypt <hi
                    rend="italic">nefer</hi> meant good. This word in writing is expressed in two
                    ways: first, by a single symbol—which had originally been the pictorial
                    representation of some material object, but was afterwards the conventional
                    symbol of the idea of goodness; secondly, by this same symbol followed by two
                    others, which had also, from being originally hieroglyphs, acquired the phonetic
                    values of <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r;</hi> that is to say,
                    one symbol could at will express the whole word <hi rend="italic">nefer</hi> and
                    its initial letter <hi rend="italic">n</hi>. This is the natural, perhaps the
                    only possible way of eliminating the single sound; but it is obvious that great
                    difficulties would attend it at the outset. There could be at first no
                    convention to restrict the symbol for <hi rend="italic">n</hi> to that of the
                    particular word <hi rend="italic">nefer;</hi> any other beginning with <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> would have served. There was no law to prevent a writer
                    taking as many symbols for <hi rend="italic">n</hi> as took his fancy; and in
                    fact each letter in this way did have several different symbols.</p>
                <p>It follows that while Egypt must be credited with having first invented an
                    alphabetic system, and must for ever claim for this the gratitude of the world,
                    yet that system was far too imperfect to become the instrument of a popular
                    literature. It suffered equally from the opposite diseases of homophony and
                    polyphony, from the expression of the same sound by many different symbols, and
                    from the use of one symbol to denote many different syllables. And each of these
                    evils was only aggravated by time. The earlier Egyptian writing is much more
                    simple than the later, wherein homophones increased to a degree to which there
                    was practically no limit except the strength of the memory; and the numerous
                    phonetic devices to unravel the confusions of polyphony must have been equally
                    burdensome. It might have been expected that polyphony at least would have
                    become extinct with time; that the different symbols for the same syllable would
                    all have been worn down into single letters, and thus, though homophony might
                    have multiplied, polyphony would have perished. This might have been the case if
                    these symbols had ever become perfectly clear of their originally pictorial or
                    conventional origin. But this was never the case. To the last, the employment of
                    a symbol to express an object or idea continued side by side with its employment
                    as a single letter. The spirit of hieroglyphism, real if not apparent, could not
                    be vanquished by alphabetism; and in order that ideography may be finally
                    expelled, it would seem that circumstances are needed more favourable than can
                    be often found combined at any period of any nation’s history. In fact, a purely
                    phonetic alphabet is most likely to be produced when one nation borrows from
                    another such portion of that nation’s symbols as it requires for its own needs,
                    and rejects that superfluity which only leads to confusion. We have already seen
                    indications of this fact.</p>
                <p>Many circumstances combine to render it difficult for a nation to reach of itself
                    pure phonetism in writing. There is the strong disinclination to change, of
                    which we have before spoken. It is always easier to put up with difficulties to
                    which we have been accustomed all our life than to make any radical change,
                    especially when that change causes at once serious difficulties at every moment.
                    It was easier for the Egyptians to retain the odd mixture of ideographic,
                    syllabic, and alphabetic writing, and occasionally to add some new key for
                    unlocking the difficulties to the formidable list which was already in use. The
                    ingenuity of these grammatical devices almost surpasses belief. We can only
                    refer the curious to the hieroglyphic grammar in the fifth volume of Bunsen’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Egypt's Place in Universal History.</hi> In the second place,
                    a good deal must be allowed to the restraining influence of religion. It is well
                    known that most of the ancient nations ascribed a divine origin to their systems
                    of writing. It might well <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n644/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0644-0607"/> seem to them to be too wonderful a thing for the
                    result of human ingenuity. Thus in one of the Assyrian lists of the different
                    values of syllables, published, as has been already mentioned, by royal
                    authority, Sardanapalus V. states that the god Nebo has revealed to the kings,
                    his ancestors, the cuneiform writing, which he thus endeavours to simplify for
                    the better understanding of his people (Oppert, ii. 53). The Sanskrit character,
                    which is now known to be due to a Phoenician source, was called <hi
                    rend="italic">Deυanâgarî, “</hi> belonging to the city of the gods," unless, as
                    Prof. Μ. Müller suggests <hi rend="italic">(Sanskrit Grammar,</hi> p. 1), we are
                    to understand by the gods here only the Brahmans; but whatever the name may
                    mean, their belief in its divine origin is certain enough. And Μ. Lenormant
                    points out (i. 80) that the native Egyptian term for writing meant “writing
                    heavenly words.” Now it is clear that no nation among which this belief lingered
                    in any degree would be likely to alter fundamentally the spirit of their system
                    of writing. Lastly, it is possible, though, as we have suggested above, not very
                    probable, that the obscurities of the existing system may have recommended it to
                    the priests. These reasons may suffice to show that it was not in Egypt that we
                    -should expect to find the development of a purely phonetic system. But just as
                    the Japanese took the Chinese characters, and gave them a development which they
                    have never had in the land of their creation—just as the people of Susiana took
                    the cuneiform writing and made it purely phonetic, without any remnant of
                    ideography,—so the work of extracting order out of the chaos of Egyptian writing
                    was reserved for the Phoenicians.</p>
                <p>The Phoenicians were peculiarly fitted to perform this inestimable part in the
                    history of human development. An active and enterprising nation, they were early
                    brought into commercial relations with Egypt, and must of necessity have learnt
                    something of their system of writing; they could see its advantages and its
                    perfectly remediable faults; the advantage of one definite symbol for one sound,
                    and the disadvantage of a dozen; the desirability that this symbol should
                    signify that sound only, and the undesirability of its denoting a horse or a man
                    as well. And the religious scruples which may have affected the Egyptians need
                    have no weight for strangers. If the characters were divine for the priests of
                    Isis, they were a convenient instrument to supply every-day wants for the
                    sailors of Tyre.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ.
                    Lenormant (p. 83) will have it that the Phoenicians must have been “très peu
                    religieux, et au fond presque athée.” They may have been so, but surely not
                    merely in order to borrow an alphabet from Egypt. It is enough that that
                    alphabet could have had no sanctity for them.</p></note></p>
                <p>These considerations do not, of course, amount to a proof that the Phoenician
                    alphabet was derived from Egypt. It is of course possible that it disengaged
                    itself by degrees out of an earlier hieroglyphic system at home. But of such a
                    system no vestiges remain; and the correspondence between the Phoenician
                    characters and those of the earlier Egyptian hieratic is sufficiently striking
                    to warrant us in regarding it as at least provisionally true that what was
                    natural and perfectly possible did actually take place.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For evidence of this, see plate, p.
                    600.</p></note> The general testimony of the early Greek and Roman writers, that
                    the alphabet was invented in Phoenicia, must then be limited to the sense in
                    which Tacitus says that the Phoenicians had this credit— <hi rend="italic"
                    >tanquam repererint,</hi><hi rend="italic">quoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >acceperant.</hi></p>
                <p>It cannot be known with certainty whether the Phoenicians took, together with the
                    Egyptian symbols, the phonetic values which they had in Egypt, or whether they
                    totally disregarded those values, and simply assigned to the symbols the value
                    of their own sounds at will. The first view, however, seems clearly the more
                    probable. The Phoenicians could only become acquainted with the Egyptian symbol
                    and sound together; the one would naturally suggest the other; and we should
                    expect that they would first take the symbols belonging to those sounds which
                    exactly corresponded in Egyptian and Phoenician, then the symbols of other
                    Egyptian sounds which did not exactly correspond to their own, but which seemed
                    in each case the most analogous to them; but that there would never be any
                    violent rupture between the symbol and its old sound. Yet it seems quite certain
                    that there is no connection between the names which the letters bore in
                    Phoenicia and the original object of which the Egyptian character is the debased
                    representation. Thus the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet (corresponding
                    to the Hebrew <hi rend="italic">aleph)</hi> was named from its fancied
                    resemblance to an ox’s head, the second (Hebrew <hi rend="italic">beth)</hi> to
                    a house, and so on. But the symbol which strangely seemed to the Phoenicians
                    like an ox is only the form, rapidly drawn, of an eagle; <hi rend="italic"
                    >beth</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> in like manner, is the
                    quickly-drawn figure of a crane. It would seem, then, that the Phoenicians
                    borrowed sound and symbol, but no name. They cared nothing for the history of
                    the symbols; and when they found it convenient to have a name for each symbol
                    they chose some object whose name began with the letter in question; and we
                    should have said that it was totally impossible that any similarity in form
                    between the letter and the object whose name it borrowed could have helped to
                    give currency to the nomenclature, did we not see evidence of similar and
                    apparently equally impossible fancies in the names of the constellations, let
                    the origin of those names be what it may.</p>
                <p>Such, very briefly traced, seems to have been the origin of the Phoenician
                    alphabet, the parent of almost every alphabet, properly so called, existing on
                    the earth. For the main ramifications of this alphabet in subsequent times we
                    cannot do better than translate the summary of an author already often referred
                    to, Μ. François Lenormant. He distinguishes (p. 110) five main stems. These
                    are—</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Semitic</hi> stem, wherein the values of the letters
                    have remained exactly the same as those of the Phoenicians, except in a few
                    derived alphabets framed in Persia and the countries immediately adjacent, which
                    being employed to write Indo-European languages, turn the soft breathings of the
                    Phoenician into genuine vowels. This stem subdivides itself into two main
                    branches—the Hebraeo-Samaritan and the Aramaic.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Central</hi> stem, whose province includes Greece, Asia
                    Minor, and Italy. The transformation of the symbols of the smooth, and even of
                    the rough, breathings into symbols of vowels is here the invariable rule. This
                    stem contains first the different varieties of the Hellenic alphabet, then the
                    alphabets derived from the Greek, including three families—the Albanian, Asiatic
                    (taking Asia in the same sense as the old Greeks did), and the Italian. In the
                    Asiatic family we distinguish two groups—one for the Phrygian alphabet only,
                    which is made up of elements whose origin is exclusively Greek, the other
                    containing the Lycian and Carian, where these elements are mixed up with
                    Cypriote<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The only two
                    alphabets, in the strict sense of the term, which Μ. Lenormant cannot classify
                    as of Phoenician origin are the Cypriote and the Persian cuneiform—the former
                    still imperfectly deciphered, but seemingly to some extent syllabic; the latter
                    perhaps not pure alphabetic, but retaining certain ideograms.</p></note>
                    characters. The Italian family must also be subdivided into an Etruscan group
                    and a Latin group, between which stands the Faliscan alphabet, of a mixed
                    character.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Western</hi> stem, containing the systems of writing
                    which resulted from the spread of the alphabet by the colonists of Tyre among
                    the indigenous inhabitants of ancient Spain. This stem reckons but one single
                    family. It has, as that which precedes it, for its fundamental character the
                    change of the value of the Phoenician breathings. But the direction in which the
                    forms of the letters vary is signally different. . . .</p>

                    runes of the Teutonic and Scandinavian peoples, who were settled at a particular
                    epoch in the north of Europe, but had arrived from Asia, where they still lived
                    during a part of historic time, and where they must have had imparted to them
                    the alphabet produced by the Phoenicians. Some elements in the runic writing
                    seem to point to a direct reception of the writing from the seamen of Canaan;
                    others, on the contrary, bear a certain stamp of Greek influence. . . .</p>

                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">Indo-Homerite</hi> stem, distinguished by the appearance
                    of a new principle, the expression of vowel sounds by means of conventional
                    adjuncts attached to the symbol of the consonant, and thus sometimes
                    considerably modifying its shape. The place of its origin seems to have been
                    southern Arabia. From thence it has radiated on the one side to Africa, where
                    the Abyssinian and the African systems form a separate family with the
                    Himyaritic, or alphabet of the old inhabitants of Yemen; on the other side to
                    Ariana, where a special form of writing established itself; and to India, whose
                    most ancient alphabet, Mâgadhî, now referred by A. Weber to a Phoenician origin,
                    has given birth to an enormous list of derivatives, which can be classified
                    among six families—Devanâgarî, Pâlî, Dravidian, Transgangetic, Oceanic, and
                    Thibetan—which we here enumerate in their chronological order of descent.</p>
                <p>It will of course be observed that this classification of alphabets runs entirely
                    counter to the universally-accepted classification of languages into certain
                    well-recognised groups under three main heads—Indo-European, Semitic, and that
                    family which, rather because its members differ from the two first-named than
                    from any especial bond of union among themselves, is called Turanian. This is in
                    nowise surprising. There is no necessary connection whatever between the sound
                    and the symbol which signifies it —between the language and the alphabet. The
                    languages of nearly all Europe are Indo-European (or Aryan, as they are
                    sometimes called); the alphabets are universally Semitic —that is the fact,
                    explain it as we may. In fact, if we wish to maintain that sound and symbol
                    correspond, so that the second is the only natural exponent of the first, we
                    must form two hypotheses which refute themselves— first, that it was possible
                    that any race of men, when they first felt the need of an alphabet, deliberately
                    set themselves to form their letters so as to represent the different positions
                    of the organs of speech as each sound was produced; secondly, that such forms
                    could have been exactly preserved through long lapse of time, so as to convey to
                    subsequent generations exactly the same idea as they gave to their inventors.
                    But each supposition is clearly impossible. An alphabet so formed would also be
                    an artificial alphabet, such as could never have entered the minds of men who
                    needed to supply just their actual wants as they arose, not to construct a
                    scientific table of signs to denote all possible sounds. But the construction of
                    such a pictorial alphabet as we have supposed is quite possible, and it has
                    actually been formed most ingeniously by Mr Melville Bell. In his system, which
                    he calls “Visible Speech,” consonants are denoted by curved lines, which
                    represent the position of the tongue or lips in their formation. For example, in
                    forming the gutturals <hi rend="italic">k, g, ng,</hi> the back of the tongue is
                    raised, and this is expressed by the curve C; in pronouncing <hi rend="italic"
                    >y,</hi> the front of the tongue is arched, and this is denoted by &gt; in
                    pronouncing dentals, the point of the tongue is raised, and this is expressed by
                    O; in sounding labials, the lips are closed, and this is denoted by Q; where the
                    passage of the mouth is completely closed by the symbolised organ (as in <hi
                    rend="italic">k, g, t, d, p,</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi>), the ends of the
                    curve are shut by a connecting line— thus Ç| denotes <hi rend="italic">k;</hi>
                    the consonants which are voice articulations (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., in
                    producing which the <hi rend="italic">chordoe vocales</hi> vibrate, and so
                    produce voice), as <hi rend="italic">g, d, b,</hi> &amp;c., are further
                    distin-tinguished by a short straight line within the curve, the physiological
                    sign which is chosen (conventionally, it must be allowed) to represent voice
                    being (I) a straight line; and the other distinguishing marks of the consonants
                    are similarly expressed either by added marks or by slight modifications of the
                    primary curve. Equally ingeniously, the vowels are expressed by the straight
                    line which is the sign of voice, a subordinate symbol, or “definer,” being added
                    to denote the part of the mouth which modifies the vowel— <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> a hook or a solid point at the top or bottom of the vowel-line, a
                    bar across the line to express that the lips are contracted or drawn across the
                    aperture of the mouth, &amp;c., &amp;c. We need not enter further into the
                    minutiae of the system; enough has been said to show the principle on which it
                    is formed. It is obvious that there would be no greater difficulty in teaching
                    this alphabet to a child than in teaching it <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, except that the number of
                    symbols is greater, because one is provided for every sound in the language,
                    which our alphabet certainly fails to do; still, to learn either our alphabet or
                    “visible speech” must for a child be simply an effort of memory. And one great
                    practical gain which would be derived from the general adoption of such a system
                    is the ease with which foreign languages could be mastered. The great difficulty
                    in learning to speak a foreign language does not consist in the mere mastering
                    so many declensions; it lies in the fact that two alphabets may be composed of
                    exactly the same symbols, and yet many of these symbols may express to the two
                    nations quite different sounds. This is a preliminary difficulty which must be
                    mastered at once; and it would be immensely lessened if such dissimilar
                    sounds—as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the German, French, and English <hi
                    rend="italic">u—</hi> were not all presented to the learner under the same
                    symbol. It seems certain that, with the lapse of time and the progress of
                    invention, the intercourse between nations must be largely increased; and the
                    need of some more perfect instrument of speech between them must increase
                    proportionately. But in spite of the obvious gains, it is utopian to suppose
                    that the world will ever be converted to a system of universal writing; and the
                    real and immense gain of such a method is the power which it gives to a
                    linguistic inquirer to denote accurately on paper the exact sounds heard in any
                    dialect spoken in any part of the world, civilised or uncivilised; for it is as
                    competent to register the click of the Hottentot as the most subtle vowel sound
                    of Europe. With our present alphabet it is utterly impossible to represent
                    adequately the strange sounds of some out-of-the-way dialect (which for students
                    of language may be as important as the literary speech) in such a way as to be
                    generally intelligible, because there often is no symbol to correspond exactly,
                    and naturally no two inquirers agree upon the nearest out of the existing
                    symbols. The science of language is therefore greatly indebted to Mr Bell for
                    providing so effective a method for preserving for ever those dialectic
                    peculiarities which are vanishing with startling rapidity in these days of
                    constant communication between different parts of a country. Another system,
                    equally valuable scientifically, has been invented by the eminent philologer, Mr
                    Alexander J. Ellis. In his “Palaeotype” only the ordinary symbols are employed,
                    but they are printed in different ways to denote different sounds—sometimes as
                    capitals, sometimes in italics, sometimes turned upside down; so that, despite
                    the familiarity of the letters, a page of palaeotype is at least as appalling to
                    the uninitiated as the curves and lines of “visible speech.”</p>
                <p>We may proceed to trace the variations from the Phoenician alphabet to our own,
                    down the central stem of Greece and Italy. The Phoenician alphabet consisted of
                    twenty-eight letters, which for convenience we may call by the names of their
                    Hebrew equivalents. These were (1) Aleph, (2) Beth, (3) Gimel, (4) Daleth, (5)
                    He, (6) Vav, (7) Zayin, (8) Cheth, (9) Teth, (10) Yodh, (11) Kaph, (12) Lamedh,
                    (13) Mem, (14) Nun, (15) Samekh, (16) Ayin, (17) Pe, (18) Tsadhe, (19) Koph,
                    (20) Resh, (21) Shin, (22) Tav. None of these were vowel sounds. Aleph was the
                    lightest guttural or rather faucal sound, being pronounced below the guttural
                    point at the very top of the larynx: it can have been barely audible even before
                    a vowel. He corresponded nearly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n646/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0646-0609"/> to our <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> Cheth was a
                    strongly-marked <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi> a continuous guttural sound produced
                    at the back of the palate. Ayin represents a faucal sound peculiar to the
                    Semitic race, varying between an evanescent breathing and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> rolled in the throat.</p>
                <p>The Phoenicians employed hardly any vowel signs: in Hebrew the three principal
                    sounds <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, <hi rend="italic">i, u</hi> (see article A)
                    were sometimes expressed in writing, and long <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> were denoted, not by special signs, but by consonants akin
                    to them, <hi rend="italic">yodh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vav: a</hi> was
                    regularly omitted except at the end of a word, where it was denoted by He and
                    sometimes by Aleph. In fact, in all Semitic languages the practice was to ignore
                    vowels in writing, leaving it to the reader to fill in, according to the
                    context, the unvarying framework of consonantal sounds: the Hebrew vowel-points
                    were a later invention, rendered necessary when the language had ceased to be
                    spoken.</p>
                <p>When the Greeks received the Phoenician alphabet it is obvious that they must
                    have made considerable changes in the values of the symbols. Several of them
                    would be unnecessary, for they had no sounds in their language to correspond to
                    them: while for other most important sounds, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    vowels, no symbol was provided. It is clear how imperfect any previous alphabet
                    of the Greeks must have been when they adopted in its stead another so foreign
                    to the genius of their language, which developed the vowels and marked strongly
                    the momentary consonants and nasals, but rejected as far as possible the
                    continuous consonants, both palatal and labial, and even under many
                    circumstances the dental <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> the one sibilant they
                    employed. But they ingeniously adopted the strange signs to new ends. Aleph, He,
                    and Ayin were turned without difficulty into α, ε, and o .∙ Yodh became ι, as it
                    seems that the semi-vowel <hi rend="italic">y</hi> had totally disappeared from
                    Greece even at that early period: on the same principle Vav might have served to
                    express <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> although apparently the <hi rend="italic"
                    >w</hi>-sound was still sufficiently common to require the retention of Vav with
                    its consonantal value. But from what source they took their <hi rend="italic"
                    >upsilon</hi> cannot be known with certainty. Professor Key thinks that it is
                    the Hebrew form of Ayin, which differs much in shape from the nearly perfect
                    circle of the old Phoenician. This is possible enough, for the sound of Ayin was
                    not more like <hi rend="italic">o</hi> than <hi rend="italic">u;</hi> and if the
                    Greeks knew the two forms, it is not likely that they may have taken both. On
                    the other hand, it is equally possible that <hi rend="italic">v</hi> may be a
                    remnant of an earlier native alphabet. Among the consonants <hi rend="italic"
                    >β,</hi> γ, δ, <hi rend="italic">κ,</hi> λ, <hi rend="italic">μ,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">v, π, ρ, τ</hi> were borrowed with little change of form, and
                    probably of value. And these letters (with σ and the vowels already mentioned)
                    are stated by tradition to have been the only ones brought to Greece from
                    Phoenicia by Cadmus, others having been added by Palamedes, Simonides, or
                    Epicharmus; but which were the letters added by each of these is a question on
                    which the different authorities do not agree; and the incorrectness of most of
                    them is proved by the letters being found in Greek inscriptions before the time
                    of their supposed inventor. In fact, all tradition on this point is worthless,
                    unless it is borne out by inscriptions. It is at least probable that the whole
                    alphabet was borrowed at one time, for all, or nearly all, the characters occur
                    on the oldest inscriptions we possess. Thus on inscriptions of Thera dating from
                    Olympiad 40 (see Franz, <hi rend="italic">Epigraphice Graeca,</hi> pp. 51-59;
                    Kirchhoff, <hi rend="italic">Studien zur Geschichte des Griechischen
                    Alphabets,</hi> p. 41), we find Cheth in the form Q <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi>
                    denoting mainly the rough breathing <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> but also applied
                    to denote <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> as it afterwards did regularly by the name
                    <hi rend="italic">Eta:</hi> Teth occurs as φ, nearly the later <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theta;</hi> and Koph as φ , <hi rend="italic">Koppa,</hi> a symbol which was
                    once current throughout Greece, and remained universally as the numeral 90,
                    though as a letter it was retained only by the Dorians, and passed with the
                    Doric alphabet into Italy as Q. It may be observed that in this alphabet, and in
                    some later ones of Crete, Corinth, and Corcyra, Iota appears not as a straight
                    line, but in many curved shapes, approximating much nearer to the old
                    Phoenician; and the same is true of Pi, which has the top rounded like a crook.
                    We have then left only the four sibilants, Zayin, Samekh, Tsadhe, and Shin.
                    These are believed to have had the values <hi rend="italic">dz, s, ts, sh</hi>
                    respectively. We have already said that the Greeks had no great affection for
                    sibilants; witness the manner in which <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> was constantly
                    dropped, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in γ∈v∈oς for γεreσ-os. It was therefore
                    not to be expected that they could employ all the wealth of the Phoenicians; and
                    one symbol (Tsadhe) appears in no Greek alphabet. The name, however, recalls the
                    name <hi rend="italic">Zeta;</hi> but the shape of Zeta (always °¾°*) is
                    unquestionably that of Zayin; and its place in the alphabet agrees to this. It
                    seems, therefore, most probable that the Greeks confounded together the two
                    compound sounds <hi rend="italic">dz</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ts,</hi> and
                    kept but one symbol, perhaps with the name of the other (Tsadhe), because it was
                    most like that of the neighbouring letters Eta and Theta. This confusion of the
                    two sounds seems the more probable when we remember that no symbol was required
                    for the compound <hi rend="italic">ts</hi> at the time when a special symbol for
                    <hi rend="italic">ps</hi> was added, and that for <hi rend="italic">ks</hi>
                    (another analogous compound) perhaps revived. There is also much uncertainty
                    with regard to the relations of Samekh and Shin in their Greek dress. <hi
                    rend="italic">Xi</hi> ( = <hi rend="italic">ks</hi>) occupies the place of
                    Samekh, <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi> of Shin. One form of Samekh seems
                    unquestionably to have furnished that of the Greek Σ (see the forms, p. 600);
                    another <hi rend="italic">'S.</hi> is exactly the Greek <hi rend="italic">ξ</hi>
                    of all the inscriptions. Sigma had the sound (<hi rend="italic">s</hi>) of
                    Samekh, and cannot be shown ever to have had the sound (<hi rend="italic"
                    >sh</hi>) of Shin. Two names were preserved among the Greeks, <hi rend="italic"
                    >sigma</hi> and <hi rend="italic">san.</hi> Herodotus (i. 139) speaks of the
                    “same letter which the Dorians call <hi rend="italic">σάν,</hi> the Ionians <hi
                    rend="italic">σίγμα;”</hi> and though <hi rend="italic">san</hi> was no letter
                    of the Ionic alphabet, the compound <hi rend="italic">sampi ( = σav</hi> + πι)
                    denoted 900. The name <hi rend="italic">san</hi> is obviously the Semitic <hi
                    rend="italic">shin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sin:</hi> it is just possible that
                    <hi rend="italic">σίγμα</hi> may be an attempt to turn <hi rend="italic"
                    >samekh</hi> into a form which should explain its meaning to Greek ears. The
                    oldest Greek alphabets known to us— those of Thera, Melos, Crete, and the
                    earlier forms of those of Argos, Corinth, and Corcyra—have the form to denote
                    <hi rend="italic">s,—</hi> that is, the equivalent of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shin.</hi> It seems fair to infer that this was originally the case in the
                    other alphabets also. Then this symbol was dropped by degrees to avoid confusion
                    with <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> while one form of <hi rend="italic">samekh,</hi>
                    with the name <hi rend="italic">sigma,</hi> was introduced into its place:
                    another form was kept in its old place to denote the compound <hi rend="italic"
                    >ks (xi).</hi></p>
                <p>We now come to the apparently non-Phoenician letters of the Greek alphabet, <hi
                    rend="italic">φ, χ, ψ,</hi> ω. Of υ we have already spoken: we may add that its
                    sound was not a pure <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> but modified, perhaps as is the
                    German <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> This appears from the fact that, when the
                    Romans borrowed Greek words in the later times of the republic (when Roman taste
                    had grown more scrupulous), they did not use their own symbol <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> to denote the Greek <hi rend="italic">upsilon</hi> (as their forefathers
                    had done), but together with the sound borrowed the symbol also: which clearly
                    shows that the sound of <hi rend="italic">upsilon</hi> was different from the
                    ordinary <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> We now take the aspirates <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ</hi> and χ. It is most probable that the sounds of the Greek aspirates χ, <hi
                    rend="italic">θ, φ,</hi> were not those of the German <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi>
                    and the English <hi rend="italic">th</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f:</hi> that is,
                    they were probably not continuous consonants, but momentary <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n647/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0647-0610"/> sounds, followed in each case by a slight but
                    distinctly audible breath; so that χ might be represented in English characters
                    by <hi rend="italic">k'h,</hi> though the following breath is not so distinct as
                    an English <hi rend="italic">h,—</hi> if it were, we should have a compound, not
                    a simple sound. Now two of these aspirates were actually written in the oldest
                    alphabets KH and p H <hi rend="italic">(pi</hi> having the right down-stroke
                    much shorter than the left): for the dental the single symbol <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ,</hi> borrowed from the Phoenician, sufficed. Afterwards the symbols <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> (variants φ and + ) were taken
                    to supply the place of these compounds, from what source cannot be certainly
                    known; but it is not impossible that they may have been characters of an older
                    Greek alphabet which originally had the values <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">k.</hi> This draws some probability from the history of <hi
                    rend="italic">φ.</hi> That letter was originally written and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ξ,</hi> of which we have already spoken, written as KΣ (or KM). But each of
                    these also appears as ΦΣ and XΣ; so that here at least <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>
                    and χ appear as no more than <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >k:</hi> the compound ΦΣ remained permanently in the Western alphabets. It is to
                    Epicharmus that tradition (here with some probability) ascribes the
                    establishment of <hi rend="italic">ψ</hi> in the alphabet. The history of.ω is
                    closely connected with that of <hi rend="italic">η.</hi> At an early period,
                    certainly before the 40th Olympiad, in the eastern part of Hellas an attempt was
                    made to distinguish the different kinds of <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> The symbol
                    e had hitherto denoted both ε and the diphthong ει, where the ι was probably not
                    a much more important sound than the <hi rend="italic">y</hi> — <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in our <hi rend="italic">day.</hi> The habit of writing
                    the two symbols came in late in the Ionic alphabet, and so spread through
                    Greece. But at the earlier time of which we speak the symbol H began to denote
                    some <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> It is commonly supposed that this was long <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> as distinguished from epsilon, which, by the way, does not
                    mean <hi rend="italic">short</hi><hi rend="italic">e,</hi> but <hi rend="italic"
                    >“e</hi> unaccompanied,” perhaps by that after sound of <hi rend="italic">ι</hi>
                    mentioned above, though a different reason is commonly given for the name. It
                    seems very strange that the Greeks should have introduced symbols to express
                    long <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and o, and none to mark the length of the other
                    vowels, which must have been just as urgently needed: surely this would have
                    been done at Athens at the time of the formal introduction of the Ionian
                    alphabet. Again, there are a great many recognisable varieties of sound which
                    border closely on pure <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o</hi>
                    (but none of importance near <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >u),</hi> and such varieties are clearly marked in the south of Europe now. For
                    these two separate reasons, it seems at least more probable that <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> was adopted to express a sound the same, or nearly the
                    same, as the open <hi rend="italic">e</hi> of the Italians. For the same
                    reasons, it seems probable that ω was taken not to denote long o, but a more
                    open sound; perhaps something between open <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and the
                    English <hi rend="italic">au.</hi> The form Ω is of doubtful origin. It is found
                    in an alphabet of Miletus of about Olympiad 60; not earlier. It looks like a
                    conscious modification of O.</p>
                <p>Greek writing in the earliest times was from right to left, following the example
                    of Phoenicia: several specimens of this still exist. The more convenient
                    practice of writing from left to right soon became universal. It was preceded,
                    however, by an intermediate method, in which the direction of the lines was
                    alternately right to left and left to right, so that it was not necessary to
                    carry the eye back, as with us, from the end of one line to the beginning of the
                    next. This was called <hi rend="italic">βουστροφηδόν,</hi> because the lines
                    were made in the same way as the furrows by oxen in ploughing.</p>
                <p>Kirchhoff distinguishes two main divisions of Greek alphabets—the East and the
                    West; not that this geographical distribution is exact, but it is the most
                    convenient. The eastern includes first the alphabets of the towns of Asia</p>
                <p>Minor—Halicarnassus, Ephesus, Teos, Miletus, Colophon, and Rhodes, which,
                    agreeing essentially, became that Ionic alphabet that was adopted at Athens 463
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and is the Greek alphabet with which we are
                    familiar; secondly, those of the Aegean islands—Thera, Melos, Crete, Paros,
                    Siphnos, Thasos, Naxos,—in which Ω does not stand for Omega, but occasionally
                    appears as well as <hi rend="italic">o</hi> for Omicron, and there are other
                    minute differences in the shape of the letters; thirdly, some of the alphabets
                    of the mainland of Greece, which have a closer affinity to the Ionic than to
                    their neighbours, viz., the old one of Attica, down to O1. 94—Argos, Corinth and
                    its colonies, Corcyra, and even Syracuse. The western division includes the
                    remainder of the towns of Greece proper and their Sicilian and Italian colonies;
                    these are marked by peculiar variations of certain characters, especially <hi
                    rend="italic">g, e, h, th, l, r,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> by the use
                    of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> as the aspirate only, by the absence of <hi
                    rend="italic">omega,</hi> and by the universal application of the symbol ∖∣∕ or
                    to denote, not <hi rend="italic">ps,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi> whilst
                    X or +, the symbol of <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> in the eastern alphabets, here
                    denotes <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Compare with this last variation what we have
                    said above of the use of XΣ to express X: there can be little doubt that it was
                    from the occurrence of X in this collocation, and no other, that this new value
                    for it arose, and Σ was dropped. It is significant that in the old Latin
                    alphabet XS appear instead of X. The difference in value of ψ in the eastern and
                    western alphabets is perplexing: it seems that in one or the other the original
                    value must have been consciously changed, but it is not easy to say in which.
                    The most important alphabet of this group for our purpose is that of the
                    Chalcidian colonies of Sicily and the west coast of Italy—Cumse, Neapolis,
                    &amp;c.—because from this was derived the Latin alphabet, the direct progenitor
                    of our own. It is distinguished from others of the same class by the rounded
                    form of the Gamma (2, peculiar form of the Lambda , by the very old Mu (∕w), and
                    by a rounded Sigma , though it has also the two other ordinary forms ⅛ and Σ: in
                    common with some other western alphabets, it has a double <hi rend="italic"
                    >rho</hi> (P and R). (See p. 600.)</p>
                <p>From this Chalcidian alphabet it seems clear that all the Italian alphabets were
                    derived. They fall into two families, which differ from each other considerably,
                    but principally in the loss of old letters and the insertion of new—differences
                    which do not militate against their common origin, but show the cause of their
                    separate development. The first family contains the Etruscan, Umbrian, and Oscan
                    alphabets; the second the Latin and Faliscan. Into the peculiarities of the
                    members of the first group we do not propose to enter at length: they agree in
                    the total rejection of O and X, and the addition of a strange symbol to denote
                    the <hi rend="italic">f</hi> sound, <hi rend="italic">vau</hi> being retained
                    with a slightly modified form for <hi rend="italic">v:</hi> the Etruscan retains
                    the symbols φ and V which the other two dropped, and the Etruscan and Umbrian
                    agree in rejecting the soft mutes. The Umbrian, however, has a new symbol for a
                    modified <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> peculiar to itself, and also for a modified
                    <hi rend="italic">k;</hi> the Oscan has new symbols for a modified <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and in general shows a
                    difference in the shape of its characters from all the other Italian dialects,
                    which does not seem due to any other foreign influence so much as to its own
                    individuality. These three languages are all written from right to left, in
                    which the Faliscan agrees with them: the Latin alone, from the earliest time of
                    which we have any records, was written from left to right; but there can be
                    little doubt that it did not originally differ from its fellows, but changed at
                    a later time, just as the Greek alphabet itself <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n648/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0648-0611"/> had done. The fact that X, found in the Latin and
                    Faliscan alphabets, has the value of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and not of <hi
                    rend="italic">ch,</hi> and that V, as already mentioned, is found with the value
                    of <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> in Etruscan, shows that the common source of these
                    five alphabets was a western, not an eastern Greek alphabet; and the rounded
                    form of C, and the peculiar L (V, not ∕∖) limit the choice to the Chalcidian
                    family. The points in which the Latin differs from the Chalcidian alphabet of
                    Cumae, from which it was probably derived through commercial intercourse,
                    lie—</p>
                <p>(1.) In the application of the symbol <hi rend="italic">vau</hi> (F), to denote
                    not the <hi rend="italic">V</hi> but the <hi rend="italic">f</hi> sound, which
                    was probably strange to the Greeks.</p>
                <p>(2,) In allowing K to fall almost out of use—it was employed only in
                    abbreviations, such as the first letter of a praenomen, as Kaeso, or for
                    Kalendae, &amp;c.—and employing C instead, which had of course in the present
                    Greek alphabet the power of <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> This change may point to a
                    time when the distinction of the sounds <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> was obliterated, to be afterwards restored.</p>
                <p>(3.) In the formation of the new symbol G— <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> C with a
                    distinguishing line—to mark the soft gutturals, when the want of a distinctive
                    symbol was again felt. This was some time in the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.;</hi> but instead of replacing K for the hard guttural sound, they
                    preferred to leave C in its old place, but with a new value, <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while the
                    modified form G was inserted into the place of I (Z), which may have been taken
                    by the Romans (as it certainly was found in the other Italian alphabets), but
                    which fell out of use absolutely without any record.</p>
                <p>(4.) In absence of the aspirates ψ, φ, and φ: these sounds were not natural to
                    the Roman tongue, and therefore the symbols were never regularly received into
                    their alphabet, though they were taken to represent numerals. Their forms,
                    however, were much altered, and so in process of time they became confused with
                    other letters: thus ψ denoted 50; but it came to be written J_, and so naturally
                    passed into the quite meaningless L: φ denoted 10, but being too cumbrous to
                    write, the circle was dropped, and the cross (X) alone remained. A variant form
                    of the same letter (O) seems to have originally represented 100, and either to
                    have been shortened into the common form C, or C superseded it as being the
                    first letter of <hi rend="italic">centum.</hi> φ was taken for 1000, but for
                    convenience of writing it was broken up into CID, and this was the more easily
                    done because the parts were characters in use; but this symbol also was replaced
                    by M, the first letter of <hi rend="italic">mille.</hi> It is probable that φ
                    was simply divided, and the half of it (D) then stood for half of 1000, or 500;
                    and half of X, ten, became V, five. Neither D nor V have any other propriety as
                    symbols.</p>
                <p>(5.) In the addition, in the 1st century B.C., of the two symbols Y and Z after X
                    (which had long been the last letter of the alphabet), to express the Greek
                    sounds υ and Z. In borrowed words these in earlier times had been roughly
                    denoted by <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ss;</hi> but in
                    Cicero’s day greater precision was desired; and not being able to compound two
                    characters of their own to denote the strange sound (as they did for the
                    aspirates <hi rend="italic">kh, th, ph,</hi> formerly denoted only by <hi
                    rend="italic">k, t,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi>), they took sound and symbol together, so that Φpυγ∈ς appeared, not as
                    <hi rend="italic">Bruges,</hi> but as <hi rend="italic">Phryges</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">τραπεζίτης</hi> ceased to be <hi
                    rend="italic">tarpessita,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sona</hi> became <hi
                    rend="italic">sona, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>The Latin alphabet agrees with the Chalcidian in the retention of koppa (? ); the
                    downward stroke became by degrees more oblique. This symbol had a much wider use
                    in Latin than it had in any Greek language: it was needed to express a modified
                    <hi rend="italic">k</hi>-sound which the Latins liked, wherein a slight <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> sound was heard after the <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> This
                    sound was distasteful to the Greeks, and consequently they changed this <hi
                    rend="italic">kw</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">qu)</hi> into <hi rend="italic"
                    >p;</hi> so also did the other Italians (compare <hi rend="italic"
                    >equos,</hi><hi rend="italic">ίππος,</hi><hi rend="italic">Epona,</hi> &amp;c.);
                    but the Romans liked it. and therefore, alone in Italy, kept the? to denote it.
                    It is true that the Q was generally followed by a written <hi rend="italic"
                    >u,</hi> though not always in the older inscriptions; but it was fully
                    recognised that this <hi rend="italic">u</hi> was not a real letter. It was only
                    a symbol expressing further, and somewhat unnecessarily, the indistinct
                    after-sound which made Q different from K; it would have been more logical to
                    have written Q alone, as was actually attempted under the empire, where we find
                    on inscriptions forms such as <hi rend="italic">qis, qidem, qaerella;</hi> but
                    this never became general. The Latin and Chalcidian alphabets are again at one
                    in not having the symbol M for s, differing in this respect from the alphabets
                    of South Italy, and also from the Etruscan and Umbrian, which had both forms.
                    Lastly, the Chalcidian (as we saw) had two forms for <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> P
                    and R; of these the Latin chose the last, and generally employed the first for
                    <hi rend="italic">p;</hi> though for that letter the genuine Greek form p also
                    appears rarely.</p>
                <p>The Romans did not retain the Greek names for the characters of the alphabet. The
                    vowels were known by their sounds only. The momentary sounds and <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> were denoted by their own sound followed by a vowel, as <hi
                    rend="italic">be,</hi><hi rend="italic">ce,</hi><hi rend="italic">de, ge,
                    pe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">te,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">ka, ha; q,</hi> as
                    we saw, had sufficient vowel sound to float it; on the other hand, the
                    continuous consonants were preceded by the vowel, as <hi rend="italic">ef, el,
                    em,</hi><hi rend="italic">en,</hi><hi rend="italic">er,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >es</hi><hi rend="italic">; x</hi> was called <hi rend="italic">ix.</hi> The
                    difference in the names of the consonants obviously was caused by their nature:
                    momentary sounds are produced by a complete closure and opening of the organs
                    required in each case; when this opening is made, the organs are so placed as to
                    form a vowel, which naturally is produced by the remnant of sound required for
                    the consonant; whereas a vowel cannot be produced before any one of these sounds
                    without conscious effort: hence it was simpler to call <hi rend="italic">k,
                    ka,</hi> than to call it <hi rend="italic">ak.</hi> But the continuous sounds
                    are pronounced when the necessary organs only approximate more or less closely
                    to each other; the channel through which the sound passes from the larynx to the
                    lips is never closed altogether, and by reason of this slightly open position a
                    certain amount of vowel sound tends to escape just as the organs are drawing
                    together to produce the consonant, and thus is heard before it; but to sound a
                    vowel after one of these consonants the organs must be intentionally put into
                    the proper position. Thus, then, exactly the same principle —the conscious or
                    unconscious striving for ease of articulation—produces exactly opposite results
                    in the case of the momentary and the continuous consonants. The same reason
                    caused a different vowel to be employed for <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> from that which is used for the other letters. In sounding
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the organs are in nearly the same position as in
                    sounding these two gutturals, only a little more open; whereas the position of
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is more nearly that of all the other consonants. It
                    must of course be remembered that a Roman, if he had wished to speak of his <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a b</hi> c, would not have said, as we do, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a-bee-see,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">ah-bay-kay.</hi></p>
                <p>The arrangement of the letters of the alphabet has caused much ingenious
                    speculation.· It has been more than once pointed out (as by Prof. Key, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Alphabet,</hi> p. 28) that there are certainly traces of
                    regularity of arrangement. The three soft momentary sounds <hi rend="italic">b,
                    g, d,</hi> were placed together; and it is possible that <hi rend="italic">p, k,
                    t</hi> (if denoted by Pe, Koph, Tau), may have once been together, and separated
                    by later intrusions; <hi rend="italic">l,m,n</hi> have an affinity more apparent
                    than real, which was perpetuated by their meaningless designation as "liquids;”
                    still, the appearance is sufficient to justify the idea that they may have been
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n649/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0649-0612"/> purposely put together. It has been suggested
                    that the alphabet was at first composed of “four quaternions” of letters, each
                    headed by a vowel, and the scattered position of the vowels lends itself to this
                    arrangement; but it must be remembered that the arrangement of the European
                    alphabets is certainly the same as that of Phoenicia, and in the Phoenician
                    there were breathings but no vowel symbols. Besides, the remaining letters are
                    just as necessary as any sixteen which we might so arrange, and to all
                    appearance just as ancient. The author of the <hi rend="italic">New
                    Cratylus,</hi> indeed (p. 170, ed. 3), actually drew up his list of fours: the
                    three soft momentanes headed by <hi rend="italic">aleph;</hi> then came <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> followed by <hi rend="italic">vau, cheth,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">teth,</hi> oddly grouped as aspirates; then the three “liquids,”
                    with <hi rend="italic">samekh</hi> behind them; and lastly, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρe, koph,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tau,</hi> under the care of <hi
                    rend="italic">ayin.</hi> This, of course, renders it necessary to “omit <hi
                    rend="italic">caph,</hi> which is only a softened form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >coph,</hi> the liquid <hi rend="italic">resh,</hi> and the semi-vowel <hi
                    rend="italic">yodh,</hi> which are of more recent introduction.” Also it is
                    “quite certain that at the first there was only one sibilant, <hi rend="italic"
                    >samekh.”</hi> In this way Dr Donaldson satisfies himself that the “original
                    Semitic alphabet contained only sixteen letters.” We give this futile attempt at
                    arrangement with no wish to sneer at a philologer who did good work in his day,
                    but simply to show the arbitrary nature of all such attempts, resting as they
                    must do simply on internal evidence. If we bear in mind the history of the
                    derivation of the Phoenician alphabet, as we have attempted to give it, from the
                    Egyptian hieratic, we shall conclude that it is hardly probable that symbols
                    borrowed for practical uses should have been arranged upon any scientific
                    method; that chance guided the general arrangement, though a few sounds
                    obviously similar may have been put intentionally together. No argument can be
                    drawn (as by Rödiger in his Hebrew Grammar) from the juxtaposition of two
                    letters meaning a hand <hi rend="italic">(yodh</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >kaph),</hi> two meaning a head <hi rend="italic">(koph</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">resh),</hi> &amp;c.; reasons have been given above for believing
                    that these names have no relation to the original import of the signs, but were
                    merely fanciful analogies drawn by the Phoenicians themselves; and it seems as
                    possible that the juxtaposition may have suggested the idea of the names as that
                    the names caused the arrangement. But if the argument be sound, it is valid
                    against the supposition that the order was fixed throughout on scientific
                    grounds.</p>
                <p>It is quite certain that the Teutonic tribes of northwestern Europe possessed
                    characters of some sort before they received the Greek or Latin alphabets. These
                    characters are generally called <hi rend="italic">runes,</hi> and have been the
                    subject of some sound scholarship and much baseless speculation. They may be
                    divided into three main classes —the Anglo-Saxon, the German, and the
                    Scandinavian; each of these contain a number of lists of characters, which,
                    however, do not differ from each other more than the Greek alphabets; and there
                    is so much likeness in the whole family that we may infer a common origin for
                    all. The term <hi rend="italic">rune</hi> is recognised as the name of a German
                    letter by Venantius Fortunatus at the beginning of the seventh century, in the
                    lines—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Barbara fraxineis pingatur rhuna tabellis; </l>

                    The meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">run</hi> in Anglo-Saxon is a “secret;”
                    and the verb <hi rend="italic">rynan,</hi> which is derived from the same, means
                    “to whisper”—the same verb which appears in the now disused phrase, to "round in
                    the ear.” <hi rend="italic">Rûna</hi> denoted a magician; the word is contained
                    in the German <hi rend="italic">alruna,</hi> the well-known designation of those
                    prophetesses whom the German tribes venerated, which appears corrupted by
                    Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Germ.</hi> c. viii.) into <hi rend="italic"
                    >aurinia.</hi> There is sufficient evidence to show that the knowledge of these
                    runes was confined to a small class; that they were used as magical characters,
                    and also as means of augury. It was for this reason undoubtedly that they were
                    generally proscribed on the introduction of Christianity; and the reception of
                    the Latin characters by the Anglo-Saxons was regarded as important as their
                    reception of the Christian doctrines.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to believe that the barbarous inhabitants of the German forests
                    should have worked out for themselves a genuine alphabet before they came into
                    intercourse with the civilised nations of the south. When we remember the long
                    process through which a pure alphabet was reached by the highly-developed
                    nations which dwelt on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, it is utterly
                    incredible that such success should have been achieved, as it were, <hi
                    rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">saltum,</hi> under so much more
                    unfavourable circumstances in the West. It may be asserted with some confidence
                    that if the runes were genuine alphabets (which there seems no reason to deny),
                    they must have been derived from the Phoenicians in process of commerce. There
                    is quite sufficient similarity in several of the characters to make this view
                    antecedently probable, but any historical proof would be extremely difficult, if
                    not impossible. It is true that even where the characters resemble the
                    Phoenician the names of the letters differ altogether; but this, as we have
                    before seen in the case of the Phoenicians themselves, is nowise unnatural when
                    an alphabet is borrowed; the form is important, the name signifies little, and
                    new names are attached according to the fancy of the borrowers. It is highly
                    probable, both from the meaning of the word rune itself and from the evidence of
                    foreign writers, that these symbols were not used by their owners for any of the
                    ordinary ends of an alphabet (except, perhaps, for inscriptions) until the
                    Teutonic nations came into contact with Greek and Roman civilisation; by the
                    mass of the people they were probably looked on simply as charms, the unknown
                    symbols of an occult science. Nay, it might be held that even to the initiated
                    they had merely a sort of hieroglyphic value, and were developed into phonetic
                    significance only by the contact of the Greek and Roman alphabets. For this
                    view, indeed, there is no evidence, and it is not in itself probable. But we
                    should be driven to it if we were to suppose that the runes were the creation of
                    the Teutonic intellect.</p>
                <p>These ancient characters occur plentifully on memorial stones, rings, coins,
                    &amp;c., in Scandinavia. In England they have been found principally in
                    Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia. It has been suggested (by Mr Haigh) that
                    this may be due to the milder principles of the Irish monks, who restored
                    Christianity to the north of England after its fall with Edwin in 633, and did
                    not pursue that system of eradicating every trace of paganism which had been
                    originally commanded by Gregory. Runic writing was even employed in the service
                    of Christianity. Mr Kemble <hi rend="italic">(Archoeologia,</hi> vol. xxviii. p.
                    349) interpreted with great ingenuity the mutilated inscription on the famous
                    cross discovered at Ruthwell, and showed that it refers to the Crucifixion. But
                    the Anglo-Saxon alphabet was soon —early in the 7th century—conformed to the
                    Latin type, those letters of the older form alone being retained which were
                    required to denote sounds that had no counterparts in Latin; these were ƿ (wên),
                    and p (thorn), the latter of which expresses the surd breathing heard in “<hi
                    rend="italic">th</hi> in :” in order to express the corresponding sonant (heard
                    in <hi rend="italic">“that,”</hi> and confusedly denoted by the same compound
                    <hi rend="italic">th)</hi> a stroke was drawn across the simple <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> (ծ), and the new letter was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >edh.</hi> The symbol 3 is sometimes found instead of <hi rend="italic">y.</hi>
                    Curious admixtures of runes with Latin characters occasionally occur even to
                    late times. Thus, in the <hi rend="italic">Codex Exoniensis</hi> (p. 400, ed.
                    Thorpe), an enigma occurs in verse, and the parts apparently of the subject to
                    be guessed are <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0650-0613"/> written in runes; the odd effect is increased by
                    these runes being written in the regular way—(sometimes they were written <hi
                    rend="italic">βουστροφηδόν)</hi> —from right to left, contrary to the general
                    run of the words. Kemble, in the <hi rend="italic">Archoeologia,</hi> has given
                    an interesting translation of an Anglo-Saxon poem, each stanza of which begins
                    with the name of a runic letter; thus the first stanza begins with Fesh,
                    “money,” the name of <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> the first runic letter, and goes
                    on to say—</p>

                <p>The second stanza is dedicated to the bull, Ur («), the third to thorn <hi
                    rend="italic">(th), &amp;c.</hi> This poem accordingly gives the order of the
                    alphabet, which agrees in the main with that of all other runic alphabets. Yet
                    the poem is not old, for the name of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (Sigel, “the sun
                    ”) is treated by the writer as though it had been Segel “a sail”—clearly a
                    mistake of a later time, when the true name had passed out of use. It may be
                    added that the names of this alphabet are sometimes strangely abstract; thus we
                    find “gift,” “hope,” "need,” “war,” which differ much from the very concrete
                    objects which the Phoenicians chose to denote their letters. In consequence of
                    all these old alphabets beginning with the letters <hi rend="italic">f</hi>,·
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi>, <hi rend="italic">th, o, r, c,</hi> in the same order,
                    the alphabets are called by some antiquarians “futhorcs,” just as we commonly
                    speak of the ordinary alphabet as the A <hi rend="smallcaps">b</hi> c.</p>
                <p>The doctrines of Christianity were first presented to a Teutonic people in a
                    written form by Ulfilas, who, though not the first successful missionary to the
                    Goths, has thereby established his claim to be regarded as the apostle of his
                    race; and while the main body of the Goths, spurning the weak control of Rome,
                    poured westward in their fierce career of victory towards Italy and Spain, a
                    remnant was left in Maesia, to whom Ulfilas gave the gospel in their own tongue.
                    This was at the end of the 4th century of our era. He employed an alphabet of
                    twenty-four or twenty-five letters, some of which are unmistakably Greek in
                    form; others are common (or nearly so) to the Greek and the runic alphabets, and
                    may therefore have been derived from either; but if they were runic, they at
                    least received a more rounded form, it being no longer necessary to retain those
                    angles which (as we saw above in describing the cuneiform characters) were most
                    convenient in days when writing meant cutting on stone or wood. But some of the
                    letters seem to be beyond doubt runic: most clearly so are <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi>, <hi rend="italic">r, u, y,</hi> and the symbol for the compound sound
                    <hi rend="italic">kw;</hi> and the reason for all these (except <hi
                    rend="italic">r)</hi> appears to be the lack of a proper equivalent in Greek.
                    The letter which Ulfilas adopted to denote the surd breath <hi rend="italic"
                    >th</hi> is not runic, so that the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon alphabets here differ:
                    it is apparently the Greek <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> It would seem, therefore,
                    that this letter still denoted an aspirate <hi rend="italic">(p'h)</hi> in
                    Greek, and not a breath, otherwise it would surely have been taken for <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi>; here, on the contrary, it seems to have been selected at
                    random from a list of symbols which denoted no corresponding sounds in Gothic.
                    On the same lack of principle O was taken to denote <hi rend="italic">hw.</hi> X
                    was the exponent of the breath <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi> as heard in German
                    words: here the difference between the true aspirate and the breath is not
                    great. Long <hi rend="italic">o</hi> formed a symbol which is very like <hi
                    rend="italic">omega.</hi></p>
                <p>Another alphabet which has had an important influence on Europe, and which may be
                    destined to a yet wider extension as the alphabet (in a modified form) of the
                    great and progressive Russian empire, is the Cyrillic. This was the work of
                    Cyril, a monk of Constantinople, who, together with Methodius preached the
                    gospel among the Sclavonic tribes of Bulgaria and Moravia, in the 9th century,
                    long after the Teutons had come under the influence of Christianity. Cyril held
                    the services of the church among his new converts in the vulgar tongue, into
                    which he also translated certain books of the Scriptures. The alphabet which he
                    employed for’ this purpose is more thoroughly Greek than that of Ulfilas; but
                    since the Greek alphabet was not nearly sufficient to express all the Sclavonic
                    sounds—especially the numerous sibilants—he added further signs, the history of
                    which is not clear. This alphabet has been largely adopted by the eastern
                    branches of the Sclavonic race, including the Russians, Bulgarians, and the
                    Illyrian division of the Sclaves. The old Bulgarian (commonly called the
                    Ecclesiastical Sclavonic) is the language into which Cyril translated the
                    Scriptures; in philology it holds the same rank as the Gothic has among the
                    Teutonic languages: it is the parent, however, only of one of the least
                    important dialects, the modem Bulgarian. The Illyrian family is divided into the
                    Servians on the one hand, and the Croats and Slovenian peoples on the other.
                    These parties are separated by difference of religion: the Servians belong
                    mainly to the Greek Church, while the others are exclusively Roman Catholic; and
                    the members of the Greek Church naturally cling to the Cyrillic characters,
                    while the Catholics have adopted the Latin alphabet. It is not easy to predict
                    which characters will ultimately predominate. The Latin letters are insufficient
                    to express the Sclavonic sounds; but this deficiency can be eked out by
                    diacritical signs, and the greatest literary activity is shown by the Latinising
                    party. Lastly, the Cyrillic alphabet has been adopted by the Wallachians,
                    through the influence of their Sclavonic neighbours, though it is little adapted
                    to express their essentially Latin speech, derived from the colonists whom
                    Trajan settled in the new Roman province of Dacia. Most of the needless symbols
                    have been dropped in the newest form of the Wallachian alphabet. (See Max
                    Müller, <hi rend="italic">Survey of Languages,</hi> pp. 39-84.)</p>
                <p>Cyril’s original alphabet consisted of forty-eight symbols, but some of these are
                    slightly different representations of the same sound; others are tachygraphies
                    for combinations of sound, as <hi rend="italic">sht, ts,</hi> &amp;c. The names
                    were not Greek, with the exception of three— <hi rend="italic">ksi, psi,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">thita</hi> —which were relegated to the end as
                    unnecessary, but they retained their, original Greek place as numerical signs.
                    The alphabet is printed at the end of this article. It will be seen that B
                    occupies the third place, while a modified B stands second: the reason is, that
                    B had come to denote the <hi rend="italic">v</hi> sound in Greek, and therefore
                    carried this value into the Sclavonic. The modified letter denotes the old <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> sound. The 7th letter, which is not Greek, had the sound of
                    English soft <hi rend="italic">j</hi>, a little softer than the French <hi
                    rend="italic">j</hi> in <hi rend="italic">jamais.</hi> The 8th and 9th symbols
                    are the Greek <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z:</hi> they are
                    supposed to have had the same sound, that of the soft English <hi rend="italic"
                    >z</hi> (not <hi rend="italic">dz)—</hi> perhaps one of them may have originally
                    denoted <hi rend="italic">dz,</hi> a sound which easily passes into <hi
                    rend="italic">dj; dj</hi> had a special symbol both in the Servian and
                    Wallachian, though it had none in the Cyrillic, probably because the sound had
                    not then been produced; if it had, we may conclude, from the exactness which the
                    Cyrillic alphabet everywhere shows, that it would not have been left without a
                    mark. The 8th letter has been expelled from the Russian alphabet as superfluous:
                    the Russians have no <hi rend="italic">dj</hi> sound. The 10th and 11th letters
                    were sounded alike as <hi rend="italic">i;</hi> the 10th is the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">Eta,</hi> which had therefore become undistinguishable from Iota
                    in Cyril’s day, as it is in modern Greek. The 12th letter, <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> pure and simple, denoted the semi-vowel <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> The
                    22d was <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> followed by a parasitic <hi rend="italic"
                    >y.</hi> The 23d and 24th are only different ways of writing the same
                    combination <hi rend="italic">ou;</hi> the Greeks having changed the <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> sound into ü <hi rend="italic">,</hi> Cyril was obliged to
                    write <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> for <hi rend="italic">u</hi>, as the Greeks
                    themselves did. The Russian has one symbol (Y) to denote this sound: it is <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n651/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0651-0614"/> probably a tachygraphy of the 24th. The 25th and
                    26th denoted respectively the breathings <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and German <hi
                    rend="italic">ch.</hi> We may recall here the different treatment of <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> by Ulfilas; it seems a fair inference that the sound of <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> had changed from an aspirate to a breathing between the
                    times of Ulfilas and Cyril. The 27th and 28th are the Greek Omega in the simple
                    and in a modified form: they denoted the sounds heard in <hi rend="italic"
                    >note</hi> and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> respectively; these have been dropped
                    in all the derived alphabets, in which the 17th letter does work for both. We
                    now come to a series of letters (29-44) which are not Greek, and denote sounds
                    which were probably unknown, or at least had no separate exponents, in the Greek
                    system. The first four are sibilants, simple or compound. It will be remembered
                    how the Greek dropped the large Phoenician stock of sibilants, through their own
                    disinclination to such sounds. Cyril, however, did not go back to the original
                    types, but had recourse to the inartistic expedient of using two or three
                    upright strokes, with small modifiers below. Letter 29 is the compound <hi
                    rend="italic">ts,</hi> 30 denotes the fuller compound <hi rend="italic"
                    >tsch</hi> (English <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> in “church”), 31 is the simple <hi
                    rend="italic">sh,</hi> 32 is <hi rend="italic">sht,</hi> which in Russian is
                    said to be expressible only by <hi rend="italic">schtsch,</hi> unquestionably a
                    very strong sibilant; the newer form of Wallachian used 29 to express <hi
                    rend="italic">dj.</hi> The letters 33-36 were attempts to express the neutral
                    vowel (heard in English in <hi rend="italic">fir, sun,</hi> &amp;c.), the first
                    two in its aspect nearest to <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> the last two nearer to
                    <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> The first and last are important in Russian: they are
                    written, but not pronounced; but the first hardens a preceding letter, or, if it
                    be a continuous consonant, makes it be sounded as though it were double. The
                    36th, on the contrary, softens a preceding letter, giving it the <hi
                    rend="italic">mouillé</hi> sound. The 34th letter has been dropped in Russian;
                    the 35th has a peculiar kind of <hi rend="italic">i</hi> sound. The 37th letter
                    has an <hi rend="italic">e</hi> sound; it was apparently introduced into the
                    alphabet in consequence of the polyphony of the original <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> which in Russian does the work of <hi rend="italic">e, o,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">oe,</hi> and also of each of these preceded by the semi-vowel <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but as the new letter has three of
                    these sounds, there is not much gain of clearness. A third symbol, however, has
                    been introduced—an inverted <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which did not belong to
                    the Cyrillic alphabet: it is used at the beginning of words where the pure <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> sound is heard—not <hi rend="italic">ye,</hi> and also in
                    foreign words beginning with <hi rend="italic">oe.</hi> Letters 38-40 are
                    compounds expressing the <hi rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> sounds, preceded by <hi
                    rend="italic">y.</hi> The combinations seem to us needless, but the Greek had no
                    symbol for <hi rend="italic">y;</hi> therefore Cyril probably thought it
                    necessary to connect the I-symbol with the following vowel, in order to show
                    that it was only the semi-vowel, not a full vowel, which would have caused
                    another syllable. The first of these symbols has been retained in Russian
                    unchanged; the second is now written rather like an inverted <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> H; the third was suffered to drop—whence arose the confusion respecting
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> which we have just mentioned. Nos. 41 and 42 denote
                    nasalised vowels, e and <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> as heard in the French <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi> and <hi rend="italic">on:</hi> these sounds seem to have
                    fallen out of all Sclavonic languages, except the Polish. 43 and 44 denote the
                    same vowels “pre-iotised,” like the three 38-40: these also are now unknown.
                    Then came the Greek Ksi and Psi, the characters being very slightly altered:
                    they have fallen out of use altogether. No. 47, Thita, is retained in Russian,
                    but sounded as an <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> which has thus two exponents, <hi
                    rend="italic">θ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> Lastly came the equivalent of
                    the Greek Upsilon called <hi rend="italic">ijica:</hi> this is employed in
                    Russian in words borrowed from the Greek.</p>
                <p>Fourteen of these letters have been expelled from the Russian alphabet, namely 8,
                    11, 22, 23, 27, 28, 34, 40-46; their list of 35 letters is made up by the
                    addition of the inverted <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which stands in the 31st
                    place of the alphabet. The forms of the letters are more rounded than those of
                    Cyril, as will be seen by a comparison of the two. This reform, among others,
                    was due to Peter the Great, who printed the first Russian periodical at Moscow
                    in 1704. (Max Müller, <hi rend="italic">Survey,</hi> p. 49.)</p>
                <p>The Servian alphabet differs from the Russian chiefly by the insertion of symbols
                    to denote modification of sound caused by a following <hi rend="italic">y.</hi>
                    Thus we find a character to express <hi rend="italic">dy</hi> (equivalent to the
                    Hungarian <hi rend="italic">gy</hi> heard in “Magyar”); another for <hi
                    rend="italic">ly,</hi> denoting the sound of the Italian <hi rend="italic"
                    >gli;</hi> another for <hi rend="italic">ny,</hi> the Italian and French <hi
                    rend="italic">gn;</hi> and one for <hi rend="italic">ty,</hi> a softer sound
                    than the <hi rend="italic">tsch,</hi> the symbol for which is common to Russian
                    and Servian.</p>
                <p>The Wallachian adopted nearly all the Cyrillic characters. except the superfluous
                    vowel-symbols and the nasalised vowels. The list was soon considerably
                    shortened, as was natural in a language originally non-Sclavonic, though in the
                    course of time it has naturally borrowed many words from its neighbours. Since
                    it has been used for literary purposes, it has been further diminished to 27
                    symbols by the loss of the short sibilant (32), the second <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> and the iotised <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> the other iotised vowels had
                    gone before. The forms of the characters have also been much assimilated to the
                    Latin types: instead of the peculiar symbol for <hi rend="italic">sch,</hi>
                    which the Russian retains, the new Wallachian has a J with a wavy stroke through
                    the middle; <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is written as N, not as H; and Cyril’s
                    combinations of perpendicular fines are more rounded than the Russian. The
                    Wallachian has one special symbol to denote the sound <hi rend="italic"
                    >ün</hi>.</p>
                <p>We have thus described the alphabets used in modern Europe. The only others which
