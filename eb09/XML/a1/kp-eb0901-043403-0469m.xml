                    throne, and severity in maintaining the discipline of the army, tended greatly
                    to the consolidation of the newly-recovered empire. Bahram, however, was
                    naturally despotic and cruel; and when order was somewhat restored, Akbar found
                    it necessary to take the reins of government into his own hands, which he did by
                    a proclamation issued in March 1560. The discarded regent lived for some time in
                    rebellion, endeavouring to establish an independent principality in Malwah, but
                    at last he was forced to cast himself on Akbar’s mercy. The emperor not only
                    freely pardoned him, but magnanimously offered him the choice of a high place in
                    the army or a suitable escort for a pilgrimage to Mecca, and Bahram preferred
                    the latter alternative. When Akbar ascended the throne, only a small portion of
                    what had formerly been comprised within the Moghul empire owned his authority,
                    and he devoted himself with great determination and marvellous success to the
                    recovery of the revolted provinces. Over each of these, as it was restored, he
                    placed a governor, whom he superintended with great vigilance and wisdom. He
                    tried by every means to develop and encourage commerce; he had the land
                    accurately measured for the purpose of rightly adjusting taxation; he gave the
                    strictest instructions to prevent extortion on the part of the tax-gatherers,
                    and in many other respects displayed an enlightened and equitable policy. Thus
                    it happened that, in the fortieth year of Akbar’s reign the empire had more than
                    regained all that it had lost, the recovered provinces being reduced, not to
                    subjection only as before, but to a great degree of peace, order, and
                    contentment. Akbar’s method of dealing with what must always be the chief
                    difficulty of one who has to rule widely diverse races, affords perhaps the
                    crowning evidence of his wisdom and moderation. In religion he was at first a
                    Mussulman, but the intolerant exclusiveness of that creed was quite foreign to
                    his character. Scepticism as to the divine origin of the Koran led him to seek
                    the true religion in an eclectic system. He accordingly set himself to obtain
                    information about other religions, sent to Goa, requesting that the Portuguese
                    missionaries there would visit him, and listened to them with intelligent
                    attention when they came. As the result of these inquiries, he adopted the creed
                    of pure deism and a ritual based upon the system of Zoroaster. The religion thus
                    founded, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n470/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0470-0435"/> however, having no vital force, never spread
                    beyond the limits of the court, and died with Akbar himself. But though his
                    eclectic system failed, the spirit of toleration which originated it produced in
                    other ways many important results; and, indeed, may be said to have done more to
                    establish Akbar’s power on a secure basis than all his economic and social
                    reforms. He conciliated the Hindoos by giving them freedom of worship; while at
                    the same time he strictly prohibited certain barbarous Brahminical practices,
                    such as trial by ordeal and the burning of widows against their will. He also
                    abolished all taxes upon pilgrims as an interference with the liberty of
                    worship, and the capitation tax upon Hindoos, probably upon similar grounds.
                    Measures like these gained for him during his lifetime the title of “Guardian of
                    Mankind,” and caused him to be held up as a model to Indian princes of later
                    times, who in the matter of religious toleration have only too seldom followed
                    his example. Akbar was a munificent patron of literature. He established schools
                    throughout his empire for the education of Hindoos as well as Moslems, and he
                    gathered round him many men of literary talent, among whom may be mentioned the
                    brothers Feizi and Abulfazl. The former was commissioned by Akbar to translate a
                    number of Sanscrit scientific works into Persian; and the latter (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Abulfazl)</hi> has left, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Akbar-Nameh,</hi> an enduring record of the emperor’s reign. It is also said
                    that Akbar employed Jerome Xavier, a Jesuit missionary, to translate the four
                    Gospels into Persian. The closing years of Akbar’s reign were rendered very
                    unhappy by the misconduct of his sons. Two of them died in youth, the victims of
                    intemperance; and the third, Selim, afterwards the emperor Jehanghir, was
                    frequently in rebellion against his father. These calamities were keenly felt by
                    Akbar, and may even have tended to hasten his death, which occurred at Agra on
                    the 13th October 1605. His body was deposited in a magnificent mausoleum at
                    Sicandra, near Agra.</p>
