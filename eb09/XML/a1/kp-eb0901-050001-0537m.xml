                <p><label type="entry">ALEXANDRINE VERSE</label>, a name given to the leading
                    measure in French poetry. It is the heroic French verse, used in epic narrative,
                    in tragedy, and in the higher comedy. There is some doubt as to the origin of
                    the name; but most probably it is derived from a collection of romances,
                    published early in the 13th century, of which Alexander of Macedon was the hero,
                    and in which he was represented, somewhat like our own Arthur, as the pride and
                    crown of chivalry. Before the publication of this work most of the trouvère
                    romances appeared in octo-syllabic verse. The new work, which was henceforth to
                    set the fashion to French literature, was written in lines of twelve syllables,
                    but with a freedom of pause which was afterwards greatly curtailed. The new
                    fashion, however, was not adopted all at once. The metre fell into disuse until
                    the reign of Francis I., when it was revived by Jean Antoine de Boeuf, one of
                    the seven poets known as the Pleiades. It was not he, however, but Ronsard, who
                    made the verse popular, and gave it vogue in France. From his time it became the
                    recognised vehicle for all great poetry, and the regulation of its pauses became
                    more and more strict. The following is an example of the verse as used by
                    Racine—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> “Où suis-je? qu’ai-je fait? ∥ que dois-je faire encore? </l>
                    <l part="N"> Quel transport me saisit? ∥ quel chagrin me dévore ?” </l>
                </lg>
                <p>Two inexorable laws carne to be established with regard to the pauses. The first
                    is, that each line should be divided into two equal parts, the sixth syllable
                    always ending with a word. In the earlier use of this metre, on the contrary, it
                    frequently happened that the sixth and seventh syllables belonged to the same
                    word. The other is, that, except under the most stringent conditions, there
                    should be none of what the French critics call <hi rend="italic"
                    >enjambement,</hi> that is, the overlapping of the sense from one line on to the
                    next. Ronsard completely ignored this rule, which was after his time settled by
                    the authority of Malherbe. Such verses as the following by Ronsard would be
                    intolerable in modern French poetry—</p>

                <p>Michael Drayton, who was twenty-two years of age when Ronsard died, seemed to
                    think that the Alexandrine might be as pleasing to English as it was to French
                    ears, and in this metre he wrote a long poem in twenty-four books called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Polyolbion.</hi> The metre, however, failed to catch the English
                    ear. Our principal measure is a line of ten syllables, and we use the
                    Alexandrine only occasionally to give it variety and weight. In our ordinary
                    heroic verse it is but rarely introduced; but in the favourite narrative metre,
                    known as the Spenserian, it comes in regularly as the concluding line of each
                    stanza. In English usage, moreover, it is to be observed that there is no fixed
                    rule as to the position of the pause, though it is true that most commonly the
                    pause occurs at the end of the sixth syllable. Spenser is very free in shifting
                    the pause about; and though the later poets who have used this stanza are not so
                    free, yet, with the exception of Shenstone and of Byron, they do not scruple to
                    obliterate all pause between the sixth and seventh syllables. Thus Thomson <hi
                    rend="italic">(Castle of Indolence,</hi> i. 42):—</p>
                <l part="N"> "And music lent new gladness to the morning air.” </l>
                <p>The danger in the use of the Alexandrine is that, in attempting to give dignity
                    to his line, the poet may only produce heaviness, incurring the sneer of
                    Pope—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> “A needless Alexandrine ends the song, </l>
                    <l part="N"> That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.” </l>
