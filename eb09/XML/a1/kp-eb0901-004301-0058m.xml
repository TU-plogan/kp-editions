                    by those of Inverness and Banff. Its greatest length is 102 miles, and breadth
                    50 miles. Its circuit with sinuosities is about 300 miles, 60 being seacoast. It
                    is the fifth of Scotch counties in size, and is one-sixteenth of the extent of
                    Scotland. Its area is 1970 square miles, or 1,260,625 acres, of which, in 1872,
                    366 per cent., or 585,299 acres, were cultivated, 93,339 in woods (mostly Scotch
                    fir and larch), and 6400 in lakes. It contains 85 civil parishes and parts of 6
                    others, or 101 parishes, including civil and <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra.</hi>
                    The county is generally hilly, and mountainous in the south-west, whence, near
                    the centre of Scotland, the Grampians send out various branches, mostly to the
                    north-east, through the county. The run of the rivers and the general slope of
                    the county is to the north-east and cast. It is popularly divided into five
                    districts:—First, <hi rend="italic">Mar,</hi> mostly between the Dee and Don,
                    and forming nearly the south half of the county. It is mountainous, especially
                    Braemar, its west and Highland part, which contains the greatest mass of
                    elevated land in the British Isles. Here the Dee rises amid the grandeur and
                    wildness of lofty mountains, much visited by tourists, and composed chiefly of
                    granite and gneiss, forming many high precipices, and showing patches of snow
                    throughout every summer. Here rises Ben Muichdhui, the second highest mountain
                    in Scotland and in the British Isles, 4296 feet; Braeriach, 4225; Cairntoul,
                    4245; Cairngorm (famed for “Cairngorm stones,” a peculiar kind of rock crystal),
                    4090; Ben-a-Buird, 3860; Ben Avon, 3826; and Byron’s “dark Lochnagar,” 3786. The
                    soil on the Dee is sandy, and on the Don loamy. The city of Aberdeen is in Mar.
                    Second, <hi rend="italic">Formartin,</hi> between the lower Don and Ythan, with
                    a sandy coast, succeeded by a clayey, fertile, tilled tract, and then by low
                    hills, moors, mosses, and tilled land. Third, <hi rend="italic">Buchan,</hi>
                    north of the Ythan, and next in size to <pb break="no"

                    with the interior bare, low, flat, undulating, and in parts peaty. On the coast,
                    six miles south of Peterhead, are the Bullers of Buchan,—a basin in which the
                    sea, entering by a natural arch, boils up violently in stormy weather. Buchan
                    Ness is the eastmost point of Scotland. Fourth, <hi rend="italic">Garioch,</hi>
                    a beautiful, undulating, loamy, fertile valley, formerly called the granary of
                    Aberdeen, with the prominent hill Benachie, 1676 feet, on the south. Fifth, <hi
                    rend="italic">Strathbogie,</hi> mostly consisting of hills (The Buck, 2211 feet;
                    Noath, 1830 feet), moors, and mosses. The county as a whole, except the low
                    grounds of Buchan, and the Highlands of Braemar, consists mainly of nearly level
                    or undulating tracts, often naked and infertile, but interspersed with many rich
                    and highly cultivated spots.</p>
                <p>The chief rivers are the Dee, 96 miles long; Don, 78; Ythan, 37, with mussel beds
                    at its mouth; Ugie, 20; and Deveron, 58, partly on the boundary of Banffshire.
                    The pearl mussel occurs in the Ythan and Don. A valuable pearl in the Scottish
                    crown is said to be from the Ythan. Loch Muick, the largest of the few lakes in
                    the county, 1310 feet above the sea, is only 2½ miles long and ⅓ to ½ mile
                    broad. The rivers have plenty of salmon and trout. There are noted chalybeate
                    springs at Peterhead, Fraserburgh, and Pananich near Ballater.</p>
                <p>The climate of Aberdeenshire, except in the mountainous districts, is
                    comparatively mild, from the sea being on two sides. The mean annual temperature
                    at Braemar is 43° ∙6 Fahr., and at Aberdeen 45° ∙8. The mean yearly rainfall
                    varies from about 30 to 37 inches. The summer climate of the Upper Dee and Don
                    valleys is the driest and most bracing in the British Isles, and grain is
                    cultivated up to 1600 feet above the sea, or 400 to 500 feet higher than
                    elsewhere in North Britain. All the crops cultivated in Scotland ripen, and the
                    people often live to a great age.</p>
                <p>The rocks are mostly granite, gneiss, with small tracts of syenite, mica slate,
                    quartz rock, clay slate, grauwacke, primary limestone, old red sandstone,
                    serpentine, and trap. Lias, greensand, and chalk flints occur. The rocks are
                    much covered with boulder clay, gravel, sand, and alluvium. Brick clay occurs
                    near the coast. The surface of the granite under the boulder clay often presents
                    glacial smoothings, grooves, and roundings. Cairngorm stone, beryl, and amethyst
                    are found in the granite of Braemar.</p>
                <p>The tops of the highest mountains have an arctic flora. At Her Majesty’s Lodge,
                    Loch Muick, 1350 feet above the sea, grow larches, vegetables, currants,
                    laurels, roses, Ac. Some ash trees, 4 or 5 feet in girth, are growing at 1300
                    feet above the sea. The mole occurs at 1800 feet above the sea, and the squirrel
                    at 1400. Trees, especially Scotch fir and larch, grow well in the county, and
                    Braemar abounds in natural timber, said to surpass any in the north of Europe.
                    Stumps of Scotch fir and oak found in peat in the county are often far larger
                    than any now growing. Grouse, partridges, and hares abound in the county, and
                    rabbits are often too numerous. Red deer abound in Braemar, the deer forest
                    being there valued at £5000 a year, and estimated at 500,000 acres, or
                    one-fourth the area of deer forests in Scotland.</p>
                <p>Poor, gravelly, clayey, and peaty soils prevail much more in Aberdeenshire than
                    good rich loams, but tile draining, bones, and guano, and the best modes of
                    modern tillage, have greatly increased the produce. Farm-houses and steadings
                    have greatly improved, and the best agricultural implements and machines are in
                    general use. About two-thirds of the population depend entirely on agriculture,
                    and oatmeal in various forms, with milk, is the chief food of farm-servants.
                    Farms are generally small, compared with those in the south-east counties. The
                    fields are separated by dry-stone dykes, and also by wooden and wire fences.
                    Leases of 19 or 21 years prevail, and the five, six, or seven shift rotation is
                    in general use. In 1872 there were 11,642 occupiers of land, with an average of
                    50 acres each, and paying about £536,000 in rent. Of the 585,299 acres of the
                    county in crop in 1872, 191,880 acres were in oats, 18,930 in barley and here,
                    1633 in rye, 1357 in wheat, 95,091 in turnips (being one-fifth of the turnips
                    grown in Scotland), 8414 in potatoes, 232,178 in grasses and clover. In 1872 the
                    county had 23,117 horses, 157,960 cattle (being above one-seventh of all the
                    cattle in Scotland), 128,308 sheep, and 13,579 pigs. The county is unsurpassed
                    in breeding, and unrivalled in feeding cattle, and this is more attended to than
                    the cultivation of grain-crops. About 40,000 fat cattle are reared, and above
                    £1,000,000 value of cattle and dead meat is sent from the county to London
                    yearly. The capital invested in agriculture within the county is estimated at
                    about £5,133,000.</p>
                <p>The great mineral wealth in Aberdeenshire is its long-famed durable granite,
                    which is largely quarried for building, paving, causewaying, and polishing. An
                    acre of land on being reclaimed has yielded £40 to £50 worth of causewaying
                    stones. Gneiss is also quarried, as also primary limestone, old red sandstone,
                    conglomerate millstone, grauwacke, clay slate, syenite, and hornblende rock.
                    Iron ore, manganese, and plumbago occur in the county.</p>
                <p>A large fishing population in villages along the coast engage in the white and
                    herring fishery. Haddocks are salted and rock-dried (speldings), or smoked
                    (finnans). The rivers and coasts yield many salmon. Peterhead was long the chief
                    British port for the north whale and seal fishery, but Dundee now vies with it
                    in this industry.</p>
                <p>The manufactures and arts of the county are mainly prosecuted in or near the town
                    of Aberdeen, but throughout the rural districts there are much milling of corn,
                    brick and tile making, stone-quarrying, smith-work, brewing and distilling, cart
                    and farm implement making, casting and drying of peat, timber felling,
                    especially on Deeside and Donside, for pit-props, railway sleepers, lath, barrel
                    staves, &amp;c. The chief imports into the county are, coals, lime, timber,
                    iron, slates, raw materials of textile manufactures, wheat, cattle-feeding
                    stuffs, bones, guano, sugar, alcoholic liquors, fruits, &amp;c. The chief
                    exports are granite (rough, dressed, and polished), flax, woollen, and cotton
                    goods, paper, combs, preserved provisions, oats, barley, live and dead cattle,
                    Ac. In the county there are about 520 fairs in the year for cattle, horses,
                    sheep, hiring servants, Ac.</p>
                <p>Aberdeenshire communicates with the south by the Caledonian Railway, and five
                    macadamised roads across the east Grampians, the highest rising 2200 feet above
                    the sea. About 188 miles of railway (the Great North of Scotland, Formartin and
                    Buchan, and Deeside lines), and 2359 miles of public roads, ramify through the
                    county. Tolls over the county were abolished in 1865, and the roads are kept up
                    by assessment. The railway lines in the county have cost on the average about
                    £13,500 a mile. Several macadamised roads and the Great North of Scotland
                    Railway form the main exits from the county to the north-west.</p>
                <p>The chief antiquities in Aberdeenshire are Picts’ houses or weems; stone
                    foundations of circular dwellings; monoliths, some being sculptured; the
                    so-called Druid circles; stone cists; stone and earthen enclosures; the
                    vitrified forts of Dunnideer and Noath; cairns; crannoges; earthen mounds, as
                    the Bass; flint arrow-heads; clay funeral urns; stone celts and hammers. Remains
                    of Roman camps occur at Peterculter, Kintore, and Auchterless, respectively
                    107½, 100, and 115 acres. Roman arms have been found. Ruins of ancient edifices
                    occur. On the top of a conical hill called Dunnideer. in the Garioch district,
                    are the remains of a <pb break="no"

                    surrounded by a vitrified wall, which must be still older. The foundations of
                    two buildings still remain, the one in Braemar, and the other in the Loch of
                    Cannor (the latter with the remains of a wooden bridge between it and the land),
                    which are supposed to have belonged to Malcolm Canmore, King of Scotland. The
                    most extensive ruins are the grand ones of Kildrummy Castle, evidently once a
                    princely seat, and still covering nearly an acre of ground. It belonged to David
                    Earl of Huntingdon in 1150, and was the seat of the Earls of Marr attainted in
                    1716. The Abbey of Deer, now in ruins, was begun by Cumyn Earl of Buchan about
                    1219.</p>
                <p>In Roman times, Aberdeenshire formed part of Ves-pasiana in Caledonia, and was
                    occupied by the Taixali, a warlike tribe. The local names are mostly Gaelic. St
                    Columba and his pupil Drostan visited Buchan in the 6th century. In 1052 Macbeth
                    fell near the Peel Bog in Lumphanan, and a cairn which marks the spot is still
                    shown. In 1309 Bruce defeated Cornyn, Earl of Buchan, near Inverurie, and
                    annihilated a powerful Norman family. In 1411 the Earl of Marr defeated Donald
                    of the Isles in the battle of Harlaw, near Inverurie, when Sir Robert Davidson,
                    Provost of Aberdeen, was killed. In 1562 occurred the battle of Corrichie on the
                    Hill of Fare, when the Earl of Murray defeated the Marquis of Huntly. In 1715
                    the Earl of Marr proclaimed the Pretender in Braemar. In 1746 the Duke of
                    Cumberland with his army marched through Aberdeenshire to Culloden. In 1817 a
                    base line of verification, 5 miles 100 feet long, was measured in connection
                    with the Trigonometrical Survey of the British Isles, on the Belhelvie Links 5
                    to 10 miles north of Aberdeen.</p>
                <p>Among eminent men connected with Aberdeenshire are, Robert Gordon of Straloch,
                    who in 1648 published the first atlas of Scotland from actual survey; the Earls
                    Marischal, whose chief seat was Inverugie Castle; Field-Marshal Keith, born at
                    Inverugie Castle, 1696; Dr Thomas Reid, the metaphysician, minister of New
                    Machar 1737 to 1752; Lord Pitsligo, attainted 1745; Sir Archibald Grant of
                    Monymusk, who introduced turnips into the county 1756, and was the first to
                    plant wood on a great scale; Peter Garden, Auchterless, said to have died at the
                    age of 132, about 1780; Rev. John Skinner, author of some popular Scottish
                    songs; Morrison the hygeist; the Earl of Aberdeen, Prime Minister during the
                    Crimean war.</p>
                <p>The native Scotch population of Aberdeenshire are longheaded, shrewd, careful,
                    canny, active, persistent, but reserved and blunt, and without demonstrative
                    enthusiasm. They have a physiognomy distinct from the rest of the Scottish
                    people, and have a quick, sharp, rather angry accent. The local Scotch dialect
                    is broad, and rich in diminutives, and is noted for the use of <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> for <hi rend="italic">o</hi> or <hi rend="italic">u, f</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">uh</hi>, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> for <hi rend="italic">th,</hi>
                    &amp;c. In 1830 Gaelic was the fireside language almost every family in Braemar,
                    but now it is little used.</p>
                <p>Aberdeenshire has a Lord-Lieutenant and 3 Vice and 60 Deputy-Lieutenants. The
                    Supreme Court of Justiciary sits in Aberdeen twice a-year to try cases from the
                    counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Kincardine. The counties of Aberdeen and
                    Kincardine are under a Sheriff and two Sheriffs-Substitute. The Sheriff Courts
                    are held in Aberdeen and Peterhead. Sheriff Small-Debt and Circuit Courts are
                    held at seven places in the county. There are Burgh' or Bailie Courts in
                    Aberdeen and the other royal burghs in the county. Justice of the Peace and
                    Police Courts are held in Aberdeen, &amp;c. The Sheriff Courts take cognisance
                    of Commissary business. During 1871, 994 persons were confined in the
                    Aberdeenshire prisons. In the year 1870-71, 74 parishes in the county were
                    assessed £53,703 for 7702 poor on the roll and 1847 casual poor.</p>
                <p>Aberdeenshire contains 105 Established churches, 99 Free, 31 Episcopal, 15 United
                    Presbyterian, 9 Roman Catholic, and 31 of other denominations. This includes
                    detached parts of the two adjacent counties.</p>
                <p>By the census of 1871, 84∙83 per cent. of the children in the county, of the ages
                    5 to 13, were receiving education. Those formerly called the parochial
                    schoolmasters of Aberdeenshire participate in the Dick and Milne Bequests, which
                    contributed more salary to the schoolmasters in some cases than did the
                    heritors. Most of the schoolmasters arc Masters of Arts, and many are preachers.
                    Of 114 parochial schools in the county before the operation of the new Education
                    Act, 89 received the Milne Bequest of £20 a year, and 91 the Dick Bequest,
                    averaging £30 a year, and a schoolmaster with both bequests would have a yearly
                    income of £145 to £150, and in a few cases £250. The higher branches of
                    education have been more taught in the schools of the shires of Aberdeen and
                    Banff than in the other Scotch counties, and pupils have been long in the habit
                    of going direct from the schools of these two counties to the University.</p>

                    same year valued at £11,133. For general county purposes for the year ending
                    15th May 1872, there was assessed £14,803 to maintain police, prisons, militia,
