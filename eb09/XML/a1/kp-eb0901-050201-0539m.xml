                <p><label type="entry">ALFIERI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Vittorio</hi></label>, chiefly
                    celebrated as the author who raised the Italian tragic drama from its previous
                    state of degradation, was born on the 17th January 1749, at the town of Asti, in
                    Piedmont. He lost his father in early infancy; but he continued to reside with
                    his mother, who married a second time, till his tenth year, when he was placed
                    at the academy of Turin. After he had passed a twelvemonth at the academy, he
                    went on a short visit to a relation who dwelt at Coni; and during his stay there
                    he made his first poetical attempt, in a sonnet chiefly borrowed from lines in
                    Ariosto and Metastasio, the only poets he had at that time read. When thirteen
                    years of age he was induced to commence the study of civil and canonical law;
                    but the attempt only served to disgust him with every species of application,
                    and to increase his relish for the perusal of French romances. By the death of
                    his uncle, who had hitherto taken some charge of his education and conduct, he
                    was left, at the age of fourteen, to enjoy without control his vast paternal
                    inheritance, augmented by the recent accession of his uncle’s fortune. He now
                    began to attend the riding-school, where he acquired that rage for horses and
                    equestrian exercise which continued to be one of his strongest passions till the
                    close of his existence.</p>
                <p>After some time spent in alternate fits of extravagant dissipation and
                    ill-directed study, he was seized with a desire of travelling; and having
                    obtained permission from the king, he departed in 1766, under the care of an
                    English preceptor. Restless and unquiet, he posted with the utmost rapidity
                    through the towns of Italy; and his improvement was such as was to be expected
                    from his mode of travelling and his previous habits. Hoping to find in foreign
                    countries some relief from the tedium and <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi> with
                    which he was oppressed, and being anxious to become acquainted with the French
                    theatre, he proceeded to Paris. But he appears to have been completely
                    dissatisfied with everything he witnessed in France, and contracted a dislike to
                    its people, which his intercourse in future years rather contributed to augment
                    than diminish. In Holland he became deeply enamoured of a married lady, who
                    returned his attachment, but who was soon obliged to accompany her husband to
                    Switzerland. Alfieri, whose feelings were of the most impetuous description, was
                    in despair at this separation, and returned to his own country in the utmost
                    anguish and despondency of mind. While under this depression of spirits he was
                    induced to seek alleviation from works of literature; and the perusal of
                    Plutarch’s <hi rend="italic">Lives,</hi> which he read with profound emotion,
                    inspired him with an enthusiastic passion for freedom and independence. Under
                    the influence of this rage for liberty he recommenced his travels; and his only
                    gratification, in the absence of freedom among the Continental states, appears
                    to have been derived from contemplating the wild and sterile regions of the
                    north of Sweden, where gloomy forests, lakes, and precipices conspired to excite
                    those sublime and melancholy ideas which were congenial to his disposition.
                    Everywhere his soul felt as if confined by the bonds of society; he panted for
                    something more free in government, more elevated in sentiment, more devoted in
                    love, and more perfect in friendship. In search of this ideal world he posted
                    through various countries, more with the rapidity of a courier than of one who
                    travels for amusement or instruction. During a journey to London, he engaged in
                    an intrigue with a married lady of high rank; and having been detected, the
                    publicity of a rencounter with the injured husband, and of a divorce which
                    followed, rendered it expedient and desirable for him to quit England. He then
                    visited Spain and Portugal, where he became acquainted with the Abbé Caluso, who
                    remained through life the most attached and estimable friend he ever possessed.
                    In 1772 Alfieri returned to Turin, where he again became enamoured of a lady,
                    whom he loved with his usual ardour, and who seems to have been as undeserving
                    of a sincere attachment as those he had hitherto adored. In the course of a long
                    attendance on his mistress, during a malady with which she was afflicted, he one
                    day wrote a dialogue or scene of a drama, which he left at her house. On a
                    difference taking place between them, the piece was returned to him, and being
                    retouched and extended to five acts, it was performed at Turin in 1775, under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra.</hi></p>
                <p>From this moment Alfieri was seized with an insatiable thirst for theatrical
                    fame, and the remainder of his life was devoted to its attainment. His first two
                    tragedies, <hi rend="italic">Filippo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polinice,</hi>
                    were originally written in French prose; and when he came to versify them in
                    Italian, he found that, from his Lombard origin, and long intercourse with
                    foreigners, he expressed himself with feebleness and inaccuracy. Accordingly,
                    with the view of improving his Italian style, he went to Tuscany, and, during an
                    alternate residence at Florence and Siena, he completed his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Filippo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polinice,</hi> and conceived the plan of
                    various other dramas. While thus employed, he became acquainted with the
                    Countess of Albany, who then resided with her husband at Florence. For her he
                    formed an attachment which, if less violent than his former loves, appears to
                    have been more permanent. With this motive to remain at Florence, he could not
                    endure the chains by which his vast possessions bound him to Piedmont. He
                    therefore resigned his whole property to his sister, the Countess Cumiana,
                    reserving an annuity which scarcely amounted to a half of his original revenues.
                    At this period the Countess of Albany, urged by the ill-treatment she received
                    from her husband, sought refuge in Rome, where she at length received permission
                    from the pope to live apart from her tormentor.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n540/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0540-0503"/>
                <p>Alfieri followed the countess to that capital, where he completed fourteen
                    tragedies, four of which were now for the first time printed at Sienna.</p>
                <p>At length, however, it was thought proper that, by leaving Rome, he should remove
                    the aspersions which had been thrown on the object of his affections. During the
                    year 1783 he therefore travelled through different states of Italy, and
                    published six additional tragedies. The interests of his love and literary glory
                    had not diminished his rage for horses, which seems to have been at least the
                    third passion of his soul. He came to England solely for the purpose of
                    purchasing a number of these animals, which he carried with him to Italy. On his
                    return he learned that the Countess of Albany had gone to Colmar in Alsace,
                    where he joined her, and resided with her under the same roof during the rest of
                    his life. They chiefly passed their time between Alsace and Paris, but at length
                    took up their abode entirely in that metropolis. While here, Alfieri made
                    arrangements with Didot for an edition of his tragedies; but was soon after
                    forced to quit Paris by the storms of the Revolution. He recrossed the Alps with
                    the countess, and finally settled at Florence. The last ten years of his life,
                    which he spent in that city, seem to have been the happiest of his existence.
                    During that long period his tranquillity was only interrupted by the entrance of
                    the Revolutionary armies into Florence in 1799. Though an enemy of kings, the
                    aristocratic feelings of Alfieri rendered him also a decided foe to the
                    principles and leaders of the French Revolution; and he rejected with the utmost
                    contempt those advances which were made with a view to bring him over to their
                    cause. The concluding years of his life were laudably employed in the study of
                    the Greek literature, and in perfecting a series of comedies. His assiduous
                    labour on this subject, which he pursued with his characteristic impetuosity,
                    exhausted his strength, and brought on a malady for which he would not adopt the
                    prescriptions of his physicians, but obstinately persisted in employing remedies
                    of his own. His disorder rapidly increased, and at length terminated his life on
                    the 8th October 1803, in the fifty-fifth year of his age.</p>
                <p>The character of Alfieri may be best appreciated from the portrait which he has
                    drawn of himself in his own <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of his Life.</hi> He was
                    evidently of an irritable, impetuous, and almost ungovernable temper. Pride,
                    which seems to have been a ruling sentiment, may account for many apparent
                    inconsistencies of his character. But his less amiable qualities were greatly
                    softened by the cultivation of literature. His application to study gradually
                    tranquillised his temper and softened his manners, leaving him at the same time
                    in perfect possession of those good qualities which he had inherited from
                    nature,—a warm and disinterested attachment to his family and friends, united to
                    a generosity, vigour, and elevation of character, which rendered him not
                    unworthy to embody in his dramas the actions and sentiments of Grecian
                    heroes.</p>
                <p>It is to his dramas that Alfieri is chiefly indebted for the high reputation he
                    has attained. Before his time the Italian language, so harmonious in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sonnets</hi> of Petrarch, and so energetic in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Commedia</hi> of Dante, had been invariably languid and prosaic in
                    dramatic dialogue. The pedantic and inanimate tragedies of the 16th century were
                    followed, during the iron age of Italian literature, by dramas of which
                    extravagance in the sentiments and improbability in the action were the chief
                    characteristics. The prodigious success of the <hi rend="italic">Μerope</hi> of
                    Maffei, which appeared in the commencement of the last century, may be
                    attributed more to a comparison with such productions than to intrinsic merit.
                    In this degradation of tragic taste the appearance of the tragedies of Alfieri
                    was perhaps the most important literary event that had occurred in Italy during
                    the 18th century. On these tragedies it is difficult to pronounce a judgment, as
                    the taste and system of the author underwent considerable change and
                    modification during the intervals which elapsed between the three periods of
                    their publication. An excessive harshness of style, an asperity of sentiment,
                    and total want of poetical ornament, are the characteristics of his first four
                    tragedies, <hi rend="italic">Filippo, Polinice, Antigone,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Virginia.</hi> These faults were in some measure corrected in the
                    six tragedies which he gave to the world some years after, and in those which he
                    published along with <hi rend="italic">Saul,</hi> the drama which enjoyed the
                    greatest success of all his productions; a popularity which may be partly
                    attributed to the severe and unadorned manner of Alfieri being well adapted to
                    the patriarchal simplicity of the age in which the scene of the tragedy is
                    placed. But though there be a considerable difference in his dramas, there are
                    certain observations applicable to them all. None of the plots are of his own
                    invention. They are founded either on mythological fable or history; most of
                    them had been previously treated by the Greek dramatists, or by Seneca. <hi
                    rend="italic">Rosmunda,</hi> the only one which could be supposed of his own
                    contrivance, and which is certainly the least happy effusion of his genius, is
                    partly founded on the eighteenth novel of the third part of Bandello, and partly
                    on Prevost’s <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">d'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">un</hi><hi rend="italic">Homme</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Qualité.</hi> But whatever subject he chooses, his dramas are always formed on
                    the Grecian model, and breathe a freedom and independence worthy of an Athenian
                    poet. Indeed, his <hi rend="italic">Agide</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bruto</hi>
                    may rather be considered oratorical declamations and dialogues on liberty than
                    tragedies. The unities of time and place are not so scrupulously observed in his
                    as in the ancient dramas; but he has rigidly adhered to a unity of action and
                    interest. He occupies his scene with one great action and one ruling passion,
                    and removes from it every accessary event or feeling. In this excessive zeal for
                    the observance of unity he seems to have forgotten that its charm consists in
                    producing a common relation between multiplied feelings, and not in the bare
                    exhibition of one, divested of those various accompaniments which give harmony
                    to the whole. Consistently with that austere and simple manner which he
                    considered the chief excellence of dramatic composition, he excluded from his
                    scene all <hi rend="italic">coups de théâtre,</hi> all philosophical
                    reflections, and that highly ornamented versification which had been so
                    assiduously cultivated by his predecessors. In his anxiety, however, to avoid
                    all superfluous ornament, he has stripped his dramas of the embellishments of
                    imagination; and for the harmony and flow of poetical language he has
                    substituted, even in his best performances, a style which, though correct and
                    pure, is generally harsh, elaborate, and abrupt; often strained into unnatural
                    energy, or condensed into factitious conciseness. The chief excellence of
                    Alfieri consists in powerful delineation of dramatic character. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Filippo</hi> he has represented, almost with the masterly touches
                    of Tacitus, the sombre character, the dark mysterious counsels, the <hi
                    rend="italic">suspensa</hi><hi rend="italic">semper</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">obscura verba,</hi> of the modern Tiberius. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Polinice,</hi> the characters of the rival brothers are
                    beautifully contrasted.; in <hi rend="italic">Maria Stuarda,</hi> that
                    unfortunate queen is represented unsuspicious, impatient of contradiction, and
                    violent in her attachments. In <hi rend="italic">Mirra,</hi> the character of
                    Ciniro is perfect as a father and king, and Cecri is a model of a wife and
                    mother. In the representation of that species of mental alienation where the
                    judgment has perished, but traces of character still remain, he is peculiarly
                    happy. The insanity of Saul is skilfully managed; and the horrid joy of Orestes
                    in killing Aegisthus rises finely and naturally to madness, in finding that, at
                    the same time, he had inadvertently slain his mother.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the merits or defects of Alfieri, he may be considered as the
                    founder of a new school in the Italian drama. His country hailed him as her sole
                    tragic poet; and his successors in the. same path of literature have regarded
                    his bold, austere, and rapid manner, as the genuine model of tragic
                    composition.</p>
                <p>Besides his tragedies, Alfieri published during his life many sonnets, five odes
                    on American independence, and the poem of <hi rend="italic">Etruria,</hi>
                    founded on the assassination of Alexander I., duke of Florence. Of his prose
                    works the most distinguished for animation and eloquence is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Panegyric on Trajan,</hi> composed in a transport of indignation
                    at the supposed feebleness of Pliny’s eulogium. The two books entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">La Tirannide</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Essays on Literature
                    and Government,</hi> are remarkable for elegance and vigour of style, but are
                    too evidently imitations of the manner of Machiavel. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antigallican,</hi> which was written at the same time with his <hi
                    rend="italic">Defence of Louis XVI.,</hi> comprehends an historical and
                    satirical view of the French Revolution. The posthumous works of Alfieri consist
                    of satires, six political comedies, and the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of his
                    Life—</hi> a work which will always be read with interest, in spite of the cold
                    and languid gravity with which he delineates the most interesting adventures and
                    the strongest passions of his agitated life. See <hi rend="italic">Mem.
