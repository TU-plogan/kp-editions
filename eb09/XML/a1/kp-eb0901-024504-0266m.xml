                <p><label type="entry">AFRICA</label></p>
                <p>THIS vast continent, though associated from the dawn of civilisation with
                    traditions and mysteries of the most stimulating kind, has remained until
                    recently one of the least known, and, both commercially and politically, one of
                    the least important of the great divisions of the globe. The knowledge of Africa
                    possessed by the ancients was very limited, owing principally to its physical
                    construction. The great desert, which in a broad belt stretches quite across the
                    continent, forbade every attempt to pass it until the introduction of the camel
                    by the Arabs. The want of any known great river, except the Nile, that might
                    conduct into the interior, contributed to confine the Greek and Roman colonists
                    to the habitable belt along the northern coast. The Phoenicians are known to
                    have formed establishments on the northern coast of Africa at a very early
                    period of history, probably not less than 3000 years ago; and the conquest of
                    Egypt by Cambyses dates as far back as the year <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    525. We may consider, therefore, the coasts of Egypt, of the Red Sea, and of the
                    Mediterranean, to have been settled and well known to the ancient Asiatics, who
                    were constantly passing the narrow isthmus which divided their country from
                    Africa and led them immediately from parched deserts into a fertile valley,
                    watered by a magnificent river. But whether they were much or little acquainted
                    with the western coast, which bounds the Atlantic, and the eastern coast, washed
                    by the Indian Ocean, is a question that has exercised the research and ingenuity
                    of the ablest scholars and geographers, and has not yet been satisfactorily
                    answered.</p>
                <p>This question being one of curiosity rather than utility, we shall only state the
                    case, and the results of the several inquiries, without entering into the merits
                    of the arguments advanced by the different parties. We are told by Herodotus,
                    that Necho, king of Egypt, sent out an expedition under the command of certain
                    Phoenician seamen, for the purpose of circumnavigating Africa; and that, on
                    their return, they asserted that they had accomplished this undertaking. Few of
                    the ancient writers give credit to the story; but, among the moderns, the Abbé
                    Paris and Montesquieu have contended that this voyage was actually performed.
                    Isaac Vossius and D’Anville have strong doubts; and Dr Vincent and M. Gosselin
                    maintain that such an expedition, at such a period, exceeds all the means and
                    resources of navigation, then in its infancy. Last of all comes Major Rennel,
                    who, in his elucidation of the geography of Herodotus, has done more than all
                    the rest in clearing away the doubts of history; and <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
                    argues the possibility of such a voyage, from the construction of their ships,
                    with flat bottoms and low masts, enabling them to keep close to the land, and to
                    discover and enter into all the creeks and harbours which any part of the coast
                    might present. At all events, one thing is evident: if such an expedition ever
                    circumnavigated the African continent, the fruits of it have nearly, if not
                    entirely, perished.</p>
                <p>About half a century after this supposed expedition, the account of another
                    voyage, down the western coast, is contained' in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Periplus</hi> of Ξanno, which has also called forth many learned and elaborate
                    discussions among modern geographers, some of whom would carry Hanno to the
                    Bight of Benin, others only to Sherbro Sound or the river Nun in lat. 28° N.</p>
                <p>The extent to which ancient discovery proceeded along the eastern coast of
                    Africa, has divided the opinion of the learned nearly as much as its progress on
                    the western coast. Delisle, Huet, and Bochart, made the discovery of the coast
                    to extend as far south as Mozambique and Madagascar. D’Anville could trace such
                    discovery no farther than to Cape Delgado; and Μ. Gosselin contends that the
                    ancients never proceeded down the coast beyond Brava. But Dr Vincent, who has
                    entered more profoundly into the subject than any of his predecessors, and
                    brought a great fund of learning to bear on the question, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Periplus</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Erythrean Sea,</hi> has with
                    great plausibility extended these boundaries to Mozambique and to the island of
                    Madagascar.</p>
                <p>Egypt, under the Ptolemies, the great patrons of science and promoters of
                    discovery, possessing the advantage of the only great river which falls from the
                    African continent into the Mediterranean, made no progress beyond its ancient
                    boundaries; and though the Romans, who subsequently possessed Egypt, penetrated
                    beyond the limits of their own dependencies, they extended their discoveries no
                    further than Fezzan in one direction, and, at a later period, beyond Nubia as
                    far as Abyssinia, and the regions of the Upper Nile. We know nothing of the
                    progress made by the Carthaginians in the discovery of Interior Africa; but
                    although it has been asserted that their merchants had reached the banks of the
                    interior river, which we call the Kawara or Niger, they have left nothing on
                    record that will warrant such a supposition. The story told by Herodotus, of
                    some Nasamonians crossing the desert, and arriving at a large river, can only be
                    applicable to some western arm of the Nile. The people from whom we derive the
                    first information concerning the interior of Northern Africa are the Arabs, who,
                    by means of the camel, were able to penetrate across the great desert to the
                    very centre of the continent, and along the two coasts as far as the Senegal and
                    the Gambia on the west, and to Sofala on the east. On this latter coast they not
                    only explored to an extent far beyond any supposed limits of ancient discovery,
                    but planted colonies at Sofala, Mombas, Melinda, and at various other
                    places.</p>
                <p>The 15th century produced a new era in maritime discovery. The voyages of the
                    Portuguese were the first to give anything like an accurate outline of the two
                    coasts, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n267/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0267-0246"/> and to complete the circumnavigation of Africa.
                    The discovery of America and the West India islands gave rise to that horrid
                    traffic in African negroes, which has since been suppressed; but this traffic
                    has been the means of acquiring a more extended and accurate knowledge of that
                    part of the coast which lies between the rivers Senegal and the Cameroons, as
                    well as of the manners and character of the people who inhabit this extended
                    line of coast. With the English and French settlements in Africa began a
                    systematic survey of the coast, and portions of the interior.</p>
                <p>The uncertainty and confusion that prevailed in the geography of the interior of
                    Africa induced a few learned and scientific individuals to form themselves into
                    an association for promoting the exploration of Inner Africa. This society was
                    formed in London in 1788, and under its auspices important additions were made
                    to the geography of Africa by Houghton, Mungo Park, Hornemann, and Burckhardt.
                    Repeated failures, however, at length discouraged the association from engaging
                    other missionaries, and it subsequently merged in the Royal Geographical Society
                    in 1831.</p>
                <p>During the last sixty years more has been done to make us acquainted with the
                    geography of Africa than during the whole of the 1700 previous years, since
                    Ptolemy, taken together. With Mungo Park, strictly speaking, commences the era
                    of unceasing endeavours to explore the interior.</p>
                <p>Mungo Park proceeded in 1795 from the river Gambia on the west coast, to the
                    Joliba (commonly called Niger), traced this river as far as the town of Silla,
                    explored the intervening countries, determined the southern confines of the
                    Sahara, and returned in 1797. In 1805 this adventurous traveller embarked on a
                    second journey in the same regions, for the purpose of descending down the river
                    Joliba to its mouth. This journey added little to the discoveries already made,
                    and cost the traveller his life. He is ascertained to have passed Timbuktu, and
                    to have reached Boussa, where he was killed by the natives. In 1798 Dr Lacerda,
                    a scientific Portuguese traveller, who had already acquired fame through his
                    journeys in Brazil, made the first great journey in South-Eastern Africa, inland
                    from Mozambique, and reached the capital of the African king, known as the
                    Cazembe, in whose country he died.</p>
                <p>Hornemann, in 1796-98, penetrated from Cairo to Murzuk, and transmitted from that
                    place valuable information respecting the countries to the south, especially
                    Bornu. He then proceeded in that direction, but it is supposed that he soon
                    afterwards perished, as no accounts of his further progress have ever reached
                    Europe. The first actual crossing of the continent that has been recorded was
                    accomplished between the years 1802 and 1806, by two <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pom-beirοs</hi> or mercantile traders in the employment of the Portuguese, who
                    passed from Angola eastward through the territories of the Muata Hianvo and the
                    Cazembe, to the possessions on the Zambeze. In 1816 an expedition was sent out
                    by the English Government, under the command of Captain Tuckey, to the river
                    Congo, which was at that time believed to be the lower course of the Joliba.
                    This was a disastrous undertaking, and the geographical additions were but
                    slight, the river having been ascended a distance of only 280 miles.</p>
                <p>In 1819 Lyon and Ritchie penetrated from Tripoli to Murzuk, and a little distance
                    beyond that place.</p>
                <p>In 1822 Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney set forth from Tripoli in the same
                    direction, crossed the Great Desert, and reached, on the 4th February 1823, the
                    great lake Tsad or Chad. The surrounding countries were explored as far as
                    Sakatu in the west, and Mandara in the south. This journey was altogether one of
                    the most successful and important into the interior. Oudney died in Bornu, but
                    Clapperton undertook a second journey from the coast of Guinea, crossed the
                    Kawara, and arrived at Sakatu, at which place he also died. His servant, Richard
                    Lander, returned to England, after having explored a part of the adjoining
                    regions.</p>
                <p>Major Laing succeeded in reaching Timbuktu from Tripoli, but was murdered on his
                    return in the desert.</p>
                <p>In 1827 and 1828 Caillié set out from the Rio Nunez on the western coast, reached
                    Timbuktu, and returned from that place through the Great Desert to Marocco. A
                    second Portuguese journey was undertaken in 1830 from Mozambique to the
                    Cazembe’s dominions, and Major Monteiro, the leader of the expedition, more
                    fortunate than his predecessor Dr Lacerda, was enabled to complete a map of the
                    country traversed, and to bring back a complete account of this portion of the
                    interior.</p>
                <p>The termination of the Joliba, Kawara, or Niger, remained in obscurity till 1830,
                    when it was ascertained by Lander and his brother, who succeeded in tracing the
                    river from Yaouri down to its mouth. They embarked on a second expedition, which
                    sailed in 1832, for the purpose of ascending the Kawara as far as Timbuktu. But
                    only Rabba was reached, and the general results of the expedition were most
                    disastrous.</p>
                <p>The great Niger expedition, similar to the foregoing, consisted of three
                    steam-vessels, and was despatched by the Government in 1841, under Captain
                    Trotter. It proved a failure, and resulted in a melancholy loss of life.</p>
                <p>In the region between the Kawara and the coast, Mr Duncan, one of the survivors
                    of the Niger expedition, made some additions to our geographical knowledge by
                    his journey to Adafoodia, in 1845-46. This enterprising traveller met with an
                    untimely death in a second attempt in the same region for the purpose of
                    reaching Timbuktu.</p>
                <p>The preceding journeys were confined chiefly to the northern and western portions
                    of the continent. A much greater number of travellers explored the regions
                    drained by the Nile, the salubrity of which, particularly of Abyssinia, is so
                    infinitely greater than that of Western Africa, that among the many explorers of
                    the former, a very small proportion have died as compared with the immense loss
                    of life in Western Africa. Among the most distinguished of the earlier East
                    African travellers are Bruce (1768-73), Browne (1793), who reached Darfur,
                    Burckhardt (1814), Cailliaud (1819), and more recently Rüppel (1824-25),
                    Russegger (1837), D’Abbadie (1838- 44), Beke (1840-44), D’Arnaud and Werne on
                    the White Nile (1840-42), and Brun Rollet (1845).</p>
                <p>Though the Dutch settlement in South Africa was founded as early as 1650, not
                    much information of the interior of that portion of the continent was gained
                    till the end of the 18th century, when a series of journeys was commenced by
                    Sparrmann, and followed up by Vaillant, Barrow, Trotter, Somerville,
                    Lichtenstein, Burchell (1812), Campbell, Thomson, Smith, Alexander (1836-37),
                    and Harris.</p>
                <p>A station of the Church Missionary Society was established near Mombas, in about
                    4° S. lat. on the east coast of Africa, in 1845, and the zealous missionaries in
                    charge of it began to make exploring journeys into the interior. Thus, early in
                    1849, the Rev. Mr Rebmann discovered the great snow-clad mountain of
                    Kilima-njaro, rising on the edge of the inland plateau; and his companion, Dr
                    Krapf, taking a more northerly route, came in sight of a second huge mountain
                    named Kenia, also snow-clad, though directly beneath the equator. Frequent
                    reports reached these missionaries of vast lakes in the interior beyond the
                    mountains they had discovered, and their information awakened a great interest
                    in this region at home.</p>
                <p>About this time an embassy, for the purpose of concluding commercial treaties
                    with the chiefs of Northern Africa, as far as Lake Chad, by which the legitimate
                    trade of these countries should be extended and the system of slavery abolished,
                    was originated by Mr James Richardson, who <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n268/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0268-0247"/> left England for this purpose in 1849,
                    accompanied by Drs Barth and Overweg. The expedition had already almost reached
                    the scene of its labours when Richardson died; Overweg also fell a victim to his
                    exertions, but Dr Barth continued his explorations till 1856. During this time
                    he traversed in many directions almost the whole of the northern Soudan,
                    completing a scries of journeys which must always remain most conspicuous in
                    North African travel, and upon which we are still dependent for the greater part
                    of our knowledge of the central negro states.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1849, Dr Livingstone, who, as an agent of the London Missionary
                    Society, had laboured and travelled in the countries immediately north of the
                    Cape Colony since 1840, began those remarkable journeys in the interior of
                    Southern Africa, which have continued until the present time, and have given to
                    him the first place among African discoverers. The finding of Lake Ngami, the
                    central point of the continental drainage of South Africa, was the great
                    discovery of the first year.</p>
                <p>Two journeys from the west coast now claim attention. In 1846 a Portuguese trader
                    named Graça succeeded in again reaching the country of the South African
                    potentate, named the Muata Yanvo, from Angola; he was followed by a Hungarian
                    named Ladislaus Magyar, who explored the central country in various directions
                    from 1847 to 1851. Between 1851 and 1853 Livingstone made two journeys northward
                    from his station in the land of the Bechuanas, and was the first European to
                    embark upon the upper course of the Zambeze. From the Makololo country, in the
                    central part of the river basin, he now led a party of natives westwards
                    up-stream to the water-parting of the continent at the little Lake Dilolo, and
                    thence to the western slope, reaching the Portuguese coast at Loanda in
                    1854.</p>
                <p>During 1851 Galton explored a part of the south-western country inhabited by the
                    Damaras and Ovampo, from Walfisch Bay to a point in lat. 17° 58' S., and long.
                    21° E., determining accurately a number of positions in this region. On the
                    south-east, also, Gassiot made an interesting journey from Port Natal
                    north-westward through the mountains to the river Limpopo.</p>
                <p>Two most remarkable journeys across the whole continent now follow in order; the
                    one, made by Silva Porto, a Portuguese trader, who leaving Benguela in 1853,
                    took an eastward route, parallel to but considerably northward of the Zambeze,
                    over perfectly unknown country. He then rounded the southern end of the Lake
                    Nyassa (afterwards explored by Livingstone), and made his way across the east
                    coast-land to the mouth of the Rovuma river, having spent a year and two months
                    in his tedious march. The other was executed by Livingstone, who in returning
                    (1855-56) by a somewhat more northerly route than that travelled over in going
                    westward to Loanda, descended the Zambeze to its mouth at Quilimane, discovering
                    the wonderful Victoria Falls of the river on his way.</p>
                <p>In 1856 an important addition was made to the more exact geography of Africa, in
                    a survey of the greater part of the course of the Orange river, by Mr Moffat, a
                    son of the veteran South African missionary.</p>
                <p>The following year was one of great activity in African exploration. Damara Land,
                    in the south-west, was traversed Ry Messrs Hahn and Rath as far as the southern
                    limit of the Portuguese territory at the Cunene river; Dr Bastian was exploring
                    the interior of Congo and Angola, and Du Chaillu had begun his first journey in
                    the forest country of the Fan tribes on the equatorial west coast. Under the
                    auspices of the Royal Geographical Society, Captains Burton and Speke, already
                    distinguished by their perilous journey to Harar, a trading centre in the Somali
                    and Galla country of the east African promontory, set out from Zanzibar, to
                    ascertain the truth about the great inland lakes which had been reported by the
                    Mombas missionaries. Their most successful journey (1857-59) resulted in the
                    discovery of Lake Tanganyika, in a deep basin, between 3° and 8° S. lat., and of
                    the southern portion of a perhaps greater lake northward, supposed by Speke, its
                    discoverer, to be the head reservoir of the Nile.</p>
                <p>In a new journey in the Zambeze region in 1859, Dr Livingstone, accompanied by Dr
                    Kirk, traced the Shire river, a northern tributary of the Zambeze, to its
                    outflow from the Nyassa, the most southerly of the great African chain of fresh
                    lakes.</p>
                <p>About this time also several travellers (Petherick (1858), Lejean, Miani, the
                    Poncets, Antinori, Debono, Peney) were adding much to the existing knowledge of
                    the Upper White Nile from the Egyptian side; and in the north the Algerian
                    Sahara was being explored by the French scientific traveller Duveyrier.</p>
                <p>In 1860 Captain Speke, anxious to extend knowledge of the great inland reservoirs
                    which had been discovered in his former journey, and to connect them with the
                    known countries to northward, accompanied by Captain Grant, again left Zanzibar.
                    Reaching a point on the north-western shores of the great lake which he had
                    previously made known, and which he now named the Victoria Nyanza, the traveller
                    thence traced the outflowing river to the White Nile at Gondokoro, thus
                    completing a great link in the chain of African discoveries, which binds the
                    country known from the east coast to that explored from the side of Egypt.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Dr Livingstone had endeavoured to find a way to his newly-discovered
                    Lake Nyassa from the mouth of the Rovuma, a large river which flows to the
                    Indian Ocean near Cape Delgado, and which was also reported to take its rise in
                    this lake, but the river proved to be unnavigable beyond a point not far from
                    the sea. He returned then (in 1861) to the Shire river; and, carrying a boat
                    past its rapids, launched out to explore the whole length of Lake Nyassa.</p>
                <p>A series of important journeys by Gerhard Rohlfs had now (1861) begun in Marocco
                    and in the Maroccan Sahara; and on the equatorial east coast region, Baron von
                    der Decken had extended Rebmann’s information in the region of the snowy
                    mountain, Kilima-njaro.</p>
                <p>In the south the artist Baines had crossed the Kalahari Desert from Damara Land
                    to the falls of the Zambeze. In 1862 Petherick made an important journey of
                    exploration in the Nile region west of Gondokoro.</p>
                <p>The year 1864 was marked by the discovery of a second great reservoir lake of the
                    Nile, near the latitude of the Victoria Nyanza, by Baker, pushing southward from
                    Gondokoro. This lake the discoverer named the Albert Nyanza. During this year
                    also, Rohlfs extended his travels from Marocco to the oasis of Tuat, thence
                    making his way to Ghadames and Tripoli; in Western Africa, the officers of the
                    French marine stationed at the Gaboon explored the delta region of the great
                    Ogowai river; and Du Chaillu, in a second journey (1864-65), entered the gorilla
                    country of Ashango, south of this river; whilst, on the east coast, Baron von
                    der Decken attempted the navigation of the Juba, but was destined to fall a
                    martyr to the jealousies of the Galla and Somali tribes, whose territories the
                    river divides.</p>
                <p>After a short stay at Tripoli, the traveller Rohlfs again turned southward, and
                    in a journey which lasted from 1865 to 1867, crossed the whole northern
                    continent—first reaching Lake Chad by almost the same route as that formerly
                    taken by Barth, and thence striking south-westward by a new path to the Bight of
                    Benin.</p>
                <p>In 1866 some progress was made in discovery in the west, by the navigation of the
                    Ogowai river by Walker, for 200 miles from its mouth. Hahn and Rath also
                    extended <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n269/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0269-0248"/> their exploration of Damara Land. On the eastern
                    side Messrs Wakefield and New, the successors of Krapf and Rebmann in the Mombas
                    Mission, made numerous short journeys in the Galla country, and the former
                    collected very valuable native information respecting the countries lying
                    between this coast-land and the great lakes of the Nile basin. In this year also
                    Dr Livingstone had again entered the Rovuma river, beginning that greatest of
                    all his journeys from which he has not yet (1873) returned, and the outline of
                    which we shall notice further on.</p>
                <p>Still farther south, in 1866-67, the discovery of gold in the mountains between
                    the Zambeze and Limpopo rivers, by the pioneer Mauch, gave great impetus to
                    exploration in this part of the continent. The years 1867-68 brought the
                    memorable Abyssinian campaign, and the accurate records kept of the line of
                    march on the high land from Massowah to Magdala formed a most valuable
                    contribution to African geography.</p>
                <p>Most important in the following years (1869-71) were the researches of the
                    botanist, Dr Schweinfurth, in the region of the complicated network of
                    tributaries received by the White Nile west of Gondokoro, during which he passed
                    the water-parting of the Nile basin in this direction, and came into a new area
                    of drainage, possibly belonging to the system of Lake Chad; and the outsetting
                    of a great Egyptian military expedition (1869) by Sir Samuel Baker, for the
                    purpose of exploration of the Upper Nile and of the extermination of slave
                    traffic on the river, and to plant Egyptian military posts in the regions
                    visited.</p>
                <p>The letters received from time to time in this country from Dr-Livingstone enable
                    us to trace roughly his movements from 1866 to the present time as follows
                    :—Arriving from Bombay, on the East African coast, near the mouth of the Rovuma,
                    he passed up the course of this river to the confluence of its main tributary
                    branches, one coming from the north-west, the other from south-west. Following
                    the latter arm, the traveller appears to have gone round the southern end of the
                    Lake Nyassa, and, marching then in a north-westerly direction, he crossed the
                    head waters of the Aruangoa tributary of the Zambeze, near the track of Lacerda,
                    in the previous century; ascending a high land, he came upon a portion of the
                    Chambeze river, belonging to a different basin, and continuing in a
                    northwesterly direction, discovered Lake Liemba, a southern extension of Lake
                    Tanganyika, in April 1867. Thence he turned to the Cazembe’s town, and in
                    journeys northward and southward from this point, made known the two great
                    lakes, Moero (Sept. 1867), and Bangweolo or Bemba (July 1868), which form part
                    of a new system, connected by the Chambeze (also named the Luapula and Lualaba)
                    river in a basin south and west of that of the Tanganyika. In 1869 Livingstone
                    had made his way to Ujiji, Burton’s halting-place, on the eastern shore of the
                    Tanganyika. Hence, crossing the lake, he penetrated the dense tropical forests
                    and swamps of Manyuema country, in the heart of the southern portion of the
                    continent, and during 1870-71 traced the vast river (Lualaba) flowing out of the
                    Lake Moero, in its north and westerly course, to a second, and then a third
                    great expansion—Lake Kamalondo the one, and the other a still unvisited body of
                    water lying in about 3° S. lat., and 25° or 26° E. long; also learning, by
                    native report, that the Lualaba (which is in all probability the upper course of
                    the mighty Congo river) received a great tributary from south-westward. This
                    south-western arm also expands into a vast lake, which Livingstone has named, in
                    anticipation, Lake Lincoln.</p>
                <p>Though the untruth of a report of Livingstone’s death, near the Nyassa, had been
                    proved by an expedition sent out on his track by the Geographical Society of
                    London in 1867, yet, at the time of his Manyuema journey, the probable fate of
                    the great traveller, from whom no news had come out of Africa for more than two
                    years, became a matter of the greatest anxiety among all classes in Europe and
                    America. This led to a special mission for Dr Livingstone’s aid, generously
                    fitted out at the cost of the proprietor of an American newspaper. Stanley, the
                    leader of this expedition, made a bold march from Zanzibar to Ujiji, on Lake
                    Tanganyika, and was fortunate in meeting the great traveller there, returning
                    from Manyuema, broken down by the severity of the task which he had
                    accomplished, and in need of everything. A boat voyage round the northern end of
                    Tanganyika, undertaken in the latter part of 1871 by Livingstone and Stanley
                    together, proved that this great lake has no apparent outlet in a northerly
                    direction, and leaves the question of its drainage in considerable doubt.</p>
                <p>Recruited in health, and supplied with stores and followers, Livingstone is
                    believed to have started afresh from Unyanyembe, a point midway in the route
                    from Zanzibar to Ujiji, where he parted with Stanley, in autumn of 1872, to
                    carry out a projected journey, in which he will clear up all doubts respecting
                    the ultimate direction of the great Lualaba river.</p>
                <p>Of the expeditions which have been progressing in Africa contemporaneously with
                    these later journeys of Dr Livingstone, that of Sir Samuel Baker is perhaps the
                    most important, though its story has until now been one of almost continuous
                    hardship and disaster. Up to the middle of the year 1870, at which time the
                    expedition, consisting of upwards of 1500 men, with numerous vessels, had safely
                    reached a point on the Nile in 9° 26' N. lat., all appears to have gone well;
                    but beyond this the passages of the river had become choked with overgrowth of
                    vegetation, and each yard of advance had to be cut through this living barrier;
                    disease broke out among the troops, and the expedition was reduced to the
                    greatest straits. In the end, however, it appears to have been completely
                    successful, and before Sir Samuel Baker’s return to Egypt in 1873, the whole
                    country, as far south as the equator, had been taken possession of in the name
                    of Egypt, and several garrisons had been planted to maintain the hold.</p>
                <p>Knowledge of the rich country between the Transvaal Republic and the Zambeze has
                    extended with wonderful rapidity, through the exertions of the pioneers Mauch,
                    Mohr, Baines, Elton, and St Vincent Erskine, so that this region has now almost
                    passed out of the category of lands in which geographical discoveries can be
                    made. A point of great interest in the progress of the exploration of this
                    country was the discovery by Mauch, in 1871, of the ruins of an ancient city or
                    fortress, named Zimbaoe, certainly not of African construction, about 200 miles
                    due west from Sofala, in lat. 20° 15' S., long. 30° 45' E., through which it has
                    been sought to identify this region with the Ophir of Scripture. The finding, in
                    1869, of rich diamond fields in the upper valley of the Orange river, and in
                    that of its tributary the Vaal, caused a rush of emigration to these districts,
                    and tended still further to develop this portion of Africa.</p>
                <p>North African exploration is also vigorously progressing. In the west, during
                    1869, Winwood Reade made a journey from Sierra Leone to the head of the Niger,
                    and from 1867 onwards Μ. Munzinger, consul at Massowa, has greatly extended our
                    knowledge of Northern Abyssinia. A notable journey of exploration in the Sahara
                    remains to be mentioned. In 1869 Dr Nachtigal was appointed to carry presents
                    from the King of Prussia to the Sultan of Bornu, on Lake Chad, in acknowledgment
                    of that potentate’s aid to former travellers. Besides accomplishing this
                    mission, this explorer has added very considerably to our knowledge of the
                    Eastern Sahara by investigating the central mountainous country of Tibesti,
                    hitherto only known by report; and in <pb break="no"

                    has proved the existence of an outflowing river from Lake Chad, which has
                    hitherto been believed to be a terminal lake, the freshness of its waters having
                    on this account appeared an anomaly in physical geography.</p>
                <p>With the double purpose of affording support to Dr Livingstone, and of adding to
                    the geography of Equatorial Africa, two expeditions were fitted out by the Royal
                    Geo-graphical Society in 1872. One of these, led by Lieut. Cameron, was planned
                    to follow the footsteps of Livingstone in his present journey from the eastern
                    side, entering the country by the ordinary trade route from Zanzibar towards the
                    Tanganyika. This expedition started from Zanzibar early in 1873, under the
                    auspices of Sir Bartle Frere’s mission, and has now made considerable progress
                    towards the interior. The other, named the “Livingstone Congo Expedition,” under
                    Lieuts. Grandy, is to pass from the west coast to the interior, by following the
                    river Congo, which is almost without doubt the lower course of the great Lualaba
                    river, about to be further explored by Dr Livingstone coming to it from the
                    eastern side. The latest accounts from this expedition are also in the highest
                    degree favourable, and an advance of upwards of 150 miles has already been made
                    from Loanda. A new expedition, under the leadership of the indefatigable
                    traveller Rohlfs, is now in preparation, and is destined to explore the unknown
                    portions of the Libyan desert.</p>
                <p>Thus the exploration of the great continent is slowly advancing year by year, but
                    with earnest and unceasing progress. As yet the only portions of Africa of which
                    we possess any approach to an accurate topographical knowledge are, the Cape
                    Colony and Natal under British rule in the south, the French colony of Algeria,
                    the Portuguese possession of Angola, and Egypt and Tunis, dependent on the
                    Turkish Empire, in the north.</p>
                <p>Throughout the rest of the continent, a network of routes accomplished by
                    travellers gives in most parts the great outline of its features; where these
                    lines interlace more closely, as in the South African Republics, and in
                    Abyssinia, the general aspect of the land is now so well known as to preclude
                    the possibility of any important geographical discovery there; elsewhere,
                    however, the gaps between the tracks are wider. In the vast inhospitable region
                    of the Sahara there are great areas still unknown to civilised man, and the
                    equatorial region of dense forests in Central Africa is still one of the
                    greatest <hi rend="italic">terrae</hi><hi rend="italic">incognitae</hi> of the
                    globe.</p>
                <p>The origin and meaning of the name of this great continent has been a fertile
                    subject for conjecture among philologists and antiquaries. By the Greeks it was
                    called Libya, Λ <hi rend="italic">ιβυη,</hi> and by the Romans Africa. Varro
                    believed he had found the etymology of the former in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Libs,</hi> the Greek name of the south wind; and Servius, the scholiast on
                    Virgil, proposed to derive the other from the Latin word <hi rend="italic"
                    >aprica</hi> (sunny), or the Greek word <hi rend="italic">a-phriké</hi> (without
                    cold). It is more probable that the name Libya was derived by the Greeks from
                    the name of the people whom they found in possession of the country to the
                    westward of Egypt, and who are believed to have been those that are called in
                    the Hebrew Scriptures <hi rend="italic">Lehabim</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lubim.</hi> With respect to the word <hi rend="italic">Africa,</hi> Suidas
                    tells us that it was the proper name of that great city which the Romans called
                    <hi rend="italic">Carthago,</hi> and the Greeks, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Karchedon.</hi> It is certain, at least, that it was applied originally to the
                    country in the immediate neighbourhood of Carthage, that part of the continent
                    first known to the Romans, and that it was subsequently extended with their
                    increasing knowledge, till it came at last to include the whole continent. Of
                    the meaning of the name, the language of Carthage itself supplies a simple and
                    natural explanation; the word <hi rend="italic">Afrygah,</hi> signifying a
                    separate establishment, or in other words a colony, as Carthage was of Tyre. So
                    that the Phoenicians of old, at home, may have spoken of their Afrygah, just as
                    we speak of our colonies. Be that as it may, the Arabs of the present day still
                    give the name of Afrygah or Afrikiyah to the territory of Tunis. It may also be
                    remarked, that the name seems not to have been used by the Romans till after the
                    time of the first Punic war, when they became first acquainted with what they
                    afterwards called <hi rend="italic">Africa Propria.</hi></p>
                <p>Africa lies between the latitudes of 38° N. and 35° S., and is of all the
                    continents the most truly tropical. It is, strictly speaking, an enormous
                    peninsula attached to Asia by the isthmus of Suez. The most northern point is
                    the Cape, situated a little to the west of Cabo Blanco, and opposite Sicily,
                    which lies in lat. 37° 20' 40" N., long. 9° 41' E. Its southernmost point is
                    Cabo d’Agulhas, in 34° 49' 15" S.; the distance between these two points being
                    4330 geographical, or about 5000 English miles. The westernmost point is Cabo
                    Verde, in long. 17° 33' W., its easternmost Cape Jerdaffun, in long. 51° 21' E.,
                    lat. 10° 25' N., the distance between the two points being about the same as its
                    length. The western coasts are washed by the Atlantic, the northern by the
                    Mediterranean, and the eastern by the Indian Ocean.</p>
                <p>The form has been likened to a triangle, or to an oval, but such a comparison is
                    scarcely warranted, it being of an irregular shape, the northern half rounding
                    off, the southern one Contracting and terminating in a point.</p>
                <p>The superficial extent of Africa has never been accurately determined, but may be
                    taken at 9,858,000 geographical square miles, exclusive of the islands. It is
                    larger than either Europe or Australia, but smaller than Asia and the New
                    World.</p>
                <p>The coast line of Africa is very regular and unbroken, presenting few bays and
                    peninsulas. The chief indentation is formed by the Gulf of Guinea, with its two
                    secondary divisions, the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Biafra. On the northern
                    coast, the Gulf of Sidra and the Gulf of Kabes must be mentioned, and on the
                    eastern coast the Gulf of Arabia.</p>
                <p>The physical configuration may be considered under two heads, the great
                    lower-lands and plains of Northern Africa, and the great table-lands, with their
                    mountain ranges and groups, of Central and Southern Africa. The great northern
                    lower-land comprises the Sahara, the Lake Chad region, and the valley of the
                    Lower Nile. The Sahara is by no means a plain throughout, but for the greater
                    part it rises into table-lands, interspersed with mountain groups of 6000 feet
                    elevation, and probably more, and the term lower-lands can only be applied to it
                    in a general way, to distinguish it from the more elevated region to the
                    south.</p>
                <p>The Sahara has often been pictured as a monotonous and immense expanse of sand;
                    but nothing could be more erroneous, as the greatest variety exists in the
                    physical configuration of its surface, as well as in its geological features.
                    Our knowledge is as yet too scanty to enable us to trace its features in every
                    part. On the north, this great desert is fringed with extensive table-lands,
                    which in some places rise abruptly from the Mediterranean, as the great plateau
                    of Barbary, extending through Marocco, Algeria, and Tunis, and the table-land of
                    Barca, elevated 1500 feet, and gradually descending towards the Delta of the
                    Nile.. This elevated ground is succeeded to the south by a depressed region,
                    which extends from the Great Syrtis or Gulf of Sidra, in a general direction as
                    far as Middle Egypt, and comprises the oases of Augila and Siwah. So greatly
                    depressed is this region, that the level of the oasis of Siwah is 100 feet, and
                    in one place (Bahrein) even 167 feet below the level of the sea. The western
                    portions of this country, between the oases of Augila and Siwah, explored in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n271/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0271-0250"/> 1869 by the traveller Rohlfs, were found to be
                    everywhere from 100 to 150 feet beneath the level of the Mediterranean; and M.
                    de Lesseps, in conducting a survey from the Egyptian side, found the eastern
                    part to be much beneath the level of the Nile. Here then must be one of the
                    greatest areas of depression in the land of the globe, comparable with that
                    which surrounds the Caspian Sea. This depressed region is again followed by a
                    table-land of considerable extent and width, extending from the Gulf of Kabes in
                    a southerly direction, along the Tripoline shores, and probably traversing, in
                    the same direction, the Libyan Desert, and reaching as far as the Nile, near the
                    first cataract. Its north-western part, as far as Sokna, consists of the
                    Hamadah, a stony, dreary, and extensive table-land, of from 1500 to 2000 feet
                    high, “which seems to be like a broad belt intercepting the progress of
                    commerce, civilisation, and conquest, from the shores of the Mediterranean to
                    Central Africa.” Near Sokna this plateau breaks up and forms what are called the
                    Jebel-es-Soda, or Black Mountains, a most picturesque group of cliffs; and
                    again, on the route from Murzuk to Egypt, it also breaks into huge cliff's, and
                    bears the name of El-Harouj. The whole of the central portion of the Northern
                    Sahara, as far south as the plateau of Air or Asben, is occupied by similar bare
                    table-lands, with lower areas of sand dunes between. Numerous wadys, the only
                    inhabited parts of the country, intersect the slopes of these plateaux. The
                    country of Ahaggar, between 23° and 29° N. lat., and 5° E. long., appears to
                    form the central elevation from which the greater of these dry water-courses
                    radiate; from it a series of long wadys—one of them, the wady Rharis or
                    Igharghar, being about 600 miles in length—run northward towards a depressed
                    country which lies inland from the Gulf of Cabes, and contains several salt
                    lagoons, covered with a few feet of water in winter, but dried up in summer, and
                    lying considerably below the Mediterranean level. Other wadys radiate west and
                    south-west from Ahaggar to the unknown region of the Sahara, which lies between
                    this and the northern bend of the Niger. The most truly desert region of the
                    Sahara is an irregular belt of shifting sand dunes, the “Erg” or “Areg,” which
                    stretches from the lagoons above referred to near the Mediterranean coast
                    south-westward to near the river Senegal and the Atlantic, in an unbroken chain
                    for upwards of 2000 miles, and having an average width of perhaps 200 miles. In
                    this sand belt the wadys of the inward slope of the plateau of Barbary
                    terminate, excepting the Wady Saura, which crosses the Erg to the important
                    oasis of Tuat, near the centre of its southern border, and the Wady Draa, which
                    turns to the Atlantic coast. From Wady Draa a great plain extends along the
                    western shore as far as the river Senegal, and probably continues as such to the
                    east towards Timbuktu, and thence to Lake Chad. Thus it appears that the western
                    half of the Sahara is surrounded by a broad belt of plains and depressions, the
                    central parts being formed by extensive table-lands, with occasional mountain
                    knots, such as that which forms the fertile kingdom of Air and Asben, the
                    culminating points of which are from 4000 to 5000 feet high.</p>
                <p>The eastern portion of the Sahara appears to have nearly the same general
                    elevation as the western half, and near its centre several fertile mountain
                    regions, comparable with that of Asben, are known. Such is the mountainous
                    country of Borgu, north-east of the kingdoms which surround Lake Chad, and
                    Tibesti, north of it, in the centre of the Tibbu district, recently explored by
                    Dr Nachtigal, who found rich vegetation and abundant animal life in the valleys
                    of this mountain group.</p>
                <p>To the south and east of the region just described Africa may be considered as
                    one connected mass of elevated land, comprising the most extensive table-lands,
                    as well as high mountain groups and chains.</p>
                <p>The great mass of the African plateau land is to southward of the 10th parallel
                    of N. latitude, but it is prolonged on the eastern side almost to the north
                    coast of the continent by the wedge-shaped table-land of Abyssinia, the highest
                    surface in Africa, and by the mountains which extend from it between the lower
                    course of the Nile and the Red Sea. The terminal point of the high land in this
                    direction may be said to be Jebel Attaka, which rises immediately west of Suez
                    to a height of 2640 feet. From this point to the southern extremity of the
                    continent the eastern, and generally higher edge, of the great plateau runs in
                    an almost unbroken line. Passing southwards along its margin, the most prominent
                    heights before the table-land of Abyssinia is reached are Mounts Elba, 6900, and
                    Soturba, 6000 feet in elevation, near the middle of the African coast of the Red
                    Sea. There may, however, be greater heights in the little known region of Nubia,
                    which lies between these mountains and the Nile.</p>
                <p>The eastern slope of the Abyssinian plateau begins immediately south of the port
                    of Massowah, and is a uniform line of steep descent, unbroken by any river,
                    falling abruptly from an average height of 7000 feet to the depressed plain
                    which here skirts the coast of the Red Sea. This edge, which extends southward
                    for at least 800 miles, forms the water-parting of the rivers which have
                    furrowed deeply into the opposite slopes of the plateau, and appears to be
                    higher than the general surface of the country; yet several lofty groups of
                    mountains rising from the level of the high land attain a much greater
                    elevation, and Mount Abba Jared, the highest known point, is estimated at 15,000
                    feet above tho sea. Between the most southern part of Abyssinia which is known
                    and the equator, where the edge of the plateau has again been partly explored, a
                    long space of unknown country intervenes; but there is every reason to believe
                    that the slope is continuous. Mount Kenia, 18,000 feet, and Kilimanjaro, 18,715
                    feet, the highest points in all Africa, mark the eastern edge under the equator;
                    further south on tho inland route from Zanzibar to the Tanganyika, the edge is
                    known as the Rubeho Mountains, with a height of 5700 feet at the pass by which
                    they are crossed on the caravan route. Still further, the edge is again known
                    where it forms a rampart, called the Njesa, walling in the Nyassa Lake. From
                    this point Mount Zomba, 7000 feet high, near Lake Shirwa, Mount Milanje, 8000
                    feet, and Mount Clarendon, 6000 feet, carry it south to where the Zambeze river
                    makes the first break in its uniform line. The narrows and rapids of Lupata,
                    below the town of Tete, mark the point at which the river breaks through the
                    plateau land to the coast slope beneath it. Passing the river, the eastern edge
                    is again followed in the Mashona and Matoppo Mountains (7200 feet) of
                    Mosilikatse’s kingdom, from which heights the chief tributaries of the Limpopo
                    river flow. At the headwaters of that river the plateau edge forms the Hooge
                    Veldt of the Transvaal Republic which joins with the Kathlamba or Drakenberg.
                    The portion of the edge which bears this name is specially prominent: it runs
                    southward in a huge wall of rocky crags which support the table-land behind for
                    500 miles, almost parallel with the coast, and at a distance of 150 miles from
                    it, having Zulu Land, Natal, and Caffraria on the slopes of the spurs which it
                    throws down to the coast. In the Transvaal Republic, where the Drakenberg joins
                    the Hooge Veldt, the edge attains a height of 8725 feet in the summit named
                    after the explorer Mauch, but it is highest where it forms the interior limit of
                    Natal, and where Cathkin Peak rises to 10,357 feet above the sea.</p>

                    and the streams which form tho Orange river flow down its inward slope. There is
                    no break in the continuance of the edge where it passes round from the
                    Drakenberg to form the inmost and highest of the alternate ridges and terraces
                    of the Cape Colony. It is now named in successive parts from east to west the
                    Storm Berge, the Zuur Berg, Schnee Berge, Nieuwe-veld, and Rogge-veld, the
                    last-named portion of the edge turning northward with the bend of the western
                    coast. Its greatest height within the Cape Colony is in Compass Berg, the summit
                    of the Schnee Berge, 8500 feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>The outer terraces of the Cape Colony, in which two chief ridges may be traced,
                    lie closer together, and much nearer the coast; between these and the inmost or
                    chief edge is the dry elevated region known as the Great Karroo. Their elevation
                    is also very considerable, though they are broken through by lines of drainage
                    sloping from the chief edge; the part of the middle ridge, which is named the
                    Little Zwarte Berge, attains 7628 feet, and several points in both are upwards
                    of 6000 feet above the sea. Table Mountain, a well-known and flat-topped mass of
                    granite overhanging Cape Town, 3550 feet high, is the nucleus of the peninsula
                    which extends south to form the Cape of Good Hope, but is altogether separated
                    from the mountain ridges of the colony.</p>
                <p>The western edge of the great African plateau is generally lower than the
                    eastern, since the whole slope of the continent is more or less from the great
                    heights on its eastern side, towards the west, but it is also clearlytraceable,
                    and of great height throughout. Rounding the western side of the Cape Colony,
                    the three ridges above noticed run together, and decrease somewhat in elevation
                    as the mouth of the Orange river is approached. Their elevation at the point of
                    union in Little Namaqua Land is still very considerable; and here Mount Welcome
                    attains 5130 feet, and Vogelklip, to north of it, 4343 feet above the sea.
                    Beyond the Orange river in Namaqua and Damara Lands, the western edge continues
                    in one or more terraces parallel to the coast. Mount Omatako, in the latter
                    country, rises to 8800 feet. Northward, through Benguela and Angola, a more
                    broken series of ridges and terraces mark the descent from the interior plateau,
                    and the great Congo river breaks through to the coast-land at the place where it
                    forms the cataracts of the narrow gorge of Yellala. Sierra Complida is the name
                    given by the Portuguese to that part of the western edge which runs between the
                    Congo and the rapids of the lower Ogowai river on the equator. On the plateau
                    edge at the southern side of this river, Du Chaillu has made known a mountain of
                    12,000 feet in elevation; and the furthest point which has been reached on the
                    Ogowai was in the vicinity of high mountains. Passing the Ogowai, and following
                    the coast of the Bight of Biafra, the edge is now known as the Sierra do
                    Crystal. The Camaroon mountains, at the head of the gulf, form a high peninsula
                    of volcanic mountains, rising to 13,700 feet; but are isolated from the plateau
                    lands, and belong rather to the remarkable line of volcanic heights which shows
                    itself in the islands of Fernando Po, Prince’s Island, St Thomas, and Annobon,
                    stretching away into the ocean in the direction of St Helena. From the Sierra do
                    Crystal the plateau edge inclines towards the lower course of the river Niger to
                    a point above its delta, and below the confluence of the Benue, and then turns
                    abruptly to the east.</p>
                <p>The heights which skirt the northern coast-land of the Gulf of Guinea, and which
                    stretch as far as the head-waters of the Senegal and Gambia, and in the inner
                    slope of which the Niger also has its sources, may be considered as an extension
                    from the great plateau. But they are of smaller general elevation; and that best
                    known part of the ridge, which has the name of the Kong Mountains, is apparently
                    not higher than from 2000 to 3000 feet.</p>
                <p>The northern edge of the great African plateau is almost unknown; but there are
                    evidences that it runs eastward between the 4th and 8th parallels of N.
                    latitude, to a point at which it is well known, and where the Nile falls over
                    its slope, forming the succession of rapids above Gondokoro. The character of
                    the upper Benue river is that of a mountain-born river: and Mounts Alantika,
                    10,000 feet high, and Mindif, 6000 feet, which rise to southward of Lake Chad,
                    seem to be the outliers of the plateau edge in which the Benue has its sources.
                    Beyond the Nile the margin of the plateau curves northward, to form the inner
                    slope of the Abyssinian table-land.</p>
                <p>The general elevation of the surface of the great African plateau, the limits of
                    which have now been traced, may be taken at from 3000 to 4000 feet above the
                    sea; but its surface presents very great undulations, from tho depressions which
                    are occupied by some of the great lakes, to the high mountains which rise above
                    its average level. The most prominent of these interior masses yet known are the
                    Blue Mountains, discovered by Baker, rising from the western shore of the Albert
                    Lake to a height of perhaps 10,000 feet, and which are believed to extend
                    southward to unite with the Balegga Mountains, made known by Livingstone in his
                    journey of 1871, north-west of Lake Tanganyika; these again are believed to join
                    with the mountains which rise midway between the Victoria, the Albert Nyanza,
                    and the Tanganyika, dividing the drainage to these vast lakes, and rising here
                    in Mount M’fumbiro to upwards of 10,000 feet. Another great central line of
                    heights which also had an important part in directing the water-shed of the
                    interior of South Africa, runs from the north of the Nyassa Lake, where it is
                    named the Lobisa plateau, through the Muchinga Mountains, which separate the
                    drainage of the Lualaba and its lakes from that of the Zambeze basin, westward
                    to the heights in the far interior of Angola, known as the Mossamba Mountains,
                    and from which rivers flow in all directions.</p>
                <p>The plateau of Barbary, in the north of the continent, beyond the lower land of
                    the Sahara, is a distinct and separate high land, stretching from Cape Bon, on
                    the Mediterranean coast opposite Sicily, in a south-westerly direction to the
                    Atlantic coast, through Tunis, Algeria, and Marocco. The eastern portion of it
                    in Algeria and Tunis rises in a broad plateau from 2000 to 3000 feet in general
                    height, with outer heights, enclosing an elevated steppe, at a distance of about
                    100 miles apart. On the west, where it enters Marocco, these outer ridges draw
                    together and form the high ranges of the Atlas Mountains, rising to a much
                    greater elevation, and attaining 11,400 feet in the summit named Mount
                    Miltsin.</p>
                <p>The African continent, as far as it has yet been explored, seems to be the
                    portion of the globe least disturbed by volcanic action. The known active
                    volcanoes in the continent are those of the Camaroon Mountains, on the coast of
                    the Gulf of Guinea in the west, and the Artali volcano in the depressed region
                    of the salt desert which lies between the Abyssinian plateau and the Red Sea.
                    This latter volcano is probably a part of the system with which the volcanic
                    island of Jebel Tur, in the Red Sea, near the same latitude, is connected. One
                    other active volcano only is known by report,—the Njemsi volcano, in the country
                    between Mount Kenia and the Victoria Lake. Shocks of earthquake appear to be
                    almost unknown in any part of the continent. It has been pointed out by the late
                    Sir Roderick Murchison that the older rocks which are known to circle round the
                    continent, unquestionably included an interior marshy or lacustrine country, and
                    that the present centre zone of waters, whether lakes, rivers, or marshes,
                    extending from Lake Chad to Lake Ngami, are but the great modern residual
                    phenomena of those <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0273-0252"/> of a mesozoic age. The surface of the South
                    African continent has not been diversified in recent times by the outpouring of
                    lava streams, or broken up by the efforts of subterranean heat to escape. Nor
                    has it been subjected to those great oscillations by which the surfaces of many
                    other countries have been so placed under the waters of the ocean as to have
                    been strewed over with erratic blocks and marine exuviae. The interior of South
                    Africa may therefore be viewed as a country of very ancient conservative
                    terrestrial character. Knowledge of the special geology of Africa is yet
                    confined to the few parts of the continent in which Europeans have permanently
                    settled. In this respect the southern region of the Cape Colony and Natal have
                    advanced furthest, and their geological features have been mapped out with some
                    accuracy. Elsewhere in the continent, excepting in Algeria and Angola, light has
                    only been thrown along the line followed by the few explorers who have given
                    attention to this subject.</p>
                <p>Among the minerals of Africa, salt is widely distributed, though in some
                    districts wholly wanting. Thus in the Abyssinian high land the salt, which is
                    brought up in small blocks from the depressed salt plain on the Red Sea coast
                    beneath, is so valued as to be used as a money currency; and in the native
                    kingdoms of South Central Africa, the salt districts are royal possessions
                    strictly guarded. Metals seem nowhere very abundant. Gold is perhaps the most
                    generally distributed. The gold-fields of the Transvaal Republic and of the
                    country which extends thence to the Zambeze, are numerous; but no yield has as
                    yet been discovered of sufficient quantity to overcome the difficulties of
                    working, and of transport to the distant sea-ports, to which no navigable rivers
                    lead from this region. Copper is known to exist in large quantities in the
                    mountains of native kingdoms of the centre of South Africa; and one of the
                    objects of Dr Livingstone’s present journey is to visit the famed copper country
                    of Katanga south-west of the Tanganyika Lake. The diamond-fields in the
                    districts of the Vaal and Orange rivers north of the Cape Colony are now
                    steadily worked, and give good returns.</p>
                <p>Africa is the only one of the continents of the globe which lies equally to north
                    and south of the equator, and the portions of it which extend beyond the tropics
                    do not advance far into the temperate zones. From this it results that Africa,
                    besides being the warmest of all the continents, has also the most equal
                    distribution of the sun’s heat during the seasons over the parts which lie north
                    and south of the central line. Winds and rain, depending on the distribution of
                    heat, are also correspondingly developed in these two great divisions of the
                    continent, and the broad landscape zones, passing from humid forest to arid
                    sandy desert, also agree exactly with one another north and south of Equatorial
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>Between 10° N. and 10° S. of the equator, but especially in that portion of it
                    the outskirts of which have only as yet been reached by travellers, Africa
                    appears to be a land of dense tropical forest. Wherever it has been penetrated,
                    travellers speak of an excessively rank vegetation; passage has to be forced
                    through thick underwood and creeping plants, between giant trees, whose foliage
                    shuts out the sun’s rays; and the land teems with animal and insect life of
                    every form and colour. Describing the forests of Manyuema country, west of the
                    Tanganyika Lake, Livingstone says—“Into these [primaeval forests] the sun,
                    though vertical, cannot penetrate, excepting by sending down at midday thin
                    pencils of rays into the gloom. The rain water stands for months in stagnant
                    pools made by the feet of elephants. The climbing plants, from the size of a
                    whipcord to that of a man-of-war’s hawser, are so numerous, that the ancient
                    path is the only passage. When one of the giant trees falls across the road, it
                    forms a wall breast high to be climbed over, and the mass of tangled ropes
                    brought down makes cutting a path round it a work of time which travellers never
                    undertake.” Here there is a double rainy season, and the rainfall is excessive.
                    To north and south of this central belt, where the rainfall diminishes, and a
                    dry and wet season divides the year, the forests gradually open into a park-like
                    country, and then merge into pastoral grass-lands. In North Africa this pastoral
                    belt is occupied by the native states of the Soudan, from Abyssinia westward, in
                    the parallel of Lake Chad, to the Gambia on the Atlantic coast; and
                    corresponding to this in the south, are the grass-lands stretching across the
                    continent from the Zambeze to southern Angola and Benguela. The pastoral belts
                    again gradually pass into the dry, almost rainless desert zones of the Sahara in
                    the north, and the Kalahari desert in the south, which present many features of
                    similarity.</p>
                <p>The extremities of the continent, to which moisture is carried from the
                    neighbouring oceans, again pass into a second belt of pastoral or agricultural
                    land, in the northward slopes of the plateaus of Barbary, Marocco, Algeria, and
                    Tunis, corresponding with the seaward terraces of cultivated land in the Cape
                    Colony in the south.</p>
                <p>Taking a broad view of the hydrography of Africa, there are two great areas of
                    continental drainage, one in the north, the other in the south, from which no
                    water escapes directly to the ocean. These correspond almost exactly with the
                    two desert belts of the Sahara and the Kalahari above described. The whole of
                    the remaining portions of the continent, its forests and pastoral districts, in
                    which the greater rainfall gives greater power to the rivers, are drained by
                    streams which find their way to the ocean on one side or other, generally
                    forcing a passage through some natural or waterworn gorge in the higher circle
                    of mountains which run round the outer edges of the great plateau.</p>
                <p>By far the larger portion of the oceanic drainage of the continent is to the
                    Atlantic and its branch the Mediterranean, to which the Nile, Niger, Ogowai,
                    Congo, and Orange rivers flow. The great rivers which drain on the opposite
                    side, to the Indian Ocean, are the Juba, Zambeze, and Limpopo; whilst the
                    northern continental basin, by far more extensive than the southern, has only
                    one great river, the Shari, which supplies Lake Chad.</p>
                <p>It must be noticed that the capabilities of the African rivers, as highways of
                    approach to the interior of the continent, are exceedingly small in comparison
                    with those of the other great continents of the globe, most of them being either
                    barred at their mouths, or by rapids at no great distance from the coast. It is
                    owing to this physical cause mainly that the African continent has remained for
                    so many centuries a sealed book to the civilised world. On the other hand, it
                    must be observed, that when these outer barriers have been passed, the great
                    interior of the land, in its most productive regions, possesses a network of
                    vast rivers and lakes, unsurpassed in extent by those of any country of the
                    world, by means of which the resources of Central Africa may in future be
                    thoroughly developed.</p>
                <p>The Nile is the oldest of historical rivers, and afforded the only means of
                    subsistence to the earliest civilised people on earth, and yet the origin of
                    this river remained an enigma almost to the present day. Though it drains a
                    larger area than any other river of Africa, upwards of 1,000,000 square miles,
                    and in this respect is one of the largest rivers of the globe, the Nile, passing
                    for a great portion of its lower course through the desert bolt of North Africa,
                    and receiving no tributaries there, loses much of its volume by evaporation, and
                    is far surpassed in the quantity of water conveyed to the ocean by the Congo, in
                    the moist equatorial zone. The great labours of Dr <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0274-0253"/> Livingstone, in the lake region of Central
                    Africa, have so narrowed the space within which the sources of the Nile can
                    exist, that, though no traveller has yet reached the ultimate feeders of the
                    great river, their position can now be predicated almost with certainty. The
                    limit of the Nile basin on the south is formed by the high mountains which rise
                    to westward of the Albert Lake, and which divide between this great reservoir
                    and the Tanganyika, extending eastward to the plateau of Unyamuezi, on the
                    northern side of which the Victoria Nyanza lies. The ultimate sources must then
                    be the feeders of these great equatorial lakes, the Victoria and Albert. The
                    river issuing from the former lake, at the Ripon Falls, 3300 feet above the sea,
                    to join the northern end of the Albert Nyanza, may be considered as the first
                    appearance of the Nile as a river. At the Ripon Falls the overflow is from 400
                    to 500 feet in breadth, and the descent of 12 feet is broken in three places by
                    rocks. Further down, where the river turns westward to join the Albert Lake, it
                    forms the Karuma and Murchison Falls, the latter being 120 feet in height. From
                    the Albert Lake, the Nile, called the Kir in this part, begins its almost due
                    northward course to the Mediterranean, and has no further lake expansion.
                    Between the Albert and Gondokoro, in 5° N. lat., which lies at 2000 feet above
                    the sea, the Nile descends at least 500 feet in a series of rapids and
                    cataracts. Beyond Gondokoro, up to which point it is navigable, it enters the
                    northern lower land of Africa, which is here a region of swamps and forests, and
                    several tributaries join it from the west. The largest of these, named the
                    Bahr-el-Ghazal, unites with the main stream below the 10th parallel; and, not
                    much further on, a main tributary, the Sobat river, joins the Nile from the
                    unknown region which lies to the southeast. Hence, onward, the Nile is known as
                    the Bahr-el-Abiad or White River. The two remaining great tributary rivers
                    descend from the high land of Abyssinia on the east. The first of these, the
                    Bahr-el-Azrek or Blue River, its waters being pure in comparison with those of
                    the Nile, has its source near Lake Dembea or Tzana, through which it flows, in
                    the western side of the Abyssinian plateau, 6000 feet above the sea; forming a
                    semicircular curve in the plateau, the Blue Nile runs north-westward to the
                    confluence at Khartum, 1345 feet above the sea. Between this point and the union
                    of the next tributary, the Nile forms the cataract which is known as the sixth
                    from its mouth. In about 18° N. it is joined by the Atbara or Black River, the
                    head stream of which is the Takkazze, flowing in a deep cut valley of the high
                    land. This tributary is named from the dark mud which it carries from the high
                    land, brought down to it by streams which swell into rushing torrents in the
                    rainy season. It is to these rivers that the fertility of Lower Egypt is mainly
                    due, for each year a vast quantity of Abyssinian mud is borne down to be spread
                    over the delta. Hence the Nile pursues its way in a single line through the dry
                    belt of desert to the Mediterranean without a single tributary, descending by
                    five cataracts, at considerable distances apart. The delta of the Nile, in which
                    the river divides into two main branches, from which a multitude of canals are
                    drawn off, is a wide low plain, occupying an area of about 9000 square miles.
                    The most remarkable circumstance connected with the delta is the annual rise and
                    overflow of the river, which takes place with the greatest regularity in time
                    and equality in amount, beginning at the end of June, and subsiding completely
                    before the end of November, leaving over the whole delta a layer of rich
                    fertilising slime.</p>
                <p>The Sheliff in Algeria, and the Muluya in Eastern Marocco, are the chief streams
                    flowing to the Mediterranean from the high land of Barbary.</p>
                <p>Passing round to the Atlantic system, the Sebu, the Ummer Rebia, and the Tensift,
                    from the Atlas range, are permanent rivers flowing across the fertile plain of
                    Western Marocco, which they serve to irrigate. Next is the Wady Draa, a
                    water-course which has its rise on the inner slope of the high land in Marocco,
                    and which bends round through the Maroccan Sahara to the Atlantic, near the 28th
                    parallel. Its channel, of not less than 500 miles in length, forms a long oasis
                    in the partly desert country through which it flows, and water remains in its
                    bed nearly throughout the year.</p>
                <p>A stretch of 1100 miles of waterless coast, where the desert belt touches on the
                    Atlantic, intervenes between the Draa and the Senegal river, at the beginning of
                    the pastoral belt in lat. 15° N.</p>
                <p>The Senegal rises in the northern portion of the belt of mountains which skirt
                    the Guinea coast, and has a northwesterly course to the sea. During the rainy
                    season it is navigable for 500 miles, from its mouth to the cataract of Feloo,
                    for vessels drawing 12 feet of water, but at other times it is not passable for
                    more than a third part of this distance. The Gambia has its sources near those
                    of the Senegal, and flows westward in a tortuous bed over the plain country,
                    giving a navigable channel of 400 miles, up to the Falls of Barra Kunda. The Rio
                    Grande, from the same heights, is also a considerable river.</p>
                <p>The Niger is the third African river in point of area of drainage and volume; it
                    is formed by the union of two great tributaries, the Quorra and Benue,—the
                    former from the west, the latter from the country in the east of the river
                    basin. The Quorra, called the Joliba in its upper course, has its springs in the
                    inner slope of the mountains which give rise to the Senegal and Gambia, not far
                    from the Atlantic coast. At first its course is north-eastward to as far as the
                    city of Timbuctu, on the border of the desert zone; then it turns due east, and
                    afterwards south-east to its confluence with the Benue, at a point 200 miles
                    north from the coast of the Gulf of Guinea. The chief tributary of the Quorra is
                    the Sokoto river, coming from the elevated country which forms the water-parting
                    between the Niger basin and that of Lake Chad on the east, and its confluence is
                    near the middle of the portion of the channel of the Quorra which bends to
                    south-east.</p>
                <p>At a distance of about 100 miles from its sources, the traveller Park, the first
                    European who reached the Joliba, found it flowing in a wide fertile valley, and
                    navigated by canoes which kept up a constant traffic. Above Timbuctu' the
                    commerce of the river is busily carried on in barges of 60 to 80 tons burden;
                    further on, where the river touches upon the desert belt in the most northerly
                    portion of its course, its fertile banks form the most marked contrast to the
                    arid desert lands beyond. From the confluence of the Sokoto to the union with
                    the Benue, the river course is only navigable after the rainy season, since at
                    other times rocks and shoals interrupt the passage. The sources of the Benue are
                    unknown as yet, but it is believed to have its rise in the northern edge of the
                    great plateau of Southern Africa, almost due south of Lake Chad; its known
                    course is westward, and at the furthest point to which it was easily navigated
                    by the traveller Baikie, nearly 400 miles from its confluence with the Kawara or
                    Quorra, it was still half a mile in width and about 10 feet in average depth,
                    flowing through rich plains. From the confluence of the Quorra and Benue the
                    Niger has a due south course to its delta, and the united river has an average
                    width of about a mile. At a distance of 100 miles from the sea, minor branches
                    which enclose the delta separate from the main stream on each side. The delta is
                    much more extensive than that of the Nile, and measures about 14,000 square
                    miles of low alluvial plain, covered with forest and jungle, and completely
                    intersected by branches from the main river, the outmost of which reach the sea
                    not less than 200 miles <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n275/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0275-0254"/> apart. Unlike the Nile, the Niger possesses one
                    main channel through the centre of the delta, called at its mouth the Nun
                    river.</p>
                <p>Old Calabar river, the Camaroon river, and the Gaboon, are the best known of a
                    number of wide inlets or estuaries of the sea, which occur on the west coast
                    immediately north of the equator; but these are merely the receptacles of a
                    number of minor streams, not the mouths of great rivers, as at one time
                    supposed.</p>
                <p>The Ogowai (pron. Ogowee) river, the delta of which forms Cape Lopez, immedaitely
                    S. of the equator, is a great stream which is believed to drain a large area of
                    the forest zone between the Niger and the Congo; as yet, its lower coast is only
                    known to a distance of 200 miles from the sea. Above the delta the main stream
                    of the river, named the Okanda, breaks through the edge of the plateau, and is
                    joined by the Onango, a tributary from the coast range of the Sierra Complida.
                    Below this confluence the river is a mile and a half in average width, its depth
                    varying from 15 to 50 feet. The delta is formed by the two main branches into
                    which the Ogowai divides at about 30 miles from the coast, and is a swampy flat,
                    covered with mangroves.</p>
                <p>Tho Congo or Zaire must be considered the second river of Africa in point of area
                    of drainage, and it is the first in respect of the volume of water which it
                    discharges to the ocean. There remains but little doubt that the head streams of
                    this vast river are those which supply the great lacustrine system discovered by
                    Dr Livingstone in his recent journeys south and west of Lake Tanganyika. Through
                    these lakes the river, which rises in the upland north of Lake Nyassa, named in
                    different parts of its course the Chambeze, Luapula, or Lualaba, flows in great
                    bends to west and northward, to where it passes into the unknown country still
                    to be explored in the heart of the continent. The Lualaba has a great tributary
                    named the Lufira, from the south; and it is almost certain that the Kassabi
                    river, which springs in the Mossamba Mountains, in the interior borders of
                    Angola, is also one of the feeders of this great river. The Guango river, rising
                    in the same mountains, nearer Angola, must also join the Congo lower down in its
                    valley. At the furthest point on the Lualaba reached by Livingstone, in about
                    lat. 6° S. and long. 25° E., the great river had a breadth of from 2000 to 6000
                    yards, and could not be forded at any season of the year. Every circumstance
                    connected with this river—its direction, the time of its annual rising, and the
                    volume of its water which could be discharged by the Congo mouth alone—point to
                    its identity with this river. The explorer Tuckey, who, in 1816, followed up the
                    Congo from its mouth on the west coast further than any one, found it, above the
                    cataracts which it forms in breaking through the coast range, to have a width of
                    from 2 to 4 English miles, and with a current of from 2 to 3 miles an hour; and
                    his statement that at the lowest stage of its waters it discharges 2,000,000 of
                    cubic feet of water per second, has been confirmed by more recent surveys. Forty
                    miles out from its mouth its waters are only partially mingled with that of the
                    sea, and some nine miles from the coast they are still perfectly fresh. The
                    Congo is the only one of the large African rivers which has any approach to an
                    estuary, contrasting in this respect with those which have delta mouths.</p>
                <p>The Coanza, the most important river of Angola, in respect of its affording a
                    navigable channel for 140 miles from its mouth, rises in a broad valley formed
                    by the Mossamba Mountains in the interior of Benguela, and curves north-westward
                    to the ocean. Its upper course is rapid, and its navigation only begins after
                    the last of its cataracts has been passed; the mouth is closed by a bar. The
                    Cunene river has its rise in the opposite watershed of tho mountains, its
                    springs being close to those of the Coanza, and its course is south-westward,
                    forming the southern limit of the territory of Mossamedes. It is the most
                    southerly river of the central fertile zones of Africa on this side of the
                    continent, and appears to be suitable for navigation throughout the greater part
                    of its length—rising from 15 to 20 feet at times of flood, but having such a
                    depth, at its lowest stage, as to be only passable by canoes.</p>
                <p>From the Cunene, in 1at. 17° S., to the Orange river in 29° S., the dry belt of
                    the South African desert zone intervenes, and there are no permanent rivers on
                    the land sloping to the sea. The coast lands from the edge of the plateau are,
                    however, furrowed by numerous water-courses, which are filled only after the
                    occasional rainfalls.</p>
                <p>The Orange river also belongs for the greater part of its lower course to the
                    water-courses of the arid belt, but it receives such a constant supply from its
                    head streams, which descend from the high lands near the east coast of the
                    continent, as to be able to maintain a perennial flow in its channel, which,
                    however, is so shallow as to be of no value for navigation. Its main head
                    streams are the Vaal and Nu Gariep or Orange, which rise on the opposite slopes
                    of one of the summits of the Drakenberg range, called the Mont aux Sources.
                    After encircling the Orange River Free State, these rivers unite near the centre
                    of this part of the continent to form the Orange, which continues westward to
                    the Atlantic, but without receiving any permanent tributary. The chief water
                    channels which periodically carry supplies to it from the south are Brak and the
                    Great Hartebeeste; from the Kalahari region in the north come the Molopo and
                    Nosob channels. Midway between the union of the head streams and the ocean the
                    river forms a great fall of 150 feet in height.</p>
                <p>The rivers which flow down from the terraces of the Cape Colony are numerous, but
                    have little permanent depth of water, shrinking almost to dryness excepting
                    after rains, when they become impetuous torrents; some have cut deep channels,
                    much beneath the level of the country, and the banks of these canons are choked
                    with dense vegetation. Passing round to Natal and Zulu Land, the coast country
                    is well watered by frequent streams which descend from the base of the
                    cliff-wall of the Drakenberg; these have generally the character of mountain
                    torrents, with rapid flow between high banks and changing volume, and are almost
                    without exception closed at their mouths by sand bars, which in most instances
                    shut in considerable lagoons. One of these, the lake of Santa Lucia, is more
                    than 40 miles in length.</p>
                <p>The first large river of the Indian Ocean system is the Limpopo or Crocodile
                    river, so named from the great number of these animals found in its bed. Its
                    basin lies centrally in the southern tropic, also in the desert belt, and on
                    this account it barely maintains a shallow flow of water throughout the year.
                    Its sources are in that part of the plateau edge in the Transvaal Republic which
                    is known as the Hooge Veldt and Magalies Berg; from this it forms a wide
                    semicircular sweep to north-east and south, reaching the ocean not far north of
                    Delagoa Bay, in 25° S. Its chief tributary, the Olifant or Lepalule, has its
                    rise in a part of the Hooge Veldt which is nearer the coast. Many of its minor
                    tributaries in its lower course are periodical streams known as <hi
                    rend="italic">sand rivers,</hi> only filled after heavy rains.</p>
                <p>The Zambeze is the great river of the pastoral belt of South Africa, and the
                    fourth in point of size in the continent, draining nearly 600,000 square miles.
                    As far as its basin has yet been explored, the Zambeze has three head streams
                    from the great water-parting ridge which extends from the Mossamba Mountains of
                    inner Angola to the high lands north of Nyassa Lake, about the 12th parallel of
                    S. latitude. There are the Lungebungo river from the Mossamba Mountains, the
                    Leeba river from Lake Dilolo, on the water-parting which separates between<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n276/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0276-0255"/> the Zambeze and the Kassabi river, and the
                    Leeambye or Jambaji, probably the main-source stream, coming from the unknown
                    lands south-west of the Cazembe’s territory. From the union of these streams the
                    general course of the Zambeze is in two wide curves eastward, through the
                    plateau and over its edge to the Indian Ocean, in about 19° S. lat. From the
                    north its main tributaries are the Kafue and Loangwa or Aruangoa rivers, and the
                    Shire river, flowing out of Lake Nyassa. Above this point, on its middle course,
                    where it forms the great Victoria Falls, the Zambeze receives the Chobe from the
                    north-west; and from southward numerous minor tributaries join its lower
                    channel. The Zambeze forms a delta with many mouths, the outmost of which are
                    nearly 100 miles apart, and their entrances are generally barred by sand banks;
                    but if these be passed, the main river is continuously navigable for 320 miles
                    to the town of Teté, and its tributary the Shire may also be followed up for
                    nearly 150 miles, to where its cataracts stop navigation. At the Victoria Falls
                    the great river contracts from its general width of nearly a mile, to 60 or 80
                    feet, and plunges over a height of 100 feet, into a remarkable zig-zag gorge
                    rent in the hard basalt rocks.</p>
                <p>The Rovuma, which has its chief tributaries from the plateau edge on the eastern
                    side of Lake Nyassa, is the next great river of the drainage to the Indian
                    Ocean. It has been navigated by Livingstone for 150 miles from the coast, and
                    formed part of his route in entering the continent on the journey from which he
                    has not yet returned, but its basin has not yet been explored.</p>
                <p>Still farther north the mouths of a great river named the Rufiji are known, on
                    the coast opposite the island of Monfia, south of Zanzibar; but no part of its
                    course has yet been traced by any European.</p>
                <p>The Kingani and the Wami are two streams from the plateau edge, in the country of
                    Usagara, and reach the sea in the channel formed by Zanzibar island. The Pangani
                    river, further north, rises in the snowy mountain Kilimanjaro. The Sabaki and
                    Dana, which embouch on the opposite side of Formosa Bay, in 3° S., flow over the
                    same coast plains, having their head springs in the spurs of Mount Kenia. The
                    latter river might be navigated during the rainy season for 100 miles from the
                    coast.</p>
                <p>The Juba river is the most considerable on the eastern side north of the equator.
                    It is believed to have its rise in the high lands immediately south of
                    Abyssinia, and its general direction is south-eastward to the Indian Ocean; but
                    nothing is known of its higher course except by report. The ill-fated expedition
                    under Baron von der Decken explored this river for about 180 miles upwards from
                    its mouth, but as yet no traffic is carried on by its means. The Webbe or Haines
                    river flows down from the high lands in a direction nearly parallel to the Juba,
                    a little farther north, but its outlet on the coast is completely barred by sand
                    dunes of from 400 to 500 feet in height, behind which it forms a lagoon of
                    varying extent. The desert zone is now again reached, and the water supply
                    fails. No permanent rivers reach the Red Sea from the Abyssinian highlands or
                    from the heights of Nubia which continue these northward; the largest
                    water-course is that of the Barca, which is periodically filled by its
                    tributaries in thé northern part of the Abyssinian plateau.</p>
                <p>Turning now to the great areas of continental drainage, it is observed that in
                    North Africa there is a vast space of upwards of four millions of square miles,
                    extending from the Nile valley westward to the Atlantic coast, and from the
                    plateau of Barbary in the north to the extremities of the basin of Lake Chad in
                    the south, from which no single river finds its way to the sea. The whole of
                    this space, however, appears to be furrowed by water channels in the most varied
                    directions. From the inner slopes of the plateau of Barbary numerous wadys take
                    a direction towards the great sand-belt of the Erg, in which they terminate; a
                    great series of channels appears to radiate from the higher portion of the
                    Sahara, which lies immediately north of the tropic of Cancer and in about 5° E.
                    of Greenwich; another cluster radiates from the Mountains of Tibesti, in the
                    eastern Sahara.</p>
                <p>Lake Chad, on the margin of the pastoral belt, is supplied by a large river named
                    the Shari, coming from the moist forest country which lies nearer the equator;
                    and the lake, which till recently was believed to have no outlet, overflows to
                    north-eastward, fertilising a great wady, in which the waters become lost by
                    evaporation as they are led towards the more arid country of the Sahara.</p>
                <p>The southern area of continental drainage is of much smaller extent, and occupies
                    the space of the desert zone which lies between the middle of the Zambeze basin
                    and Damara Land. It centres in Lake Ngami, to which the Tioge river flows from
                    the pastoral belt on the northwest. Several water-courses from the high Damara
                    Land also take a direction toward this lake. The river Zuga carries off the
                    overflow of Lake Ngami towards a series of salt lagoons which lie eastward near
                    the edge of the plateau; but it becomes narrower and less in volume as it
                    approaches these, and in some seasons scarcely reaches their bed.</p>
                <p>Smaller spaces of continental drainage exist at various points near the eastern
                    side of the continent. One of these occupies the depressed area between the base
                    of the Abyssinian highland and the Red Sea, and is properly a continuation of
                    the Sahara desert belt beyond the intervening plateau. In this space the Hawash
                    river, descending from the plateau, terminates before reaching the sea. Another
                    interior basin lies in the plateau between the edge on which mountains Kenia and
                    Kilima-njaro rise and the country east of the Victoria Lake, and includes
                    several salt lakes. It is probable that the great Tanganyika Lake is the centre
                    of a third basin of no outflow on this side of the great plateau; and Lake
                    Shirwa, south-east of the Nyassa, constitutes a fourth.</p>
                <p>The great lakes, which form such a prominent feature in African hydrography, are
                    found chiefly in the southern and eastern regions of the continent, but they are
                    distributed over all the systems of drainage. The Victoria and Albert Lakes of
                    the Nile basin are great seas of fresh water; and if their extent should
                    ultimately prove to be nearly that which is at present believed, they rival the
                    great American lakes for the place of the greatest expanse of fresh water on the
                    globe. The former, the Victoria Lake, is at an elevation of about 3300 feet
                    above the sea; and its outline, as at present sketched on our maps, occupies an
                    area of not less than 30,000 square miles. The Albert. Lake, 2500 feet above the
                    sea, is believed to have an extent not far short of this. Lake Baringo,
                    north-east of the Victoria, is reported to be a great fresh lake, discharging
                    towards the Nile by a river which is possibly the Sobat tributary. Lake Tzana or
                    Dembea, 60 miles in length, at a level of 6000 feet above the sea, on the
                    Abyssinian plateau, is the only remaining great lake of the Nile basin.</p>
                <p>The great expansions of the Chambeze-Lualaba river, presumably belonging to the
                    river Congo, are the only other considerable lakes of the Atlantic drainage. The
                    highest of them, Lake Bangweolo or Bemba, is described as being 150 miles in
                    length from east to west, and at an elevation of 4000 feet; Lake Moero, the
                    next, extends through 60 miles; Lakes Kamalondo or Ulenge, and the yet unvisited
                    lakes of the same drainage, are described as of vast extent, and lie at an
                    elevation of about 2000 feet above the sea.</p>

                <p>Belonging to the drainage system of the Indian Ocean are, Lake Nyassa, 1500 feet
                    above the sea, and stretching meridionally over an area of nearly 9000 square
                    miles in the basin of the Zambeze; and Lake Samburu, a reported lake of great
                    extent, lying in the plateau edge north of Mount Kenia, and probably belonging
                    to the basin of the Juba river. The great Lake Tanganyika, upwards of 10,000
                    square miles in area, and united by a broad channel with Lake Liemba in the
                    south, occupies a deep longitudinal basin, girt with mountains; it is 2800 feet
                    above the sea level. As yet no outlet has been discovered for this vast lake,
                    and the question whether it has or has not an overflowing river, is still
                    undecided; but its waters are not perfectly fresh, the drainage to it is small,
                    and the probability is that the Tanganyika is a continental lake. Lake Shirwa,
                    enclosed by mountains on the plateau edge southeast of Lake Nyassa, and 2000
                    feet above the sea, has brackish water, and no outlet.</p>
                <p>Lake Chad, the greatest lake of the continental system of North Africa, is a
                    shallow lagoon of very variable extent, with numerous islands: it lies at about
                    1100 feet above the sea; its waters are fresh and clear, and its overflow is
                    carried off to north-eastward by the wady named Bahr-el-Ghazal.</p>
                <p>Lake Ngami, the corresponding lake in the southern continental system, at an
                    elevation of about 2900 feet, is also a shallow reedy lagoon, varying in extent
                    according to the season. The Zuga river carries off its surplus water to
                    eastward. Salt lakes are of frequent occurrence in the areas of continental
                    drainage; perhaps the most remarkable of these is the Assal lake, which lies in
                    a depression east of Abyssinia comparable with that of the Dead Sea, 600 feet
                    beneath the level of the Red Sea; the Sebka-el-Faroon or Schott Kebir, south of
                    Tunis, is a great salt lagoon, 100 miles in length, dried up in summer, when its
                    bed is found to be thickly encrusted with salt, and in winter covered with water
                    to a depth of two or three feet. It lies several feet beneath the level of the
                    Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>Africa lies almost entirely in the torrid zone, and is the hottest continent of
                    all. The greatest heat, however, is not found under the equator, since the whole
                    of the central belt of the continent is protected by a dense covering of forest
                    vegetation, supported by the heavy rainfall, and has in consequence a more
                    equable climate, but in the dry, bare exposed desert belts, which lie on the
                    margins of the tropics, the Sahara in the north and the Kalahari in the south,
                    where the climate is extreme. The highest temperature is found throughout the
                    Sahara, particularly in its eastern portions towards the Red Sea. In Upper Egypt
                    and Nubia eggs may be baked in the hot sands; and the saying of the Arabs is,
                    “in Nubia the soil is like fire and the wind like a flame.” The regions along
                    the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts are rendered more temperate by the
                    influence of the sea. To the south of the Great Desert the temperature
                    decreases, chiefly on account of the increasing moisture and protection of the
                    land surface from extreme heating by its tree growth, but also because of the
                    greater elevation of the land as the great southern plateau is approached. Both
                    on account of its elevation and its narrower form, which gives greater access to
                    the equalising influence of the surrounding ocean, the southern half of the
                    African continent has a less high temperature than the northern, though the same
                    gradations of climate outward from the centre belt are clearly marked in each
                    division. Regular snowfall does not occur even in the most southern or northern
                    regions; and this phenomenon is only known in the most elevated points of the
                    continent, as in the Atlas Mountains in the north, the summits of which retain
                    patches of snow even in summer, in the Abyssinian peaks, in the highest points
                    of the mountains of the Cape Colony, and most remarkably in the lofty summits of
                    Mounts Kenia and Kilima-njaro, which rise on the plateau directly beneath the
                    equator. The intensity of radiation and its influence upon the temperature are
                    very great in Northern Africa; while in the day time the soil of the Sahara
                    rapidly absorbs the solar rays, during the night it cools so rapidly that the
                    formation of ice has often been known to occur.</p>
                <p>The observed average temperatures of the extreme months of the year at various
                    points of Africa, from N. to S., are given in the following table :—</p>

                <p>Africa is not much under the influence of the regular winds, except the monsoons
                    of the Indian Ocean, the great movement of the atmosphere depending chiefly on
                    the oscillation of the continent beneath the sun during the seasons, as will be
                    afterwards explained. The wind currents over the whole continent have a
                    prevailing direction from the east. There are the trade winds, modified by
                    interruptions of changing heat and elevation of the land surface. In the
                    northern part of the Indian Ocean the year is divided between the south-west
                    monsoon, blowing from March till September, away from Africa, towards the then
                    heated continent of Asia; and the north-east monsoon, or rather the normal trade
                    wind, blowing towards the African coasts, from October till February. It will be
                    seen in the next paragraph, that the monsoons, although they extend only to
                    about a third portion of the East African shores, have an extremely important
                    bearing upon the physical economy of the whole African continent. From
                    hurricanes Africa is nearly exempt, except in its south-eastern extremity, to
                    which at times the Mauritius hurricanes extend. At rare intervals these have
                    visited the east coast as far as Zanzibar. Northern Africa is much exposed to
                    the hot winds and storms from the Sahara, which are called in Egypt Khamsin, in
                    the Mediterranean Scirocco, Shume or Asshume in Marocco, and Harmattan on the
                    west coasts of the Sahara and in the countries bordering on the Gulf of Guinea.
                    These always blow directly across the coast from the interior, and seem to move
                    round the compass during the year, beginning in Egypt in April, in Algeria in
                    July, in Marocco in August, in Senegambia in November. Similar dry electrical
                    winds are experienced in the Kalahari desert in the south. Whirlwinds,
                    frequently carrying sand up into the atmosphere, are of frequent occurrence in
                    these deserts, and are also known in the dry region of Unyamuezi, between
                    Zanzibar and the Tanganyika, and in the Limpopo basin farther south. Extreme
                    heat and dryness are the characteristics of these winds, which, raising the
                    sand, filling the air with dust, and prodigiously favouring<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n278/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0278-0257"/> the powers of evaporation, are often fatal to the
                    vegetable and animal creation in the regions visited by them.</p>
                <p>In Africa the dependence of the winds and rains upon the movement of the land
                    beneath the sun is more clearly marked than in any other intertropical region of
                    the globe. The high temperature caused by the vertical heat of the sun over a
                    particular area induces an indraught of air to that place, an ascending current
                    is produced which carries up with it the warm and moist air; condensed in the
                    higher regions of the atmosphere, the moisture falls as rain, and the
                    condensation makes way for a further indraught. It is thus that in Africa the
                    winds and rains follow as a rule the pendulating movement of the continent
                    beneath the sun, and the rainy season of any space begins almost immediately
                    after the sun has reached its zenith. Between the tropics and the equator the
                    sun comes twice to the zenith of each belt during the year, at the tropical
                    lines the sun is only once in the zenith; thus it follows that a double rainy
                    season is observed in all places lying in the central belt of the tropics, and a
                    single rainy season in those which are nearer the skirts of the zone. These wet
                    and dry seasons correspond to the cooler and hotter periods of the year, and
                    take the place of the summer and winter of the temperate regions. Various
                    circumstances tend to interfere with and modify the working of this general rule
                    of the rotation of seasons. In Southern Africa that rainy season which follows
                    the apparent movement of the sun northward, is greater than that which ensues
                    after his passage south, since in the former case the winds are drawn inwards
                    from the ocean and carry greater quantities of moisture, whereas in the latter
                    the winds are drawn from the land north of the equator, and their moisture is
                    already in great part spent. In the northern and eastern regions of Africa the
                    winds and rains are governed as much by the heating and cooling of the Asiatic
                    continent as by that of Africa itself, but in the central and western portions
                    of the continent the rule is well exemplified. Thus in Damara Land, bordering on
                    the southern tropic, there is one short rainy season from February till April,
                    beginning only with the northing sun; at Loanda in Angola the greater rains last
                    from February till May, the lesser rainy season, when the sun has passed this
                    place going south, occurs in November only. At Annobon island, surrounded by
                    wide sea, April and May are the rainy months of the northing sun, October and
                    November of the southing. The Guinea coast, facing the sea to southward, has its
                    greater rainy season from March to June, when the northing sun draws the ocean
                    winds on to the coast; and its lesser rains occur in October and November, when
                    the sun has passed southward from the land. Nearing the northern tropical line,
                    the coast-land from Sierra Leone to the Senegal river has a simple wet and dry
                    season during the year.</p>
                <p>On the eastern coast-land the rains are more dependant on the direction of the
                    monsoon winds; about the mouths of the Zambeze and on the Mozambique coast the
                    rains begin in November, after the north-east monsoon wind has set in over the
                    northern part of the Indian Ocean, bringing with it the vapours drawn from the
                    sea to condense on the coast slopes. The rains continue here till March, when
                    the south-west monsoon begins to blow away from the land towards the then heated
                    surface of Asia. At Zanzibar there is a double rainy season, a stronger in the
                    months of March, April, and May, with the northing sun, beginning immediately
                    after the south-west monsoon has set in, and a weaker in September and October
                    with the southing sun. Under the equator on the east coast the rains begin in
                    April with the south-west monsoon, continuing till June, and during this period
                    the sky is obscured by heavy clouds. The second rainy season here is only marked
                    by a few showers in September and October. Whils the north-east monsoon is
                    blowing the sky remains of a cloudless blue. In the interior of the continent,
                    between these tropical coasts, the rainy seasons appear rather to precede than
                    follow the advancing sun. In the region of the central Zambeze the greater rains
                    last through February, March, and April, the lesser occurring in October and
                    November. The worst droughts are experienced in December and January. Nearer the
                    centre of the continent the two rainy seasons become so lengthened as almost to
                    merge into one period of rains, extending over about eight months of the year.
                    In the newly-explored country south-west of the Tanganyika, Dr Livingstone found
                    that the rains began in October, and that the last showers fell in May; but
                    there is probably a drier period between these limits. At the Tanganyika Lake
                    the rainy season begins in September, lasting till May, and the same rainy
                    reason has been observed in the interior country of the west coast immediately
                    north of the equator. Between these points, in Manuyema country, Dr Livingstone
                    found that the rains continued till July, or almost through the year. Northward
                    in the interior the rainy seasons are again clearly divided into a greater and
                    lesser, and in the regions west of the Upper Nile between 5° and 10° N. lat.,
                    the stronger rains occur from August till October, the weaker come with the
                    northing sun in April and May. The plateau of Abyssinia, rising high above the
                    general level of the north of Africa, and intercepting and condensing the moist
                    winds, has also a double rainy season,—a greater from June to September, when
                    the sun is passing southward; a lesser in February and April, with the northing
                    sun. The rainy seasons in Central Africa are ushered in and accompanied by
                    violent thunderstorms and by occasional falls of hail. The quantity of the
                    rainfall, which is excessive in the regions near the equator, diminishes rapidly
                    to north and south of this belt as the dry regions on the borders of the tropics
                    are approached.</p>
                <p>The Sahara, and also the Kalahari of Southern Africa, are almost rainless
                    regions, but wherever a sufficient elevation occurs to intercept a cooler
                    stratum of the atmosphere, rain is not wanting, even in the midst of the Great
                    Desert. A striking instance of this is related by Mr Richardson. That traveller
                    relates that when on the borders of the mountain knot of “Aïr, in about latitude
                    19° N., on the 30th Sept. 1850, there was a cry in the encampment, ‘The wady is
                    coming.’ Going out to look, I saw a broad white sheet of foam advancing from the
                    south between the trees of the valley. In ten minutes after a river of water
                    came pouring along, and spread all around us, converting the place of our
                    encampment into an isle of the valley. The current in its deepest part was very
                    powerful, capable of carrying away sheep and cattle, and of uprooting trees.
                    This is one of the most interesting phenomena I have witnessed during my present
                    tour in Africa. The scene, indeed, was perfectly African. Rain had been observed
                    falling in the south; black clouds and darkness covered that zone of the
                    heavens, and an hour afterwards came pouring down this river of water into the
                    dry parched-up valley.”</p>
                <p>The causes of want of rainfall in the vast region of the Sahara appear to be
                    mainly these—that the winds advancing towards it come from a cooler and moister
                    to a warmer and drier region, indeed to the hottest and driest of all, and so
                    are constantly losing in moisture and gaining in temperature as they approach;
                    the high plateau of Abyssinia forms an effective screen from the winds of tho
                    Indian Ocean, wringing out their moisture before the Sahara is reached, and on
                    the Atlantic side the north-east trade wind constantly blows away from the land;
                    a barrier of mountains also deprives the Sahara of rain from the south-west.
                    Another cause of dryness is the low level of great areas of the Sahara. We have
                    seen that wherever <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n279/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0279-0258"/> there is a considerable elevation, even in its
                    midst there is a periodical rainfall. The Kalahari region is almost rainless, on
                    account of the great heat to which it is subjected; but specially because the
                    winds coming towards it from the eastward, the prevailing winds, expend their
                    moisture on the high slopes of the plateau which face the Indian Ocean. Heavy
                    dews, consequent on the rapid changes of day and night temperature in these bare
                    regions, partly compensate the deficiency of rain.</p>
                <p>The portions of the continent which lie beyond the tropics north and south, the
                    outer slopes of the plateau of Barbury aud of the Cape Colony, have no marked
                    rainy season, and the times of the occurrence of rain are altered, the summers
                    of both being drier, the showers more frequent in winter. In Natal, and on the
                    slopes of the plateau in its neighbourhood, rain may be expected in any month;
                    but the greatest falls occur from October to March. The absolute quantity of ram
                    which falls in Africa has as yet been measured at so few points, that no
                    definite conclusions can be arrived at respecting it.</p>
                <p>Although Africa belongs almost entirely to the torrid and warm zones, its
                    vegetable productions are essentially different in different parts. Thus, in the
                    extreme north, groves of oranges aud olives, plains covered with wheat and
                    barley, thick woods of evergreen oaks, cork-trees, and sea-pines, intermixed
                    with cypresses, myrtles, arbutus, and fragrant tree-heaths, form the principal
                    features of the landscape. On this northern coast the date-palm is first found;
                    but its fruit does not arrive at perfection, and it is chiefly valued as an
                    ornamental object in gardens. Various kinds of grain are cultivated. Beyond this
                    region of the coast and the Atlas chain, with the borders of the Sahara,
                    commences a new scene. It is in this region, extending to the borders of Soudan,
                    that the date-tree forms the characteristic feature. Being peculiarly adapted to
                    excessive dryness and high temperature, it flourishes where few other plants can
                    maintain an existence. Were it not for the fruit of the invaluable date-tree,
                    the inhabitants of the desert would almost entirely depend on the products of
                    other regions for their subsistence. With the southern boundary of the Sahara,
                    the date-tree disappears, the baobab or monkey bread-tree takes its place, and,
                    under the influence of the tropical rains, a new, rich, and highly-developed
                    flora presents itself. These trees, together with huge cotton-trees, oil-palms,
                    sago-palms, and others of the same majestic tribe, determine the aspect of the
                    landscape. The laburnum expands its branches of golden flower, and replaces the
                    senna of the northern regions, and the swamps are often covered with immense
                    quantities of the papyrus plant Instead of waving fields of corn, the cassava,
                    yam, pigeon-pea, aud the ground-nut, form the farinaceous plants. The papaw, the
                    tamarind, the Senegal custard-apple, and others, replace the vine and the fig.
                    In Southern Africa, again, the tropical forms disappear, and in the inland
                    desert-like plains, the fieshy, leafless, contorted, singular tribes of kapsias,
                    of mesembryanthemums, euphorbias, crassulas, aloes, aud other succulent plants,
                    make their appearance. Endless species of heaths are there found in great
                    beauty, and the hills aud rocks arc scattered over with a remarkable tribe of
                    plants called <hi rend="italic">Cycadaceae.</hi> Plants of the protea tribe also
                    add to the extraordinary variety in the vegetable physiognomy of that
                    region.</p>
                <p>Of the characteristic African plants, the date-tree is one of the most important,
                    as it is likewise among the nearly one thousand different species of palms. It
                    furnishes, as it were, the bread of the desert, beyond which it occurs only in
                    Western Asia, wherever a similar dry and hot climate prevails. This tree
                    requires a sandy soil, and springs must not be absent. The dates furnish food
                    not only for man, but for the camel and the horse. For the latter purpose the
                    stones are used in many parts, and are said to be more nourishing than the fruit
                    itself. The Arabs make a great variety of dishes of which dates form the chief
                    part. Of the sap of the tree palm-wine is prepared, aud the young leaves are
                    eaten like cabbage.</p>
                <p>In Southern Africa are the extensive miniature woods of heaths, as characteristic
                    as the groves of date-palms in the north. No less than five hundred species have
                    already been discovered. These plants, of which some reach the height of 12 to
                    15 feet <hi rend="italic">(Erica</hi><hi rend="italic">urceolaris),</hi> are
                    covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable flowers of
                    beautiful colours, the red being prevalent.</p>
                <p>The papyrus is an aquatic plant, having a stem from 3 to 6 feet high. It inhabits
                    both stagnant waters and running streams, and is common in the countries of the
                    Nile, particularly Egypt and Abyssinia. Its soft, smooth flowerstem afforded the
                    most ancient material from which paper was prepared, and for this reason it is
                    one of the noticeable African plants. It has, however, also been used for other
                    purposes; its flowering stems and leaves are twisted into ropes; and the roots,
                    which are sweet, are used as food.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The order Quadrumana is well represented, more particularly within the tropics,
                    whence they decrease northwards and southwards. The most important members of
                    this family are the anthropoid monkeys, the chimpanzee and gorilla, in Tropical
                    and Western Africa. Baboons and mandrils, with few exceptions, are peculiar to
                    Africa. Only a few species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Macacus,</hi> which is
                    East Indian, are found in Africa. The only short-tailed species (<hi
                    rend="italic">Macacus Innuus)</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n280/mode/1up"

                    opposite coast at the Rock of Gibraltar. In Madagascar the place of the true
                    monkeys is supplied by the peculiar tribe of the true Lemurs or makis. Many
                    species have close affinities with those of Asia; thus the orang-outang of
                    Borneo is represented in Africa by the chimpanzee. The gibbons are entirely
                    wanting.</p>
                <p>Of the larger Carnivora the bear is almost entirely wanting, and occurs only
                    sparely in the Atlas Mountains in Barbary. The true martens are unknown, but
                    otters occur. Of the <hi rend="italic">Canis</hi> family the jackal is
                    characteristic, and roams over the whole of Africa; it differs from the Asiatic
                    species in its paler skin, which approaches the colour of the prevailing
                    deserts. The wolf and fox do not extend beyond the northern margin of Africa.
                    Hyaenas are true African tenants; the striped hyaena extending from Asia over
                    North Affrica, the spotted hyaena over the remainder of the continent; in the
                    southmost part of the continent the brown hyaena is also found, and with it the
                    aardwolf, or earth wolf of the Cape colonists, allied to this genus. Africa is
                    the chief home of the lion, which there remains undisturbed as king over the
                    lower animal creation, though it has been driven inwards from the more settled
                    portions of the coast-land; while in the extreme south-western parts of Asia, to
                    which it is now confined, its power is divided with that of the tiger. The
                    leopard, serval, caracal, chaus, and civet cat (the locality of the true civet
                    being North Africa), are the other principal representatives of the cat tribe.
                    The herpestes or ichneumons have the same distribution as the civets; the
                    species which destroys the eggs of the crocodile is found in Egypt and the North
                    of Africa.</p>
                <p>Of wild horses the asinine group is characteristic of Asia, and the hippotigrine
                    of Africa. The quagga, exclusively African, inhabits the most southern parts of
                    the continent, and is scarcely found north of the Orange river, but occurs in
                    great herds, associated with the white-tailed gnu; the zebra <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Equus Burchellii),</hi> or zebra of the plains, is widely distributed over
                    Africa, from the limit of the quagga to Abyssinia and the west coast; the zebra
                    of the mountains (<hi rend="italic">Equus</hi><hi rend="italic">zebra),</hi>
                    more completely striped than the rest, is only known in South Africa. The true
                    onager or aboriginal wild ass is indigenous to North-East Africa aud the island
                    of Socotra. A species inhabiting the high land of Abyssinia is distinct from
                    these. The horse, domesticated in other parts of Africa, excepting the region of
                    forests, is not found in the eastern intertropical region; and, for some cause
                    not yet clearly ascertained, it appears to be impossible to acclimatise it
                    there. The single humped camel or dromedary is used over the whole of North
                    Africa, as far south and west as the river Niger and Lake Chad. The Indian
                    buffalo has spread by introduction to North Africa; the Cape buffalo, a species
                    peculiar to Africa, reaches as far north as a line from Guinea to Abyssinia; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bos Brachycerus</hi> is a species peculiar to West Africa,
                    from Senegal to the Gaboon. Of sheep, the <hi rend="italic">Ovis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tragelaphus</hi> is peculiar to North Africa; the Ibex goat
                    extends into Abyssinia. The family of the antelopes is essentially African,
                    five-sixths of the species composing it being natives of that country, and
                    chiefly of the portion lying south of the Sahara, occurring in dense herds.
                    Lastly, the giraffe, one of the most celebrated and characteristic of African
                    quadrupeds, ranges from the limits of the Cape Colony as far as the Sahara and
                    Nubia.</p>
                <p>Of Edentata the seven species known to occur in Africa are also peculiar to it.
                    The aardwark (<hi rend="italic">Orycteropus capensis)</hi> is essentially
                    burrowing in its habits; and the burrows formed by these animals are the source
                    of frequent danger to the waggons and horses of the Cape colonists.</p>
                <p>A genus of moles is met with in South Africa, but is not found in the tropical
                    regions. The Cape or gilded mole, <hi rend="italic">chryso-chlore,</hi> is so
                    called from its iridescent glossy fur; two or three species of hedgehog occur in
                    the continent, and Madagascar has a peculiar family resembling these in
                    appearance, but without the power of rolling up into a ball for defence. Bats
                    are numerous in Africa, but few are peculiar to it.</p>
                <p>Of Rodents the burrowing kinds prevail. The African species of porcupine are
                    known in the northern and western coast-lands and in South-Eastern Africa. The
                    hyrax extends over Eastern Africa and a portion of the west coast. Hares are
                    only known in the countries north of the Sahara and in the Cape colony. Among
                    squirrels, those with bristles or spines in their fur are peculiar to the
                    southern regions of the continent.</p>
                <p>The ornithology of Africa presents a close analogy in many of its species to
                    those of Europe and South Asia. Thus, on its northern coasts, there is scarcely
                    a single species to be found which does not also occur in the other countries
                    bordering on the Mediterranean. The ornithology of the region of the Nile and
                    the northern coasts is identified with that of Arabia, Persia, and Spain. The
                    deserts are inhabited by species adapted to its solitudes; while Southern Africa
                    presents different species.</p>
                <p>The ostrich, the hugest of birds, which has been described as the feathered
                    camel, or the giraffe among birds, is found in almost every part of Africa. But
                    its chief home is the desert and the open plains; mountainous districts it
                    avoids, unless pressed by hunger. The beautiful white feathers, so highly prized
                    by the ladies of Europe, are found in the wings of the male bird. The chase is
                    not without its difficulties, and it requires the greatest care to get within
                    musket-shot of the bird, owing to its constant vigilance and the great distance
                    to which it can see. The fleetest horse, too, will not overtake it unless
                    stratagem be adopted to tire it out. If followed up too eagerly, the chase of
                    the ostrich is not destitute of danger; for the huntsman has sometimes had his
                    thigh-bone broken by a single stroke from the leg of a wounded bird.</p>
                <p>The large messenger or secretary-bird, which preys upon serpents and other
                    reptiles, is one of the most remarkable African birds. It is common near the
                    Cape, and is not seldom domesticated. Of gallinaceous fowls, adapted to the
                    poultry-yard, Africa possesses but a single genus, the guineahens, which,
                    however, are found in no other part of the world. These birds, of which there
                    are three or four distinct species, go in large flocks of 400 or 500, and are
                    most frequently found among underwood in the vicinity of ponds and rivers. There
                    are, besides, many species of partridges and quails in different parts of
                    Africa. Water fowl of various species are also abundant on the lakes, and
                    rivers, as are likewise various species of owls, falcons, and vultures, the
                    latter of which are highly useful in consuming the offal and carrion, which
                    might otherwise taint the air and produce disease.</p>
                <p>Among the smaller birds of Africa are many species remarkable for the gaudiness
                    and brilliancy of their plumage, or the singularity of their manners and
                    economy. Of the former kind may be mentioned the sunbirds, the lampro-tornis,
                    the bee-eaters, the rollers, the plantain-eaters, the parrots, the halcyons, and
                    numerous smaller birds that swarm in the forests. Of the latter kind it will be
                    sufficient to mention the honey-cuckoo (<hi rend="italic">Cuculus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">indicator).</hi></p>
                <p>Though Africa is not exempt from the scourge of venomous or dangerous reptiles,
                    still it has comparatively fewer than other tropical countries, owing to the
                    dryness of the climate. The reptiles harboured by the desert regions consist
                    chiefly of harmless lizards and serpents of a small size, though often venomous.
                    The frog and tortoise tribes are represented in but few species and numbers.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n281/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0281-0260"/>
                <p>The most important among the reptiles is the crocodile, which inhabits nearly all
                    the large rivers and lakes within the tropics, and is still abundant in the Nile
                    below the first cataract.</p>
                <p>The chameleon is common in Africa. Among the venomous species of snakes are the
                    purple naja, the cerastes or horned viper, the ringed naja, and the darting
                    viper.</p>
                <p>Edible fish are found almost everywhere in great variety and quantity. The fresh
                    waters of Egypt produce the gigantic bishir, the coffres, and numerous species
                    of the pimelodes. Many varieties of fish exist in the great interior lakes <hi
                    rend="italic">; five</hi> large species found in the Tanganyika are described by
                    Burton. The greater number of the fish of the Red Sea resemble the saxatiles of
                    the warm seas of Asia. On the west coasts are found the fish belonging to
                    equatorial latitudes, while the shores of the Mediterranean produce those of
                    France and Spain. The seas of the southern extremity possess the species common
                    to the latitudes of the antarctic, south of the three great capes. The fish of
                    the east coast are the same as those of the Indian Sea.</p>
                <p>Of the insect tribes Africa also contains many thousand different kinds. The
                    locust has been, from time immemorial, the proverbial scourge of the whole
                    continent; scorpione, scarcely less to be dreaded than noxious serpents, are
                    everywhere abundant; and the zebub, or fly, one of the instruments employed by
                    the Almighty to punish the Egyptians of old, is still the plague of the low and
                    cultivated districts. In the interior of Africa a venomous fly occurs in certain
                    regions of the south and east, which is fatal to nearly all domestic animals. It
                    is called tsetse <hi rend="italic">(Glossina morsitans),</hi> and its size is
                    almost that of the common blue fly which settles on meat; but the wings are
                    larger. On the absence of this insect greatly depended the success of recent
                    explorers in that quarter, as, where it appeared, their cattle infallibly fell
                    victims to its bite. There are large tribes which cannot keep either cattle or
                    sheep, because the tsetse abounds in their country. Its bite is not, however,
                    dangerous to man; wild animals likewise are undisturbed by it. The termites or
                    white ants are likewise a scourge to the country where they occur in great
                    numbers. This destructive creature devours everything in the shape of wood,
                    leather, cloth, &amp;c., that falls in its way; and they march together in such
                    swarms, that the devastation they commit is almost incredible.</p>
                <p>Of the class of zoophytes, the brilliant polypi of every variety, and madrepores,
                    abound on the coasts of Africa. The shores of the Mediterranean produce the
                    finest coral, and those of the Red Sea bristle with extensive reefs of the same
                    mollusca.</p>
                <p>From the shores of the Mediterranean to about the latitude of 20° N., the
                    population of Africa consists largely of tribes not originally native to the
                    soil, but of Arabs and Turks, planted by conquest, with a considerable number of
                    Jews, the children of dispersion; and the more recently introduced French. The
                    Berbers of the Atlas region, the Tuaricks and Tibbus of the Sahara, and the
                    Copts of Egypt, may be viewed as the descendants of the primitive stock, while
                    those to whom the general name of Moors is applied, are perhaps of mixed
                    descent, native and foreign. From the latitude stated to the Cape Colony, tribes
                    commonly classed together under the title of the Ethiopic or Negro family are
                    found, though many depart very widely from the peculiar physiognomy of the
                    Negro, which is most apparent in the natives of the Guinea coast. In the Cape
                    Colony, and on its borders, the Hottentots form a distinct variety in the
                    population of Africa, most closely resembling the Mongolian races of Asia.</p>
                <p>The Copts, or as they are correctly pronounced, either Ckoobt or Ckibt, are
                    considered to be the descendants of the ancient Egyptians. They do not now
                    compose more than one sixteenth part of the population of Egypt, their number
                    not exceeding 145,000, about 10,000 of whom reside at Cairo. Conversions to the
                    Mohammedan faith, and intermarriages with the Moslems, have occasioned this
                    decrease in their numbers; to which may be added tho persecutions which they
                    endured from their Arabic invaders and subsequent rulers. They were forced to
                    adopt distinctions of dress, and they still wear a turban of a black or blue, or
                    a grayish or light brown colour, in contradistinction to the red or white
                    turban. In some parts of Upper Egypt there are villages exclusively inhabited by
                    the Cepts. Their complexion is somewhat darker than that of the Arabs, their
                    foreheads flat, and their hair of a soft and woolly character; their noses
                    short, but not flat; mouths wide, and lips thick; the eyes large, and bent
                    upwards in an angle like those of the Mongols; their cheek-bones high, and their
                    beards thin. They are not an unmixed race, their ancestors in the earlier ages
                    of Christianity having intermarried with Greeks, Nubians, and Abyssinians. With
                    the exception of a small proportion, the Copts are Christians of the sect called
                    Jacobites, Eutychians, Monophysites, and Monothelites, whose creed was condemned
                    by the Council of Chalcedon, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 451. They are
                    extremely bigoted, and bear a bitter hatred to all other Christians; they are of
                    a sullen temper, extremely avaricious, great dissemblers, ignorant, and
                    faithless. They frequently indulge in excessive drinking; but in their meals,
                    their mode of eating, and the manner in which they pass their hours of leisure,
                    which is chiefly in smoking their pipes and drinking coffee, they resemble the
                    other inhabitants of the country. Most of the Copts in Cairo are employed as
                    secretaries and accountants, or tradesmen; they are chiefly engaged in the
                    government offices; and as merchants, goldsmiths, silversmiths, jewellers,
                    architects, builders, and carpenters, they are generally considered more skilful
                    than the Moslems. The Coptic language is now understood by few persons, and the
                    Arabic being employed in its stead, it may be considered as a dead language.</p>
                <p>The countries above Egypt are inhabited by two tribes of people resembling each
                    other in physical characters, but of distinct language and origin. One is,
                    perhaps, the aboriginal or native, the other a foreign tribe. Dr Prichard terms
                    them Eastern Nubians, or Nubians of the Red Sea, and Nubians of the Nile, or
                    Berberines. All these tribes are people of a red-brown complexion, their colour
                    in some instances approaching to black, but still different from the ebony hue
                    of the Eastern negroes. Their hair is often frizzled and thick, and is described
                    as even woolly; yet it is not precisely similar to the hair of the negroes of
                    Guinea. The Eastern Nubians are tribes of roving people who inhabit the country
                    between the Nile and the Red Sea; the northern division of this race are the
                    Ababdeh, who reach northward in the eastern desert as far as Kosseir, and,
                    towards the parallel of Deir, border on the Bishari. The Bishari reach thence
                    towards the confines of Abyssinia. The latter are extremely savage and
                    inhospitable; they are said to drink the warm blood of living animals; they are
                    for the most part nomadic, and live on flesh and milk. They are described as a
                    handsome people, with beautiful features, fine expressive eyes, of slender and
                    elegant forms; their complexion is said to be a dark brown, or a dark chocolate
                    colour. The Barábra or Berberines are a people well known in Egypt, whither they
                    resort as labourers from the higher country of the Nile. They inhabit the valley
                    of that name from the southern limit of Egypt to Sennaar. They are a people
                    distinct from the Arabs and all the surrounding nations. They live on the banks
                    of the Nile; and wherever there is any soil, they plant datetrees, set up wheels
                    for irrigation, and sow durra and some <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n282/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0282-0261"/> leguminous plants. At Cairo, whither many of this
                    race resort, they are esteemed for their honesty. They profess Islam. The
                    Barábra are divided into three sections by their dialects, which are those of
                    the Nuba, the Kenous, and the Dongolawi. According to Dr Prichard, it is
                    probable that the Berberines may be an offset from the original stock which
                    first peopled Egypt and Nubia.</p>
                <p>The country of the Nubians is limited on the west by that of the Tibbus, who are
                    spread over the eastern portions of the Sahara, as far as Fezzan and Lake Chad.
                    Dr Latham considers it probable that their language belongs to the Nubian class.
                    They inhabit the locality of the ancient Libyans or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Libyes.</hi> Their colour is not uniform. In some it is quite black, but many
                    have copper-coloured faces. They are slim and well made, have high cheekbones,
                    the nose sometimes flat like that of the negro, and sometimes aquiline. Their
                    mouth is in general large, but their teeth fine. Their lips are frequently
                    formed like those of Europeans; their eyes are expressive, and their hair,
                    though curled, not woolly. The females are especially distinguished by a light
                    and elegant form, and in their walk and erect manner of carrying themselves are
                    very striking. Their feet and ankles are delicately formed, and not loaded with
                    a mass of brass or iron, as is the practice in other countries of Northern
                    Africa, but have merely a light anklet of polished silver or copper, sufficient
                    to show their jetty skin to more advantage; and they also wear neat red
                    slippers. The Tibbus are chiefly a pastoral people. They keep horses, cattle,
                    sheep, and goats, but camels constitute their principal riches. The villages of
                    the Tibbus are very regularly built in a square, with a space left on the north
                    and south faces of the quadrangle for the use of the cattle. The huts are
                    entirely of mats, which exclude the sun, yet admit both the light and the air.
                    The interior of these habitations is singularly neat: clean wooden bowls for the
                    preservation of milk, each with a cover of basket-work, are hung against their
                    walls. They are greatly exposed to predatory incursions into their country by
                    the enemies who surround them. The Tibbus of Tibesti are described by Dr
                    Nachtigal as of medium stature, well made, of elegant though muscular frame; in
                    colour they vary between a clear bronze and black.: the greater number are dark
                    bronze-coloured, yet without the slightest trace of what is generally recognised
                    as the negro physiognomy. They carry on a considerable traffic in slaves between
                    Sudan, Fezzan, and Tripoli</p>
                <p>“All that is not Arabic in the kingdom of Marocco,” says Dr Latham, “all that is
                    not Arabic in the French provinces of Algeria, and all that is not Arabic in
                    Tunis, Tripoli, and Fezzan, is Berber. The language, also, of the ancient
                    Cyrenaica, indeed the whole country bordering the Mediterranean, between Tripoli
                    and Egypt, is Berber. The extinct language of the Canary Isles was Berber; and,
                    finally, the language of the Sahara is Berber. The Berber languages, in their
                    present geographical localities, are essentially inland languages. As a general
                    rule, the Arabic is the language for the whole of the sea-coast from the Delta
                    of the Nile to the Straits of Gibraltar, and from the Straits of Gibraltar to
                    the mouth of the Senegal.” The Berber nation is one of great antiquity, and from
                    the times of the earliest history has been spread over the same extent of
                    country as at present; the ancient Numidian and Mauritanian names of Sallust,
                    and other writers, have a meaning in the modern Berber. It has affinities with
                    the Semitic languages. In the northern parts of Atlas these people are called
                    Berbers; in the southern tracts they are the Shu1uh or Shelhas. In the hilly
                    country belonging to Tunis, the Kabyles; in Mount Auress, the Showiah; and in
                    the Desert, the Tuarick,—all belong to the same group. The mountains of Atlas
                    are said to be inhabited by more than twenty different tribes, carrying on
                    perpetual warfare against each other. They are very poor, and make plundering
                    excursions in quest of the means of supporting life. They are described as an
                    athletic, strong-featured people, accustomed to hardships and fatigue. Their
                    only covering is a woollen garment without sleeves, fastened round the waist by
                    a belt.</p>
                <p>The Shuluh, who are the mountaineers of the Northern Atlas, live in villages of
                    houses made of stone and mud, with slate roofs, occasionally in tents, and even
                    in caves. They are chiefly huntsmen, but cultivate the ground and rear bees.
                    They are described as lively, intelligent, well-formed, athletic men, not tall,
                    without marked features, and with light complexions. The Kabyles, or Kabaily, of
                    the Algerian and Tunisian territories, are the most industrious inhabitants of
                    the Barbary States, and, besides tillage, work the mines contained in their
                    mountains, and obtain lead, iron, and copper. They live in huts made of the
                    branches of trees and covered with clay, which resemble the <hi rend="italic"
                    >magalia</hi> of the old Numidiane, spread in little groups over the sides of
                    the mountains, and preserve the grain, the legumes, and other fruits, which are
                    the produce of their husbandry, in <hi rend="italic">mattour</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">es,</hi> or conical excavations in the ground. They are of middle
                    stature; their complexion is brown, and sometimes nearly black.</p>
                <p>The Tuarick are a people spread in various tribes through the greater portion of
                    the Sahara. The expedition under Richardson, Barth, and Overweg, who traversed
                    and explored a great portion of the Tuarick territories, has greatly added to
                    our knowledge of these people. The following are the names and localities of the
                    principal tribes :—</p>

                <p>The various tribes are very different in their characters, but they are all fine
                    men, tall, straight, and handsome. They exact a tribute from all the caravans
                    traversing their country, which chiefly furnishes them with the means of
                    subsistence. They are most abstemious, their food consisting principally of
                    coarse brown bread, dates, olives, and water. Even on the heated desert, where
                    the thermometer generally is from 90° to 120°, they are clothed from head to
                    foot, and cover the face up to the eyes with a black or coloured
                    handkerchief.</p>
                <p>The Moors who inhabit large portions of the empire of Marocco, and are spread all
                    along the Mediterranean coast, are a mixed race, grafted upon the ancient
                    Mauritanian stock; whence their name. After the conquest of Africa by the Arabs
                    they became mixed with Arabs; and having conquered Spain in their turn, they
                    intermarried with the natives of that country, whence, after a possession of
                    seven centuries, they were driven back to Mauritania. They are a handsome race,
                    having much more resemblance to Europeans and western Asiatics than to Arabs or
                    Berbers, although their language is Arabic, that is, the Mogrebin dialect, which
                    differs considerably from the Arabic in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n283/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0283-0262"/> Arabia, and even in Egypt. They are an
                    intellectual people, and not altogether unlettered; but they are cruel,
                    revengeful, and blood-thirsty, exhibiting but very few traces of that nobility
                    of mind and delicacy of feeling and taste which graced their ancestors in Spain.
                    The history of the throne of Marocco, of the dynastic revolutions at Algiers,
                    Tunis, and Tripoli,- is written with blood; and among the pirates who infested
                    the Mediterranean they were the worst. Their religion is the Mohammedan. They
                    are temperate in their diet and simple in their dress, except the richer classes
                    in the principal towns, where the ladies literally cover themselves with silk,
                    gold, and jewels, while the men indulge to excess their love of fine horses and
                    splendid arms. They generally lead a settled life as merchants, mechanics, or
                    agriculturists, but there are also many wandering tribes. They exhibit
                    considerable skill and taste in dyeing, and in the manufacture of swords,
                    saddlery, leathernware, gold and silver ornaments. At the Great Exhibition in
                    London in 1851, the Moorish department contained several articles which were
                    greatly admired. The Moors along the coast of Marocco still carry on piracy by
                    means of armed boats.</p>
                <p>At two different periods, separated from each other by perhaps a thousand years,
                    Africa was invaded by Arabic tribes, which took a lasting possession of the
                    districts they conquered, and whose descendants form no inconsiderable portion
                    of the population of North and Central Africa, while their language has
                    superseded all others as that of civilisation and religion. Of the first
                    invasion more has been said under the head “Abyssinians.” The second was that
                    effected by the first successors of Mahomet, who conquered Egypt, and
                    subsequently the whole north of Africa as far as the shores of the Atlantic, in
                    the course of the first century of the Hegira, or the seventh of the Christian
                    era. As regards language, Egypt is now an entirely Arabic country, although in
                    many other respects the Fellahs are totally different from the peasants in
                    Arabia. But there are also several tribes of true Arabic descent scattered about
                    from the high lands of Abyssinia down over Nubia and Egypt, and westward over
                    the central provinces of Kordofan, Darfur, Waday, and Bornu. Others wander in
                    the Libyan deserts and the Great Sahara, as well as in the states of Tripoli,
                    Tunis, and Algiers, leading a similar life with the Kabyles, but constituting a
                    totally distinct race. Others, again, dwell in the empire of Marocco, among whom
                    those along the shores of the Atlantic are notorious for their predatory habits
                    and ferocious character. In many places Arabic adventurers have succeeded in
                    subduing native tribes of every nationality, over which they rule as sovereign
                    lords; and on the coast of Zanzibar resides an Arabic royal dynasty. Many of the
                    smaller islands to the north of Madagascar are inhabited by Arabs, and traces of
                    them have been discovered in Madagascar itself. The African Arabs are not all
                    alike in features and colour of skin, the differences being attributable to some
                    of them having intermarried with natives, while others preserved the purity of
                    their blood.</p>
                <p>The early settlements of the Jews in Egypt are facts universally known. Under the
                    Ptolemies, large numbers of them settled at Alexandria and in Cyrenaica, and
                    after the destruction of Jerusalem they rapidly spread over the whole of the
                    Roman possessions in Africa; many also took refuge in Abyssinia. King Philip II.
                    having driven them out of Spain, many thousands of families took refuge on tho
                    opposite coast of Africa. They are now numerous in all the larger towns in the
                    north, where they carry on the occupation of merchants, brokers, &amp;c., the
                    trade with Europe being mostly in their hands. They live in a state of great
                    degradation, except in Algiers, where the French restored them to freedom and
                    independence. They have acquired much wealth, and although compelled to hide
                    their riches from the cupidity of their rulers, they lose no opportunity of
                    showing them whenever they can do so without risk of being plundered, fear and
                    vanity being characteristic features of their character. The Jewesses in Marocco
                    and Algiers are of remarkable beauty.</p>
                <p>Ever since the conquest of Egypt by Sultan Selim, and the establishment of
                    Turkish pashalics in Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers, Turks have settled in the
                    north of Africa; and as they were the rulers of the country, whose numbers were
                    always on the increase on account of the incessant arrivals of Turkish soldiers
                    and officials, the Turkish became, and still is, the language of the different
                    governments. Properly speaking, however, they are not settled, but only encamped
                    in Africa, and hardly deserve a place among the African nations.</p>
                <p>Not all the inhabitants of the country called Abyssinia are Abyssinians; nor are
                    the real Abyssinians all of the same origin, being a mixed race, to the
                    formation of which several distinct nations have contributed. The primitive
                    stock is of Ethiopian origin, but, as their language clearly shows, was at an
                    early period mixed with a tribe of the Himyarites from the opposite coast of
                    Arabia, who, in their turn, were ethnologically much more closely connected with
                    the Hebrews than with the Joctanides, or the Arabs properly speaking. In the age
                    of the Egyptian Ptolemies, and after the destruction of Jerusalem, Jews settled
                    in Abyssinia in such numbers, that not only their religion spread among the
                    inhabitants, but the Hebrew language became mixed with the Abyssinian as it then
                    was. Hence the surprising analogy between the principal Abyssinian languages,
                    viz., the Gheez in Tigré, and the Amharic in Amhara, with the Hebrew. The
                    uninterrupted intercourse with Arabia, and the immigration of several Arabic
                    tribes, also contributed towards the apparently Semitic aspect of the present
                    Abyssinian language. A large portion of Abyssinia having been occupied by Galla
                    and other tribes, we shall here only dwell on the original Abyssinians. They
                    inhabit a large tract, extending from the upper course of the Blue River, north
                    as far as the Red Sea, and some isolated districts in the south and south-east.
                    To the west of them are the Agau Abyssinians, a different tribe, whose idiom,
                    however, is the common language of the lower classes in Tigré and Amhara also.
                    Abyssinia was once a large and powerful kingdom, but the Galla having conquered
                    the whole south of it, it gradually declined until the king or emperor became a
                    mere shadow, in whose name several vassal princes exercise an unlimited power
                    each in his own territory. Owing to their jealousy and mutual fears, war seldom
                    ceases among the inhabitants. The Christian religion was introduced into
                    Abyssinia in the first centuries after Christ; but whatever its condition might
                    have been in former times, it now presents a degraded mixture of Christian
                    dogmas and rites, Jewish observances, and heathenish superstition. Yet of
                    Judaism, which was once so powerful, but feeble traces are extant, while the
                    Mohammedan religion is visibly on the increase. European missionaries have been,
                    and still are very active among them, but their efforts have been crowned only
                    with partial success. The Abyssinians, the Gallas being excluded from that
                    denomination, are a fine strong race, of a copper hue, more or less dark, and
                    altogether different from the Negroes, with whom, however, they have frequently
                    been confounded, because they were called a black people. Their noses are nearly
                    straight, their eyes beautifully clear, yet languishing, and their hair is black
                    and crisp, but not woolly. They are on the whole a barbarous people, addicted to
                    the grossest sensual pleasures; and their priests, among whom marriage is
                    customary, are little better than the common herd of the people. They live in
                    huts, a large assemblage of which forms a so-called <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0284-0263"/> town; and although they possess some solid
                    constructions of stone, such as churches and bridges, it appears that these were
                    built by the Portuguese, the ruins at Axum and other places belonging to a much
                    earlier period, when the country undoubtedly enjoyed a higher civilisation than
                    at present. Owing to the influence exercised upon them during the last thirty
                    years by European missionaries and travellers, their conduct towards strangers
                    is less rude than it used to be at the time of Bruce. It is a remarkable fact
                    that, notwithstanding the low state of their religion, the Christians in
                    Abyssinia are not allowed to keep slaves, although they may purchase them for
                    the purpose of selling them again.</p>
                <p>This extensive race comprehends by far the greater number of African nations,
                    extending over the whole of Middle and South Africa, except its southernmost
                    projection towards the Cape of Good Hope. A line drawn from the mouth of the
                    Senegal in the west to Cape Jerdaffun in the east, forms its northern limits
                    almost with geometrical accuracy, few Ethiopic tribes being found to the north
                    of it. All the members of this race, however, are not Negroes. The latter are
                    only one of its numerous offshoots; but between the receding forehead, the
                    projecting cheek-bones, the thick lips of the Negro of Guinea, and the more
                    straight configuration of the head of a Galla in Abyssinia, there are still many
                    striking analogies; and modern philology having traced still greater analogies,
                    denoting a common origin, among the only apparently disconnected languages of so
                    many thousands of tribes, whose colour presents all the hues between the deepest
                    black and the yellow brown, it is no longer doubtful that the Negro, the Galla,
                    the Somali, and the Kaffre, all belong to the same ethnological stock.</p>
                <p>The principal Negro nations, as we know them, are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mandingoes,</hi> who are numerous, powerful, and not uncivilised, in
                    Senegambia, and farther inland, around the head waters of the Quorra, where they
                    have established a great number of kingdoms and smaller sovereignties. The
                    inland trade is chiefly in their hands. They are black, with a mixture of
                    yellow, and their hair is completely woolly. The <hi rend="italic">Wolofs</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Yolofs,</hi> whose language is totally different from those
                    of their neighbours, are the handsomest and blackest of all Negroes, although
                    they live at a greater distance from the equator than most of the other black
                    tribes, their principal dwelling-places being between the Senegal and the
                    Gambia, along the coast of the Atlantic. They are a mild and social people. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Foulahs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Fellatahs</hi> occupy the
                    central parts of Soudan, situated in the crescent formed by the course of the
                    Quorra, and also large tracts to the southeast, as far as the equator west to
                    the Senegal, and east till beyond Lake Chad. Their colour, as a rule, is black,
                    intermixed, however, with a striking copper hue, some of them being hardly more
                    dark than gipsies. They are one of the most remarkable nations in Africa, very
                    industrious, live in commodious and clean habitations, and are mostly
                    Mohammedans. A distinction was formerly made between the Foulahs of Senegambia
                    and the Fellatahs of Central Africa, but it has since been ascertained that they
                    belong to the same stock, and speak the same language. The hair of the Foulahs
                    is much less woolly than that of other Negroes. Of the principal nations in
                    Guinea, among whom the true Negro type is particularly distinct, especially
                    around the Bight of Benin, are the Feloops, near the Casamança, very black, yet
                    handsome; and the Ashanti, of the Amina race, who surpass all their neighbours
                    in civilisation, and the cast of whose features differs so much from the Negro
                    type that they are said to be more like Indians than Africans; although this is
                    perhaps only true of the higher orders. They are still in possession of a
                    powerful kingdom. The country behind the Slave Coast is occupied by tribes akin
                    to the Dahomeh on the coast. In South Guinea we meet three principal races,
                    namely, the Congo, the Abunda, and the Benguela Negroes, who are divided into a
                    variety of smaller tribes, with whom we are much less acquainted than with the
                    northern Negroes, although the Portuguese have occupied this coast for upwards
                    of three centuries. The <hi rend="italic">Wamasai</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wak-wavi,</hi> possibly of Abyssinian stock, are a remarkable race of wild
                    nomad hunters, who occupy the high plateau which rises between the coast-land
                    and the Victoria Nyanza, extending from the equator southward to the route which
                    leads from Zanzibar to the Tanganyika Lake. They are the terror of the more
                    settled inhabitants of the surrounding countries, and occasionally make raids
                    down even to the coast-land behind Mombas. The next great branch of the Ethiopic
                    race comprehends the Galla, who occupy an immense tract in Eastern Africa, from
                    Abyssinia as far as the fourth degree of S. latitude, on the coast inward from
                    Mombas. Our knowledge of them is chiefly confined to those Gallas who conquered
                    Abyssinia. With regard to their physical conformation, they stand between the
                    Negro of Guinea and the Arab and Berber. Their countenances are rounder than
                    those of the Arabs, their noses are almost straight, and their hair, though
                    strongly frizzled, is not so woolly as that of the Negro, nor are their lips
                    quite so thick. Their eyes are small (in which they again differ from the
                    Abyssinians), deeply set, but very lively. They are a strong, large, almost
                    bulky people, whose colour varies between black and brownish, some of their
                    women being remarkably fair, considering the race they belong to. An interesting
                    tribe of them has lately been brought to the knowledge of Europeans, the Somali,
                    originally Arabs, who have advanced from the southern shores of the Gulf of Aden
                    since the 15th century, and now occupy the greater portion of the East African
                    promontory wedging into the Galla region, and almost dividing that country into
                    two distinct portions. For the most part they pursue a wandering and pastoral
                    life.</p>
                <p>In the central regions of the continent the negroid tribes, which are classed
                    under the general name of Wanyamwezi, occupying the plateau south of the
                    Victoria and east of the Tanganyika Lakes, have been made known by Burton and
                    subsequent travellers; round the west and north of the Victoria are several
                    distinct kingdoms, the chief being those of Karague and Uganda, traversed by
                    Speke and Grant; in the region west of the Upper Nile the countries of the Jur,
                    Dor, and Bongo tribes have been explored by Dr Schweinfurth, and he has passed
                    beyond the watershed of the Nile into a new basin, where he found the Niamniam
                    and Monbuttu tribes. Dr Livingstone, in his latest journey, has entered the
                    country of the Manyuema tribes, west of Tanganyika, in the heart of the
                    continent; these he describes as a fine, tall handsome race, superior alike to
                    the slaves seen at Zanzibar and the typical negro of the west coast; exceedingly
                    numerous, and living in a primitive condition, utterly ignorant of the outer
                    world. The Balunda race of Negroes occupy a great area of South Central Africa,
                    and have two ancient and powerful kingdoms of Muropua and Lunda, the former
                    ruled over by the hereditary “Muata” or chief Hianvo, who has his capital near
                    the Cassabi tributary of the Congo, and the latter by the Hianvo’s vassal, the
                    Cazembe, whose palace is near the Luapula river, south-west of Lake Tanganyika.
                    Kibakoe or Quiboque and Lobal, south-west of the kingdom of Hianvo, are the
                    chief states on the borders of Angola and Benguela; towards the Nyassa lake,
                    southeast from the Cazembe’s dominions, the Maravi tribe is per haps the most
                    powerful, and beyond the Nyassa that of the Wahiao is the chief. The Makololo
                    tribe, occupying the central portion of the Zambeze basin, is of southern
                    origin, and forms an intermediate stage between the Negro and Kaffre.</p>
                <p>The Kaffres, who, together with the tribes most akin to them, occupy the greater
                    portion of South Africa, especially the eastern portions, have some analogy with
                    Europeans in <pb break="no"

                    while some are almost black, others are comparatively fair, although some of
                    their tribes might have been mixed with the Eastern Negroes. They have been very
                    wrongly classed with the Negroes. They are a strong, muscular, active people,
                    addicted to plunder and warfare. The Eastern Kaffres, among whom the Amakosah
                    and Amazulah are best known to us, on account of their frequent invasions of the
                    Cape Colony, are much more savage than the western and northern, or the Bechuana
                    and Sichuana tribes. All Kaffres are pastoral, keeping large herds of cattle;
                    but the last-named tribes inhabit large towns, well-built houses, cultivate the
                    ground carefully, and exhibit every appearance of being capable of entire
                    civilisation. The word Kaffre, or Kafir, as it ought to be written, is Arabic,
                    and was first applied by the Europeans to the inhabitants of the coast of
                    Mozambique, because they were so called by the Mohammedans, in whose eyes they
                    were <hi rend="italic">Kafirs,</hi> that is infidels.</p>
                <p>We conclude this sketch with the Hottentot race, which is entirely different from
                    all the other races of Africa. Where they originally came from, and how they
                    happened to be hemmed in and confined entirely to this remote corner of the
                    earth, is a problem not likely to be ever satisfactorily solved. The only people
                    to whom the Hottentot has been thought to bear a resemblance, are the Chinese or
                    Malays, or their original stock the Mongols. Like these people they have the
                    broad forehead, the high cheek-bones, the oblique eye, the thin beard, and the
                    dull yellow tint of complexion, resembling the colour of a dried tobacco leaf;
                    but there is a difference with regard to the hair, which grows in small tufts,
                    harsh, and rather wiry, covering the scalp somewhat like the hard pellets of a
                    shoe-brush. The women, too, have a peculiarity in their physical conformation,
                    which, though occasionally to be met with in other nations, is not universal, as
                    among the Hottentots. Their constitutional “bustles” sometimes grow to three
                    times the size of those artificial stuffings with which our fashionable ladies
                    have disfigured themselves. Even the females of the diminutive Bosjesmen
                    Hottentots, who frequently perish of hunger in the barren mountains, and are
                    reduced to skeletons, have the same protuberances as the Hottentots of the
                    plains. It is not known even whence the name of Hottentot proceeds, as it is
                    none of their own. It has been conjectured that <hi rend="italic">hot</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">tot</hi> frequently occurring in their singular language, in
                    which the monosyllables are enunciated with a palatic clacking with the tongue,
                    like that of a hen, may have given rise to the name, and that the early Dutch
                    settlers named them <hi rend="italic">hot-en-tot.</hi> They call themselves <hi
                    rend="italic">qui-quae,</hi> pronounced with a clack. They are a lively,
                    cheerful, good-humoured people, and by no means wanting in intellect; but they
                    have met with nothing but harsh treatment since their first connection with
                    Europeans. Neither Bartholomew Diaz, who first discovered, nor Vasco de Gama,
                    who first doubled, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any of the subsequent Portuguese
                    navigators, down to 1509, had much communication with the natives of this
                    southern angle of Africa; but in the year above mentioned, Francisco d’Al-meyda,
                    viceroy of India, having landed on his return at Saldanha (now Table) Bay, was
                    killed, with about twenty of his people, in a scuffle wtih the natives. To
                    avenge his death, a Portuguese captain, about three years afterwards, is said to
                    have landed a piece of ordnance loaded with grape shot, as a pretended present
                    to the Hottentots. Two ropes were attached to this fatal engine; the Hottentots
                    poured down in swarms. Men, women, and children flocked round the deadly
                    machine, as the Trojans did round the wooden horse, “<hi rend="italic">funemque
                    manu contingere gaudent.”</hi> The brutal Portuguese fired off the piece, and
                    viewed with savage delight the mangled carcasses of the deluded people. The
                    Dutch effected their ruin by gratifying their propensity for brandy and tobacco,
                    at the expense of their herds of cattle, on which they subsisted. Under the
                    British sway they have received protection, and shown themselves not unworthy of
                    it. They now possess property, and enjoy it in security. One of the most
                    beautiful villages, and the neatest and best-cultivated gardens, belong to a
                    large community of Hottentots, under the instruction and guidance of a few
                    Moravian missionaries.</p>
                <p>These forlorn people are of Hottentot origin. Of them also several tribes have
                    been discovered much farther north, and intelligence has lately reached Europe,
                    that between the Portuguese possessions, in the very centre of South Africa,
                    there is a nation of dwarfish appearance who possess large herds, and who seem
                    to belong to the original Bushmen stock.</p>
                <p>The island of Madagascar is inhabited by a race of Malay origin, exhibiting
                    traces of Negro and Arabic mixture.</p>
                <p>The area and population of Africa and its divisions are thus estimated:—<note

                <p>In the central forest regions of Africa, wherever communications with the
                    coast-land have been opened up, hunting the elephant for its tusks to barter
                    with the traders appears to be the characteristic occupation, if any, beyond
                    that of mere attention to the daily wants of life, is engaged in; and here the
                    population may be considered as a settled one, living in villages in the more
                    open spaces of the woods. A rudely agricultural state seems to mark the outer
                    belt of negro land on each side of the equatorial zone, where the population is
                    also more or less stationary. The arid regions of the Sahara and the Kalahari
                    beyond have, on the other hand, a thinly scattered nomadic population, though
                    here also the fertile wadys form lines of more permanent habitation, and contain
                    permanent towns and villages. Excepting in the immediate neighbourhood of the
                    Mediterranean in Abyssinia, on a narrow margin of the coasts of the Atlantic and
                    the Indian Ocean, and in those parts which have been colonised by Europeans, or
                    which came directly under their influence, society has remained in a barbarian
                    state, and there remain great areas the inhabitants of which have as yet no
                    knowledge of the outer world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi> is conducted with little art The natural
                    fertility of the soil in the well-watered districts supersedes the need of
                    skill, while the production of the simplest manufactures is alone requisite,
                    where the range of personal wants embraces few objects, and those of the
                    humblest class.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wars,</hi> cruel and incessant, waged not for the sake of
                    territory, but for the capture of slaves, form one of the most marked and
                    deplorable features in the social condition of the African races. This practice,
                    though not of foreign introduction, has been largely promoted by the cupidity of
                    the Europeans and Transatlantic nations; and, unhappily, the efforts of private
                    philanthropy, and the political arrangements of various governments, have not
                    yet availed to terminate the hideous traffic in mankind, or abate the suffering
                    entailed upon its victims.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Religion,</hi> Christianity is professed in Abyssinia, and
                    in Egypt by the Copts, but its doctrines and precepts are little understood and
                    obeyed. Mohammedanism prevails in all Northern Africa, excepting Abyssinia, as
                    far as a line passing through the Soudan, from the Gambia on the west to the
                    confluence of the Quorra and Benue, and thence eastward, generally following the
                    10th parallel of N. lat. to the Nile below the junction of the Ghazal; thence
                    southeast, leaving the coast-land in the Mohammedan region, to Cape Delgado. In
                    Marocco, Algeria, and Egypt, there is an admixture of Jews. Heathen Negroes and
                    Caffre tribes extend southward over the continent from the line described above
                    to the colonies in the southern extremity of the continent; and over this vast
                    area the native mind is surrendered to superstitions of infinite number and
                    character. In the Cape Colony Protestantism again prevails, but with a strong
                    intermixture of heathenism. The labours of Christian missionaries have, however,
                    done much, especially in South Africa, towards turning the benighted Africans
                    from idols to the living God.</p>
                <p>In describing the political divisions of Africa, we shall proceed from north to
                    south.</p>
                <p>The country included under the general name of Barbary extends from the borders
                    of Egypt on the east to the Atlantic on the west, and is bounded by the
                    Mediterranean on the north, and by the Sahara on the south. It comprises the
                    states of Marocco, Algeria, Tunis, and Tripoli</p>
                <p>Marocco, the most westerly state of Barbary, is thus named by the Europeans, but
                    by the Arabs themselves Mogr'-eb-el-Aksa, or “the extreme west.” The eastern
                    boundary was determined in the treaty with the French of 18th March 1845, by a
                    line which, in the south, commences east of the oasis Figueg, intersecting the
                    desert of Angad, and reaching the Mediterranean at a point about 30 miles west
                    of the French port Nemours. In the south Marocco embraces the oasis of Tuat and
                    the Wady Draa. The power of the government of Marocco, which is despotic and
                    cruel, as well as the population of the country, appear to have diminished
                    greatly. Two-thirds of the country are independent of the Sultan’s authority,
                    and are held by mountain chiefs who defy his power. The trade of the coast is
                    maintained by European merchants. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Marocco.</hi></p>
                <p>Algeria extends from Marocco in the west, to Tunis in the east, and closely
                    answers in its limits to the ancient kingdom of Numidia. The southern boundaries
                    are not very definite, falling, as they do, within the boundless plains of the
                    desert See <hi rend="smallcaps">Algiers.</hi></p>
                <p>Tunis is the smallest of the Barbary states. The configuration of the surface is
                    similar to that of Algeria, in three divisions, the “Tell,” or fertile coast
                    slopes, the steppes on the high lands, and the low-lying Sahara beyond. The
                    highest peaks range between 4000 and 5000 feet. The southern plains comprise the
                    land of dates (Belad-el-Jerid), and several extensive salt lakes. Tunis
                    possesses but few rivers and streams, and springs are plentiful only in the
                    mountainous regions.</p>
                <p>The climate is, upon the whole, salubrious, and is not of the same excessive
                    character as that of Algeria; regular sea-breezes exercise an ameliorating
                    influence both in summer and winter; frost is almost unknown, and snow never
                    falls. During summer occasional winds from the south render the atmosphere
                    exceedingly dry and hot</p>
                <p>The natural productions of the country are somewhat similar to those of the other
                    Barbary states, but dates of the finest quality are more largely produced. The
                    horses and dromedaries are of excellent breed, and the former are eagerly sought
                    for the French army in Algeria. Bees are reared in great quantity, and coral
                    fisheries are carried on. Of minerals lead, salt, and saltpetre are the most
                    noticeable.</p>
                <p>The population consists chiefly of Mohammedan Moors and Arabs; the number of Jews
                    is estimated at 45,000, and of Roman Catholics 25,000. The former have attained
                    a higher degree of industry and civilisation than their brethren elsewhere;
                    those of the latter who inhabit the central mountainous regions are nearly
                    independent</p>
                <p>The government is vested in a hereditary bey, and has been conducted in peace and
                    security for a number of years. From the year 1575 onwards, Tunis has been under
                    the rule of Turkey; but by a firman of October 1871 the Sultan renounced the
                    ancient tribute. The bey, who is styled “Possessor of the kingdom of Tunis,” is
                    confirmed in his position at Constantinople, and may neither enter into a war,
                    nor conclude a treaty of peace, nor cede any part of his territory without the
                    sanction of the Sultan. The Tunisian coinage bears the name of the Sultan, and
                    the troops (3900 infantry and artillery, and 100 cavalry, form the regular army)
                    are at the disposal of the Sublime Porte in time of war. In the interior of the
                    country the bey has absolute power. The slave trade was abolished in 1842.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Tunis is considerable, but agriculture is in a backward state.
                    The exports consist chiefly of wool, olive-oil, wax, honey, hides, dates, grain,
                    coral, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The principal town is Tunis, situated on a shallow lake on the north coast. It is
                    the most important commercial place on the southern shores of the Mediterranean
                    after Alexandria, and has a population of about 125,000. The site of the ancient
                    Carthage is 13 miles from Tunis in the direction of Cape Bon.</p>
                <p>Tripoli, a regency of the Turkish empire, extends from Tunis along the shores of
                    the Mediterranean to the tableland of Barca, which forms a separate province.
                    Politically, it includes the pashalic of Fezzan, a country which, in a physical
                    point of view, belongs to the Sahara.</p>
                <p>Tripoli is the least favoured by nature of the Barbary <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n287/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0287-0266"/> states, possessing a great extent of sterile
                    surface. Mr Richardson graphically describes the physiognomy of the country
                    between the towns of Tripoli and Murzuk in eight zones:—1. The plain along the
                    sea-shore, with the date-palm plantations and the sandhills; 2. The Gharian
                    mountains, with their olive and fig plantations, more favoured with rains than
                    the other regions; 3. The limestone hills and broad valleys between the town of
                    Kalubah and Ghareeah, gradually assuming the aridity of the Sahara as yo proceed
                    southward; 4. The Hamadah, an immense desert plateau, separating Tripoli from
                    Fezzan; 5. The sandy valleys and limestone rocks between El-Hessi and Es-Shaty,
                    where herbage and trees are found; 6. The sand between Shiaty and El-Wady, piled
                    in masses or heaps, and extending in undulating plains; 7. The sandy valleys of
                    El-Wady, covered with forests of date-palms; 8. The plateau of Murzuk,
                    consisting of shallow valleys, ridges of low sandstone hills, and naked plains.
                    These zones extend parallel with the Mediterranean shores through the greater
                    portion of the country. A summit of the Jebel-es-Soda, or Black Mountains,
                    midway between Tripoli and Murzuk, almost 2800 feet high, is supposed to be the
                    culminating point of the regency. Rivers exist only periodically, and springs
                    are exceedingly scarce.</p>
                <p>The climate is somewhat more subject to extremes than that of Tunis, especially
                    in the interior, where burning heat is followed by excessive cold. As far south
                    as Sokna snow occasionally falls. The climate of Murzuk is very unhealthy, and
                    frequently fatal to Europeans.</p>
                <p>The natural products are very much like those of Tunis. Oxen and horses are
                    small, but of good quality; the mules are of excellent breed. Locusts and
                    scorpions are among the most noxious animals. Salt and sulphur are the chief
                    minerals.</p>
                <p>The population is very thin. Arabs are the prominent race, besides which are
                    Turks, Berbers, Jews, Tibbus, and Negroes. The country is governed by a pasha,
                    subject to the Ottoman empire. The military force by which the Turks hold
                    possession of this vast but thinly-peoplcd territory amounts to 4500 men.</p>
                <p>The commerce is not inconsiderable, and the inhabitants of Tripoli trade with
                    almost every part of the Sahara, as well as the Soudan. At Murzuk there is a
                    large annual market, which lasts from October to January. The exports of Tripoli
                    are wheat, wax, ivory, ostrich feathers, madder, esparto grass, cattle, salt,
                    and dates.</p>
                <p>Tripoli is the capital of the regency, and the largest town; it lies on the
                    Mediterranean, surrounded by a fertile plain; the number of inhabitants is about
                    30,000. Murzuk, the capital of Fezzan, has a mixed population of about 11,000
                    souls. The town of Ghadamis has about 7000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>In 1869 the maritime plateau of Barca and the depressed region inland from it,
                    which contains the oases of Aujila and Jalo, was formed into a separate
                    government, dependent directly upon Constantinople. This country is the seat of
                    the ancient Greek <hi rend="italic">Pentapolis</hi> of Bernice, Arsinoe, Barca,
                    Apollonia, and Cyrene. Bengazi, the only place of importance, occupies the site
                    of the first of these on the Mediterranean, and has from 6000 to 7000
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Egypt occupies the north-eastern corner of Africa, and is remarkable for its
                    ancient and sacred associations, and its wonderful monuments of human art.</p>
                <p>Egypt is a vast desert, the fertile portions susceptible of cultivation being
                    confined to the Delta of the Nile and its narrow valley, a region celebrated in
                    the most ancient historic documents for its singular fertility, and still
                    pouring an annual surplus of grain into the markets of Europe. By the annual
                    inundation of the Nile this region is laid under water, and upon its retirement
                    the grain crops are sown in the layer of mud left behind it. Barren ranges of
                    hills and elevated tracts occupy the land on both sides of the Nile, which is
                    the only river of the country. The amount of its rise is a matter of extreme
                    solicitude to the people, for should it pass its customary bounds a few feet,
                    cattle are drowned, houses are swept away, and immense injury ensues; a falling
                    short of the ordinary height, on the other hand, causes dearth and famine,
                    according to its extent. The water of the Nile is renowned for its agreeable
                    taste and wholesome quality. In connection with the Nile is the Birket-el-Kerun,
                    a salt lake.</p>
                <p>The climate is very hot and dry. Rain falls but seldom along the coasts, but the
                    dews are very copious. The hot and oppressive winds, called khamsin and simooms,
                    are a frequent scourge to the country; but the climate is, upon the whole, more
                    salubrious than that of many other tropical countries.</p>
                <p>The natural products are not of great variety. The wild plants are but few and
                    scanty, while those cultivated include all the more important kinds adapted to
                    tropical countries; rice, wheat, sugar, cotton, indigo, are cultivated for
                    export; dates, figs, pomegranates, lemons, and olives, are likewise grown. The
                    doum-palm, which appears in Upper Egypt, is characteristic, as also the papyrus.
                    The fauna is characterised by an immense number of waterfowl, flamingoes,
                    pelicans, &amp;c. The hippopotamus and crocodile, the two primeval inhabitants
                    of the Nile, seem to be banished from the Delta, the latter being still seen in
                    Upper Egypt. The cattle are of excellent breed. Large beasts of prey are
                    wanting; but the ichneumon of the ancients still exists. Bees, silkworms, and
                    corals are noticeable. Minerals are scarce, natron, salt, and sulphur being the
                    principal.</p>
                <p>The native Egyptians of Arab descent compose the great bulk of the people, the
                    peasant and labouring class, and are termed Fellahs. Next in number, though
                    comparatively few (145,000), are the Copts, descended from the old inhabitants
                    of the country, the ancient Egyptians, but far from being an unmixed race. The
                    Arabic Bedouin tribes, Negroes, European Christians (Greeks, Italians, French,
                    Austrian, English), the Jews, and the dominant Turks, compose the remainder of
                    the population.</p>
                <p>Egypt is formally a Turkish pashalic, but the hereditary pasha, by whom the
                    government is conducted, and whose authority is absolute, is practically an
                    independent prince. The government of Nubia and Kordofan is also conducted by
                    the Pasha of Egypt, and recently the whole of the Nile valley, as far south as
                    the equator, has been annexed by the Egyptian government. An army of about
                    14,000 men is maintained.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of Egypt has always been considerable, there being three harvests
                    in the year. The industry is limited: one peculiar branch is the artificial
                    hatching of eggs in ovens heated to the requisite temperature, a process which
                    has been handed down from antiquity, and is now chiefly carried on by the Copts.
                    Floating bee-hives are also peculiar to the Nile. The commerce is extensive and
                    important: the exports to Europe consist chiefly of cotton, flax, indigo,
                    gum-arabic, ostrich feathers, ivory, senna, and gold. The country forms part of
                    the great highway of traffic between Europe and Southern Asia. Railways, from
                    the ports of Alexandria and Damietta in the Mediterranean, and from Suez on the
                    Red Sea, unite at Cairo; and a railway now extends thence up the bank of the
                    Nile to near the first cataract of the river at Assouan, in lat. 24° N.</p>
                <p>The Suez canal, uniting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, was begun in April
                    1859, and was opened for traffic ten years later, in November 1869. The cutting
                    runs from the artificial harbour of Port Said on the Mediterranean, through the
                    shallow lagoon of Menzaleh, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n288/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0288-0267"/> through two smaller Jakes with low sandhills
                    between; nearer Suez a depressed area, in which several salt lakes formerly
                    existed, has been filled up by water let in by the canal, and now forms a wide
                    expanse of water. In length the canal is nearly 100 miles, and has a depth
                    throughout of 26 feet, with a general width of 200 to 300 feet at the top of the
                    banks and 72 feet at the bottom. Vessels are able to steam or be towed through
                    the canal in sixteen hours from sea to sea. Extensive harbours and docks have
                    been constructed both on the Mediterranean side and at Suez. The number of
                    vessels which entered Fort Said in 1871 was 1215, of 928,000 tons, exclusive of
                    87 war-ships.</p>
                <p>Egypt proper is divided into three sub-pashalics—Bahari or Lower Egypt, Vostani
                    or Middle Egypt, and Said or Upper Egypt. Cairo, on the east bank of the Nile,
                    is the capital of Egypt, and is the largest town of Africa, containing 354,000
                    inhabitants: it has 400 mosques, and upwards of 130 minarets, some of them of
                    rich and graceful architecture, presenting at a distance an appearance
                    singularly imposing. Alexandria, on the coast, is the emporium of the commerce
                    with Europe, and has 220,000 inhabitants, among whom are 54,000 Europeans.
                    Damietta has a population of 37,100; Rosetta of 18,300. Suez, on the northern
                    extremity of the Red Sea, is a small, ill-built town, but has assumed importance
                    as a good port since the establishment of the overland route to India and the
                    completion of the maritime canal. It has now nearly 14,000 inhabitants, of whom
                    about 2500 are Europeans. Port Said has 8800 inhabitants, of whom one-half are
                    foreigners.</p>
                <p>Nubia extends along the Red Sea, from Egypt to Abyssinia, comprising the middle
                    course of the Nile.</p>
                <p>The natural features of the country are varied; the northern portion consisting
                    of a burning sterile wilderness, while the southern, lying within the range of
                    the tropical rains, and watered by the Abyssinian affluents of the Nile,
                    exhibits vegetation in its tropical glory, forests of arborescent grasses,
                    timber-trees, and parasitical plants largely clothing the country. This latter
                    territory, which may be called Upper Nubia, includes the region of ancient
                    Meroe, situated in the peninsula formed by the Nile proper, the Blue River, and
                    the Atbara, and comprises, further south, the recently extinguished modern
                    kingdom of Sennaar.</p>
                <p>Nubia forms the link between the plain of Egypt and the high table-lands of
                    Abyssinia; its general physical character is that of a slightly ascending
                    region. The lowest parts in Upper Nubia scarcely exceed an altitude of 1300
                    feet; Khartum, at the confluence of the Blue and White Rivers, being 1345 feet
                    above the level of the sea. A chain of mountains and elevated land rises
                    abruptly along the shores of the Red Sea, gradually sloping down to the valley
                    of the Nile; the intermediate region being intersected by smaller ranges, groups
                    of hills, and numerous wadys filled with sand. The spurs of the Abyssinian
                    table-land, extending within the southern confines of Nubia, reach a height of
                    3000 feet. Besides the Nile, the country is watered by two other large rivers,
                    its tributaries, the Bhar-el-Azrek or Blue River, and the Atbara or Takkazze,
                    both being much alike in magnitude, and having their head-streams in the
                    Abyssinian table-land.</p>
                <p>The climate of Nubia is tropical throughout, and the heat in the deserts of its
                    central portions is not exceeded by that of any other part of the globe. The
                    southern half of the country is within the influence of the tropical rains, the
                    northern partakes the character of the almost rainless Sahara; and while the
                    latter is generally very salubrious, the former is a land of dangerous fevers,
                    particularly in the plains subject to inundations. Such is the Kolla, a marshy
                    and swampy region of great extent, situated along the foot of the Abyssinian
                    Mountains, between the Blue River and the Takkazze.</p>
                <p>The northern region is poor in natural productions, but in the south the
                    vegetation is most luxuriant; palms form a prominent feature, and the monkey
                    bread-tree attains its most colossal dimensions. The date-tree, dourra, cotton,
                    and indigo are cultivated. The date-palm does not extend beyond the south of
                    Abou-Egli, in lat. 18° 36'.</p>
                <p>The elephant occasionally wanders as far as Sennaar; the rhinoceros, lion,
                    giraffe, and buffalo are more common. The waters are inhabited by crocodiles
                    more ferocious than those of Egypt, and by huge hippopotami. The young
                    hippopotamus brought to the Zoological Gardens of London in 1850, was captured
                    in Nubia, in an island of the Nile, about 1800 miles above Cairo: no living
                    specimen had been seen in Europe since the period when they were exhibited by
                    the third Gordian in the Colosseum at Rome. Monkeys and antelopes are found in
                    great numbers. The camel does not extend beyond the twelfth degree of latitude
                    to the south. Ostriches roam over the deserts; and among the reptiles, besides
                    the crocodile, are large serpents of the python species, and tortoises. Of the
                    numerous insects the most remarkable is the scarabaeus of the ancient Egyptians,
                    still found in Sennaar. Of minerals Nubia possesses gold, silver, copper, iron,
                    salt.</p>
                <p>In the inhabitants two principal varieties are recognised, the pure original
                    population, and their descendants, mixed with other nations. The Berberines
                    inhabit the northern part, and the Bisharis the desert regions; the latter are
                    the genuine Nubians, finely moulded and dark complexioned, supposed by some to
                    agree more closely with the ancient Egyptians than the Copts, usually deemed
                    their representatives. In the south-eastern part the true Negro element
                    appears.</p>
                <p>Nubia, now a province under the pashalic of Egypt, consisted formerly of a number
                    of small and independent kingdoms. The Turkish conquest lasted from 1813 to
                    1822; in the latter years it was invaded and mercilessly ravaged by the army of
                    Mahomet Ali, under his second son Ismayl, whose dreadful atrocities entailed a
                    fearful fate upon himself, having been surprised when attending a nocturnal
                    banquet, at some distance from his camp, and burned to death.</p>
                <p>The country is favourable for agriculture, which, however, is only carried on to
                    a limited extent, by the women. Cattle are abundant, and the camels of the
                    Bisharin and Ababde are famous for their enduring powers. Salt is largely
                    exported from the shores of the Red Sea to India, and ivory, with other products
                    of tropical Africa, forms a principal article of trade.</p>
                <p>Khartum, the capital of Nubia, the headquarters of the Egyptian government, and
                    the chief seat of commerce, contains a population variously estimated at from
                    20,000 to 50,000. It is a modern town, having been founded in 1821, and lies in
                    a dry, flat, and unhealthy country, near the confluence of the two main branches
                    of the Nile. It is in telegraphic communication with Cairo.</p>
                <p>Kordofan, on the western side of Nubia, lies between the parallels of 12° and
                    16°, and between the meridians 29° and 32°, containing about 30,000 square
                    miles. It is a flat country, interspersed with a few hills, presenting in the
                    dry season a desert with little appearance of vegetation, and in the rainy
                    season a prairie, covered with luxuriant grass and other plants. The general
                    elevation of the country is 2000 feet, and some of the hills attain a height of
                    3000. The altitude of El Obeid is 2150 feet. There are no permanent rivers in
                    the country, and the natural products are similar to those of the adjoining
                    regions of Nubia.</p>
                <p>The population consists of Negroes. This country was, simultaneously with Nubia,
                    made tributary to Egypt. The <pb break="no"

                    and is not inconsiderable. El Obeid, the chief town, is composed of several
                    villages of mud-built houses, thatched with straw, containing about 12,000
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The boundaries of Abyssinia are somewhat uncertain; but confining it to the
                    provinces actually under the government of Christian or Mohammedan princes, it
                    may be described as extending from about 9° to 16° N. lat., and from 35° to 40°
                    E. long. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Abyssinia.</hi></p>
                <p>The Saharan countries extend from the Atlantic in the west, to the Nilotic
                    countries in the east, from the Barbary States in the north, to the basins of
                    the Rivers Senegal and Kawara, and Lake Chad in the south. The area of this
                    large space amounts to at least 2,000,000 square miles, or upwards of one-half
                    of that of the whole of Europe. It is very scantily populated, but from our
                    present defective knowledge of that region, the number of its inhabitants can be
                    but roughly estimated.</p>
                <p>The physical configuration of the Sahara has already been indicated.
                    Notwithstanding the proverbial heat, which is almost insupportable by day, there
                    is often great cold at night, owing to the excessive radiation, promoted by the
                    clearness of the sky. Rain is nearly, though not entirely absent, in this
                    desolate region. It appears that when nature has poured her bounty over the
                    adjoining regions in the south, and has little more left to bestow, she sends a
                    few smart showers of rain to the desert, parched by the long prevalence of the
                    perpendicular rays of the sun. The prevailing winds blow during three months
                    from the west, and nine months from the east When the wind increases, into a
                    storm, it frequently raises the loose sand in such quantities that a layer of
                    nearly equal portions of sand and air, and rising about 20 feet above the
                    surface of the ground, divides the purer atmosphere from the solid earth. This
                    sand, when agitated by whirlwinds, sometimes overwhelms caravans with
                    destruction, and, even when not fatal, involves them in the greatest confusion
                    and danger.</p>
                <p>The natural products correspond with the physical features of the country.
                    Vegetation and animal life exist only sparingly in the oases or valleys where
                    springs occur, and where the soil is not utterly unfit to nourish certain
                    plants. Amongst the few trees the most important is the date-palm, which is
                    peculiarly suited to the dryness of the climate. This useful tree flourishes
                    best in the eastern part of the desert, inhabited by the Tibbus. The doum-palm
                    is likewise a native of the same part, and seems entirely absent in the western
                    Sahara; its northernmost limit is on the southern borders of Fezzan and Tegerry,
                    in lat. 24° N. Acacias are found in the extreme west towards Senegambia,
                    furnishing the so-called gum-arabic. In many parts of the desert a thorny
                    evergreen plant occurs, about 18 inches high. It is eagerly eaten by the camels,
                    and is almost the only plant which supplies them with food while thus traversing
                    the desert. The cultivation of grains to a small extent is limited to the
                    western oases of Tuat and others, a little barley, rice, and beans, being there
                    grown. In the kingdom of Air there are some fields of maize and other grains;
                    but upon the whole, the population depend for these products on Soudan and other
                    regions. There are but a few specimens of wild animals in these wildernesses;
                    lions and panthers are found only on its borders. Gazelles and antelopes are
                    abundant, hares and foxes but scarce. Ostriches are very numerous, and vultures
                    and ravens are also met with. In approaching Soudan, animal and vegetable life
                    becomes more varied and abundant Of reptiles, only the smaller kinds are found,
                    mostly harmless lizards and a few species of snakes. Of domestic animals, the
                    most important is the camel, but horses and goats are not wanting, and in the
                    country of the Tuaricks an excellent breed of sheep is found, while in that of
                    the Tibbus a large and fine variety of the ass is valuable to the inhabitants.
                    Of minerals, salt is the chief production, which occurs chiefly near Bilma.</p>
                <p>The habitable portions of the Sahara are possessed by three different nations. In
                    the extreme western portion are Moors and Arabe. They live in tents, which they
                    remove from one place to another; and their residences consist of similar
                    encampments, formed of from twenty to a hundred of such tents, where they are
                    governed by a sheik of their own body; each encampment constituting, as it were,
                    a particular tribe. They are a daring set of people, and not restrained by any
                    scruple in plundering, ill-treating, and even killing persons who are not of
                    their own faith; but to such as are, they are hospitable and benevolent. The
                    boldest of these children of the desert are the Tuaricks, who occupy the middle
                    of the wilderness, where it is widest. The form of their bodies, and their
                    language, prove that they belong to the aboriginal inhabitants of Northern
                    Africa, who are known by the name of Berbers. They are a fine race of men, tall,
                    straight, and handsome, with an air of independence which is very imposing. They
                    live chiefly upon the tribute they exact from all caravans traversing their
                    country. They render themselves formidable to all their neighbours, with whom
                    they are nearly always in a state of enmity, making predatory incursions into
                    the neighbouring countries. The third division of Saharan people are the Tibbus,
                    who inhabit the eastern portion, comprising one of the best parts of the desert.
                    In some of their features they resemble the Negroes. They are an agricultural
                    and pastoral nation, live mostly in fixed abodes, and are in this respect
                    greatly different from their western neighbours. Their country is as yet little
                    explored by Europeans. The Tibbus are in part Pagans, while the other
                    inhabitants of the Sahara are Mohammedans.</p>
                <p>The commerce of the Sahara consists chiefly of gold, ostrich feathers, slaves,
                    ivory, iron, and salt, exchanged for manufactured goods, and transported across
                    the desert by great caravans, which follow lines uniting the greater cities and
                    oases of the southern and northern borders.</p>
                <p>Western Africa comprehends the west coast of Africa, from the borders of the
                    Sahara, in about lat. 17° N. to Nourse River, in about the same latitude south,
                    with a considerable space of inland territory, varying in its extent from the
                    shores, and, in fact, completely undefined in its interior limits.</p>
                <p>Senegambia, the country of the Senegal and Gambia, extends from the Sahara in the
                    north to lat. 10° in the south, and may be considered as extending inland to the
                    sources of the waters which flow through it to the Atlantic.</p>
                <p>The western portion is very flat, and its contiguity to the great desert is
                    frequently evidenced by dry hot winds, an atmosphere loaded with fine sand, and
                    clouds of locusts. The eastern portion is occupied with hills and elevated land.
                    Under the 10th parallel the hills approach quite close to the coast. The country
                    possesses a great number of rivers, among which the Senegal, Gambia, and Rio
                    Grande are the most important. Senegambia ranges, in point of heat, with the
                    Sahara and Nubia. The atmosphere is most oppressive in the rainy season, which
                    lasts from June to November, when an enormous amount of rain drenches the
                    country. The prevailing winds in that period are south-west, whereas in the dry
                    season they are from the east. The climate is, upon the whole, most unhealthy,
                    and too generally proves fatal to Europeans.</p>
                <p>The vegetation is most luxuriant and vigorous. The baobab (monkey bread-tree),
                    the most enormous tree on the face of the globe, is eminently characteristic of
                    Senegambia. It attains to no great height, but the circumference of the trunk is
                    frequently 60 to 75 feet, and has been found to measure 112 feet; its fruit, the
                    monkey bread, is a principal<pb break="no"

                    (cottontrees) are likewise numerous, and they are among the loftiest in the
                    world. Acacias, which furnish the gum-arabic, are most abundant, while the
                    shores are lined with mangrove trees. The flora and fauna are similar to those
                    of Nubia. Gold and iron are the chief metals.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants consist of various Negro nations, the chief of which are the
                    Wolof.</p>
                <p>The gum trade is the most important traffic on the Senegal; bees-wax, ivory,
                    bark, and hides, forming the chief exports from the Gambia.</p>
                <p>Of European settlements are: The French possessions on the Senegal; the capital
                    of which is St Louis, built about the year 1626, on an island at the mouth of
                    the river. The total population of the settlement amounts to about 210,000.</p>
                <p>The British settlement on the Gambia has about 7000 inhabitants. Bathurst is the
                    chief town.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese settlement consists of small factories south of the Gambia, at the
                    Bissagos Islands, Bissao, Cacheo, and some other points.</p>
                <p>The west coast of Africa, from Senegambia to the Nourse River, is commonly
                    comprised by the general denomination Guinea Coast, a term of Portuguese
                    origin.</p>
                <p>The coast is generally so very low, as to be visible to navigators only within a
                    very short distance, the trees being their only sailing marks. North of the
                    equator, in the Bight of Benin, the coast forms an exception, being high and
                    bold, with the Cameroon Mountains behind; as also at Sierra Leone, which has
                    received its name (Lion Mountain) in consequence. The coast presents a dead
                    level often for thirty to fifty miles inland. It has numerous rivers, some of
                    which extend to the furthest recesses of Inner Africa.</p>
                <p>The climate, notoriously fatal to European life, is rendered pestilential by the
                    muddy creeks and inlets, the putrid swamps, and the mangrove jungles that cover
                    the banks of the rivers. There are two seasons in the year, the rainy and the
                    dry season. The former commences in the southern portion in March, but at Sierra
                    Leone and other northern parts, a month later.</p>
                <p>Vegetation is exceedingly luxuriant and varied. One of the most important trees
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Elais guineensis,</hi> a species of palm, from the
                    covering of whose seed or nut is extracted the palm-oil, so well known to
                    English commerce and manufacture; several thousand tons are annually brought
                    into the ports of Liverpool, London, and Bristol. The palm-oil tree is
                    indigenous and abundant from the river Gambia to the Congo; but the oil is
                    manufactured in large quantities chiefly in the country of the Gold and Slave
                    Coasts. The former comprises nearly all the more remarkable of African animals:
                    particularly abundant are elephants, hippopotami, monkeys, lions, leopards,
                    crocodiles, serpents, parrots. The domestic animals are mostly of an inferior
                    quality. The principal minerals are gold and iron. The population consists,
                    besides a few European colonists, of a vast variety of Negro nations, similar in
                    their physical qualities and prevailing customs, but differing considerably in
                    their dispositions and morals.</p>
                <p>The chief articles of commerce are palm-oil, ivory, gold, wax, various kinds of
                    timber, spices, gums, and rice.</p>
                <p>The divisions of Northern or Upper Guinea are mostly founded on the productions
                    characteristic of the different parts, and are still popularly retained.</p>
                <p>The British colony of Sierra Leone extends from Rokelle river in the north, to
                    Kater river in the south, and about twenty miles inland. The chief portion of
                    the settlement is a rugged peninsula of mountains with a barren soil, but
                    surrounded by a belt of rich coast-land, with a moist and pestilential climate.
                    The colony was founded in 1787, and has been maintained with a view to the
                    suppression of the West African slave trade. The population, consisting chiefly
                    of liberated slaves, amounted, in 1869, to 55,374, of which number 129 were
                    white men. Freetown, the capital is, after St Louis, the most considerable
                    European town on the western coast of Africa.</p>
                <p>The Malaghetta or Grain Coast extends from Sierra Leone to Cape Palmas.
                    Malaghetta is a species of pepper yielded by a parasitical plant of this region.
                    It is sometimes styled the Windy or Windward Coast, from the frequency of short
                    but furious tornadoes throughout the year. The republic of Liberia, a settlement
                    of the American Colonisation Society, founded in 1822, for the purpose of
                    removing free people of colour from the United States, occupies a considerable
                    extent of the coast, and has for its capital Monrovia, a town named after the
                    president, Mr Monro.</p>
                <p>The Ivory Coast extends from Cape Palmas 3° W. long., and obtained its name from
                    the quantity of the article supplied by its numerous elephants. The French
                    settlements of Grand Bassam, Assinie, and Dabou were abandoned in 1871.</p>
                <p>The Gold Coast stretches from west of Cape Three Points to the river Volta, and
                    has long been frequented for gold-dust and other products. By a treaty of
                    February 1871, the whole of the Dutch possessions on the Gold Coast were made
                    over to Britain, and the Danish settlements of Christiansburg and Friedensburg
                    were ceded to the English in 1849; so that the British coast now extends from
                    the mouth of the Tenda river, in long 2° 40' W., to that of the Ewe, in long. 1°
                    10' E. of Greenwich. The protected territory extends inland from this coast
                    strip to an average distance of 50 miles. Cape Coast Castle and Fort James,
                    founded by the British, and Elmina (population about 10,000) the most important
                    of the former Dutch stations, with Accra, are the chief settlements.</p>
                <p>The Slave Coast e tends from the river Volta to the Calabar river, and is, as its
                    name implies, the chief scene of the most disgraceful traffic that blots the
                    history of mankind. Eko or Lagos, one of the chief towns of the coast, was
                    destroyed by the British in 1852, and was proclaimed a British possession in
                    1861. Palma aud Badagry are also British settlements.</p>
                <p>The kingdoms of Ashantee, Dahomey, Yoruba, and others, occupy the interior
                    country of the Guinea coast. Ashantee the most powerful Negro state of Upper
                    Guinea, is an exceedingly fertile and productive country. Its inhabitants,
                    though skilled in some manufactures and of a higher intelligence than is usually
                    found in this region, are of an exceedingly sanguinary disposition, and have
                    frequently been involved in war with the British. The capital city, Kumassi, is
                    believed to have a population of about 100,000.</p>
                <p>The coast from the Old Calabar river to the Portuguese possessions is inhabited
                    by various tribes. Duke Town, on the former river, is a town of 4000
                    inhabitants, with considerable trade in palm-oil, ivory, and timber.</p>
                <p>On the Gaboon river, close to the equator, are a French settlement (in 1871 the
                    French retained only a coaling station), and American missionary stations. At
                    the equator Southern or Lower Guinea begins, where the only European settlements
                    are those of the Portuguese.</p>
                <p>Loango is reckoned from the equator to the Zaïre or Congo river. Its chief town
                    is Boally, called Loango by the Europeans.</p>
                <p>Congo extends south of the Zaïre, comprising a very fertile region, with veins of
                    copper and iron. Banza Congo or St Salvador is the capital.</p>
                <p>Angola comprises the districts of Angola proper, Ben-guela, and Mossamedes. In
                    these regions the Portuguese settlements extend farther inland than the two
                    preceding <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n291/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0291-0270"/> districts, namely, about 200 miles. The capital,
                    St Paulo de Loando, contains 12,300 inhabitants, and has a fine harbour. St
                    Felipe de Benguela is situated in a picturesque but very marshy and most
                    unhealthy spot.</p>
                <p>The coast from Benguela to the Cape Colony may, in a general arrangement like
                    this, be included either within West Africa or South Africa. The whole coast is
                    little visited or known, being of a most barren and desolate description, and
                    possessing few harbours. Ichabo island and Angra Peguena Bay are visited for
                    their guano deposits, and are claimed as British possessions.</p>
                <p>Under South Africa the Cape Colony only is generally comprised. It takes its name
                    from the Cape of Good Hope, and extends from thence to the Orange river in the
                    north, and to the Kai river in the east. A large proportion of the territory
                    included within these limits, especially in the north, is either unoccupied, or,
                    excepting missionary stations, entirely in the hands of the aborigines.</p>
                <p>Apart from the shores, the country consists of high lands, forming parallel
                    mountainous ridges, with elevated plains or terraces of varying extent between.
                    The loftiest range, styled in different parts of its course Sneuw-bergen,
                    Winterbergen, Nieuveld-bergen, and Roggenveld-bergen, names originated by the
                    Dutch, is the third and last encountered on proceeding into the interior from
                    the south coast. This and the other chains are deeply cut by the transverse
                    valleys called kloofs, which serve as passes across them, and appear as if
                    produced by some sudden convulsion of nature, subsequently widened by the action
                    of the atmosphere and running water.</p>
                <p>The high plains or terraces are remarkable for their extraordinary change of
                    aspect in the succession of the seasons. During the summer heats they are
                    perfect deserts, answering to the term applied to them, karroos, signifying, in
                    the Hottentot language, “dry” or “arid.” But the sandy soil being pervaded with
                    the roots and fibres of various plants, is spontaneously clothed with the
                    richest verdure after the rains, and becomes transformed for a time into a vast
                    garden of gorgeous flowers, yielding the most fragrant odours. Adapted thus to
                    the support of graminivorous animals, the karroos are the resort of antelopes,
                    zebras, quaggas, and gnus in countless herds, and of the carnivorous beasts that
                    prey upon them, the lion, hyaena, leopard, and panther. These quadrupeds,
                    however, with the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, giraffe, buffalo, and
                    ostrich, have been largely banished from their old haunts by the advancing
                    footsteps of civilised man, and are only found in the more secluded parts of the
                    interior. The country has a singular and superb flora, but it comprises few
                    native plants useful to man: many such have been now introduced. Heaths of
                    varied species and great beauty abound; and geraniums are treated as common
                    weeds. Many highly productive districts occur; corn, wines, and fruit being the
                    chief objects of cultivation in the neighbourhood of the Cape, while the more
                    inland settlements are grazing farms. Some fine natural forests clothe the sides
                    of the mountains; but in general the colony is deficient in timber trees, as
                    well as in navigable streams, perennial springs, and regular rain. A great
                    deposit of rich copper ore occurs near the mouth of the Orange; and salt is
                    obtained for consumption and sale from salt lakes.</p>
                <p>The climate is exceedingly fine and salubrious. There are two seasons,
                    characterised by the prevalence of certain winds. During the summer, which lasts
                    from September to April, the winds blow from south-east, cold and dry; during
                    the winter, namely from May to September, north-west winds prevail. In the most
                    elevated regions the winters are occasionally severe, and snow and ice
                    occur.</p>
                <p>The chief native tribes within the British territory are the Hottentots,
                    Bechuanas, and Kaffres. No manufacture is conducted at the Cape except the
                    making of wine, of which from 10,000 to 40,000 gallons are annually exported to
                    England. Various articles of provision are supplied to ships sailing between
                    Europe and the East Indies.</p>
                <p>Cape Town is the capital of the colony, and contains 28,460 inhabitants, of whom
                    15,120 are Europeans. Its commerce is considerable, and the port is frequented
                    by 500 to 600 vessels every year.</p>
                <p>The Orange river sovereignty, added to the British territories in 1848, but
                    subsequently given up and constituted a free republic, extends north of the
                    Orange river as far as the Ky Gariep or Vaal river. In consequence of the
                    discovery of rich diamond fields on the lower Vaal river and in the neighbouring
                    territory of the Griqua chief Water-boer, who also petitioned to have his lands
                    subjected to British rule, a wide country surrounding the diamondfields was
                    incorporated with the Cape Colony in October 1871, under the name of Griqua Land
                    West, divided into the districts of Pneil, Griqua Town, and Klipdrift. The
                    population of this new territory was estimated at 50,000 in 1872, concentrated
                    in camps round the chief diamondfields. In 1869, Bassuto Land, a mountainous
                    territory at the head waters of the Nu Gariep branch of the Orange river, and on
                    the inward slope of the Drakenberg range, was incorporated as a British
                    possession.</p>
                <p>Natal or Victoria, a district on the east coast, and separated from the Cape
                    Colony by Kaffraria, is a recently formed British settlement, which was created
                    into a colony in 1856. It is highly favoured in those respects in which the Cape
                    is most deficient, having abundance of wood and water, with coal aud various
                    metallic ores, a fine alluvial soil, and a climate adapted to the cultivation of
                    the products for which the home demand is large and constant—cotton, silk, and
                    indigo. Pietermaritzburg, the capital of the settlement, lies 50 miles from the
                    coast. Port Natal, now D’Urban, seated on a fine lake-like bay, is the only
                    harbour.</p>
                <p>The Transvaal Republic is an inland state, between the Vaal on the south and the
                    Limpopo river on the north, having the Drakenberg edge on the east, and the
                    Bechuana tribes, which occupy the region bordering on the Kalahira desert, on
                    the west, founded by the Dutch <hi rend="italic">boers</hi> emigrating from the
                    Cape Colony. Its surface is an elevated plateau, thinly wooded in some parts,
                    but generally affording excellent pasture. The chief town is Potchefstroom, on a
                    tributary of the Vaal; but the seat of government is at Pretoria, in the region
                    of the head streams of the Limpopo.</p>
                <p>East Africa extends from Natal northwards to the Red Sea, comprising Sofala,
                    Mozambique, Zanzibar, and the Somali country. But little is known of that region
                    beyond the shores. The Sofala Coast, extending from Delagoa Bay to the Zambeze
                    river, is flat, sandy, and marshy, gradually ascending towards the interior. It
                    abounds with rivers, which are the source of yearly inundations. The soil is
                    very fertile, and produces chiefly rice. In the interior, gold and other metals,
                    as well as precious stones, are found. The Portuguese have settlements at
                    Sofala, in an unhealthy spot, abounding with salt marshes; it consists of only
                    huts, a church, and a fort in ruins. Inhambane, near the tropic of Capricorn,
                    has an excellent harbour.</p>
                <p>Mozambique extends from the Zambeze to Cape Delgado, and is similar, in its
                    natural features, to the Sofala Coast. The greatest river is the Zambeze. The
                    principal settlement of the Portuguese is at Quillimane, which is situated in a
                    very unhealthy position on the northern arm of the delta of the Zambeze,
                    surrounded with mangrove trees.</p>
                <p>The Zanzibar or Sawahili Coast extends from Cape Delgado to the river Jub, near
                    the equator. The coast is generally low, and has but few bays or harbours: its
                    northern portion is rendered dangerous by a line of coral reefs extending along
                    it. The region possesses a great number of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n292/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0292-0271"/> rivers, but none of them attain a first-rate
                    magnitude. The principal are the Rovuma, the Lufiji, Ruvu, Pangani, and Dana;
                    the two latter rising in the snowy mountains of Kilima-njaro and Kenia. The
                    climate is similar to that of other tropical coasts of Africa, hot and unhealthy
                    in general: in some portions, however, the elevated ground, and with it a more
                    temperate and healthy climate, approaches the shores to within a short distance.
                    The vegetation is luxuriant, aud cocoa-nut, palms, maize, rice, and olives are
                    the chief articles of cultivation. The fauna comprises all the more
                    characteristic African species.</p>
                <p>The chief inhabitants are the Sawahili, of mixed Arab and Negro descent, but the
                    coasts are under the Arab dominion of the Imaum of Muscat, by whose efforts
                    commerce with the nations of the interior has greatly increased.</p>
                <p>The island of Zanzibar (Unguja of the Sawahili) is the residence of a Sultan,
                    tributary to the Imaum of Muscat, and the seat of extensive commerce. Mombas, on
                    a small island close to the main shore, possesses the finest harbour on that
                    coast, and has recently become famous as the seat of an important missionary
                    station.</p>
                <p>The Somali country comprises the eastern horn of Africa, from the equator
                    northward to the Bay of Tadjurra, near the entrance into the Red Sea. The coast
                    is generally bold and rocky, in some places covered with sand; and the extensive
                    region it encloses presents a slightly ascending plain, traversed by large
                    valleys of great fertility, among which the Wady Nogal is prominent. This
                    country is not so well watered as the region to the south, and some of its
                    rivers are periodical.</p>
                <p>The Somali country is famous for its aromatic productions and gums of various
                    kinds; and it is supposed that the spices and incense consumed in such large
                    quantities by the ancient peoples of Egypt, Greece, Syria, and Rome, were
                    derived from this part of Africa, and not from Arabia.</p>
                <p>Zeila and Berbera, on the northern coast, are the chief trading ports: the
                    permanent population of the former is about 3000, while the latter may be said
                    to exist only during the winter, when no less than 20,000 strangers, at an
                    average, arrive to pitch their tents, and thus create a great market-place.
                    Harrar, in the Galla country, is the chief place in the interior, with 8000
                    inhabitants, who are Mohammedans. One-third of the population is Somali,
                    one-third Arab.</p>
                <p>Central Africa comprises the regions which extend from the southern borders of
                    the Sahara in the north to Cape Colony in the south, and from Senegambia in the
                    west to the territory of the Egyptian pashalic on the east. It comprehends the
                    central basins of the great lakes from Lake Chad to the Nyassa, and the greater
                    part of the basins of the Niger, Congo, Nile, and Zambeze. Even the Sahara may
                    well be included in this general denomination. So little is yet known of this
                    vast region that the general features of some portions only can be indicated.
                    The greater portion seems to be densely peopled with numerous tribes, and to
                    possess inexhaustible natural resources. The portion north of the equator, under
                    the name Soudan or Nigritia, comprises a great number of states, among which the
                    principal are Bambarra, Timbuktu, and Houssa, in the west; Bornu, Baghermi, and
                    Waday, around Lake Chad; Darfur in the east; and Adamaua in the south. The
                    inhabitants are of Negro race, with many Arabs, Moors, and Berbers.</p>
                <p>Bambarra occupies part of the basin of the Joliba, or upper source of the Quorra.
                    The dominant inhabitants are the Mandingoes and Foulahs, who have embraced
                    Islamism, and are much more advanced in civilisation than the other Negro
                    tribes. The country comprises extensive and excellent pastures, with abundance
                    of domestic animals, as homed cattle, sheep, goats, and horses of a fine breed.
                    Among the vegetable products the most remarkable is the butter-tree, which
                    furnishes an important article of agricultural industry and trade. .</p>
                <p>Sego, the capital, is situated on the Joliba, and contains 30,000 inhabitants. It
                    was here that Mungo Park first caught sight of the long-sought river.</p>
                <p>Timbuktu, or Jennie, comprises the basin of the Joliba below Bambarra, and lies
                    partly within the Great Sahara. Timbuktu, a few miles from the banks of the
                    Joliba, and situated amid sands and deserts, is a celebrated centre of the North
                    African caravan trade. It contains from 12,000 to 15,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Houssa is an extensive country extending to the Sahara in the north, to the
                    Joliba or Kawara on the west, to Bornu on the east, and to about 10° N. lat. on
                    the south. The dominant race are the Foulahs, but the mass of the population are
                    Negroes. It is a very fertile and beautiful country, but the climate is
                    insalubrious, and in many parts fatal to Europeans. The inhabitants are engaged
                    in pastoral, as well as in agricultural and commercial pursuits.</p>
                <p>The capital, Sakatu, is one of the largest cities in Negroland; it is situated in
                    a fertile but marshy plain. Kano, another large town, containing 30,000 to
                    40,000 inhabitants, is the great emporium of trade in Houssa; there the English
                    merchandise coming from the north through the Sahara, meets with American goods
                    coming from the Bight of Benin. The manufactures of Kano consist chiefly of
                    cloth, for the dyeing of which that town is famed all over Central Africa.</p>
                <p>Bornu is one of the most powerful states of Negroland; extending on the west to
                    the 10th degree of long., on the east to Lake Chad and the kingdom of Baghermi,
                    and on the south as far as Mandara and Adamaua, in about 11° N. lat. Kanem, on
                    the northern side of Lake Chad, has recently been conquered and brought under
                    Bornuese sovereignty.</p>
                <p>The general character of Bornu is that of a plain, subject to inundations,
                    particularly near Lake Chad. It is very fertile, and cotton and indigo attain a
                    high degree of excellence. The original Bornuese are an agricultural people.</p>
                <p>Kuka, the capital and residence of the Sheik of Bornu, had in 1866 about 60,000
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Baghermi, another powerful kingdom, is situated east of Bornu. The boundaries,
                    according to Dr Barth, who first visited this country and penetrated as far as
                    Masena, the capital, are on the west the river Loggeme, a tributary of the Shary
                    or Asu, by which it is divided from Bornu and Adamaua; on the north its limits
                    are in about 12½ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> N. lat., and on the east 19½ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi> E. long., both lines dividing it from Waday; the
                    southern boundary is in about 8½ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> N. lat. Baghermi
                    is an extensive plain or valley formed by the river Shary or Asu and its
                    tributaries. The inhabitants are very warlike, and frequently engage in slave
                    marauding expeditions into the neighbouring states to the south.</p>
                <p>Masena, the capital, lies in 11° 40' N. lat., and 17° <hi rend="italic">2</hi> 0'
                    E. long.</p>
                <p>Waday, or Dar Saley, lies east of Baghermi, and reaches as far as Darfur. It
                    comprises an extensive region, stretching as far as the basin of the Nile. Lake
                    Fittri, situated in the western portion, forms a basin, unconnected with that of
                    Lake Chad, and by which the country as far as Darfur is drained. It has never
                    been explored by Europeans. The population comprises a great variety of tribes
                    and different languages.</p>
                <p>Wara, the capital, is placed by Dr Barth in 14° N. lat., and 22° E. long.</p>
                <p>Darfur, east of Waday, extends as far as Kordofan. The country rises towards the
                    west into a range of hills called Jebel Marrah. It is drained into the Nile. A
                    great portion of the country is Saharan in its character, while other parts are
                    fertile and diversified. Browne, in 1703, estimated the whole population at
                    200,000. It has an extensive trade with Egypt.</p>

                <p>Cobbeih, the capital, is a merchant town, and contains about 6000
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Fumbina or Adamaua is an extensive country south of Houssa and Bornu, under
                    Foulah dominion. It consists of a large, fertile, and highly-cultivated valley,
                    formed by the River Benue. Near Yola, the capital, the Benue receives the Faro,
                    a large tributary coming from the south-west. This country was first visited by
                    Dr Barth in 1851.</p>
                <p>Yola, the capital, lies in 8° 50' N. lat., and 13° 30' E. longitude.</p>
                <p>South of the belt of Negro states of the Soudan lies the great unknown region of
                    Central Africa. On the east the unexplored area is bounded by the numerous
                    states of the lake region made known by Burton, Speke, and Livingstone. Of these
                    the chief are Unyamwesi, occupying the plateau south of the Victoria Lake, and
                    east of Lake Tanganyika, with the capital town of Kaseh or Tabora, frequented by
                    Arab traders from Zanzibar; Karague on the western side of the Victoria Nyanza;
                    and Uganda, stretching round its north-western shores. In the interior, beyond
                    Lake Tanganyika, Livingstone has recently made known the peoples of Manyuema
                    land, where “there is no political cohesion; not one king or kingdom. Each man
                    is independent of every other.” To the south of the unknown region are the
                    powerful Negro kingdoms of the Muata Yanvo and of the Cazembe, occupying the
                    whole of the interior between 6° and 12° S. lat. Kabebe, the capital of the
                    former state, is believed to be in about lat. 8° S., long. 23° 30' E. of
                    Greenwich; and Lunda, the chief town of the latter potentate, is in the Luapula
                    valley, south-west of the Tanganyika Lake, and was visited by Livingstone in
                    1867-68. The Makololo kingdom, occupying the central basin of the Zambeze river,
                    with the chief town of Linyanti, west of the Victoria Falls; and that of
                    Mosilikatse in the south-east, between the Zambeze and the Limpopo rivers, are
                    the great remaining divisions of Central Africa. Besides these, however,
                    innumerable petty kingdoms, chiefships, and tribes subdivide the vast
                    populations of Negroland.</p>
                <p>To Africa belong a considerable number of islands. The Madeiras, belonging to
                    Portugal, lie off the north-west coast of Africa, at a distance of about 360
                    miles. Madeira, the chief island, is about 100 miles in circuit, and has long
                    been famed for its picturesque beauty, rich fruits, and fine climate, which
                    renders it a favourite resort of invalids. Wine is the staple produce. Funchal,
                    the chief town, with 18,000 inhabitants, is a regular station for the West India
                    mail steam-packets from Southampton, and the Brazilian sailing-packets from
                    Falmouth.</p>
                <p>The Canaries, belonging to Spain, the supposed Fortunate Islands of the ancients,
                    are situated about 300 miles south of Madeira. They are 13 in number, all of
                    volcanic origin, Teneriffe being the largest. The latter is remarkable for its
                    peak, which rises as a vast pyramidal mass to the height of 12,173 feet.</p>
                <p>The Cape Verde Islands, subject to Portugal, are a numerous group about 80 miles
                    from Cape Verde. They obtained their name from the profusion of sea-weed found
                    by the discoverers in the neighbouring ocean, giving it the appearance of a
                    green meadow. They are also of volcanic origin.</p>
                <p>Fernando Po, a very mountainous forest covered island, is in the Bight of Biafra.
                    The British settlement of Clarence Town was established in 1827, but afterwards
                    abandoned The island now belongs to Spain.</p>
                <p>St Thomas, immediately under the equator, is a Portuguese settlement; as is also
                    Prince’s Island, in 2° N. lat.</p>
                <p>Annobon in 2° S. lat., belongs to the Spaniards.</p>
                <p>Ascension, a small, arid, volcanic islet, was made a British port on the arrival
                    of Napoleon Bonaparte at St Helena, and since retained as a station, at which
                    ships may touch for stores. Green Hill, the summit of the island, rises to the
                    height of 2840 feet.</p>
                <p>St Helena is a huge dark mass of rock, rising abruptly from the ocean to the
                    height of 2692 feet. James’ Town is the only town and port.</p>
                <p>Madagascar, the largest island of Africa, and one of the largest in the world, is
                    separated from the Mozambique coast by a channel of that name, about 250 miles
                    wide. The area exceeds that of France.</p>
                <p>The high interior of the island is generally very fertile, with magnificent
                    forests and fine pastures watered by numerous rivers, but a belt of hot swamp
                    land with a deadly climate surrounds the coast.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants are diverse races of Negro, Arab, and Malay origin. The Ovahs, a
                    people of the central provinces, are now dominant. The principal town,
                    Antananarivo, has about 80,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The French possess the islands of Sante Marie and Nos-sibe on the coast of
                    Madagascar, and Mayotta island in the Comoro group.</p>
                <p>The Comoro isles, four in number, are in the north part of the Mozambique
                    Channel, and inhabited by Arab tribes.</p>
                <p>Réunion or Bourbon, 400 miles east of Madagascar, is a colony of France,
                    producing for export, coffee, sugar, cocoa, spices, and timber.</p>
                <p>Mauritius, ceded to the British by the French in 1814, is 90 miles north-east of
                    Bourbon. The sugar-cane is chiefly cultivated. Port Louis, the capital,
                    beautifully situated, has 75,000 inhabitants. Within the jurisdiction of the
                    Governor of the Mauritius are the islands of Rodriguez, the Seychelles, and the
                    Amarante islands.</p>
                <p>Socotra, a large island, east of Cape Jerdaffun, with an Arab and Negro
                    population, has been known from early times; it belongs to the Imaum of Muscat.
                    This island was long celebrated as producing the finest aloetic drug; it is
                    found still to produce a fine kind of aloe, though much of what passed as
                    Socotrine aloes really came from India. Gums, tobacco, and dates are also
                    exported. (K. J.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Note.—</hi> The above article was completed before it was known
                    with certainty that the saddest event in the history of African exploration had
                    occurred. Dr Livingstone, to whom the article justly assigns “the first place
                    among African discoverers,” died of dysentery near Lake Bangweolo on the 4th of
                    May 1873. The story of his latest discoveries, and of the rare devotion with
                    which his native attendants carried his remains with them during an eight
                    months’ march to the coast, belongs to a biographical notice. It is more fitting
                    in this place to note, as some consolation for an almost irreparable loss, that
                    Livingstone’s death seems to have given a powerful stimulus to the prosecution
                    of the task he had so nearly completed. The expedition of Lieutenant Cameron,
                    above referred to, is being carried out with a vigour and intelligence that give
                    ample promise of a further limitation of the region of the unknown, if not of
                    the complete solution of all outstanding problems. In the spring of 1874 he had
                    commenced a thorough exploration of Lake Tanganyika, which, from his
                    professional experience as a hydrographical surveyor, is expected to lead to
                    very valuable results. And the complete success of Stanley’s first memorable
                    mission in search of Livingstone warrants confident hopes in regard to a second
                    expedition, also admirably organised and equipped, which has started under his
                    direction.</p>
