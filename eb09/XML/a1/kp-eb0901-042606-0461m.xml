                <p><label type="entry">AINSWORTH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry</hi></label>, divine
                    and scholar, was born “about 1560” at Pleasington, near Blackburn, Lancashire,
                    having been second son of Lawrence Ainsworth of Pleasington Hall. Young Henry
                    Ainsworth is believed to have received his education at Queen Elizabeth’s
                    Grammar School in Blackburn, of which his father was an original founder.
                    According to tradition, he was a Roman Catholic, and a younger brother, John, a
                    Protestant; and the two brothers, entering into a written controversy, mutually
                    converted each other—Henry having embraced Protestantism, and John, Popery. The
                    subsequent earlier history of Ainsworth is still obscure. No record survives;
                    but various authorities concur in stating that he passed from Blackburn to
                    Cambridge. He associated with the Puritan party in the Church of England, and
                    eventually adopted the platform of the Independents as represented by the
                    Brownists. He was driven from his native country by the state proscription of
                    the sectaries before the year 1593. He is found resident in “ablind lane at
                    Amsterdam” about 1595-6. His exile must have reduced him to extreme poverty. He
                    is stated to have been a “porter” to a scholarly bookseller in Amsterdam, who,
                    on discovering his skill in the Hebrew language, made him known to his
                    countrymen. Roger <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0462-0427"/> Williams, in one of his fiery tractates,
                    reproaches Ainsworth as “living upon ninepence a week and some boiled roots.”
                    When the Brownists erected a church in Amsterdam, Francis Johnson was chosen for
                    their pastor, and Henry Ainsworth for their doctor or teacher. In 1596 these two
                    divines drew up a confession of their faith (in Latin), which was reprinted in
                    1598, and dedicated to the various universities of Europe (including St Andrews,
                    Scotland). The separations and controversies which ensued at Amsterdam and at
                    Leyden belong to church history. Of Ainsworth it may be said, that while he
                    never put himself forward or sought notoriety, he was beyond comparison the most
                    steadfast and most resolute and most cultured champion of those principles of
                    civil and religious freedom represented by the now large and influential body of
                    Nonconformists in Britain and America called Independents or Congregationalists.
                    The personal squabbles and temporary animosities have long passed away; and it
                    is recognised that in Henry Ainsworth Nonconformity had a man of saintly worth,
                    of intellectual power, and of uncompromising intrepidity. Amid the strifes and
                    clamours of controversy he pursued steadfastly his rabbinical studies. The
                    combination was so unique that Moreri and Zedler, like others, made two Henry
                    Ainsworths—one Dr Henry Ainsworth, a learned biblical commentator; the other H.
                    Ainsworth, an arch-heretic, and “the ringleader of the Separatists at
                    Amsterdam.” Kindred mistakes are found regarding his writings in Hornbeck’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi rend="italic">Controversiarum,</hi> and more recent
                    bibliographical authorities. In 1608 our Ainsworth defended the Separation
                    against Richard Bernard and William Crashaw (father of the poet). But his ablest
                    and most arduous minor work in controversy was his crushing reply to the
                    notorious Smyth, entitled <hi rend="italic">A Defence of the Holy Scriptures,
                    Worship, and Ministry, used in the Christian Church separated from Antichrist,
                    against the Challenges, Cavils, and Contradictions of M. Smyth</hi> (1609). His
                    memory abides through his rabbinical learning. The ripe fruit of many years’
                    diligence appeared in his Notes on Genesis, 1616; Exodus, 1617; Leviticus, 1618;
                    Numbers, 1619; Deuteronomy, 1619; Psalms, 1612, 2d edition 1617; Song of
                    Solomon, 1623. These were collected in folio in 1627, and again in 1639, and
                    later in various forms. From the outset the <hi rend="italic">Annotations</hi>
                    have taken a commanding place, especially among Continental scholars, as witness
                    Clement, Dornius, Voght, Lilienthal, and Simon, the last urging Catholics to
                    study and value them. Perhaps nothing more clearly shows even his home repute
                    than the praiseworthy zeal with which Vice-Chancellor Dr John Worthington
                    endeavoured to recover certain posthumous MSS. of Ainsworth. These, it is to be
                    feared, have irrecoverably disappeared. Moreri mentions a current report that
                    the famous Lightfoot “pillaged the best of his observations” from Ainsworth. A
                    comparison of the <hi rend="italic">Exercitations</hi> with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annotations</hi> shows, however, that the two scholars worked
                    independently. Moreri’s groundless remark has been transmuted into an imputation
                    as groundless—that Lightfoot had got into his possession the MSS. of Ainsworth.
                    The character and learning of the great rab-binist ought to have silenced such
                    an unworthy suspicion. There is nothing more striking in the career of Ainsworth
                    than the reported manner of his death, which took place at Amsterdam in 1622-3.
                    It is stated that, having found a diamond of great value, he advertised it; and
                    when the owner, who was a Jew, came to demand it, he offered the finder any
                    gratuity he sought. Ainsworth, though poor, requested only of the Jew that he
                    would procure him a conference with some of his rabbis upon the prophecies of
                    the Old Testament relating to the Messiah, which the Jew promised; but not
                    having interest to obtain such a conference, it is thought that he contrived to
                    get Ainsworth poisoned (Neal, <hi rend="italic">Puritans,</hi> ii. 47). Another
                    account says that he attended the conference, and so confounded the Jews that,
                    from spite and malice, they in this manner put a period to his life (Brook, <hi
                    rend="italic">Puritans,</hi> ii. 302). There is an air of improbability about
                    the narrative; but it is certain he was dead in 1623, for in that year was
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Seasonable Discourse, or a Censure upon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a Dialogué</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Anabaptists,</hi> in which
                    the editor speaks of him as a departed worthy. For a pretty complete list of his
                    writings, lesser and larger, see Chalmers, Brook, and Hanbury. Many are now
                    extremely rare and high-priced. (See Worthington’s <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>
