                    1759 he was appointed professor at the gymnasium of Erfurt, but relinquished
                    this situation two years after, and went to reside in a private capacity at
                    Leipsic, where he continued to devote himself for a long period to the
                    cultivation of letters, and particularly to those extensive and laborious
                    philological researches which proved so useful to the language and literature of
                    his native country. In 1787 he received the appointment of principal librarian
                    to the elector of Saxony at Dresden, with the honorary title of Aulic
                    Counsellor. Here he continued to reside during the remainder of his life,
                    discharging with diligence and integrity the duties of his situation, and
                    prosecuting his laborious studies to the last with indefatigable industry and
                    unabated zeal. Possessing a naturally robust constitution, he was able to
                    devote, it has been said, fourteen hours daily to literary toil, down even to
                    the period of his death. He died at Dresden on the 10th of September 1806. The
                    life of a mere scholar is generally destitute of interest; and that of Adelung,
                    which was spent entirely in literary seclusion, presents no variety of incident
                    to tho pen of the biographer. Of his private character and habits few memorials
                    have been preserved, but in these few he is represented as the man of an amiable
                    disposition. He was a lover of good cheer, and spared neither pains nor expense
                    in procuring a variety of foreign wines, of which his cellar, which he
                    facetiously denominated his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Selectissima,</hi> is
                    said to have contained no less than forty different kinds. His manners were easy
                    and affable, and the habitual cheerfulness of his disposition rendered his
                    society most acceptable to a numerous circle of friends. The writings of Adelung
                    are very voluminous, and there is not one of them, perhaps, which does not
                    exhibit some proofs of the genius, industry, and erudition of the author. But
                    although his pen was usefully employed upon a variety of subjects in different
                    departments of literature and science, it is to his philological labours that he
                    is principally indebted for his great reputation; and no man ever devoted
                    himself with more zeal and assiduity, or with greater success, to the
                    improvement of his native language. In a country subdivided into so many
                    distinct sovereign states, possessing no common political centre, and no
                    national institution whose authority could command deference in matters of
                    taste,—in a country whose indigenous literature was but of recent growth, and
                    where the dialect <pb break="no"

                    courts, it was no easy task for a single writer to undertake to fix the standard
                    of a language which had branched out into a variety of idioms, depending in a
                    great measure upon principles altogether arbitrary. Adelung effected as much in
                    this respect as could well be accomplished by the persevering labours of an
                    individual. By means of his excellent grammars, dictionary, and various works on
                    German style, he contributed greatly towards rectifying the orthography,
                    refining the idiom, and fixing the standard of his native tongue.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The period in which High
                    German as a written language approached nearest perfection is, according to him,
                    the short interval between 1740 and 1760.</p></note> Of all the different
                    dialects he gave a decided preference to that of the margraviate of Misnia, in
                    Upper Saxony, and positively rejected everything that was contrary to the
                    phraseology in use among the best society of that province, and in the writings
                    of those authors whom it had produced. In adopting this narrow principle he is
                    generally thought to have been too fastidious. The dialect of Misnia was
                    undoubtedly the richest, as it was the earliest cultivated of any in Germany;
                    but Adelung probably went too far in restraining the language within the limits
                    of this single idiom, to the exclusion of others from which it might have, and
                    really has, acquired additional richness, flexibility, and force. His German
                    dictionary has been generally regarded as superior to the English one of
                    Johnson, and certainly far surpasses it in etymology. Indeed, the patient spirit
                    of investigation which Adelung possessed in so remarkable a degree, together
                    with his intimate knowledge of the ancient history and progressive revolutions
                    of the different dialects on which the modern German is based, peculiarly
                    qualified him for the duties of a lexicographer. No man before Jacob Grimm did
                    so much for the language of Germany. Shortly before his death he issued the very
                    learned work, at which he had been labouring quietly for years, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Mithridates; or, a General History of Languages, with the Lord’s
                    Prayer, as a specimen, in nearly five hundred languages and dialects.</hi> The
                    hint of this work appears to have been taken from a publication, with a similar
                    title, published by the celebrated Conrad Gesner in 1555; but the plan of
                    Adelung is much more extensive. Unfortunately he did not live to finish what he
                    had undertaken. The first volume, which contains the Asiatic languages, was
                    published immediately after his death; the other three were issued under the
                    superintendence of Professor Vater (1809-17). Of the very numerous works by
                    Adelung, in addition to translations, the following are of greatest importance
