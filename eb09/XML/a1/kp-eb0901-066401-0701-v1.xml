                    divine. Formerly the practical and devotional writings of this eminent
                    Nonconformist rivalled John Bunyan’s in popularity, and his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Looking to Jesus</hi> holds its own even now. Prominent name as his was in
                    his generation, very scanty are the personal memorials of him. His own “Media,”
                    under the head of “Experiences,” yields a few incidents of his life. According
                    to Anthony à Wood, he was a minister’s son, descending from those of the name
                    living at Lowick, and they from the Ambroses of Ambrose Hall in Lancashire. It
                    is probable that his father was Richard Ambrose, vicar of Ormskirk, who was
                    succeeded by another son, Henry. It seems improbable that any of his line could
                    descend of the Lowick Ambroses, inasmuch as they were the most “persistent
                    Catholics of Lancashire;” and there is the additional consideration that, while
                    in our worthy’s writings there are many references to the Papists, he makes not
                    the slightest allusion to his conversion from Popery, or to any Catholic
                    relatives or associations. He entered Brazenose college, Oxford, in 1621, in the
                    seventeenth year of his age, and must therefore have been born in 1603-4. Having
                    proceeded Μ.A. and been ordained, he received at the outset a little cure in
                    Derbyshire, which was at that time and onward to Puritanism what Goshen was to
                    Egypt and Israel. By the influence of the Earl of Bedford, he was appointed one
                    of the king’s itinerant preachers in Lancashire. Having later served for a time
                    a curacy in Garstang, he was selected by the Lady Margaret Hoghton as vicar of
                    Preston. He was on the celebrated committee for the ejection of “scandalous and
                    ignorant ministers and schoolmasters” during the Commonwealth. So long as
                    Ambrose continued at Preston he was favoured with the warm friendship of the
                    Hoghton family, as was John Howe, —their ancestral woods and the tower near to
                    Blackburn affording him sequestered places for those devout meditations and
                    “experiences” that give such a charm to his diary. The immense auditory of his
                    sermon at the funeral of Lady Hoghton is a living tradition still all over the
                    county. For some reason which is unknown, perhaps failing strength for so
                    onerous a charge, Ambrose left his great church of Preston, and became minister
                    of Garstang, where before he had been curate. He was vicar of Garstang when the
                    Act of Uniformity was passed. He could have conscientiously complied with many
                    of its requirements, for he was willing to use the Prayer-book, and did not
                    stickle at things whereat other tender consciences did; but the enforcement was
                    so absolute, not to say brutal, that he found himself constrained to form one of
                    the Two Thousand. His after years were passed among old friends at Preston. He
                    spent a great part of his time every summer in Widdicre wood, where, seldom seen
                    by any except on the Sabbath, he communed with his own heart and his God. The
                    last time he was seen alive was by some friends from Garstang, of whom he is
                    said to have taken leave with unusual affection and gravity. Immediately after
                    they left him he retired to his wonted place of meditation, where he was found
                    by an attendant <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">articulis</hi><hi

                    says he was seventy-two, but his college entry shows he was mistaken. As a
                    religious writer, Ambrose has a vividness and freshness of imagination possessed
                    by scarcely any of the Puritan Nonconformists. He is plaintive as Flavel and as
                    intense as Baxter. Many who have no love for Puritan doctrine, nor sympathy with
                    Puritan experience, have appreciated the pathos and beauty of his writings,
                    which have never been out of print from their original issue until now. <hi
