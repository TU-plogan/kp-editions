                    this Puritan divine was in his own time, and representative in various ways, he
                    has hitherto been confounded with others, as Robert Abbot, Bishop of Salisbury,
                    and his personality distributed over a Robert Abbot of Cranbrook; another of
                    Southwick, Hants; a third of St Austin’s, London; while these successive places
                    were only the successive livings of the one Robert Abbot. He is also described
                    as of the Archbishop’s or Guildford Abbots, whereas he was in no way related,
                    albeit he acknowledges very gratefully, in the first of his epistles-dedicatory
                    of <hi rend="italic">A Hand of Fellowship to Helpe Keepe ovt</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Sinne</hi><hi rend="italic">and Antichrist</hi> (1623, 4to),
                    that it was from the archbishop he had “received all” his “worldly maintenance,”
                    as well as “best earthly countenance” and “fatherly incouragements.” The worldly
                    maintenance was the presentation to the vicarage of Cranbrook in Kent, of which
                    the archbishop was patron. This was in 1616. He had received his education at
                    Cambridge, where he proceeded Μ.A., and was afterwards incorporated at Oxford.
                    In 1639, in the epistle to the reader of his most noticeable book historically,
                    his <hi rend="italic">Triall of our Church-Forsakers,</hi> he tells us, “I have
                    lived now, by God’s gratious dispensation, above fifty years, and in the place
                    of my allotment two and twenty full.” The former date carries us back to
                    1588-89, or perhaps 1587-88—the <pb break="no"

                    to 1616-17 (<hi rend="italic">ut</hi><hi rend="italic">supra).</hi> In his <hi
                        rend="italic">Bee Thankfull London and her Sisters</hi> (1626), he describes
                    himself as formerly “assistant to a reverend divine .... now with God,” and the
                    name on the margin is “Master Haiward of Wool Church.” This was doubtless
                    previous to his going to Cranbrook. Very remarkable and effective was Abbot’s
                    ministry at Cranbrook, where the father of Phineas and Giles Fletcher was the
                    first “Reformation” pastor, and which, relatively small as it is, is
                    transfigured by being the birth-place of the poet of the “Locustae” and “The
                    Purple Island.” His parishioners were as his own “sons and daughters” to him,
                    and by day and night he thought and felt, wept and prayed, for them and with
                    them. He is a noble specimen of the rural clergyman of his age. Puritan though
                    he was in his deepest convictions, he was a thorough Churchman as toward
                    Nonconformists, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Brownists, with whom he waged
                    stern warfare. He remained until 1643 at Cranbrook, aud then chose the very
                    inferior living of Southwick, Hants, as between the one and the other, the
                    Parliament deciding against pluralities of ecclesiastical offices. Succeeding
                    the “extruded” Udall of St Austine’s, Abbot continued there until a good old
                    age. In 1657, in the <hi rend="italic">Warning-piece,</hi> he is described as
                    still “pastor of Austine’s in London.” He disappears silently between 1657-8 and
                    1662. Robert Abbot’s books are distinguished from many of the Puritans by their
                    terseness and variety. (Brook’s <hi rend="italic">Puritans,</hi> iii. 182, 3;
