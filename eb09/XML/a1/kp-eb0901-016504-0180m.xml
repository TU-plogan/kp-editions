                    >Hadrian)</hi> was the name of six popes :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adrian</hi> I., son of Theodore, a Roman nobleman, occupied
                    the pontifical chair from 772 to 795. Soon after his accession the territory
                    that had been bestowed on the popes by Pepin was invaded by Desiderius, king of
                    the Longobards, and Adrian found it necessary to invoke the aid of Charlemagne,
                    who entered Italy with a large army, and repelled the enemy. The pope
                    acknowledged the obligation by conferring upon the emperor the title of
                    Patrician of Rome, and Charlemagne made a fresh grant of the territories
                    orginally bestowed by his father, with the addition of Ancona and Benevento. The
                    friendly relations thus established between pope and emperor continued unbroken,
                    though a serious difference arose between them on the question of the worship of
                    images, to which Charlemagne and the Gallican Church were strongly opposed,
                    while Adrian favoured the views of the Eastern Church, and approved the decree
                    of the Council of Nicaea (787), confirming the practice and excommunicating the
                    iconoclasts. It was in connection with this controversy that Charlemagne wrote
                    the so-called <hi rend="italic">Libri Cavolini,</hi> to which Adrian replied by
                    letter, anathematising all who refused to worship the images of Christ, or the
                    Virgin, or saints. Notwithstanding this, a synod, held at Frankfort in 794, anew
                    condemned the practice, and the dispute remained unsettled at Adrian’s death. An
                    epitaph written by Charlemagne in verse, in which he styles Adrian “father,”
                    proves that his friendship with the pontiff was not disturbed by the controversy
                    in which they were so long engaged.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adrian</hi> II., born at Rome, became pope in 867, at the
                    age of seventy-six. He faithfully adhered to the ambitious policy of his
                    immediate predecessor, Nicholas I., and used every means to extend his
                    authority. His persistent endeavours to induce Charles the Bald to resign the
                    kingdom of Lorraine to the emperor were unsuccessful. Hincmar, archbishop of
                    Rheims, who had crowned Charles, denied the pope’s right to interfere in the
                    matter, and maintained that the threatened excommunication of the king’s
                    adherents would have no validity. Adrian was for the time more successful in his
                    contest with the patriarch of Constantinople—the sentence of deposition he
                    passed upon Photius being confirmed by a council of the Eastern Church held in
                    869-70. His arrogant measures were, however, the immediate occasion of the
                    schism between the Greek and Latin churches. Adrian had himself been married,
                    but put away his wife on ascending the papal throne, and a council called by him
                    at Worms in 868 decreed the celibacy of the clergy. He died in 872.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adrian</hi> III., born at Rome, succeeded Martin II. in 884,
                    and died in 885 on a journey to Worms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adrian</hi> IV. whose name was Nicholas Breakspeare, was
                    born before 1100 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> at Langley, near St Albans, in
                    Hertfordshire, and is the only Englishman who has occupied the papal chair. His
                    request to be allowed to take the habit of the monastery of St Albans having
                    been refused by Abbot Richard, he proceeded to Paris, where he studied with
                    diligence, and soon attained great proficiency, especially in theology. Being
                    admitted, after a period of probation, a regular clerk in the monastery of St
                    Rufus, in Provence, he distinguished himself so much by his learning and strict
                    observance of the monastic discipline that he was chosen abbot when the office
                    fell vacant. His merit became known to Pope Eugenius III., who created him
                    cardinalbishop of Alba in 1146, and sent him two years later as his legate to
                    Denmark and Norway. On this mission he converted many of the inhabitants to
                    Christianity, and erected Upsal into an archiepiscopal see. Soon after his
                    return to Rome, Anastasius, successor of Eugenius, died, and Nicholas was
                    unanimously chosen pope, against his own inclination, in Nov. 1154. On hearing
                    of the election, Henry II. of England sent the abbot of St Albans and three
                    bishops to Rome with his congratulations, which Adrian acknowledged by granting
                    considerable privileges to the monastery of St Albans, including exemption from
                    all episcopal jurisdiction except that of Rome. The bestowal by Adrian of the
                    sovereignty of Ireland upon the English monarch was a practical assertion of the
                    papal claim to dispose of kingdoms. The act, besides facilitating and hastening
                    the subjection of Ireland to England, was also the means of inducing Henry to
                    yield the long-contested point of lay investiture to ecclesiastical offices. The
                    beginning of Adrian’s pontificate was signalised by the energetic attempts of
                    the Roman people to recover their ancient liberty under the consuls, but the
                    pope took strong measures to maintain his authority, compelling the magistrates
                    to abdicate, laying the city under an interdict, and procuring the execution of
                    Arnold of Brescia (1155). In the same year he excommunicated William, king of
                    Sicily, who had ravaged the territories of the church, but the ban was removed
                    and the title of King of the Two Sicilies conferred on William in the following
                    year, on the promise of a yearly tribute to the Holy See. With Adrian commenced
                    the long and bitter conflict between the papal power and the house of
                    Hohenstaufen which ended in the humiliation of the latter. Frederick Barbarossa
                    having entered Italy at the head of a large army for the purpose of obtaining
                    the crown of Germany from the hands of the pope, Adrian met him at Sutri. The
                    demand that he should hold the pope’s stirrup as a mark of respect was at first
                    refused by Frederick, whereupon the pope on his part withheld from the emperor
                    the <hi rend="italic">osculum pacis,</hi> and the cardinals ran away in terror.
                    After two days’ negotiation, Frederick was induced to yield the desired homage,
                    on the representation that the same thing had been done by his predecessors. His
                    holiness then conducted the emperor to Rome, where the ceremony of coronation
                    took place in the Church of St Peter’s. It was in these transactions that the
                    quarrel originated. A letter addressed by the pope to Frederick and the German
                    bishops in 1157 asserted, on the ground of the ceremonies that had taken place,
                    that the emperor held his dominions as a <hi rend="italic">beneficium.</hi> The
                    expression, being interpreted as denoting feudal tenure, stirred up the fiercest
                    indignation of Frederick and the Germans, and though explanations were
                    afterwards given with the view of showing that the word had not been used in an
                    offensive sense, the breach could not be healed. Adrian was about to pronounce
                    the sentence of excommunication upon Frederick when he died at Anagni on the 1st
                    Sept. 1159.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adrian</hi> V., a Genoese, whose name was Ottoboni Fiesci,
                    occupied the papal throne for only five weeks in 1276. When congratulated on his
                    accession he replied in the <pb break="no"

                    healthy cardinal rather than a dying pope.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adrian</hi> VI., born of humble parentage at Utrecht in
                    1459, studied at the university of Louvain, of which he became vice-chancellor.
                    He was chosen by the Emperor Maximilian to be tutor to his grandson, the
                    Archduke Charles, through whose interest as Charles V. he was afterwards raised
                    to the papal throne. In 1517 he received the cardinal’s hat from Leo X., and in
                    1519 he was made bishop of Tortosa. After the death of Ferdinand he was for a
                    time regent of Spain. He was chosen pope Jan. 9, 1522; but the election was very
                    displeasing to the people of Rome, as the new pope, in contrast with his
                    predecessor Leo, was known to be very rigid in discipline and frugal in his mode
                    of living. On his accession, contrary to the usual custom, he did not change his
                    name, and he showed his dislike to ostentation in many other ways. In regard to
                    the great fact with which he had to deal—the Reformation—Adrian’s conduct showed
                    that he did not fully estimate the gravity of the crisis. Acknowledging the
                    corruptions of the church, he did his utmost to reform certain external abuses;
                    but when his proposed measures failed to win back Luther and the other
                    reformers, he immediately sought to suppress their doctrines by force. He died
                    on the 14th September 1523. So little did the people care to conceal their joy
                    at the event that they wrote on the door of his physician’s house the words “the
                    saviour of his country.”</p>
