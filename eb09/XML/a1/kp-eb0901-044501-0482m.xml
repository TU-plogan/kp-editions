                    d'</hi></label>, a Spanish general and statesman, born at Vitoria in 1771. He
                    served first in the navy, and had risen to be captain of a frigate when he
                    exchanged into the army, receiving corresponding rank. In politics he followed a
                    very devious course. At the assembly of Bayonne, in 18)8, he was one of the most
                    prominent of those who accepted the new constitution from Joseph Bonaparte as
                    king of Spain. In 1811, when Joseph’s position was becoming insecure, Alava
                    joined the national independent party, who were fighting in alliance with the
                    English. The Spanish Cortes appointed him commissary at the English
                    headquarters, and Wellington, who seems to have regarded him with great favour,
                    made him one of his aides-de-camp. Before the close of the campaign he had risen
                    to the rank of brigadier-general. On the restoration of Ferdinand, Alava was
                    cast into prison, but the influence of his uncle Ethenard, the inquisitor, and
                    of Wellington, secured his speedy release. He soon contrived to gain the favour
                    of the king, who appointed him in 1815 ambassador to the Hague. Four years later
                    he was recalled, owing, it is said, to the marked kindness he had shown to his
                    banished fellow-countrymen. On the breaking out of the revolution of 1820 he was
                    chosen by the province of Alava to represent it in the Cortes, where he became
                    conspicuous in the party of the <hi rend="italic">Exaltados,</hi> and in 1822
                    was made president. In the latter year he fought with the militia under
                    Ballasteros and Murillo to maintain the authority of the Cortes against the
                    rebels. When the French invested Cadiz, Alava was commissioned by the Cortes to
                    treat with the Duc d’Angoulême, and the negotiations resulted in the restoration
                    of Ferdinand, who pledged himself to a liberal policy. No sooner had he regained
                    power, however, than he ceased to hold himself bound by his promises, and Alava
                    found it necessary to retire first to Gibraltar and then to England. On the
                    death of Ferdinand, he returned to Spain, and, espousing the cause of Maria
                    Christina against Don Carlos, was appointed ambassador to London in 1834, and to
                    Paris in 1835. After the insurrection of La Granja, he refused to sign the
                    constitution of 1812, declaring himself tired of taking new oaths, and was
                    consequently obliged to retire to France, where he died at Barèges in 1843.</p>
