                <p><label type="entry">AMBASSADOR</label>, a word introduced into the English
                    language from the Fr. <hi rend="italic">ambassadeur,</hi> the Ital. <hi
                    rend="italic">ambasciatore,</hi> or the Span. <hi rend="italic">embaxador,</hi>
                    which Wicquefort derives, perhaps without sufficient authority, from the Span.
                    <hi rend="italic">embiar,</hi> to send. The word denotes a public minister of
                    the highest rank, accredited and sent by the head of a sovereign state to a
                    foreign court or country, with power to represent the person of the sovereign by
                    whom he is sent, to negotiate with a foreign government, and to watch over the
                    interests of his own nation abroad. The power thus conferred is contained in the
                    credentials or letters of credence of which the ambassador is the bearer, and in
                    the instructions under the sign-manual delivered to himself. The credentials
                    consist in a sealed letter addressed by the sovereign in person whose
                    representative he is, to the sovereign to whom he is sent, and they contain a
                    general assurance that the sovereign by whom he is despatched will approve and
                    confirm whatever is done by the ambassador in his name. In England these letters
                    of credence are under the signmanual of the Queen, and are not countersigned by
                    the Secretary of State. On special occasions, as for the negotiation of
                    treaties, additional an express powers are given to an ambassador under the
                    great seal, and sometimes (but very rarely) full general powers to treat on all
                    subjects. Lord Clarendon held such powers at the congress of Paris in 1856</p>
                <p>Diplomatic envoys are of three ranks, as was finally determined by a common
                    agreement of all the powers which was annexed to the final act of the treaty of
                    Vienna in 1815:—1. Ambassadors; the ambassador of the pope being called a
                    nuncio, and the ambassador of the Emperor of Austria to the Sublime Porte being
                    called his inter-nuncio. These only have representative rank. 2. Envoys
                    extraordinary or ministers plenipotentiary, accredited to sovereigns (<hi
                    rend="italic">auprès des souverains).</hi> 3. Chargés d'affaires, who are only
                    entitled to transact business with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. We Shall
                    confine ourselves in this article to the diplomatic officers of the first rank.
                    The relative number of ambassadors, as distinguished from ministers, has of late
                    years been considerably increased. The Emperor Nicholas refused for many years
                    to send an ambassador to the court of France, and he therefore suppressed the
                    grade for a time altogether. His example was imitated by other powers. But the
                    old practice has now been reverted to. The Queen of England has embassies at
                    Paris, Constantinople, Vienna, St Petersburg, and Berlin. The number of British
                    ministers plenipotentiary is twenty-three, and three chargés d’affaires; but
                    these numbers vary.</p>
                <p>From the 15th century, when the practice of sending resident embassies may be
                    said to have commenced in Europe, down to the close of the 18th century, these
                    missions were surrounded with a prodigious amount of splendour, ceremonial, and
                    contentious dignity. British ambassadors were commonly sent out till within the
                    last thirty years in ships of war. The ambassador represented a monarch, and was
                    to play the part of one. The memoirs of those ages are full of the magnificence
                    and profuse display which marked their progress—lacqueys, liveries, state
                    coaches, led horses, and all the pageantry of state. Fierce disputes frequently
                    arose between rival ambassadors for precedence; sometimes these disputes even
                    extended to the courts and ministers to whom these envoys were despatched as
                    messengers of peace, and a vast deal of time was lost (especially at the
                    Congress of Münster) in adjusting them. On the part of the sovereign to whom
                    they were to present their credentials the same display was made. The new
                    ambassador was fetched by the master of the ceremonies in the king’s coaches and
                    feasted at the king’s expense. The solemn entry and the public audience, as they
                    were termed, were an essential part of the mission. The ambassador had the right
                    to stand covered in the presence of royalty. At Venice the doge placed Sir Harry
                    Vane, covered and seated, on his right hand in the Council of Ten. A speech was
                    then delivered, in which the ambassador declared the friendly sentiments of his
                    own sovereign, and his own humble desire to give effect to them. Modern
                    simplicity and the facility of intercourse has swept away many of these
                    formalities. Traces of them survive at the courts of Berlin and Vienna, but
                    elsewhere an ambassador is presented with little more than the customary
                    ceremony of a court. It has long been held that every state is at liberty to
                    receive ambassadors with or without ceremony, just as it pleases, provided they
                    are all treated alike. Formalities of this kind are, however, still of moment in
                    dealing with Oriental states, where ceremony is the language of power. Perhaps
                    it is nowhere carried to higher perfection than at the court of Japan. The
                    knotty question of precedence was also settled at the Congress of Vienna by an
                    agreement that precedency should be regulated by seniority, dating from the
                    notification of the arrival of the envoy. In foreign countries the senior
                    ambassador is known as the dean or doyen of the diplomatic body; but in England
                    the diplomatic body has no general mouthpiece or representative.</p>
                <p>Every state or sovereign has the right, if it thinks fit, to refuse to receive a
                    particular person as an ambassador, or even to receive any ambassador at all. It
                    is therefore customary to ascertain beforehand whether the person designated for
                    an embassy is favourably regarded, and will be well received. There have been
                    instances, not very remote, of unfavourable answers or refusals to receive given
                    individuals.</p>
                <p>The rank of an ambassador, as regards the society of the nation to which he is
                    accredited, places him immediately after the princes of the blood royal, because
                    he represents a sovereign power, and this rank is universally conceded to him.
                    The rank of a minister plenipotentiary is rather more dubious, but by a rule
                    laid down by Her Majesty for the court of St James they follow dukes and precede
                    marquises. An ambassador or minister not actually accredited to this court has
                    of course no official rank at all, and must take his personal rank. No
                    distinction is made between the ambassadors of monarchies and of republics. The
                    Venetian ambassadors held in their time a very prominent rank in Europe; so in
                    our day do the ministers of the United States; but the United States have never
                    sent any ambassador to Europe—their representatives therefore rank in the second
                    class of public ministers.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed briefly to enumerate that which constitutes the essential
                    dignity and utility of an ambassador —on the one hand his rights and privileges,
                    on the other his duties.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first right of an ambassador is that of personal
                    audience of the sovereign. His credentials must invariably be presented to the
                    sovereign in person, and he may ask for an audience on any fitting occasion. In
                    England, however, the sovereign does not officially receive an ambassador except
                    in the presence of one or more of the ministers of the crown. Mr Canning
                    complained bitterly of the influence of Prince Lieven and Prince Esterhazy over
                    George IV., who lived on intimate terms with these ambassadors, and used to say
                    "his father would never have done so.” In England the right of audience is now
                    generally limited to the presentation of some congratulatory letter; but at
                    Continental courts it is not without considerable utility and importance, as was
                    shown by the memorable conversation of Sir Hamilton Seymour with the Emperor
                    Nicholas, and the personal interviews of Lord Cowley and Lord Clarendon with the
                    Emperor Napoleon III.</p>
                <p>In all ages the perfect personal security of persons invested with high
                    diplomatic functions, as the representatives<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n695/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0695-0658"/> of a foreign power, has been an essential and
                    fundamental principle of the law of nations. Indeed it <hi rend="italic"
                    >was</hi> the law of nations when there was no other. Alexander the Great
                    destroyed Tyre for an insult offered to his ambassador; and it stands recorded
                    in the Roman law, “Si quis legatum hostium pulsasset, contra jus gentium id
                    commissum esse existimatur, <hi rend="italic">quia</hi><hi rend="italic">sancti
                    habentur legati” (</hi><hi rend="italic">Dig. L. Tit.</hi> vii. § 17). In
                    moments of excessive excitement or revolutionary frenzy even this principle has
                    been violated, as in the murder of Dr Dorislaus at the Hague (1649), and of the
                    French envoys at Rastadt (1799); but such acts leave an indelible disgrace on
                    those who have committed them. For it is the interest of all mankind that
                    ambassadors and envoys should have absolute security to perform their missions
                    with freedom of speech and the liberty “eundi et redeundi” undisturbed, insomuch
                    that to intercept or refuse passage to an ambassador, even through the territory
                    of a third party, is justly regarded as a base action, though probably the leave
                    of the third party to grant the passage ought to be asked. It was the barbarous
                    custom of Turkey to send an ambassador to the Seven Towers on a declaration of
                    war, and detain him there as long as the war lasted; but the Porte formally
                    relinquished and abandoned this practice on the breaking out of war with Russia
                    in 1827. To secure this immunity from all interference, an accredited ambassador
                    or envoy is wholly free from the jurisdiction of the courts of law, or of any
                    other authority in the country in which he is sent to reside. This constitutes
                    the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">extraterritoriality.</hi> His house is as
                    sacred as his person. It is supposed, like a ship at sea, to form part of the
                    territory represented by the flag which he may hoist over it. All the members of
                    the embassy, and even the servants of the ambassador, share the same
                    inviolability. They cannot even be arrested and prosecuted for offences without
                    his consent. Hence, as the courts of justice have no jurisdiction over them, and
                    indeed would have no means of enforcing an adverse decision either by distress
                    or imprisonment, these diplomatic agents cannot be impleaded or sued. The only
                    means of obtaining redress for an injury or breach of contract is an appeal to
                    the head of the mission, or a further appeal to the government which he
                    represents, which, it must be presumed, will not allow a wrong to be committed
                    with impunity under the shelter of privilege. In England, by the statute 7 Anne,
                    c. 12, it is expressly enacted that any process against foreign ambassadors or
                    ministers, or their goods and chattels, shall be altogether void. This Act was
                    passed in consequence of an attempt, made in 1708, to arrest an ambassador of
                    Peter the Great in London for a debt of £50, and it is still law; but in fact it
                    is only declaratory, and in confirmation of the common law and the law of
                    nations.</p>
                <p>An ambassador or envoy pays no taxes or contributions to the public revenue of
                    the country in which he resides, and on this principle he is entitled to receive
                    commodities from abroad free of customs duties. But he is not exempted from the
                    payment of local rates,—-though, indeed, if he were to decline to pay them, no
                    process could issue against him for the purpose of levying them. He also pays
                    the ordinary rates of postage, but he has the privilege of sending his own
                    couriers carrying sealed despatches, which exempts him from the monopoly of the
                    post office. These couriers, and their despatches or mails, are also regarded by
                    common consent as inviolable messengers, unless they chance in time of war to
                    fall into the hands of a hostile belligerent. In some countries ambassadors and
                    their couriers have been allowed to have a prior claim for post horses over
                    private travellers.</p>
                <p>Another of the important privileges of an ambassador or envoy is the free
                    exercise of the religion or form of worship to which he adheres; but it is laid
                    down by the best writers on the subject that a foreign minister has not the
                    right of maintaining a chapel or chaplain within his hotel, under the law of
                    nations; hence the liberty of religious worship for the ambassador and his suite
                    was made a matter of treaty engagement between Catholics and Protestants, and
                    between Christians and Mussulmans. By courtesy, though not of strict right, the
                    usage of ambassadors’ chapels has, however, become general; and it had a real
                    importance in countries where the free exercise of different forms of belief was
                    not tolerated by law. Thus, at the time when the rites of the Church of Rome
                    were forbidden in England, the Spanish and Bavarian chapels in London were free;
                    and they have remained in existence till dur own days, although the enlarged
                    tolerance of the present age has removed in every civilised country those
                    barriers. In China and Japan the free exercise of the Christian religion by the
                    Christian embassies is formally secured by treaty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">B.</hi> We now pass to the duties of an ambassador, and we
                    place at the head of them that of keeping his own sovereign well informed of all
                    that may concern his interests in foreign countries. He is the eye of the
                    government he serves, specially directed to a particular spot, and he ought to
                    be thoroughly acquainted with the course of policy, the movements of parties,
                    the character and disposition of individual statesmen, and the material and
                    commercial resources of the country in which he resides. His public despatches,
                    and his private correspondence with the Minister of Foreign Affairs under whom
                    he serves, ought to be a record of all that can interest or concern the state
                    which he represents. In this sense the diplomatic reports of the ambassadors of
                    former times are invaluable materials for history. His next duty is to protect
                    and defend, if necessary, the persons and interests of his fellow-countrymen
                    abroad; and this is of especial moment in the case of a British ambassador,
                    whose countrymen are to be met with as travellers, navigators, or merchants in
                    all parts of the globe. To them the presence and influence of the diplomatic
                    representatives of their country is of incalculable value, and nothing can be
                    more ill-judged than the proposals that have been made to cut down and contract
                    our foreign embassies and missions. A third, but not less important, duty of an
                    ambassador is to maintain the most amicable relations with the sovereign to whom
                    he is accredited, and with his ministers, and to observe towards them the
                    strictest respect, veracity, and good-will. It has been said in joke that the
                    first duty of an ambassador is to keep a good cook; but if this implies that he
                    is to exercise a liberal hospitality and to make his house agreeable, those no
                    doubt are means which may powerfully assist him in the objects of his mission.
                    In former times it was considered to be essential to good diplomacy to act as a
                    spy upon the motives and conduct of foreign statesmen, to cheat without being
                    cheated, to use clandestine means to obtain information, to endeavour to form a
                    party in foreign states favourable to the ambassador’s own national interests,
                    to observe and resist with the utmost jealousy the demeanour of other foreign
                    envoys, and to carry on a species of warfare under the mask of courtesy and
                    good-breeding. These practices have given diplomacy and the functions of
                    ambassadors a bad name, but it must be said that they are repudiated by the
                    principles and practice of the present time, and more especially by the foreign
                    policy of this country. Down to a recent period, these struggles for ascendancy
                    in foreign countries were carried on with great eagerness, and they led to
                    unfortunate results. In Spain, for example, the untoward marriage of Queen
                    Isabella was notoriously brought about by the violent and arbitrary interference
                    of the French ambassador; and in 1848, when Lord Palmerston instructed <pb

                    minister that they would do well to adopt a more liberal and constitutional
                    system of government, General Narvaez immediately sent the British envoy out of
                    the country. This was the exercise of an extreme right, for which the British
                    government could claim no redress. So, again, when in the course of the Russian
                    war (1855) it appeared to the American government that the British envoy in
                    Washington had infringed the neutrality laws of the United States by
                    endeavouring to enlist recruits for the service of Her Majesty, he was compelled
                    to leave the country, and Great Britain had no just cause of complaint. These
                    modern cases are important, because they prove that no state which respects
                    itself will tolerate, on the part of a foreign envoy, a direct interference in
                    the internal affairs of government or an infraction of its own laws. Hence
                    arises the great principle on which our modern practice is founded, namely, that
                    it is the duty of an ambassador to observe a strict neutrality between
                    contending parties in the state to which he is accredited; to accept the
                    government <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> with which he communicates as the
                    government and sovereign of the nation; to pay implicit obedience to the laws of
                    that state, whatever they be; and to abstain as much as possible from all
                    intervention in its internal affairs. These doctrines are comparatively new, but
                    they are sound, and they may be said to have received the assent and the
                    approval of the most enlightened governments of Europe. Great changes have
                    occurred within the last few years in France, Germany, Austria, Italy, and
                    Spain; but they have all the distinguishing mark that they are wholly
                    independent of foreign diplomatic influence. The first, perhaps we ought to say
                    the sole duty, of an ambassador is to protect his own national interests and to
                    promote the most friendly relations with the sovereign to whom he is accredited;
                    and experience has proved that these objects are best secured by confining
                    himself to the principal objects of his mission, and by relying on no arts but
                    those of sincerity, forbearance, and truth. (H. <hi rend="smallcaps"
