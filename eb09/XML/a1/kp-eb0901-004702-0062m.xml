                    and Abernethy was elected assistant-surgeon in 1787. In this capacity he began
                    to give lectures in Bartholomew Close, which were so well attended that the
                    governors of the hospital built a regular theatre (1790-91), and Abernethy thus
                    became the founder of the distinguished School of St Bartholomew’s. ' He held
                    the office of assistant-surgeon of the hospital for the long period of
                    twenty-eight years, till, in 1815, he was elected principal surgeon. He had
                    before that time been appointed surgeon of Christ’s Hospital (1813), and
                    Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to the Royal College of Surgeons (1814).
                    Abernethy had great fame both as a practitioner and as a lecturer, his
                    reputation in both respects resting on the efforts he made to promote the
                    practical improvement of surgery. His <hi rend="italic">Surgical Observations on
                    the Constitutional Origin and Treatment oj Local Diseases</hi> (1809)—known as
                    “My Book,” from the great frequency with which he referred his patients to it,
                    and to page 72 of it in particular, under that name—was one of the earliest
                    popular works on medical science. The views he expounds in it are based on
                    physiological considerations, and are the more important that the connection of
                    surgery with physiology had scarcely been recognised before the time he wrote.
                    The leading principles on which he insists in “My Book” are chiefly these two :—
                    <hi rend="italic">1st,</hi> That topical diseases are often mere symptoms of
                    constitutional maladies, and then can only be removed by general remedies; and
                    <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> That the disordered state of the constitution very
                    often originates in, or is closely allied to deranged states of the stomach and
                    bowels, and can only be remedied by means that beneficially affect the functions
                    of those organs. His profession owed him much for his able advocacy of the
                    extension in this way of the province of surgery. He had great success as a
                    teacher from the thorough knowledge he had of his science, and the
                    persuasiveness with which he enunciated his views. It has been said, however,
                    that the influence he exerted on those who attended his lectures was not
                    beneficial in this respect, that his opinions were delivered so dogmatically,
                    and all who differed from him were disparaged and denounced so contemptuously,
                    as to repress instead of stimulating inquiry. It ought to be mentioned, that he
                    was the first to suggest and to perform the daring operation of securing by
                    ligature the carotid and the external iliac arteries. The celebrity Abernethy
                    attained in his practice was due not only to his great professional skill, but
                    also in part to the singularity of his manners. He used great plainness of
                    speech in his intercourse with his patients, treating them often brusquely, and
                    sometimes even rudely. In the circle of his family and friends he was courteous
                    and affectionate; and in all his dealings he was strictly just and honourable.
                    He resigned his surgery at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in 1827, and his
                    professorship at the College of Surgeons two years later, on account of failing
                    health, and died at his residence at Enfield on the 20th of April 1831. A
                    collected edition of his works in five volumes was published in 1830. A
                    biography, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of John Abernethy,</hi> by George
                    Macilwain, F.R.C.S., appeared in 1853, and though anything but satisfactory,
                    passed through several editions.</p>
