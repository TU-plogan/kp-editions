                    are some of the epithets constantly given him by ancient writers. “Sing us one
                    of the songs of Alcaeus or Anacreon,” cries one of the guests in a comedy of
                    Aristophanes. “When I hear the verses of Sappho or Anacreon,” says the poet to
                    his friends, in the <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi> of Plato, “I set down my
                    cup for very shame of my own performances.” But though he has given his name to
                    that class of light and free lyric effusions which celebrate the joys of love
                    and wine, he is to us moderns little more than a name. We can no longer say of
                    him, as Horace could, that “time has not drowned his sportive lays;” and we have
                    to judge of his merits as a poet chiefly from the warm praises of those who had
                    his poems in their hands. Of the five books of lyrical pieces by Anacreon which
                    Suidas and Athenaeus mention as extant in their time, we have now but the merest
                    fragments, collected from the citations of later writers. Those graceful little
                    poems (most of them first printed from the MSS. by Henry Stephens in 1554),
                    which long passed among the learned for the songs of Anacreon, and which are
                    well known to many English readers in the translations of Cowley and Moore, are
                    really of much later date, though possibly here and there genuine fragments of
                    the poet have been woven up in them. They will always retain a certain
                    popularity from their lightness and elegance, and some of them are fair copies
                    of Anacreon’s style, which would lend itself readily enough to a clever
                    imitator. But an almost conclusive argument against their genuineness lies in
                    the fact that the peculiar forms of the Ionic Greek, in which Anacreon wrote,
                    are not to be found in these reputed odes, while the fragments of his poems
                    quoted by ancient writers are full of Ionicisms. Of the poet’s life little is
                    known beyond a few scattered notices, not in all cases certainly authentic. He
                    probably shared the voluntary exile of the mass of his fellow-townsmen, who,
                    when Cyrus the Great was laying siege to the Greek cities of Asia, took ship,
                    and founded a colony at Abdera in Thrace, rather than surrender their city to
                    his general Harpagus. From Thrace he soon removed to the island of Samos, ruled
                    at that time by Polycrates, one of the grandest of those old “tyrants” who by no
                    means deserved the name in its worst sense. It is said that he acted as Poly
                    crates’s tutor; that he stood very high in his confidence we learn from so good
                    an authority as Herodotus, who represents the poet as sitting in the royal
                    chamber when audience was given to the Persian herald. In return for such favour
                    and protection, he wrote many complimentary odes upon Polycrates and his
                    favourites. But if an anecdote found in Stobaeus is true, he was no mercenary
                    flatterer. On one occasion the “tyrant” presented him with the sum of five
                    talents. He spent two wakeful nights in thinking of his money, and then returned
                    it to the giver, saying that it “was not worth the care it cost him.” A cursory
                    remark in the writings of Maximus of Tyre shows at least the high estimation in
                    which the poet was supposed to have been held by hia royal patron. That writer
                    says that not even the warning given to Polycrates by Amasis, king of Egypt,
                    that his too· great prosperity would surely arouse the jealousy of the gods,
                    could make a man doubt the stability of his happiness, who had, like Polycrates,
                    the command of the Ionian sea, a navy so powerful, and such a friend as
                    Anacreon. The same authority tells us that this companionship exercised a
                    beneficial influence over the stern temper of the tyrant. Like his
                    fellow-lyrist, Horace, who was one of his great admirers, and in many respect of
                    a kindred spirit, Anacreon seems to have been made for the society of courts. On
                    the death of Polycrates, Hipparchus, who was then in power at Athens, and who
                    inherited the literary tastes of his father Pisistratus, sent a special embassy
                    to fetch the popular poet to Athens in a galley of fifty oars. He must have
                    fully enjoyed and contributed much to the enjoyment of the brilliant circle with
                    which Hipparchus had surrounded himself, and there he made acquaintance, amongst
                    others, with the poet Simonides. When this circle was broken up by the
                    assassination of Hipparchus, Anacreon seems to have returned to his native town
                    of Teos. There, according to a metrical epitaph ascribed to his friend
                    Simonides, he died and was buried. Lucian mentions him amongst his instances of
                    the longevity of eminent men, as having completed eighty-five years. If an
                    anecdote given by Pliny (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> αi. <hi rend="italic"
                    >IIist.</hi> vii. 7) is to be trusted, he was choked at last by a grape-stone;
                    but the story has an air of mythical adaptation to the poet’s habits, which
                    makes it somewhat apocryphal. Anacreon had a reputation as a composer of hymns,
                    as well as of those bacchanalian and amatory lyrics which are commonly
                    associated with his name. Two short hymns to Diana and Bacchus, consisting of
                    eight and eleven Hnes respectively, stand first amongst his few undisputed
                    remains, as printed by recent editors. But pagan hymns, especially when
                    addressed to such deities as Venus, Eros, and Bacchus, are not so very unlike
                    what we call “Anacreontic” poetry as to make the contrast of style so great as
                    the word might seem to imply. The tone of Anacreon’s lyric effusions has
                    probably led to an unjust estimate, both by ancients and moderns, of the poet’s
                    personal character. As Homer was accused of bibulous propensities by some
                    because he makes frequent and kindly mention of “the purple wine,” so Anacreon
                    was held to have been a thorough sensualist because he sang so persistently of
                    wine and love. But a poet must not always be judged by the flights of his fancy.
                    The “triple worship” of the Muses, Wine, and Love, ascribed to him as his
                    religion in an old Greek epigram <hi rend="italic">(Anthol.</hi> iii. 25, 51),
                    may have been as purely professional in the two last cases as in the first, and
                    his private character on such points was probably neither much better nor worse
                    than that of his contemporaries. Athenaeus remarks acutely that he seems at
                    least to have been sober when he wrote; and he himself strongly repudiates, as
                    Horace does, the brutal characteristics of intoxication as fit only for
                    “barbarians” and “Scythians” <hi rend="italic">(Fragm.</hi> 64, Bergk). His own
                    excuse, when charged with hymning the reigning beauties of the day rather than
                    the orthodox gods and goddesses, is said to have been made in these words—</p>
                <p>“But are not these also lesser divinities ?”</p>
                <p>The best editions of Anacreon are those of J. F. Fischer, Leipsic, 1703, and I.
                    Bergk, Leipsic, 1854. (w*. <hi rend="smallcaps">l. c.) .</hi></p>
