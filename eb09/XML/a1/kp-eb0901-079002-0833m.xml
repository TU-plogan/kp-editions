                    for instance, it is l×2×3×4×5χ6×7×8 = 40,320), the term anagram is generally
                    restricted to such rearrangements of the letters as form other words, and these
                    usually words which express a meaning. Camden <hi rend="italic">(Remains,</hi>
                    7th ed., 1674) defines “Anagrammatisme” as “a dissolution of a name truly
                    written into his letters, as his elements, and a new connection of it by
                    artificial transposition, without addition, substraction, or change of any
                    letter, into different words, making some perfect sence applyable to the person
                    named.” Considering the amount of labour that has been spent (or misspent) in
                    transpositions of this kind,—in “torturing one poor word ten thousand ways,”—the
                    anagrams that display a felicitous perfection of “applyable sence” are
                    remarkably few. Among the best are the anagrammatic answer to Pilate’s question,
                    <hi rend="italic">“Quid</hi><hi rend="italic">est veritas?”</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> namely, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">.Est vir
                    qui adest;”</hi> and the transposition of “Horatio Nelson” into “<hi
                    rend="italic">Honor</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                    Nilo;’</hi> and of “Florence Nightingale” into “Flit on, cheering angel.” James
                    I.’s courtiers discovered in “James Stuart” “A just master,” and converted
                    “Charles James Stuart” into “Claimes Arthur’s seat.” “Eleanor Audeley,” wife of
                    Sir John Davies, is said to have been brought before the High Commission in 1634
                    for extravagances, stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed
                    to “Reveale, 0 Daniel,” and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram
                    submitted by the Dean of the Arches, “Dame Eleanor Davies,” “Never soe mad a
                    ladie.” There must be few names that could furnish so many anagrams as that of
                    “Augustus do <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n834/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0834-0791"/> Morgan,” who tells that a friend had constructed
                    about 800 on his name, specimens of which are given in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Budget of Paradoxes,</hi> p. 82. The pseudonyms adopted by authors are often
                    transposed forms, more or less exact, Of their names; thus “Calvinus” becomes
                    “Alcuinus;” “François Rabelais,” “Alcofribas Nasier;” “Bryan Waller Proctor,”
                    “Barry Cornwall, poet;” “Henry Rogers,” “R. E. H. Greyson,” &lt;fcc. It is to be
                    noted that the last two are impure anagrams, an “r” being left out in both
                    cases. “Telliamed,” a simple reversal, is the <hi rend="italic">title</hi> of a
                    well-known work by “De Maillet.” The most remarkable pseudonym of this class is
                    the name “Voltaire,” which the celebrated philosopher assumed instead of his
                    family name, “François Marie Arouet,” and which is now generally allowed to be
                    an anagram of “Arouet, Lj.,” that is, Arouet the younger. Perhaps the only
                    practical use to which anagrams have been turned is to be found in the
                    transpositions in which some of the astronomers of the 17th century embodied
                    their discoveries, with the design apparently of avoiding the risk that, while
                    they were engaged in further verification, the credit of what they had found out
                    might be claimed by others. Thus Galileo announced his discovery that Venus had
                    phases like the moon in the form, <hi rend="italic superscript"> ,t</hi><hi
