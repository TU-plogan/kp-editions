                <p><label type="entry">ADULTERATION</label>, the act of debasing a pure or genuine
                    commodity for pecuniary profit, by adding to it an inferior or spurious article,
                    or by taking from it one or more of its constituents. The term is derived from
                    the Latin <hi rend="italic">adultero,</hi> which in its various inflections
                    signifies to defile, to debase, to corrupt, to sophisticate, to falsify, to
                    counterfeit, &amp;c. The objects of adulteration are fourfold, namely, to
                    increase the bulk or weight of the article, to improve its appearance, to give
                    it a false strength, or to rob it of its most valuable constituents. All these
                    adulterations are manifestly of a designedly fraudulent character, and are
                    therefore properly the subjects of judicial inquiry; but there may be accidental
                    corruptions and adulterations of a commodity, arising from natural or
                    unavoidable causes, as when darnel or ergot become mixed with grain in the
                    fields of the slovenly farmer, or when an article becomes changed and
                    deteriorated from spontaneous decay, or when mineral matters and other
                    impurities are accidentally derived from the machinery or vessels in which the
                    thing is prepared or kept. The recognition of such impurities, and the tracing
                    of them to their source, is of prime importance in pursuing a charge of
                    adulteration. Few articles of commerce, however, are exempt from fraudulent
                    adulteration, and the practice of it has grown with the competition of trade,
                    and the removal of those wholesome restrictions which in former times were so
                    energetically opposed to all kinds of dishonest dealing; for the guilds and
                    companies of all large cities had their corporate regulations for supervising
                    and governing every description of trade and manufacture. The excise, too,
                    including the customs, had until recently control over the quality of all
                    exciseable articles; and although the prime object of this was to protect the
                    revenue of the country, yet it also served to prevent adulteration. In addition
                    to this there were in ancient times ordinances of assize for regulating the
                    price and quality of the common necessaries of life. As far back as the reign of
                    John (1203) there was a proclamation throughout the kingdom for enforcing the
                    legal obligations of assize as regards bread; and in the following reign the
                    statute (51 Hen. III. stat. 6), entitled the Pillory and Tumbrel, was framed for
                    the express purpose of protecting the public from the dishonest dealings of
                    bakers, vintners, brewers, butchers, and others. This statute is deserving of
                    notice as the first in which the adulteration of human food is specially noticed
                    and prohibited; and it seems to have been enforced with more or less of rigour
                    until the time of Anne, when it was repealed (8 Anne, c. 19). According to <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber Albus,</hi> it was strictly observed in the days of Edward
                    I., for it states that “if any default shall be found in the bread of a baker in
                    the city, the first time, let him be drawn upon a hurdle from the Guildhall to
                    his own house through the great street where there be most people assembled, and
                    through the great streets which are most dirty, with the faulty loaf hanging
                    from his neck; if a second time he shall be found committing the same offence,
                    let him be drawn from the Guildhall through the great street of Cheepe, in the
                    manner aforesaid, to the pillory, and let him be put upon the pillory, and
                    remain there at least one hour in the day; and the third time that such default
                    shall be found, he shall be drawn, and the oven shall be pulled down, and the
                    baker made to forswear the trade in the city for ever.” Vintners, spicers,
                    grocers, butchers, regrators, and others, were subject to the like punishment
                    for dishonesty in their commercial dealings—it being thought that the pillory,
                    by appealing to the sense of shame, was far more deterrent of such crimes than
                    fine or imprisonment. But all this has given way to the force of free trade, and
                    now the practice of adulteration has become an art, in which the knowledge of
                    science and the ingenuity of trade are freely exercised. Fifty years ago it
                    attracted the attention of one of the most expert chemists of the day, Mr Accum,
                    who, in his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Adulterations of Food, and Culinary
                    Poisons,</hi> declared it to be an “art and mystery.” Subsequently to that, in
                    1851 and the three following years, articles on the adulteration of food
                    appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Lancet,</hi> and the effect of those articles
                    was to call for a Parliamentary inquiry, which resulted in the Adulteration of
                    Food Act of 1860. That Act of Parliament gave power to certain local authorities
                    in England, Scotland, and Ireland to appoint analysts, having competent medical,
                    chemical, and microscopical knowledge. The penalty for selling an adulterated
                    article, knowing it to be so adulterated, was five pounds, and the costs of the
                    proceedings. But as the statute was permissive, only a few analysts were
                    appointed, and it soon became a dead letter. Attempts were subsequently made to
                    improve the law, and to make it compulsory on local authorities to appoint
                    analysts. One of these was the Bill of 1869, and another was that of 1871—both
                    of which were abandoned by their promoters. In the year 1872, however, an Act
                    was passed, entitled An Act to amend the Laws for the Prevention, of
                    Adulteration of Food, Drink, and Drugs. The main features of this Act are the
                    following :—Local authorities in England, Scotland, and Ireland are bound to
                    appoint analysts with competent medical, chemical, and microscopical knowledge.
                    They must also appoint officers or inspectors to purchase articles of food,
                    drink, and drugs within their respective districts, aud take them to the analyst
                    for examination. Other purchasers of such articles are permitted, under proper
                    restrictions, to have suspected articles analysed. On receiving a certificate
                    from the analyst, stating that any article is adulterated, the inspector must
                    take the necessary legal proceedings for the purpose of bringing the offender to
                    justice. The penalty on conviction of mixing anything whatever with a drug, with
                    the view of adulterating it, or of mixing any injurious or poisonous ingredient
                    with any article of food or drink, is a sum not exceeding fifty pounds, together
                    with the costs; and for the second offence he shall be guilty of a misdemeanour,
                    and be imprisoned for a period not exceeding six calendar months with hard
                    labour. The penalty for selling an adulterated article with a guilty knowledge
                    is a sum not exceeding twenty pounds, together with the costs; and for a second
                    offence, the justice may order the offender’s name, place of abode, and offence
                    to be published in a newspaper, or in any manner he thinks fit, at the expense
                    of the offender. Although the meaning of the term adulteration is not strictly
                    defined in the Act, yet it is declared that the admixture of anything whatever
                    with an article of food, drink, or drug, for the purpose of fraudulently
                    increasing its weight or bulk, is an adulteration within the provisions of the
                    Act. The adulteration of intoxicating liquors is provided for by the Licensing
                    Act 1872 (35 and 36 Vict. c. 94); and in this Act there is a schedule of
                    substances, called “<hi rend="italic">Deleterious Ingredients’’</hi> which are
                    considered to be adulterations: they are <hi rend="italic">Cocculus
                    indicus,</hi> chloride of sodium or common salt, copperas, opium, Indian hemp,
                    strychnine, tobacco, darnel seed, extract of logwood, salts of zinc or lead,
                    alum, and any extract or compound of any of these. The execution of this Act
                    rests with the police authorities and the Inland Revenue. The penalties for
                    adulteration <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n183/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0183-0168"/> are very severe, leaving it to the magistrate
                    either to inflict a heavy fine or to send the offender to prison. In the year
                    1869 an Act was passed to prevent the adulteration of seeds, in fraud of Her
                    Majesty’s subjects, and to the great detriment of agriculture (32 and 33 Vict.
                    c. 112), wherein it is declared that the killing of seeds, the dying of them,
                    and the selling of such killed or dyed seeds, with intent to defraud, is
                    punishable with a penalty not exceeding five pounds for the first offence, nor
                    exceeding fifty pounds for a second or subsequent offence, together with the
                    publication of the offender’s name, place of abode, and offence in any manner
                    that the justice thinks fit.</p>
                <p>Adulteration in other countries is strictly prohibited under penal obligations.
                    The Prussian penal code provides that any person selling adulterated or spoiled
                    goods shall be liable to a penalty up to fifty dollars, or imprisonment for six
                    weeks, with confiscation of goods; and it is not necessary to prove that the
                    seller was aware of the adulteration. In Holland, the Dutch law is very similar
                    to the code Napoleon, and inflicts a punishment of imprisonment for from six
                    days to two years, with a fine of from 16 to 600 francs. The adulteration of
                    bread with copperas or sulphate of zinc is dealt with by imprisonment of from
                    two to five years, and a fine of from 200 to 500 florins. In Paris, malpractices
                    connected with the adulteration of food are investigated by the Conseil de
                    Salubrité and punished. Much valuable information concerning the adulteration of
                    food, drink, and drugs in foreign countries has lately been obtained from the
                    various British legations and consulates abroad, through a circular addressed to
                    them from the Foreign Office. These investigations were commenced by the late
                    Earl of Clarendon, and have been continued by Earl Granville. The results have
                    been published in the <hi rend="italic">Food Journal</hi> for 1870 and 1871; and
                    they are epitomised at page 193 of the journal of the last mentioned date.</p>
                <p>Among the adulterations which are practised for the purpose of fraudulently
                    increasing the weight or bulk of an article are the following :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Adulterations of Milk.—</hi> This is commonly effected by
                    the addition of water—technically termed Simpson; and it is known by the
                    appearance of the milk, the specific gravity of it, the quantity of cream which
                    rises, and the chemical composition of the milk. Good milk has a rich
                    appearance, and a full pleasant taste. Its specific gravity ranges from 1029
                    (water being 1000) to 1032—the average being 1030. If, therefore, the density of
                    milk is above 1030, other conditions corresponding, the inference is that the
                    sample is unusually good. Between 1028 and 1030 it is most probably genuine. At
                    from 1026 to 1028 it is of doubtful quality, and below that, unless the amount
                    of cream is enormously large, the sample is not genuine. An instrument, called a
                    <hi rend="italic">galactometer,</hi> has been constructed to show the specific
                    gravity of milk at a glance; but it must always be remembered that while the
                    addition of water tends to lower the gravity of milk, so also does the presence
                    of much cream, and therefore a sample of skimmed milk may show a high gravity
                    even when diluted with water. The percentage quantity of cream is ascertained by
                    means of an instrument called a <hi rend="italic">lactometer.</hi> It is a glass
                    tube about 10 or 11 inches long and half an inch in diameter, graduated into 100
                    parts. Having shaken a sample of milk so as to diffuse the cream throughout its
                    bulk, it is poured into the lactometer to the topmost division; and after
                    standing for 12 hours, to allow the cream to rise, the proportion of it is read
                    off from the divisions on the tube. Good milk shows a range of from 8 to 12
                    divisions. Conjoined with the preceding test, this affords reliable indication
                    of the quality of the sample. After removing the cream, the gravity should be
                    again taken, and this should not be lower than 1030. The chemical composition of
                    milk varies to some extent with the breed of the cow, its age, the diet upon
                    which it is fed, the time of calving, and the time of milking; for afternoon
                    milk is generally richer than morning, and the last drawn than the first. But
                    taking the results of a large number of analyses by different chemists, it may
                    be said that the average percentage composition of milk is as follows :—Casein
                    or cheese matter, 3∙64; butter, 3∙55 <hi rend="italic">;</hi> milk, sugar or
                    lactose, 4∙70; saline matter, 0∙81; and water, 87∙30. If, therefore, 1000 grains
                    of milk be treated with a few drops of acetic acid, and then heated in a flask
                    to about 120° Fahr., the casein of the milk will curdle, and enclose within it
                    all the butter. When it is quite cold, it can easily be filtered, and when dry,
                    the curd and butter should weigh from 75 to 85 grains; and the serum or whey
                    should have a density of about 1029. The addition of mineral matter, as common
                    salt or carbonate of soda, to milk is easily recognised by an examination of the
                    ash or saline constitutents. 1000 grains of good milk evaporated to dryness will
                    produce from 120 to 130 grains of solid matter, of which about 8 grains are
                    mineral; and these are left in the platinum capsule, when the solid matter is
                    incinerated or burnt to an ash. Of this ash about half is phosphate of lime, and
                    2∙7 are alkaline chlorides, the rest being phosphates of magnesia and iron, with
                    a little carbonate of soda. Any notable increase, therefore, in the proportion
                    of ash, or any large diminution of it, will show adulteration. Colouring matter,
                    as annatto, &amp;c., is known by the peculiar tint of the milk; and starchy
                    matters boiled to an emulsion will give their characteristic reactions with
                    iodine, and will furnish a sediment which the microscope will reveal. Fatty
                    emulsions, in imitation of milk, were used during the siege of Paris, on the
                    recommendation of Μ. Dubrunfaut, who claims to have made a very perfect
                    substitute by emulsifying fatty matter with an artificial whey or serum. This he
                    did by dissolving from 40 to 50 grammes of saccharine matter (lactose, glucose,
                    or cane sugar), and from 20 to 30 grammes of albumen (dried white of egg), and
                    from 1 to 2 grammes of the crystals of carbonate of soda, in half a litre of
                    water, and then emulsifying with from 50 to 60 grammes of olive oil or other
                    fatty substance. This is best done at a temperature of from 120° to 140° Fahr.;
                    and the liquid so prepared has the appearance of cream, and requires to be mixed
                    with twice its volume of water to acquire the consistence of milk. Gelatine may
                    be used instead of albumen, the mixture being even more nearly like rich cream
                    than the former. Μ. Gaudin says that any kind of fat may be used for this
                    purpose, provided it is purified with superheated steam; and Μ. Fan states that
                    even horse grease may be so employed. Μ. Dumas, however, is of opinion that none
                    of these substitutes can take the place of milk for any time as dietetical
                    agents. Milk from diseased animals, especially those affected with
                    pleuropneumonia, and the foot-and-mouth disease, is very unwholesome, aud ought
                    not to be drunk. The diseased product is recognised by the presence of abnormal
                    inflammatory globules of the nature of pus, and by a large amount of epithelium
                    cells. Preserved condensed milk is now so commonly used for food, that its
                    properties when good should be known. 100 parts of the specimens at present in
                    the market consist of from 14 to 18 parts of casein, from 12 to 14 of butter,
                    from 44 to 52 of sugar, and from 2∙4 to 2∙7 of saline matter—making in all from
                    77 to 81 parts of solid matter—the rest, namely, from 23 to 19 parts, being
                    water. It appears, therefore, that the concentration of the milk has been
                    carried to about one-third of its original bulk, and that sugar has then been
                    added, so that when diluted with twice its volume of water, it makes a
                    sweet-tasting milk of ordinary strength. Good cream should contain rom 25 to 34
                    parts of butter, about 5 of casein, 2 of sugar, 2 of saline matter, and from 62
                    to 56 parts of water.</p>

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Coffee</hi> has from very early times been the subject of
                    sophistication. As far back as 1725, the Act 2 Geo. I. c. 30, took cognizance of
                    the practice, and rendered it penal. In 1803 it was the object of very decisive
                    measures, for by 43 Geo. III. c. 129, the officers of excise were empowered to
                    search for, and to seize any burnt, scorched, or roasted peas, beans, or other
                    grains or vegetable substance prepared in imitation of coflee; and any person
                    manufacturing or selling the same was liable to a penalty of £100; gradually,
                    however, it was found that use of torrefied vegetables in lieu of coffee, was
                    becoming general in spite of these restrictions, and, therefore, in 1822, the
                    Legislature (3 Geo. IV. c. 53) thought it expedient to allow the manufacture and
                    sale of scorched or roasted corn, peas, beans, or turnips, by persons who were
                    not dealers or sellers of coffee or cocoa, provided the same was sold under
                    license in a whole or unground condition, and in its proper name. The penalty
                    for infraction of the law was £100 in the case of a dealer in coffee or cocoa,
                    and £50 in that of a licensed dealer. At that time the use of chicory was not
                    generally known in England, although it had long before been introduced into
                    France as a substitute for coffee; and its use was encouraged by the first
                    Napoleon, who thought thus to strike a blow at English commerce. It was also
                    used in Belgium and the Netherlands, so that travellers who visited Paris,
                    Brussels, or Amsterdam, became acquainted with the substitute, and gradually
                    acquired a taste for it. About the year 1820 the first parcels of chicory were
                    imported into this country, and it would seem that the public demand for it
                    gradually increased; for in 1832 there was a minute of the Treasury nullifying
                    the Acts of George III. and George IV., by allowing grocers and other dealers in
                    coffee and cocoa to sell chicory, provided they did not mix it with coffee. At a
                    later period even this restriction was withdrawn; for by the Treasury minute of
                    1840, dealers in coffee were permitted to sell a mixture of chicory and coffee,
                    provided a duty of 6d. per lb. was paid on all the chicory imported for home
                    consumption. The use of it being thus legalised, it rapidly came into favour,
                    and English farmers found it profitable to cultivate the root, and to send it
                    into commerce duty free. This roused the attention of the Government, for the
                    duties on chicory and coffee began seriously to fall off. Even the quality of
                    the coffee imported underwent a change; for instead of demanding the fine
                    flavoured varieties, orders were given for a coarse and strong description of
                    plantation coffee, which would stand a good deal of chicory, as the grocers
                    phrased it. All this was brought to the notice of the Lords of the Treasury, and
                    in 1852 they revoked the order of 1840. But so strong was the influence of the
                    trade upon Government, that in the following year the offensive minute was
                    withdrawn, and grocers were again permitted to sell mixtures of coffee and
                    chicory, provided the packet was distinctly labelled “mixture of chicory and
                    coffee.” The Treasury even went so far in 1858 as to direct the Commissioners of
                    Inland Revenue, not to object to licensed dealers in coffee keeping and selling
                    mangel-wurzel or beet-root mixed with coffee, provided they observed the same
                    conditions as those laid down in the Treasury minute of 1853 as to chicory and
                    coffee. Up to this time the duty on chicory had been merely nominal; but it was
                    gradually increased until, in 1863, it was equivalent to that levied on coffee,
                    and thus the revenue was protected, while adulteration was encouraged. The
                    extent to which this was practised may be gathered from the Annual Reports of Mr
                    Phillips, the principal chemist of the Inland Revenue Laboratory. During the
                    years 1856 to 1862 inclusive, when the dealers in coffee and chicory were
                    visited by the officers of Excise, the average number of samples of coffee
                    annually examined was 3053, and of these 90, or nearly 3 per cent. were
                    adulterated—the range being from 5∙1 per cent. in 1856, to 1∙8 per cent. in
                    1862; and the quantity of chicory in the mixture averaged 24 per cent. In 1860
                    it was 29 per cent. Now, in all these cases the coffee was sold as pure coffee,
                    with no label upon the package; but when the mixtures of chicory and coffee were
                    asked for, 7∙3 per cent. were improperly labelled, and the average proportions
                    of chicory ranged from 39∙8 per cent. in 1859, to 22∙3 per cent. in 1862—the
                    average for the seven years, before the duties were equalised, being 30∙7 per
                    cent. In some cases, however, it reached to nearly 90 per cent.—40 to 50 per
                    cent. being common proportions; and to neutralise the peculiar sweetness, and
                    the earthy flavours which such quantities of chicory induced, it was, and still
                    is the practice, to add more or less of the bitter material called “finings,”
                    which is a preparation of burnt sugar or caramel. Even chicory itself is now the
                    subject of adulteration with roasted corn, beans, lupin seeds, acorns,
                    horse-chesnuts, peas, pulse (called “Hambro' powder ”), mustard husks, coffee
                    husks (called “flights ”), and even spent coffee, besides various roots, as
                    carrots, parsnips, mangel-wurzel, beet-root, dandelion, Ac. It is even said that
                    spent tan and dried bullocks’ livers have been employed for the purpose. The
                    tests for these adulterations are the appearances presented by the tissues of
                    the various vegetables when examined under the microscope, and by the fact that
                    infusion of chicory does not become discoloured when it is treated with iodine,
                    as it contains no starchy matters. Ground coffee, also, is of such a greasy
                    nature, from the presence of volatile oil, that when it is thrown upon water, it
                    floats, and does not readily discolour the water; whereas, all the adulterating
                    agents quickly sink in water, and give it a brown porter-like appearance. It is
                    not difficult indeed to separate, in a rough way, the coffee from its
                    adulterating matters by merely stirring a given weight of the mixture in a
                    tumbler of cold water; after a few minutes, the coffee will be found upon the
                    surface of the water, and the other things at the bottom of it. Chemical
                    analysis also readily discovers the fraud. It might be thought that there was
                    safety in purchasing the coffee-berries entire, but a very ingenious machine has
                    been patented for the manufacture of spurious berries out of common vegetable
                    substances.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Tea.—</hi> Formerly, when the supply of tea to this country
                    was entirely under the control of the East India Company, the adulteration of it
                    in China was rarely practised, as every shipment of it was carefully examined by
                    experienced officers at Canton, who rejected all teas of spurious or doubtful
                    character. At that time, therefore, the adulteration of tea was carried on after
                    it was imported into this country, and there were many legislative enactments
                    prohibiting the practice. By the Act 2 Geo. I. c. 3, every tea dealer was
                    subject to a penalty of £100, if he was convicted of counterfeiting, altering,
                    fabricating, or manufacturing tea, or mixing it with other leaves. Later still,
                    the statutes of 4 Geo. II. c. 14, and 17 Geo. III. c. 29, and 4 Geo. IV. c. 14,
                    dealt more precisely with the subject, and imposed other penalties. At that time
                    the adulterations of tea were effected in a wholesale manner; for according to
                    Mr Phillips, of the Inland Revenue Office, there were in London alone, in 1843,
                    as many as eight manufactories in which the exhausted leaves, obtained from
                    hotels, coffee-houses, and elsewhere, were redried, and faced with rose-pink and
                    blacklead, in imitation of genuine tea. More recently, however, the adulteration
                    of tea has been practised by the Chinese, who find no difficulty in disposing of
                    any kind of spurious tea to English merchants at Canton and Shanghai, who ship
                    it to this country, and lodge it in the bonded warehouses with all the
                    formalities of an honourable transaction, knowing that the difficulties of
                    convicting them under the Adulteration of Food Acts and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n185/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0185-0170"/> Nuisances Removal Acts are almost insurmountable;
                    for, in the first place, the local sanitary authorities have no means of
                    obtaining direct information of the existence of unsound or spurious tea, or
                    other article of food or drink in bonded warehouses; and secondly, if such
                    information reaches them indirectly, they have no legal right of entry for the
                    purpose of examining the tea and taking samples. But supposing both of these
                    difficulties have been surmounted, and the tea has been found on analysis to be
                    spurious, there yet remain the difficulties of obtaining a justice’s order for
                    its condemnation, an order from the customs for its removal, and an order which
                    will satisfy the requirements of the wharfinger in whose custody it has been
                    placed. But besides these, there are the difficulties of proving the ownership
                    of the article, and the guilty knowledge of the broker who sells it. In
                    illustration of this, we may refer to the proceedings of the sanitary
                    authorities of the city of London in their endeavour to suppress the importation
                    and sale of spurious tea. In the month of March 1870, Dr Letheby, the food
                    analyst for the city, reported that a large quantity of spurious tea had arrived
                    in London from China, and was lodged in the bonded warehouses of the city. It
                    was described as “Fine Moning Congou” from Shanghai; and it consisted of the
                    redried leaves of exhausted tea, much of which had become putrid before drying.
                    It appears to have been called in China “Ma-loo mixture”—Maloo being the name of
                    the street where it was prepared, and along the sides of which heaps of this
                    trash might often be seen drying in the sun, with dogs and pigs walking over it.
                    Proceedings were taken under the Nuisance Removal Amendment Act (26 and 27 Vict.
                    c. 117), for the purpose of obtaining an order for the condemnation and
                    destruction of the tea; but it was argued for the defence—1st, That “tea” was
                    not named in the Act of Parliament; 2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, That it was not
                    included under the term “vegetable;” 3(7, That it was not “food;” and 4 <hi
                    rend="italic">th</hi>, That being in a bonded warehouse, it was not “exposed for
                    sale.” The case, however, was so glaring that, after two days’ hearing, an order
                    was given by the justice for its destruction; but as a case was granted for the
                    opinion of the Court of Queen’s Bench, the order was suspended; and as the
                    application to the Court was never made, the order is still in abeyance. In
                    another case, where many chests of spurious “scented orange Pekoe siftings” were
                    in bond, the order for its condemnation was refuted on the ground that there was
                    not sufficient evidence of the so-called tea being unwholesome, notwithstanding
                    that it was not above one-sixth its proper strength; that it had little or none
                    of the active principles of tea; that it had an unpleasant odour and an acrid
                    taste; that a great portion of it was not tea at all, and that the rest of it
                    was composed of exhausted tea leaves, with just enough good tea to give it a
                    flavour. A like failure of justice occurred in the city in 1866, when measures
                    were taken by the sanitary authorities to prevent the sale of about 350,000 lbs.
                    of rotten and charred tea which had been saved from a fire at Beal’s wharf. The
                    adulterations practised by the Chinese are numerous; exhausted tea is redried
                    and glazed in a very deceptive manner. Millions of pounds of leaves of different
                    plants, other than tea, are gathered and mixed with it. Mineral matter too, in
                    the form of china clay, fine sand, and iron filings, are ingeniously
                    incorporated with the leaf before curling, so that as much as from 20 to 40 per
                    cent. of impurity is thus mixed with it. The tests, however, for these
                    adulterations are very simple. In the first place, there is the usual trade test
                    of infusion: a quantity of tea, amounting to the weight of a sixpence, is put
                    into a small covered cup, and infused with about four ounces of boiling water
                    for ten minutes. The infusion is then poured off from the leaves and is examined
                    for colour, taste, and odour—all of which are characteristic. The leaves, too,
                    are examined for soundness, for colour, for size, and for special botanical
                    properties. Impurities like iron filings, sand, or dirt, are easily seen among
                    the leaves, or at the bottom of the cup; and when these are placed upon a coarse
                    sieve and washed with water, the impurities pasi through, and may be collected
                    for examination. The leaves, too, betray by their coarseness and botanical
                    characters, the nature and quality of the tea; for although the leaves of
                    genuine tea differ much in size and form, yet their venation and general
                    structure are very distinctive. Very young leaves are narrow, convoluted, and
                    downy; those next in size and age have their edges delicately serrated, and the
                    venation is scarcely perceptible; while those of larger size have the venation
                    well marked, there being a series of loops along each side of the leaf extending
                    from the mid-rib to the edge: the serrations also are stronger and deeper,
                    beginning a short distance from the stem and running up the side of the leaf to
                    the apex. In addition to this, the microscopic characters of the surface of the
                    leaf are very characteristic. Further investigations of a chemical nature are
                    sometimes needed to determine the question of adulteration; and these depend on
                    the well-known composition of good tea. In different cases, according to the age
                    of the leaf and its mode of treatment, the proportions of its chief constituents
                    may vary; but in a general way it may be said that the average composition of
                    tea is as follows :—Moisture from 6 to 10 per cent.; astringent matter (tannin),
                    from 25 to 35; gum, from 6 to 7; albuminous matters, from 2 to 3; thein, from 2
                    to 3; mineral matters (ash), from 5 to 6; and ligneous or woody tissue, from 50
                    to 60 per cent. Green tea, which is generally made out of young leaves, contains
                    the largest quantity of soluble matters; and these, when fully exhausted from
                    the leaves by successive boiling in water, amount to from 25 to 35 per cent. of
                    the weight of the tea. In ordinary cases, when the tea is merely infused in
                    boiling water, it does not yield above 25 per cent. of extractive. Again, the
                    ash of tea is very characteristic of its quality— old and spurious leaves, as
                    well as tea adulterated with mineral matter, yielding more than 6 per cent. of
                    ash. The chief constituents of the ash of good tea are potash and phosphoric
                    acid, with a little lime, silica, and oxide of iron —there being but a trace of
                    chlorine and sulphuric acid; whereas the ash of old and exhausted leaves
                    contains but little potash and phosphoric acid, in proportion to the lime and
                    silica; and in those cases where tea has been damaged by sea water, the amount
                    of chloride is considerable. Iron filings in tea are easily discovered by means
                    of a magnet, there being in some cases as much as 20 or 30 per cent. of this
                    impurity. Even when incorporated with the leaf before rolling and glazing, the
                    fraud is detected by the attraction of the tea to the magnet.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Cocoa</hi> in its natural state contains so much fatty
                    matter (amounting to rather more than half its weight), that it has long been
                    the practice to reduce it by means of sugar or farinaceous substances. The first
                    of these preparations is called chocolate, and the latter is known by such names
                    as granulated, flake, rock, soluble cocoa, &amp;c. In some cases the mixture is
                    adulterated with mineral matters, as oxide of iron, to give colour. These
                    adulterations are recognised by the appearance and taste of the preparation, by
                    its microscopic characters, by the colour and reaction of its solution, and by
                    the proportions of fat and mineral matters in it.</p>

                    protect the public from the dishonest dealing of bakers. The assize of bread,
                    for example, is a very ancient institution; for it was the subject of a
                    proclamation in 1202, and it was the chief matter referred to in the notable
                    statute of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0186-0171"/> the Pillory and Tumbrel (51 Henry III. stat. 16)
                    already mentioned. In the city of London, according to “<hi rend="italic">Liber
                    Albus,”</hi> the assize of bread was an important institution. It was always
                    made immediately after the feast of St Michael in each year, and very specific
                    instructions were given for the guidance of the four discreet men who were to
                    perform it; for their decision regulated the business of the baker in respect of
                    the price and quality of bread, &amp;c., for the current year; and woe to him if
                    he disregarded it— there being numerous instances in “<hi rend="italic">Liber
                    Albus”</hi> of the pillory and the thew in cases where bread had been found
                    adulterated or of short weight. In the time of Anne, the assize of bread was
                    still further regulated (8 Anne, c. 19), and in the year 1815 it was abolished
                    by the statute 55 Geo. III. c. 99. Especial provision, however, was made to
                    guard against the frauds of adulteration, for several Acts of Parliament,
                    especially 31 Geo. II. c. 29 and 1 and 2 Geo. IV. c. 50, prohibited the use of
                    alum and other spurious articles in bread under severe penalties. At the present
                    time, the chief adulterations of bread are with alum or sulphate of copper for
                    the purpose of giving solidity to the gluten of damaged or inferior flour, or
                    with chalk or carbonate of soda to correct the acidity of such flour, or with
                    boiled rice or potatoes to enable the bread to carry more water, and thus to
                    produce a large number of loaves per sack of flour. In practice 100 lbs. of
                    flour will make from 133 to 137 lbs. of bread, a good average being 136 lbs.; so
                    that a sack of flour of 280 lbs. should yield 95 four-pound loaves. But the art
                    of the baker is exercised to increase the number, and this is accomplished by
                    hardening the gluten in the way already mentioned, or by means of a gummy mess
                    of boiled rice, three or four pounds of which, when boiled for two or three
                    hours in as many gallons of water, will make a sack of flour yield at least 100
                    four-pound loaves. Such bread, however, is always dropsical, and gets soft and
                    sodden at the base on standing, and quickly becomes mouldy. A good loaf should
                    have kindness of structure, being neither chaffy, nor flaky, nor crummy, nor
                    sodden. It should also be sweet and agreeable to the palate and the nose, being
                    neither sour nor mouldy. It should keep well, and be easily restored to
                    freshness by heating it in a closed vessel. And a slice of it, subjected to a
                    temperature of from 260° to 280° Fahr. should hardly be discoloured, and should
                    not lose more than 37 or 38 per cent. of its weight. When steeped in water, it
                    should give a milky sweet solution, and not a ropy acid liquid. The recognition
                    of alum and sulphate of copper in bread requires practice and skilful
                    manipulation, it being surrounded with difficulties. The most easily applied
                    process is that described by Mr Horsley. He makes a tincture of logwood, by
                    digesting a quarter of an ounce of the freshly cut chips in five ounces of
                    methylated spirit for eight hours, and filters. A teaspoonful of this tincture
                    is put with a like quantity of a saturated solution of carbonate of ammonia into
                    a wine-glassful of water; and the mixed solutions, which are of a pink colour,
                    are then poured into a white-ware plate or dish. A slice of the suspected bread
                    is allowed to soak in it for five minutes, after which it is placed upon a clear
                    plate to drain, and, if alum be present, it will, in the course of an hour or
                    two, acquire a <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> colour; if the tint be <hi
                    rend="italic">greenish,</hi> it is a sign of sulphate of copper; whereas pure
                    bread gradually loses its pink colour, but never becomes blue or green. The ash
                    of bread will also furnish evidences of the presence of mineral impurities.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Flour and other Farinaceous Matters.—</hi> The tests for
                    good flour are its sweetness and freedom from acidity and musty flavour. A given
                    weight of the flour, say 500 grains, made into a stiff dough with water, and
                    then carefully kneaded under a small stream of water, will yield a tough elastic
                    gluten, which, when baked in an oven, expands into a clean-looking ball of a
                    rich brown colour, that weighs, when perfectly dry, not less than 50 graine. Bad
                    flour makes a ropy-looking gluten, which is very difficult of manipulation, and
                    is of a dirty brown colour when baked. The ash of flour should not exceed 2 per
                    cent. Other farinaceous matters are recognised under the microscope by the
                    peculiar form, and size, and marking of the individual granules. In this way,
                    the adulterations of oat-meal with barley-meal, and of arrow-root with inferior
                    starches, may be easily detected.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Fatty Matters and Oils</hi> are the subjects of frequent
                    adulteration. Butter and lard, for example, are mixed with inferior fats, and
                    with water, salt, and farina. Most of these impurities are seen when the sample
                    of butter or lard is melted in a glass, and allowed to stand in a warm place for
                    a few hours, when the pure fat will float as a transparent oil, while the water,
                    salt, farina, &amp;c., will subside to the bottom of the glass. Fresh butter
                    generally contains a notable quantity of water, as from 12 to 13 per cent., and
                    sometimes a little salt, and a trace of curd; but these should never exceed two
                    per cent. in the aggregate. Foreign fats are recognised by the granular look of
                    the butter, by its gritty feel, by its taste, and by its odour when warmed.
                    Other tests for these impurities are the melting-point of the sample, and its
                    solubility in a fixed quantity of ether at a temperature of 65° Fahr. 20 grains
                    of the sample, treated with a fluid drachm of ether, in a closed test tube, will
                    look slighty flocculent, and be almost entirely dissolved in the case of good
                    butter; but it will be mealy and liniment-like with lard, granular with
                    dripping, and almost solid with mutton fat. The melting point of different fats
                    is as follows :—Horse grease, 140°; calf fat, 136°; mutton fat, 130°; beef fat,
                    99°; hog’s lard, 81°; and butter, 80°.</p>
                <p>Oils are adulterated with inferior kinds, and the fraud is detected by means of
                    the specific gravity of the oil, and its chemical reactions when tested upon a
                    white plate with a drop of concentrated sulphuric acid—the colour and its time
                    of development being the indications of the quality of the oil. The specific
                    gravity of the animal oils are as follows :—Neat’s-foot oil, 880; tallow oil,
                    900; dolphin oil, 918; cod-liver oil, 921 to 926; whale oil, 927; seal oil, 934;
                    porpoise oil, 937. Among the vegetable oils the following are the most important
                    :—Rape or colza oil, 913 to 916; olive oil, 918; filbert oil, 916; beech-nut,
                    922; walnut, 923; cotton-seed, 923 to 928; poppy, 924; sweet almond, 918 to 922;
                    hazel-nut and hemp-seed, 926; and linseed, 634 to 936.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Isinglass</hi> is often adulterated with gelatine, the fraud
                    being ingeniously contrived so as to retain to a large extent the well-knowm
                    characters of genuine isinglass; but it may be recognised in the following way:
                    immersed in cold water, the shreds of genuine isinglass become white and opaque
                    like cotton threads, and they swell equally in all directions, whereas those of
                    gelatine become transparent and ribbon-like. Isinglass dissolves completely in
                    boiling water, and makes a slightly turbid solution, which has a faint fishy
                    smell, and is without action on litmus paper; whereas gelatine leaves a quantity
                    of insoluble matter, and the solution smells of glue, and has an acid reaction.
                    Strong acetic acid swells up the shreds of isinglass, and renders them soft and
                    gelatinous; but it hardens gelatine. And, lastly, the ash of genuine isinglass
                    is very small in quantity, and has a reddish colour; whereas that of gelatine is
                    bulky (weighing from 2 to 3 per cent.), and has a perfectly white appearance
                    from the presence of calcareous salts. Genuine isinglass is produced from the
                    swimming-bladder or sound of the sturgeon, but gelatine is a sort of clarified
                    glue obtained from bones, clippings of hides, &amp;c. Boussingault states that
                    the Bouxwiller glue, which is prepared from the <pb break="no"

                    establishment, is transparent, and nearly colourless, and is on that account
                    much sought after by restaurateurs for making jellies. It enters largely, too,
                    into the composition of French gelatine.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Sugar.—</hi> During the last ten or twelve years the
                    manufacture of sugar from starch has been an important branch of industry. The
                    product is sent into commerce under the names of glucose, saccharum, and British
                    sugar; and although it is chiefly used for brewing purposes, it is also employed
                    for adulterating brown sugar, and for making confectionary, jams, marmalades,
                    and fruit jellies. In the year 1870, as much as 25,737 cwt. of this sugar was
                    manufactured for home consumption, and since then the quantity has been
                    increasing. It is produced from rice or other starch, by submitting it to the
                    action of very dilute sulphuric acid at a boiling temperature—the acid being
                    afterwards neutralised with lime, and the solution evaporated to the setting
                    point. The crystals of grape sugar are very small, and are entirely without that
                    sparkling character which distinguishes cane sugar. They are less soluble in
                    water, but more so in alcohol, than cane sugar, and they have only about
                    one-third the sweetening power. Boiled with a solution of caustic potash, they
                    quickly produce a deep brown liquid, and they have the power of reducing the
                    hydrated oxide of copper, when heated therewith in an alkaline solution. These
                    characters are distinctive of it, and will serve to recognise it in the brown
                    sugars of commerce.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Mustard</hi> is generally so acrid and powerful in its
                    flavour that it is commonly diluted with flour, or other farinaceous matter,
                    turmeric being added to improve its appearance. The mixture is recognised by
                    means of the microscope, when the granules of starch and the colouring matters
                    of turmeric are easily seen. Genuine mustard does not contain starch, and
                    therefore does not become blue when it is treated with a solution of iodine.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Spices,</hi> as pepper, cinnamon, curry powder, ginger,
                    cayenne, &amp;c., are more or less the subjects of fraudulent adulteration,
                    which can readily be detected by the microscope, and by an examination of the
                    mineral constituents. Formerly, pepper was ground by the retail dealer, and then
                    there was no excuse for the presence of adulterating agents; but in 1856, the
                    wholesale dealer undertook the business of grinding, and from that time
                    adulteration has been on the increase. In some cases, the article does not
                    contain a trace of pepper, but is made up of gypsum, mustard husk, and a little
                    starch. In the <hi rend="italic">Ninth Report of the Commissioners of Inland
                    Revenue,</hi> there is a statement by Mr Phillips, the chief chemist of the
                    Excise, that he found a sample of so-called pepper containing 25 per cent.
                    gypsum, the rest being mustard husks and a little cereal starch, without a trace
                    of pepper. Another sample consisted of 16 per cent. gypsum, 44 mustard husks, a
                    little cereal starch, and the rest pepper. Four other samples, closely
                    resembling pepper, so as to deceive an inexperienced eye, were found to contain
                    about 22 per cent. of gypsum, with sand, starch, and mustard husk. Linseed meal
                    and powdered capsicums are likewise used for adulterating pepper. The chief
                    sophistications of ginger powder are sago-meal, ground rice, and turmeric; while
                    the colouring agents of curry powders and cayenne are ferruginous earths, brick
                    dust, and even vermilion and red-lead. Spices, too, are sometimes exhausted of
                    their active properties before they are ground and sold to the public.</p>
                <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Beer, Ale, and Porter.—</hi> The assize of ale is
                    contemporaneous with that of bread, being described as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >“Assisae</hi><hi rend="italic">Panis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cervesioe,”</hi> in old documents. In the statute 51 Henry III. c.
                    16 (1266), they are spoken of as ancient and well-known institutions, the object
                    of them being to regulate the quality and price of these articles. The officers
                    appointed to determine the goodness of ale were called “ale conners,” or “ale
                    tasters” <hi rend="italic">(gustatores cervisiae),</hi> and were elected
                    annually in the court-leet of each manor, and in the city of London at the
                    ward-mote, according to the advice and assent of the alderman and other
                    reputable men of the ward. Very specific instructions are given in <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber Albus</hi> of the business of the brewer, and of the
                    penalities for any default thereof—it being ordained that no ale should be sold
                    without having been tasted and approved by the ale conners of the district. Even
                    now these officers are elected in the city of London with the old formalities,
                    but the real duty of examining the quality of ale, beer, and porter has for many
                    years been in the hands of the Excise. As far back as the time of Anne there was
                    a law prohibiting the use of <hi rend="italic">Cocculus indicus</hi> or any
                    unwholesome ingredient in the brewing of beer, under severe penalties, the
                    brewer being restricted to the use of malt and hops alone; but gradually, as the
                    taste for porter came into fashion (since 1730), and during the French war, when
                    the price of malt was very high, certain colouring matters prepared from burnt
                    sugar were allowed to be used, and this at last became so necessary to the
                    trade, that it was legalised by the Act 51 Geo. III. c. 51. Five years after,
                    however, it was prohibited by the statute 56 Geo. III. c. 58, which declared
                    that after the 5th of July 1817, no brewer, or dealer, or retailer of beer,
                    shall receive, or use, or have in his possession or custody, any liquor,
                    extract, or other material or preparation, for the purpose of darkening the
                    colour of worts or beer, other than brown malt. He was also prohibited from
                    using molasses, honey, liquorice, vitriol, quassia, <hi rend="italic">Cocculus
                    indicus,</hi> grains of paradise, guinea pepper, or opium, or any extract or
                    preparation of the same, or any substitute for malt or hops, under a penalty of
                    £200; and no chemist or vendor of drugs was permitted to sell, send, or deliver
                    any such things to a brewer or retailer of beer under a penalty of £500. Later
                    still, in 1830, the Act for permitting the general sale of beer and cider by
                    retail in England (1 Will. IV. c. 64), declares that if any person so licensed
                    shall knowingly sell any beer, ale, or porter, made otherwise than from malt and
                    hops, or shall mix, or cause to be admixed, any drugs or other pernicious
                    ingredients with any beer sold in his house or premises, or shall fraudulently
                    dilute or in any way adulterate any such beer, &amp;c., shall for the first
                    offence forfeit and pay a sum of from £10 to £20, and for the second offence
                    shall be adjudged disqualified from selling beer, ale, or porter for two years,
                    or forfeit a sum of from £20 to £50; and the same regulations applied to cider
                    and perry. The execution of these acts rested with the Excise, and it would seem
                    that three classes of adulterations were practised, namely, 1 <hi rend="italic"
                    >st</hi>, Those which gave fictitious strength to the beer, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cocculus indicus,</hi> tobacco, opium, Ac.; 2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, Those
                    which improved the flavour and body of the beer, as grains of paradise, capsicum
                    pods, ground ginger, coriander seeds, carraway seeds, sweet flag, liquorice,
                    molasses, and salt; and, 3 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, Those which gave
                    bitterness, as quassia, chiretta, horehound, gentian, &amp;c. In London the
                    publicans were not in the habit of practising the first kind of adulteration,
                    but confined themselves to the second and third. In the country, however,
                    according to Mr Phillips, it was quite otherwise, especially with brewers who
                    retailed their own beer; for he found that they frequently used tobacco and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cocculus indicus.</hi> He even thinks that the cases of brutal and
                    purposeless violence which were so often recorded were referable to the
                    maddening influence of these ingredients. By the Act 24 and 25 Vict. c. 22
                    (1863), when the duty on hops was relieved, these bitters and substitutes were
                    permitted, and so also was sugar, provided the full duty of 12s. 8d. per cwt.
                    was paid upon it. Later still, by the Licensing Act 1872 (35 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n188/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0188-0173"/> and 36 Vict. c. 94), provision is made to protect
                    the public from the adulteration of beer; for it prohibits the possession, sale,
                    or use of beer adulterated with <hi rend="italic">Caeculus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >indicus,</hi> chloride of sodium (otherwise common salt), copperas, opium,
                    Indian hemp, strychnine, tobacco, darnelseed, extract of logwood, salts of zinc
                    or lead, alum, and any extract or compound thereof, under a penalty of £20 for
                    the first offence, and £100 for the second offence, together with
                    disqualification of both the dealer and the house for a certain period. The
                    police and the officers of Inland Revenue are empowered to search for and obtain
                    samples of such beer, and the analyst is a person appointed by the Excise. The
                    tests for the adulteration of beer, ale, and porter, are not easily applied
                    except by a skilled chemist; but it may be said that the chief qualities of good
                    beer are its density, sweetness, spirituosity, piquancy, flavour, and
                    frothiness. The density of ale and beer ranges from 1008 to 1020 (water being
                    1000)—the average being 1015; and in the case of porter it ranges from 1015 to
                    1020. The amount of alcohol in these beverages ranges from 5 to 9 per cent., the
                    average being about 7. The solid extract is from 4 to 6 per cent., and the ash
                    or mineral matter is from 0∙2 to 0∙3 per cent. very little of which should be
                    common salt.</p>
                <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Malt.—</hi> The Excise do not permit malt to be adulterated
                    with ungerminated grain; but it is very difficult to determine whether the
                    presence of these grains is accidental or otherwise, as in some wet seasons when
                    barley is badly stacked it will heat or become mouldy, and the grains will lose
                    their vitality. Even if the grain is dried artificially at a temperature of from
                    140° to 150° Fahr., the vitality of the seed will be destroyed. In some seasons
                    as much as from 34 to 70 per cent. of the grain will be killed. Roasted unmalted
                    grain, instead of the malted, is prohibited by 19 and 20 Vict. c. 34, but there
                    is no doubt that the substitution is largely practised.</p>
                <p>14. <hi rend="italic">Wine and Spirits.—</hi> The denunciations in the Scripture
                    against the use of mixed wine has reference, in all probability, to wines which
                    were fortified or adulterated with stimulating and intoxicating herbs. In this
                    country measures were taken at a very early period to prevent the sale of
                    unsound and unwholesome wine. The Vintners’ Company, for example, which was
                    incorporated in the reign of Edward the Third, under the name of the “<hi
                    rend="italic">Wine Tenners,”</hi> had control over the price and purity of the
                    article, there being chosen every year “persons of the most sufficient, most
                    true, and most cunning of the craft (that hold no taverns),” who were to see to
                    the condition of all wines sold by retail, and who were to govern the taverners
                    in all their proceedings. Bad or adulterated wine was thrown into the gutters,
                    and the possessors thereof were set in the pillory. It would seem that the wine
                    which was most adulterated was that called Gascoign; for in the tenth year of
                    the reign of Henry the Sixth (1432), there was a petition to the king on the
                    subject, praying him to amend the same. Stowe, in fact, says “that in the 6th of
                    Henry VI., the Lombardes currupting their sweete wines, when the knowledge
                    thereof came to John Ranwell, maior of London, he, in divers places of the
                    citie, commanded the heades of the buts and other vessels in the open streetes
                    to be broken, to the number of fifty, so that the liquor running forth passed
                    through the citie like a stream of raine water, in the sight of all the people,
                    from whence there issued a most loathsome savour.” In modern times the art of
                    adulterating wine has been brought to great perfection; for it consists not
                    merely in the blending of wines of different countries and vintages, but in the
                    use of materials which are entirely foreign to the grape. Port wine, for
                    example, is manufactured from Beni Carlos, Figueras, and red Cape, with a touch
                    of Mountain to soften the mixture and give it richness— the body and flavour
                    being produced by gum-dragon, and the colour by “<hi rend="italic"
                    >berry-dye”</hi> which is a preparation of German bilberries. To this is added
                    the washings of brandy casks. <hi rend="italic">(“brandy cowe”)</hi> and a
                    little salt of tartar to form a crust. Sherry of the brown kind and of low price
                    is mingled with Cape and cheap brandy, and is flavoured with “brandy-cowe,”
                    sugar-candy, and bitter almonds. If the colour be too high it is lowered by
                    means of blood, and softness is imparted to it by gum-benzoin. Pale sherries are
                    produced by means of plaster of Paris or gypsum, by a process called
                    “plastering,” arid the effect of it is to remove the natural acids (tartaric and
                    malic), as well as the colour of the wine. In this way a pale, dry, bitter, and
                    sub-acid wine is produced, charged with the sulphates of lime and potash. Large
                    quantities of what are called clarets are manufactured in this country from
                    inferior French wine and rough cider, the colour being imparted to it by turnsol
                    or cochineal. Madeira is produced from Vidonia with a little Mountain and Cape,
                    to which are added bitter almonds and sugar. Even Vidonia and Cape are
                    adulterated with cider and rum —carbonate of soda being used to correct the
                    acidity. Common Sicilian wine is transformed iuto Tokay, Malaga, and Lachryma
                    Christi. Champagne is produced from rhubarb stalks, gooseberries, and sugar, the
                    product being largely consumed at balls, races, masquerades, and public dinners.
                    Of late, too, since the investigations of Petiot, Thenard, Gall, Hussman, and
                    others, the manufacture of wine from sugar and the refuse husk or mark of the
                    grape has been largely practised, insomuch that a great part of the wine of
                    France and Germany has ceased to be the juice of the grape at all. In point of
                    fact, the processes of blending, softening, fortifying, sweetening, plastering,
                    &amp;c., &amp;c., are carried on to such an extent that it is hardly possible to
                    obtain a sample of genuine wine, even at first hand; and books are written on
                    the subject, in which the plainest directions are given for the fabrication of
                    every kind of wine, there being druggists called “brewers’ druggists,” who
                    supply the agents of adulteration. These are as follow :—Elderberry, logwood,
                    brazil-wood, red saunders-wood, cudbear, red beet-root, &amp;c., for colour;
                    litharge, lime or carbonate of lime, carbonate of soda, and carbonate of potash,
                    to correct acidity; catechu, logwood, sloe-leaves, and oak-bark, for
                    astringency; sulphate of lime, gypsum, or Spanish earth, and alum for removing
                    colour; cane sugar for giving sweetness and body; glucose or starch sugar for
                    artificial wine; alcohol for fortifying; and ether, especially acetic ether, for
                    giving bouquet and flavour. The tests for these agents are not readily applied,
                    except by the professional chemist; but they are promptly recognised by the
                    stomach and the brain, for good wine, though it may intoxicate, rarely leaves a
                    disagreeable impression. In a general way, it may be said that the specific
                    gravity of genuine wine ranges from 991 to 997; and the amount of alcohol in it
                    never exceeds 20 per cent. by volume. The solid residue in it, when evaporated
                    to perfect dryness, amounts to from 1∙33 to 2∙15 per cent. in Rhine wines, and
                    in the light wines of France; to from 2∙85 to 3∙73 per cent. in Teneriffe and
                    Cape; to from 3∙49 to 4∙54 per cent. in sherry and Madeira; and to from 3∙75 to
                    5∙24 in port. Sweet wines, as Lachryma Christi, Muscat, Malaga, Tokay, Bergerac,
                    champagne, and the wines of the Palatinate, contain a much larger percentage of
                    solid matter in them. The ash, or involatile constituents of wine, should range
                    between 0∙19 and 0∙5 per cent. It should be strongly alkaline, and should
                    consist of carbonate, sulphate, and phosphate of potash, chloride of sodium,
                    carbonate of lime, and a little alumina. As a distinctive mark of genuine wine,
                    the ash is of the greatest value. Again, pure wine gives but slight precipitates
                    with oxalate of ammonia, with acid nitrate of silver, and acid nitrate of
                    baryta. The <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0189-0174"/> colouring matters of wine may be separated and
                    analysed by the process of Mulder, which is too elaborate for description in
                    this place, and so also are the tests for recognising spurious colours, as the
                    test of Vogel, Jacob, and others (solutions of acetate of lead), that of Pelouze
                    and Frenny (basic acetate of lead); of Ness von Esenbeck (solutions of alum and
                    of carbonate of potash); of Batilliat (ammonia); of Filhol (ammonia and sulphide
                    of ammonium); and others. At present, the spectroscope has not furnished, as was
                    expected, any very reliable indications of the nature of the colouring matters
                    of wine. In fact, the whole subject requires fuller investigation. The
                    adulteration of spirits consists mostly in the addition of water and in the use
                    of inferior spirit, recipes being given in the <hi rend="italic">Publican’s
                    Guide,</hi> and other such books, for what is called making up spirits for sale.
                    The recognition of these frauds rests with the Excise, under the Act 35 and 36
                    Vict. c. 94.</p>
                <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Tobacco and Snuff.—</hi> The adulteration of these articles
                    is prohibited and otherwise provided for by the statutes 5 and 6 Vict. c. 93,
                    and 25 and 26 Vict. c. 7, and 30 and 31 Vict. c. 90, manufacturers of tobacco
                    and snuff being prohibited from using or having in their possession sugar,
                    honey, molasses, treacle, leaves, herbs, or plants, powdered wood, moss, weeds,
                    sea-weeds, or any ground or unground roasted grain, chicory, lime, sand, umbre,
                    ochre, or other earths, nor anything capable of being used to increase the
                    weight of tobacco or snuff, under a penalty of £200—water alone being allowed in
                    the manufacture of tobacco; and water, salt, and alkaline salts, as well as lime
                    in the manufacture of snuffs, under a penalty of £300. But it appears from the
                    reports of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, that the adulteration of tobacco
                    and snuff is still largely practised. Tobacco is adulterated with molasses,
                    sugar, aloes, liquorice, gum, catechu, oil and lamp-black, alum, tannic acid and
                    iron, logwood, and such leaves as rhubarb, chicory, cabbage, burdock,
                    colts-foot, and excess of salt and water. In the year 1862 it was discovered
                    that certain Irish manufacturers were adulterating their Cavendish and
                    roll-tobacco with liquorice, in imitation of the sweetened Cavendish of North
                    America, and therefore in 1863 the practice was legalised in the case of
                    Cavendish and negro-head by the Manufactured Tobacco Act, 1863. Snuffs are
                    adulterated with excess of alkaline salts, lime, sand, ferruginous earths,
                    fustic, torrefied oatmeal, peat-moss, ground velonia cups, bichromate of potash,
                    and chromate of lead. Mr Phillips states, in the <hi rend="italic">Fourth Report
                    of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue,</hi> that up to 1856 the practice of
                    adulterating snuff was very prevalent, particularly in Ireland—52 per cent. of
                    the samples analysed being found to be illicit; in 1858 and subsequently,
                    however, the proportion has been much less. These adulterations are recognised
                    by drying the sample, and noting the loss of weight, and by the amount and
                    nature of the ash left on incineration. Foreign leaves, &amp;c., are discovered
                    by the aid of the microscope.</p>
                <p>16. Among the adulterations which are practised for the purpose of improving the
                    appearance of the article, and giving it a false strength, are the following
                    :—The addition of <hi rend="italic">alum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sulphate of
                    copper</hi> to bread; the facing of black tea with <hi rend="italic">black
                    lead,</hi> and of green with a mixture of <hi rend="italic">indigo</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Prussian blue</hi> with <hi rend="italic">turmeric</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">china clay;</hi> the treatment of pickles and preserved fruits
                    with a <hi rend="italic">salt of copper,</hi> which has the property of
                    mordanting and brightening the green colouring matter of vegetables. In some
                    cases the quantity of copper has been so large as to give a coppery appearance
                    to a steel knife or fork kept in the pickle; but at all times the metal may be
                    discovered by the pink colour of the ash, and by its becoming blue when treated
                    with a little strong ammonia. <hi rend="italic">Ferruginous earths</hi> are
                    added to sauces, anchovies, potted meats, and the preparations of cocoa. This
                    also is recognised by the amount and colour of the ash. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mineral pigments,</hi> as yellow and orange <hi rend="italic">chromate of
                    lead,</hi> green <hi rend="italic">arsenite of copper,</hi> &amp;c., are
                    frequently used in colouring confectionery, and have produced serious results to
                    those who have eaten it. Lastly, with a view of giving false strength to the
                    article, <hi rend="italic">sulphuric acid</hi> has been added to vinegar and
                    lime-juice; <hi rend="italic">black jack</hi> or <hi rend="italic">burnt
                    sugar</hi> to coffee and chicory; <hi rend="italic">catechu</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">terra japonica</hi> to exhausted tea; <hi rend="italic">Cocculus
                    indicus</hi> to beer and porter; cayenne and mustard husks to pepper,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>17. Adulterations are also practised for the purpose of debasing the article, as
                    when the cream is taken from milk by the process of skimming; or when the active
                    principles of spices, &amp;c., have been removed by distillation.</p>
                <p>18. Accidental adulterations may occur from the admixture of darnel or ergot with
                    flour; siliceous and earthy matters with substances that are ground in a mill;
                    mould or acari with flour, sugar, cheese, &amp;c.; and copper, zinc, or lead may
                    be accidentally derived from the vessels in which any acid substance or liquid
                    has been prepared or kept. In this manner cider and wine have become tainted
                    with lead; sour milk with zinc; and jellies, jams, and preserves with
                    copper.</p>
                <p>19. <hi rend="italic">Adulteration of Cattle Foods.—</hi> In a recent trial,
                    where the question of adulteration was raised, a linseedcake maker stated in
                    evidence that his ordinary oil-cake consisted of 50 parts ground sesamé cake, 20
                    parts of bran, and 30 of linseed and linseed siftings. To prevent the detection
                    of this fraud by an examination of the cake with the naked eye, it is customary
                    to powder the materials very fine by means of a machine called a “Buffein
                    machine,” after which they are thoroughly mixed together and pressed into a
                    cake. It would seem, indeed, that pure linseed cake is not saleable, except in a
                    few localities, as in the neighbourhood of Gainsborough, and in the agricultural
                    centres of Lincolnshire and Norfolk, where the genuine cake is appreciated.
                    Elsewhere the adulterated article commands a ready sale, on account of its low
                    price; and thus encouragement is given to the use of all sorts of adulterating
                    agents, as earth-nut, cotton, beech, and sesamé bran, ricehusks, oat-dust, and
                    other such worthless matter. Very recently this important subject has been
                    treated by Dr Voelcker in a paper “On the Characters of Pure and Mixed Linseed
                    Cakes,” which was published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Royal
                    Agricultural Society of England</hi> (vol. ix. part 1 ). Some of the impurities
                    of linseed cake may be due to the accidental presence of the seeds of various
                    weeds and wild plants, which the careless farmer has allowed to grow upon his
                    land. Most of these, however, are easily removed by one or two siftings, as in
                    the case with clean linseed; but the siftings are not thrown away; they are used
                    for adulterating other samples of linseed—making the second, third, and even
                    fourth qualities of Riga and St Petersburg seed. Occasionally the siftings are
                    sent out to sea in barges to meet the vessels coming from the north with linseed
                    on board; there the mixture is made; and when the vessels reach the port for
                    which they are destined, the cargo is sold for genuine linseed “as imported.”
                    But besides these impurities, the linseed cake of commerce contains a large
                    proportion of other cakes, as rape, earth-nut, decorticated and undecorticated
                    cotton seed, beech-nut, hemp-seed, cocoa-nut, cocoa, palm-nut, palm-kernels,
                    niger seed, sesamé or teal seed, poppy, castor oil, bassia, curcas, indigo seed,
                    olive, &amp;c., besides bran, acorns, careb-beans, and the husks or shades of
                    earth-nut, oats, barley, rice,and other refuse. Some of these things are
                    actually poisonous to cattle, as in the case of castor-oil cake, curcas bean,
                    purging flax, wild mustard, wild radish, &amp;c.; others are of doubtful
                    quality, as corn cockle, darnel, indigo seed, earth-nut, &amp;c.; and many are
                    disagreeable to the taste, on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n190/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0190-0175"/> account of rancidity and other properties, as
                    cocoa-nut cake, palm-nut cake, bassia cake, &amp;c.; while many are so charged
                    with woody matters as to be indigestible and irritating in their action, as
                    cotton, olive, palm-nut, husks of rice, cocoa-nut fibre, saw-dust, &amp;c. These
                    impurities are sometimes easily recognised by the naked eye, or by a lens of low
                    power. At other times the colour of the cake is an indication of its impurity.
                    The taste of it also is frequently characteristic <hi rend="italic">; for</hi>
                    while linseed has a sweet mucilaginous taste, rape seed is turnipy, mustard
                    acrid, dodder like garlic, bassia bitter, &amp;c. Then, again, the action of a
                    little warm water will develope the flavour of impurities—rape giving off a
                    strong odour of turnip, mustard its well-known acrid flavour, wild radish and
                    other impurities their characteristic smells. When examined chemically it is
                    found that adulterated and dirty cakes show a deficiency of oil and albuminous
                    matter, and a large excess of woody fibre and mineral substance. In good cake
                    the moisture ranges from 10 to 14 per cent., the oil from 10 to 15, the
                    albuminous matter from 25 to 35, the mucilage, sugar, and digestible fibre to
                    from 20 to 30 per cent., the woody fibre to from 9 to 14, and the mineral matter
                    or ash to from 6 to 8 per cent. Cake that has been shipped too fresh is apt to
                    heat and become mouldy; in which case it will lose its fine aroma, and be of
                    inferior quality: it may even be injurious to animals feeding on it.</p>
                <p>20. <hi rend="italic">The Adulteration of Seeds,</hi> in fraud of her Majesty’s
                    subjects, and to the great detriment of agriculture, has been provided for by
                    the Act 32 and 33 Vict. c. 112, wherein it is prohibited to kill, dye, or to
                    sulphur seeds, or any way to give them a false appearance, under a penalty of £5
                    for the first offence, and £50 for the second. But for all this extensive frauds
                    are practised: turnip seed is adulterated with rape, wild mustard or charlock,
                    the vitality of which has been destroyed by kiln-drying at a high temperature;
                    old turnip seed (kiln-dried) is also used for diluting fresh seed; and it is
                    notorious that such seed can be obtained in commerce by the ton. Again, clover
                    seed is often killed and dyed—one of the commonest frauds being to dye trefoil,
                    and to sell it for red clover; the pinkish or yellowish-brown tint and metallic
                    look being given with a weak solution of logwood and alum, or with a strong
                    solution of logwood alone, and then it is shaken up with a little black lead.
                    Another trick is to dye white clover seed with a weak solution of indigo, and
                    thus to make it look like hybrid clover which has a bluish-green colour. When
                    trefoil and white clover seed have become changed by age and have lost their
                    yellowish colour, they are dyed with infusion of turmeric, and then toned down
                    •with the fumes of burning sulphur; in fact, these fumes are used to brighten up
                    all sorts of seeds that have become brown by keeping, but they destroy the
                    vitality of the seed.</p>
                <p>21. <hi rend="italic">Adulteration of Drugs.—</hi> This at all times has been
                    considered a serious offence. In the city of London, the president and censors
                    of the College of Physicians have power to search for apothecaries’ wares,
                    drugs, and stuffs, and on finding them defective, corrupted, and not meet nor
                    convenient to be ministered in any medicines for the health of man’s body, they
                    are to destroy them, and are to correct and punish the offenders by committing
                    them to prison, and amercing them in a penalty not exceeding £20. These
                    Wholesome powers were granted to the college by the Acts 14 and 15 Hen. VIII. c.
                    5, and 32 Hen. VIII. c. 40, and 2 Mary, c. 9; but although they are still in
                    force, and might be advantageously exercised, yet they have long since fallen
                    into disuse; and if it had not been for the laudable efforts of the
                    Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, there would have been no practical
                    remedy for the adulteration of drugs. The Society was founded in 1841, for the
                    purpose of advancing the status and education of those who were engaged in the
                    preparation and sale of medicines, and it was incorporated by Royal Charter in
                    1843. A few years after, in 1852, the qualifications of pharmaceutical chemists
                    were regulated by Act of Parliament (15 and 16 Vict. c. 56), and in 1868 it was
                    further provided, by the 31 and 32 Vict. c. 121, that no person should be
                    permitted to engage in the sale or dispensing of medicines, or to use the title
                    of chemist and druggist, or dispensing chemist, or pharmaceutist, without being
                    duly qualified, and registered as a pharmaceutical chemist. The adulteration of
                    medicine was also prohibited by the incorporation of the Adulteration of Food
                    and Drink Act 1860 (23 and 24 Vict. c. 84), it being declared that such
                    adulteration should be deemed an admixture injurious to health. More recently,
                    in 1872, the Act 35 and 36 Vict. c. 74, renders it penal for any one to
                    adulterate a drug for sale, or to sell such drug. In the first case the penalty
                    is a sum not exceeding £50, together with the costs of the conviction; and for a
                    second offence he shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and be imprisoned for a
                    period not exceeding six calendar months, with hard labour. In the second case,
                    the seller of an adulterated drug is subject to a penalty not exceeding £20,
                    together with costs; and for a second offence he shall have his name, place of
                    abode, and offence published in any manner that the justice thinks fit. The
                    chief adulterations and debasing of drugs are the following :—In the case of
                    vegetable substances, as jalap, opium, rhubarb, cinchona bark, &amp;c., foreign
                    substances are added to make up for the loss of weight in drying and powdering,
                    there being in many cases a trade allowance of only four per cent. for such
                    loss, whereas in almost all cases it exceeds this. Roots, seeds, and barks, for
                    example, lose from 6 to 9 per cent., scammony 7 per cent., aloes 9, sarsaparilla
                    10, squills 12, and opium from 15 to 25 per cent. At other times foreign
                    substances are added to assist the grinding, or to improve the appearance of the
                    article. Occasionally the active principles are removed, or the medicine has
                    become worthless from keeping or from faulty preparation. In the case of the
                    alkaloids, inert substances, as sugar, starch, gum, &amp;c., are mixed with them
                    to increase their weight and bulk. Lastly, the activity of a vegetable drug may
                    greatly depend on its mode and place of culture. With respect to mineral
                    preparations, there is even a still larger field for adulteration, insomuch that
                    the purity of the article is entirely regulated by the wholesale price of it.
                    Again, directly after the Act of 1856 (18 and 19 Vict. c. 38), which permitted
                    the sale of methylated spirit—that is, inferior spirit mixed with wood-naphtha,
                    duty free for manufacturing purposes—advantage was taken of it by many chemists
                    and druggists, and the cheap spirit was used for making tinctures and other
                    medicinal preparations. This, however, came at last to be so serious and
                    dangerous a practice, and was withal so great a fraud on the revenue, that means
                    were taken to suppress it by the Act 29 and 30 Vict. c. 64, wherein it is
                    provided that such spirit shall not be used in any medicinal preparation, except
                    in the manufacture of chloroform, ether, and the vegetable alkaloids, or in the
                    preparation of other things whereby the spirit was afterwards entirely
                    dissipated. But Mr Phillips remarks, in the <hi rend="italic">Ninth</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Report of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue,</hi> that a few
                    instances have been discovered of the sale of drinks under the names of
                    “Indianna brandee,” “medicated whiskee,” “pure Islay mountain,” “Indian
                    tincture,” &amp;c., the exciting principle of all of which was found to be
                    hyponitrous ether prepared from methylated spirit. In the case of a drink called
                    “Hollands whiskee,” it was produced by distilling the methylated spirit with a
                    little nitric acid, and then sweetening with treacle, and flavouring with
                    rhubarb, chloroform, <pb break="no"

                    character; and notwithstanding its disagreeable flavour, it got into public
                    favour in some districts, especially in Ireland, and was largely sold as a cheap
                    means of producing intoxication.</p>
                <p>22. <hi rend="italic">The Adulteration of Textile Fabrics.—</hi> Woollen goods
                    have for years past been largely adulterated with refuse fibres called “shoddy”
                    or “mingo.” The practice was denounced by Latimer in one of his sermons at
                    Paul’s Cross, preached before king Edward in 1635, wherein he spoke of it as the
                    devil’s artifice, saying that they were wont to make beds of flock, but now they
                    had turned it into dust, which he aptly called “Devil’s dust,” and that the
                    cloth worker did so incorporate it to the cloth that it was wonderful to see.
                    The practice is still in vogue, for there is hardly a piece of cheap cloth
                    without it. Shoddy as originally used was merely the fluff or waste from the
                    looms, but now it consists of any kind of woollen rubbish, as old blankets,
                    stockings, &amp;c., pulled to pieces in a machine called the “Devil.” Mingo is
                    even a shorter description of fibre, and is made in the same way from old rags.
                    No less than forty millions of pounds of these are made annually in Yorkshire,
                    at an estimated value of eight millions sterling, and all of it is used for
                    adulterating woollen cloth. There is even another kind of refuse called
                    “extract,” which is employed for the same purpose. It consists of the wool
                    obtained from the rags of mixed goods; that is, goods which have a cotton or
                    linen warp blended with wool. The cotton is destroyed by chemical agency,
                    chiefly by means of dilute sulphuric acid, and the wool is left intact.</p>
                <p>The cotton fabrics and gray goods of Lancashire and Yorkshire are largely
                    adulterated with size and china clay, the object being to give them increased
                    weight and substance. Up to about twenty years ago the sizing of cotton goods
                    was effected with a mixture of fermented flour, paste, and tallow, by which
                    means the tenacity of the warp was increased and the friction of weaving was
                    lessened. To effect this about 20 per cent. of size was used; but in 1854, when
                    tallow became dear in consequence of the Russian war, a substitute was found in
                    china clay. Later still in 1862, when the cotton famine began to be felt, and
                    the long-fibred American cotton grew scarce, it was found necessary to give
                    tenacity to the twist made from shorter fibre by using more size. In this manner
                    as much as from 50 to 90 per cent. of size has got to be used, the greater part
                    of it being china clay, with a certain proportion of hygroscopic matter, such as
                    chloride of magnesium, to keep the material damp and supple. The impurity is
                    easily detected by washing the cloth, and ascertaining the loss of weight before
                    and after the operation. Cheap calicoes are also largely impregnated with lime,
                    which has been used in the process of bleaching, and left in them. A cloud of
                    dust flies out of such fabrics when they are torn. Silk also is made heavier and
                    stouter by the incorporation of dye stuffs used expressly for the purpose. This
                    is generally the case with dark-coloured silks, black and brown, as lighter
                    shades will hardly admit of it; as much indeed as half the weight of the silk
                    may be thus incorporated with it.</p>
                <p>23. <hi rend="italic">Falsification of Coin and Precious Metals.—</hi> In
                    Anglo-Saxon times the debasing or counterfeiting of coin was punished by the
                    loss of the hand. In later times it has been criminal in the highest degree. By
                    the statute 24 and 25 Vict. c. 99, the counterfeiting of gold or silver coin is
                    felony, and in Scotland is a high crime and offence. Hardly less severe is the
                    punishment for debasing, diminishing, lightening, or impairing the value of the
                    current coin of the realm; and very effectual means are taken to secure their
                    standard value when put into circulation. In the first place, an officer is
                    appointed by the Crown to superintend the coinage, and to be answerable for its
                    goodness. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mint</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Coinage.)</hi> In the second place, the coin is tested, as to its weight and
                    fineness, by persons skilled in the goldsmith’s craft. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Assay.)</hi> But notwithstanding this, the coins of the realm, as issued from
                    the mint, have often been debased to a considerable extent; for, according to
                    Lord Liverpool, the total debasement of the silver money of this country, from
                    the time of the Conquest to the reign of Elizabeth, was not less than 65 per
                    cent. It is notorious that in Spain, Austria, and Turkey the degradation of the
                    silver coin, even at the present time, is carried to a serious extent. By the
                    Coinage Act 1870 (33 and 34 Vict. c. 10) the composition and weight of all the
                    coins of this country are strictly provided for; and in the case of gold coin,
                    the limits or “remedy” of fineness and weight are exceedingly narrow. The
                    composition of the coin is fixed at eleven-twelfths fine gold, and one-twelfth
                    alloy (copper); so that in 1000 parts of our gold coin there are 916∙66 parts of
                    fine gold. This is called its millesimal fineness, and the allowance for error
                    in composition is limited to 0∙002 per 1000 parts. The weight of the sovereign
                    is fixed at 123∙27447 grains, and the limit of error in weight is the 0∙2 of a
                    grain; and in proportion with all other gold coins. In the case of silver coins,
                    the composition is thirty-seven fortieths of fine silver, and three-fortieths of
                    alloy (copper) —the millesimal fineness being therefore 925 parts of silver; the
                    remedy or allowance of fineness is just twice that of gold—namely, 0∙004 per
                    1000 parts. The weight of the silver coin is at the rate of 87∙27272 grains per
                    shilling of value; and the remedy or allowance of error is confined to 0∙36363
                    of a grain per shilling. Lastly, the bronze coinage of the country consists of
                    95 parts copper, 4 tin, and 1 zinc: the weight of a penny being 145∙83333
                    grains; and the allowance for error is 2∙91666 grains per penny. The specific
                    gravity of the several descriptions of coin is 17∙53 for gold, 10∙35 for silver,
                    and 8∙89 for bronze. So accurate are the composition and weight of the coins
                    issued from the mint at the present time, that at the last trial of the “Pyx” in
                    July 1871, the jury reported that every piece separately examined (representing
                    many millions sterling) was found to be accurately coined in regard to weight
                    and fineness. In the case of the gold coin, the fineness ranged from 916∙2 to
                    917 parts per 1000. These, indeed, were the extremes of only 2∙66 per cent. of
                    the coins examined, the great bulk of them, namely 72∙65 per cent. having a
                    fineness of from 916∙5 to 916∙7 per 1000. Now, when it is considered that the
                    composition of an alloy of gold and copper can be ascertained to the one-ten
                    thousandth part, and that the delicacy of a balance is to the thousandth part of
                    a grain, it must be evident that the accuracy and perfection of coining in this
                    country are remarkably precise. As, however, the weight of gold and silver coin
                    must become less by continual wear, the Acts 22 and 25 Vict. c. 99, and 33 and
                    34 Vict. c. 10 provide for it. It does not appear that the practice of debasing
                    coin is carried on to any great extent in this country; for in the second Annual
                    Report of the Deputy-Master of the Mint (1871), the chemist of the Mint (Mr W.
                    Chandler Roberts) says that only two sovereigns were submitted to him, the
                    weight of which had been fraudulently reduced by means of a solvent, aided by
                    electricity. In former times, however, the process of “sweating” was very
                    frequently employed.</p>
                <p>The adulteration of precious metals was prohibited and provided for by the rules
                    and regulations of the various guilds and corporations which took cognizance of
                    the goldsmiths’ craft. As early as the 26th of Henry II. (1180) the Goldsmiths’
                    Company of London was founded, and in 1327, when it was incorporated, it was
                    invested with the privilege and power of inspecting, trying, and regulating all
                    gold and silver wares throughout the kingdom<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n192/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0192-0177"/>, and of punishing all offenders who were found
                    guilty of working adulterated gold or silver. The chief offenders appear to have
                    been the cutlers, who were charged with covering base metal in such a manner
                    that it could not easily be detected. It was therefore provided that all manner
                    of vessels of gold and silver should be of “good and true alloy;” and power was
                    given to the company to “go from shop to shop to assay if the gold was good,”
                    and finding that it was not of the right touch, it was to be seized and
                    forfeited for the king. Subsequently, by the statute of 2 Henry VI. (1424), it
                    was provided that none should work gold unless it be as good as the alloy of the
                    “mystery,” and that silver wares should be as good or better than the king’s
                    coin. It was further provided, that when the goods were finished they should be
                    brought to the Hall to be assayed; and when found of the right touch it should
                    be stamped with the owner’s and assayer’s marks, as well as with the
                    “Liberdshede crowned.” These powers have been confirmed in numerous Acts of
                    Parliament, the most important of which are the following :—12 Geo. II. c. 26
                    (1739), which provides that no goldsmith, silver smith, or other trader shall
                    work or make any vessel of gold of less than 22-carat fineness (that is, 22
                    parts of fine gold to 2 parts of alloy), nor any silver vessel or plate of less
                    than eleven ounces and two pennyweights of fine silver, and 18 pennyweights of
                    alloy, in a pound troy, under a penalty of £10. But this does not extend to
                    jewelry, earrings, gold springs, lockets, &amp;c. It also provides for the
                    proper assaying and stamping of the same. In 1784, the Act 24 Geo. III. c. 53,
                    made provision for imposing a duty on the article assayed and stamped, and from
                    that time the kings or queens head has appeared as a mark. In 1798, the Act 38
                    Geo. III. c. 69, gave permission for a lower standard of gold, namely 18-carat
                    gold (that is, 18 parts of fine gold to 6 of alloy); and by the Act 7 and 8
                    Vict. c. 22 (1844), the penalty for using false stamps, &amp;c., was
                    ameliorated. Lastly, by the Act 17 and 18 Vict. c. 96, three still lower
                    standards of gold were permitted, namely 15-carat gold, 12-carat gold, and
                    9-carat gold, each of which was to be designated by the number and the decimal.
                    At present, therefore, all gold and silver plate, as well as wedding and
                    mourning rings, must be assayed and stamped before their sale; and other
                    articles may be assayed and stamped in like manner at the option of the maker or
                    dealer. The stamps or marks impressed on gold are the following, namely,—1 <hi
                    rend="italic">st</hi>, The initials of the maker’s name; <hi rend="italic"
                    >2d,</hi> The duty mark (a king’s or queen’s head); 3 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>,
                    The crown and standard number, indicating the quality of the gold; 4 <hi
                    rend="italic">th</hi>, The assayer’s stamp (a leopard’s head for Goldsmiths’
                    Hall); and <hi rend="italic">5th,</hi> The letter denoting the year of assay. In
                    the case of silver, the stamps are—1 <hi rend="italic">st</hi>, The initial
                    letters of the maker; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> A lion; <hi rend="italic"
                    >3d,</hi> The assayer’s stamp (in London, a leopard’s head); <hi rend="italic"
                    >4th,</hi> The letter indicating the year of assay; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >5th,</hi> The duty mark (a king’s or queen’s head). Silver goods of higher
                    value, that is, with a mixture of 11 ounces and 10 pennyweights of fine silver,
                    instead of 11 ounces and 2 pennyweights, is called new sterling, and is, as
                    formerly, marked with a figure of Britannia, and a lion’s head erased. As in
                    olden times, the Goldsmiths’ Company have still power to break, cut, or
                    otherwise destroy all gold and silver plate which is below the legal standard.
