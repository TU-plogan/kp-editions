                    from D’Herbelot’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Orientale,</hi> that from the earliest periods the Eastern nations were in the
                    habit of preserving the maxims of their sages. From them the practice passed to
                    the Greeks and Romans. Plato and Xenophon treasured up and recorded the sayings
                    of their master Socrates; and Arrian, in the concluding books of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Enchiridion,</hi> now lost, collected the casual observations of
                    Epictetus. The numerous apophthegms scattered in Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius,
                    and other writers, show that it was customary in Greece to preserve the
                    colloquially expressed ideas of illustrious men. It appears that Julius Caesar
                    compiled a book of apophthegms, in which he related the <hi rend="italic">bon
                    mots</hi> of Cicero; and Quintilian informs us that a freedman of that
                    celebrated wit and orator composed three books of a work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Jocis Ciceronis.</hi> We are told by
                    Suetonius that Caius Melissus, originally the slave but afterwards the freedman
                    and librarian of Maecenas, collected the sayings of his master; and Aulus
                    Gellius has filled his <hi rend="italic">Nodes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Atticoe</hi> with anecdotes which he heard from the eminent scholars and
                    critics whose society he frequented in Rome.</p>
                <p>But though vestiges of Ana may be traced in the classical ages, it is only in
                    modern times that they have come to be regarded as constituting a distinct
                    species of composition, comprising literary anecdotes, critical reflections, and
                    historical incidents, mingled with the detail of <hi rend="italic">bon mots</hi>
                    and ludicrous tales. The term Ana seems to have been applied to such collections
                    as far back as the beginning of the 15 th century. Francesco Barbaro, in a
                    letter to Poggio, says that the information and anecdotes which Poggio and
                    Barthelemi Montepolitiano had picked up during a literary excursion through
                    Germany will be called <hi rend="italic">Ana:</hi> “Quemadmodum mala ab Appio e

                <p>Poggio Bracciolini, to whom this letter is addressed, and to whom the world is
                    indebted for the preservation of so many classical remains, is the first eminent
                    person of modern times whose jests and opinions have been transmitted to
                    posterity. Poggio was secretary to five successive popes. During the pontificate
                    of Martin V., who was chosen in 1417, Poggio and other members of the Roman
                    chancery were in the habit of assembling in a common hall adjoining the Vatican,
                    in order to converse freely on all subjects. Being more studious of wit than of
                    truth, they termed this apartment <hi rend="italic">Buggiale,</hi> a word which
                    Poggio himself interprets <hi rend="italic">Mendaciorum Officina.</hi> Here
                    Poggio and his friends discussed the news and scandal of the day; communicated
                    entertaining anecdotes; attacked what they did not approve (and they approved of
                    little); and indulged in the utmost latitude of satiric remark, not sparing even
                    the pope and cardinals. The jests and stories which occurred in these
                    unrestrained conversations were collected by Poggio, and formed the chief
                    materials of his <hi rend="italic">Facetiae,</hi> first printed, according to De
                    Bure, in 1470. This collection, which forms a principal part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Poggiana,</hi> is chiefly valuable as recording interesting
                    anecdotes of eminent men of the 14th and 15th centuries. It also contains a
                    number of quibbles or <hi rend="italic">jeux</hi><hi rend="italic">de mots,</hi>
                    and a still greater number of idle and licentious stories. Many of these are not
                    original, some of them being taken from ancient authors, and a still greater
                    number from the <hi rend="italic">Fabliaux</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trouveurs.</hi> On the other hand, Poggio has suggested much to succeeding
                    writers. Prior’s <hi rend="italic">Hans Carvel</hi> and several of Fontaine’s
                    fables are from stories originally related by Poggio. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Facetiae</hi> forms, upon the whole, the most amusing and interesting part of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Poggiana</hi> printed at Amsterdam in 1720; but this
                    collection also comprehends additional anecdotes of Poggio’s life, and a few
                    extracts from his graver compositions.</p>
                <p>Though Poggio was the first person whose remarks and <hi rend="italic">bon
                    mots</hi> were collected under the name of Ana, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sca-ligerana,</hi> which contains the opinions of Joseph Scaliger, was the
                    first work <hi rend="italic">published</hi> under that appellation, and
                    accordingly may be regarded as having led the way to that class of publications.
                    There are two collections of Scaligerana—the <hi rend="italic">Prima</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Secunda.</hi> The first was compiled by a physician named
                    Francis Vertunien, Sieur de Lavau, who attended a family with whom Joseph
                    Scaliger resided. He, in consequence, had frequent opportunities of meeting the
                    celebrated critic, and was in the custom of committing to writing the
                    observations which dropped from him in the course of conversation, to which he
                    occasionally added remarks of his own. This collection, which was chiefly Latin,
                    remained in manuscript many years after the death of the compiler. It was at
                    length purchased by Μ. de Sigogne, who published it in 1669, under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Prima</hi><hi rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nusquam antehac edita,</hi> calling it <hi rend="italic">prima</hi> in order to
                    preserve its claim of priority over another <hi rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi>
                    which, though published three years before, had been more recently compiled.
                    This second work, known as <hi rend="italic">Secunda</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Scaligerana,</hi> was collected by two brothers of the name of Vassan, students
                    of the university of Leyden, of which Scaliger was one of the professors. Being
                    particularly recommended to Scaliger, they were received in his house, and
                    enjoyed his conversation. Writing down what they had heard, particularly on
                    historical and critical subjects, they soon made up a large manuscript volume,
                    in which, however, there was neither connection nor arrangement of any
                    description. After passing through various hands, this manuscript came into the
                    possession of Μ. Daillé, who for his own use arranged <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >id</hi> alphabetical order the articles which it contained. Isaac Vossius,
                    obtaining the manuscript in loan from Μ. Daillé, transcribed it, and afterwards
                    published it at the Hague, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scaligerana,</hi><hi rend="italic">sive Excerpta</hi><hi rend="italic">ex Ore
                    Josephi Scaligeri.</hi> This edition was full of inaccuracies and blunders, and
                    a more correct impression was afterwards published by Μ. Daillé, with a preface
                    complaining of the use that Vossius had made of the manuscript, which he
                    declares was never intended for publication, and was not of a nature to be given
                    to the world. Indeed, most literary men in that age conceived that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi> particularly the <hi rend="italic">second,</hi>
                    detracted considerably from the reputation of the great scholar. Joseph
                    Scaliger, with more extensive erudition, but, as some think, less genius than
                    his father Julius Caesar Scaliger, had inherited his vanity and dogmatical
                    spirit Conversing with two young students, he would probably be but little
                    cautious in the opinions he expressed, as his literary errors could not be
                    detected or exposed. Unfortunately the blind admiration of his pupils led them
                    to regard his opinions as the responses of an oracle, and his most unmerited
                    censures as just condemnations. The <hi rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi>
                    accordingly, contains many falsehoods, with much unworthy personal abuse of the
                    most distinguished characters of the age.</p>
                <p>In imitation of the <hi rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi> a prodigious number of
                    similar works appeared in France towards the end of the 17th and beginning of
                    the 18 th century. At first these collections were confined to what had fallen
                    from eminent men in conversation; but they were afterwards made to embrace
                    fragments found among their papers, and even passages extracted from their works
                    and correspondence. Of those which merely record the conversations of eminent
                    men, the best known and most valuable is the <hi rend="italic">Menagiana.</hi>
                    Gilles Ménage was a person of good sense, of various and extensive information,
                    and of a most communicative disposition. For a long period an assembly of
                    literary men met once a week at his house; and during his later years he daily
                    received critics and scholars as visitors. Much of his time was thus spent in
                    conversation; and his habitual associates were at pains to record his opinions,
                    which were generally founded on a correct taste and judgment, and -were always
                    delivered in an interesting and lively manner. A collection of his oral opinions
                    was published in 1693, soon after his death; and this collection, which was
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Menagiana,</hi> was afterwards corrected and enlarged
                    by Μ. la Monnoye, in an edition published by him in 1715.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Perroniana,</hi> which exhibits the opinions of Cardinal du
                    Perron, was compiled from his conversation by Μ. de Puy, and published by
                    Vossius, by the same contrivance which put him in possession of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scaligerana.</hi> Some parts of this collection are useful in
                    illustrating the literary and ecclesiastical history of the age in which Du
                    Perron lived; but it contains many puerile, imprudent, and absurd remarks, many
                    of them the interpolations of his friends. The <hi rend="italic">Thuana,</hi> or
                    observations of the president De Thou, have usually been published along with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Perroniana.</hi> This collection is not extensive, and by
                    no means of sueb value as might have been expected from a man so able and
                    distinguished.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Valesiana</hi> is a collection of the literary opinions of
                    the historiographer Adrian de Valois, published by his son. Μ. de Valois was a
                    great student of history, and the <hi rend="italic">Valesiana</hi> accordingly
                    comprehends many valuable historical observations, particularly on the works of
                    Du Cange.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Fureteriana</hi> (1696) contains the <hi rend="italic">bon
                    mots of</hi> Μ. Furetière of the French Academy, the stories which he was in the
                    habit of telling, and a number of anecdotes and remarks found in his papers
                    after his decease. This production<pb break="no"

                    or criticisms on books, consisting chiefly of short stories, and containing
                    numerous allusions to a violent quarrel he had with the French Academy, of which
                    he was a member, concerning his <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Universel de la
                    Langue Française.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chevroeana</hi> (2 vols. 8vo, 1700), so called from Μ.
                    Chevreau, exhibits more research than most works of a similar description, and
                    is probably more accurate, as it differs from the Ana proper, of which the works
                    described above are instances, in having been published during the life of the
                    author, and revised by himself. Among other interesting articles, it contains a
                    learned and ingenious commentary on the works of Malherbe, to whom the French
                    language and poetry were greatly indebted for their perfection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Parrhasiana</hi> (Amst., 2 vols. 8vo, 1699-1701) is the work of
                    Jean le Clerc, a professor of Amsterdam, who bestowed this appellation on his
                    miscellaneous productions with the view of discussing various topics of
                    philosophy and politics with more freedom than he could have employed under his
                    own name. This work is not of the light and unconnected description of most of
                    the Ana which have been above enumerated, as it contains much learned
                    philological disquisition, and a long dissertation on poetry and eloquence. In
                    the first volume there is a list of his published works, and a bitter reply to
                    all who had censured them. .;</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Huetiana</hi> contains the detached thoughts and criticisms
                    of Huet, bishop of Avranches, which he himself committed to writing when he was
                    far advanced in life. Huet was born in 1630, and in 1712 he was attacked by a
                    malady which impaired his memory, and rendered him incapable of the sustained
                    attention necessary for the completion of a long or laborious work. In this
                    situation he employed himself in putting his detached observations on paper.
                    These were published by the Abbé d’Olivet the year after his death (1722), under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Huetiana,</hi> —a work which is not, like some
                    other Ana, a succession of <hi rend="italic">bon mots</hi> or anecdotes, but
                    forms a series of thoughts and criticisms on various topics of morals,
                    philosophy, and literature. One of the most instructive discussions to a
                    scholar, in this collection, is that on the Latinisation of names and surnames.
                    His critical judgments on Montaigne, Rochefoucauld, and Tacitus are valuable.
                    But were there no other literary memorials of the bishop of Avranches, he
                    certainly would not derive high reputation from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Huetiana.</hi> It was not, indeed, to be expected from the circumstances in
                    which the articles were composed, that they should always display that correct
                    judgment which distinguishes many of the other works of this learned writer.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Casauboniana</hi> presents us with the miscellaneous
                    observations, chiefly philological, of the celebrated Isaac Casaubon. During the
                    course of a long life that eminent commentator was in the daily practice of
                    committing to paper anything remarkable which he heard in conversation with his
                    friends, especially if it bore on the studies in which he was engaged. He also
                    made annotations from day to day on the works he read, with which he connected
                    his judgments concerning the authors and their writings. This compilation, which
                    was styled <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides,</hi> together with his <hi
                    rend="italic">Adversaria,</hi> and materials amassed for a refutation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Annals of Baronius,</hi> were bequeathed by his son
                    Meric Casaubon to the Bodleian library at Oxford. These were shown to
                    Christopher Wolfius during a visit which he paid to that university; and having
                    been transcribed by him, were published in 1710 under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Casauboniana.</hi> This collection consists of opinions concerning
                    various eminent writers, illustrations of passages of Scripture, and
                    philological observations and animadversions on the first thirty-four years of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Baronius.</hi> The materials and information
                    which it contains are probably more accurate than is usually the case in works
                    of the same description, as they were not reported by others, but were committed
                    to writing by Casaubon himself while the works on which he commented remained
                    fresh in his recollection.</p>
                <p>Besides the above a great many works, under the title of Ana, appeared in France
                    about the same period. Thus, the opinions and conversation of Charpentier,
                    Colomesius, and St Evremond were recorded in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carpenteriana, Colomesiana,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">St Evremoniana;</hi> and
                    those of Segrais in the <hi rend="italic">Segraisiana, —</hi> a collection
                    formed by a person stationed behind the tapestry in a house where Segrais was
                    accustomed to visit, of which Voltaire declared, “que de tous les Ana c’est
                    celui qui merite le plus d’être mis au rang des mensonges imprimés, et surtout
                    des mensonges insipides.” The Ana, indeed, from the popularity which they now
                    enjoyed, were compiled in such numbers and with so little care that they became
                    almost proverbial for inaccuracy. About the middle of the 18th century, too,
                    they were sometimes made the vehicles of revolutionary and heretical opinions.
                    Thus the evil naturally began to cure itself, and by a reaction the French A.na
                    sunk in public esteem as much below their intrinsic value as they had formerly
                    been exalted above it.</p>
                <p>Of the examples England has produced of this species of composition, perhaps the
                    most interesting is the <hi rend="italic">Wal-poliana,</hi> a transcript of the
                    literary conversation of Horace Walpole, Earl of Orford. That multifarious
                    author spent a great portion of his time in conversation, and, possessing
                    opportunities of information enjoyed by few, was distinguished for his resources
                    of anecdote, wit, and judicious remark. It was suggested to him that he ought to
                    form a collection of anecdotes and observations, but this he declined,
                    furnishing, however, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Walpoliana</hi> with
                    many anecdotes in his own handwriting. After his death several specimens of this
                    miscellany were published in the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Magazine;</hi> and
                    being afterwards enlarged by the recollections of the editor and the
                    communications of others, were published in two volumes under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Walpoliana.</hi> Most other works which in this country have been
                    published under the name of <hi rend="italic">Ana,</hi> as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Baconiana</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> γ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Atterburyana, &amp;c.,</hi> are rather extracts from the writings and
                    correspondence of eminent men than memorials of their conversation.</p>
                <p>There are some works which, though they do not bear the title, belong more
                    strictly to the class of Ana than many of the collections which are known under
                    that appellation. Such are the <hi rend="italic">Melanges d’Histoire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et de Littérature,</hi> published under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Vigneul Marυille,</hi> though the work of a Benedictine,
                    D’Argonne; and the <hi rend="italic">Locorum Communium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Collectanea, ex</hi><hi rend="italic">Lectionibus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philippi Melanchthonis,</hi> —a work of considerable reputation on account of
                    its theological learning, and the information it communicates concerning the
                    early state of the Reformed Church. But of those productions which belong to the
                    class, though they do not bear the name, of Ana, the most celebrated are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Colloquia Mensalia</hi> of Luther and Selden’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Table-Talk.</hi> The former, which comprehends the conversation of Luther with
                    his friends and coadjutors in the great work of the Reformation, was first
                    published in 1566. Captain Bell, who translated it into English in the time of
                    the Commonwealth, informs us that, an edict having been promulgated commanding
                    the works of Luther to be destroyed, it was for some time supposed that all the
                    copies of the <hi rend="italic">Colloquia Mensalia</hi> had been burned; but in
                    1626, on the foundation of a house being removed, a printed copy was found lying
                    in a deep hole, and wrapped up in a linen <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n829/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0829-0786"/> cloth. The book translated by Bell, and again by
                    the younger Hazlitt in 1847, is said to have been originally collected by Dr
                    Anthony Lauterbach, “out of the holy mouth of Luther." It consists chiefly of
                    observations and discussions on idolatry, auricular confession, the mass,
                    excommunication, clerical jurisdiction, general councils, and all the points
                    agitated by the Reformed Church in those early periods. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Table-Talk</hi> of Selden contains a more genuine and undisguised expression of
                    the sentiments of that eminent man than we find in his more studied productions.
                    It was published after his death by Bichard Milward, his amanuensis, who affirms
                    that for twenty years he enjoyed the opportunity of daily hearing his discourse,
                    and made it his practice faithfully to commit to writing “the excellent things
                    that usually fell from him." The work contains, along with much of a lighter
                    kind, many curious facts and opinions concerning the political and
                    ecclesiastical history of the interesting period during which Selden lived, and
                    in the important events of which he bore a considerable share. The style of
                    Selden, in most of the works published under his own care, is harsh and obscure;
                    but Clarendon describes him as “a clear dis-courser, possessed of the faculty of
                    making difficult things easy, and presenting them clearly to the understanding.”
                    This talent for elucidation shines chiefly in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Table-Talk,</hi> which is filled with the stores of his extensive reading,
                    delivered without any pretensions to that order and method the want of which has
                    been attributed to his other productions. Many more recent works, under such
                    titles as <hi rend="italic">Literary Remains, Table-Talk,</hi> &amp;c., partake
                    more or less of the nature of Ana, but do not call for separate notice.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable collection of Ana in the English language—and, indeed, in any
                    language—is to be found in a work which does not correspond to the normal type
                    either in name or in form. In his <hi rend="italic">Life of Samuel Johnson,
                    LL.D.,</hi> Boswell relates that to his remark, <hi rend="italic">à propos</hi>
                    of French literature, “Their Ana are good,” Johnson replied, “A few of them are
                    good; but we have one book of that kind better than any of them—Selden’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Table-Talk.”</hi> Boswell’s own work is incomparably superior to
                    all. In worth as a book this has been rated, on the high authority of Carlyle,
                    beyond any other product of the 18th century, and the value it has depends
                    mainly on its Ana. Its interest arises, not from the details it furnishes of the
                    events of Dr Johnson’s career, still less from any attempt at a discriminating
                    estimate of his work and character, but from the graphic representation it gives
                    of his habitual manner of life and speech. The innate greatness of Johnson
                    appears, more than in all his writings, in his portrait, delineated with the
                    exactness of a sharply-defined photograph, as he appeared to the eyes of his
                    admiring biographer in his daily <hi rend="italic">dishabille.</hi></p>
                <p>Wolfius has given a history of the Ana in a preliminary discourse to his edition
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Casauboniana,</hi> published in 1710. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Répertoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de Bibliographies</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Spéciales, Curieuses, et Instructives,</hi> by Peignot, there is a
                    <hi rend="italic">Notice</hi><hi rend="italic">Bibliographique</hi> of these
                    collections; but many of the books there enumerated consist of mere extracts
                    from the writings of popular authors.</p>
