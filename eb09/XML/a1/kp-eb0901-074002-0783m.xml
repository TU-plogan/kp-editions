                    and one of the chief gods of the country. His name meant the hidden or concealed
                    god, and in this respect was analogous to <hi rend="italic">Hapi</hi> or Apis,
                    which conveyed the same idea. He was tho local deity of Thebes or Diospolis, and
                    supposed by the Greeks to be the same as Zeus or Jupiter. His type was that of a
                    man wearing on his head the red crown <hi rend="italic">teshr,</hi> emblem of
                    dominion over the lower world or hemisphere, surmounted by the sun’s disc to
                    indicate his solar nature, flanked by two tail feathers of a hawk, also
                    symbolical of his relation to the gods of light. Ammon was not one of the oldest
                    deities of Egypt, for his form and name do not appear till the eleventh or
                    Diospolitan dynasty, when the kings of that line assumed his name, and built a
                    sanctuary to him at Medinat Habu. From this period the monarchs of Thebes
                    introduced his name into their titles, and the worship of Amen became the
                    predominant one of ancient Egypt; and the embellishment of his shrine and
                    enrichment of his treasury were the chief object of the policy of the Pharaohs.
                    Victory and conquest were the chief gifts he offered to his adorers; and he is
                    often seen leading up the conquered nations of the north and south to the
                    monarchs whom he endows with power and victory. In this character Amen is often
                    represented holding the Egyptian scimitar <hi rend="italic">khepsh.</hi> In his
                    celestial character his flesh was coloured blue, that of the heaven. He is said
                    to have been called on some monuments the son of Hapimaa(or the Nile); but in
                    the hymns addressed to him the title of self-engendered is applied to him, and
                    he was one of the self-existent deities. His principal titles are—lord of the
                    heaven, king of the gods, substance of the world, and resident on the thrones of
                    the world, eternal ruler,—appellatives of his celestial and terrestrial
                    functions. He was also lord of heaven and earth, streams and hills, and as a
                    demiurgos, the creator of beings. The hymns addressed to him designate him as
                    the sole or only god, in terms applicable to one god who alone exists, who
                    moulds and governs the world. At one time an attempt was made to identify him
                    with the solar orb. Considered as the active, intelligent, and pervading spirit
                    of the universe, he transfuses the breath of life into the nostrils of kings and
                    other persons. In his solar characters, Ammon was allied with Ra, and called
                    Amen Ra, or Amen Ra Harmachis, or “the sun in the horizon,” Amen being
                    considered one of the forms of the sun itself. The worship of the celestial
                    Ammon prevailed chiefly at Thebes, where, with the Mut, or “mother” goddess, and
                    his son Khonsu or Chons, he formed the Theban triad, and the sacred name of
                    Thebes was “the abode of Amen.” Besides Thebes, his worship has been found at
                    Siuah in Lybia, at Beit Oually, and at Meroe in Ethiopia, marked respect being
                    shown to his worship by the later Ethiopian monarchs. At Philae and Debud his
                    name also appears as one of the dominant deities. In the representations at
                    Hermonthis he assists at the birth of Har-pa-Ra; and in the scenes of the
                    passage of Ra, or the sun, through the hours of the night, the gigantic arm of
                    Amen strangles the serpent Apophis, “the great dragon” of Egyptian mythology,
                    the spirit of darkness, who warred against the gods of light. Another of the
                    types of Amen represents him as the reproductive power of nature, still in the
                    human form, but mummied, and holding—instead of the usual sceptre, <hi
                    rend="italic">uasm,</hi> or so-called <hi rend="italic">kukupha</hi> sceptre—the
                    whip <hi rend="italic">nekhekh.</hi> In this type he was supposed to be Amen the
                    father and Horus the child of the triad, which then consisted of Amen, Ament, or
                    the female Ammon, and Harka. His titles in this character are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amen-ka-mut-f,—</hi> Amen, “the husband of his mother,” considered as the final
                    avatar of the god, the alpha and omega, the oldest and youngest of created
                    beings. He is, considered in his youthful character, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >IIarnekht,</hi> or “the powerful Horus,” and identified with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khons,</hi> the local god of Chemmo or Panopolis. As Horus he is called the
                    “son of Isis,” but this is clearly a later fusion of the two myths. In the
                    inscriptions it is said “he has tall plumes,” and in the esoterical explanations
                    of the seventeenth chapter of the <hi rend="italic">Ritual,</hi> these plumes
                    are explained by “his two eyes,” or Isis and Nephthys, who are seen accompanying
                    Horus in certain scenes. This type of Amen was not usually exhibited, but
                    brought out on the occasion of his festival, called the manifestation of Khem,
                    one of the oldest fêtes of Egypt. This type of Amen is principally found at the
                    Ruan, or valley of El Hammamat, on the way to Coptos; and at Wady Haifa, where a
                    temple was erected to him by Amenophis III. As the god of the reproductive
                    powers of nature, the kings of Egypt are seen hoeing the ground before him, or
                    offering various coloured calves and gazelles to him. A great festival in his
                    honour is represented at Medinat Habu, where his statue is carried by twenty
                    priests, and Rameses III. cuts down before him the corn which.has just ripened
                    for the sickle. The negroes of Arabia, or else the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Regio</hi><hi rend="italic">Barbarica</hi> of later geographers, appear as
                    assistants at this festival. Another type of Amen connected him with the god
                    Khnum or Chnoumis, the spirit of the waters. In this relation he has the head of
                    a ram instead of the usual human one. Khnum was one of the demiurgi, and creator
                    of mankind, whom he had made as a potter out of clay on· the wheel, as also
                    Osiris and Horus. Sometimes the type of Khnum bears the name of Amen; and with
                    the ram ’ s head he was worshipped in the Oasis of Ammon, as also up the Nile at
                    the cataracts, Syene, Elephantine, Beghe, Beit Oually, and Meroe. It is this
                    type of Amen with which the later Greek and Roman writers were most familiar;
                    and RamesQS II., as the son of Amen, assumes the ram’s horn, which Alexander the
                    Great adopted at a later date. The worship of Khnum was older than that of Amen,
                    as it appears on the Pyramids and at the Wady Magaresh, but became less
                    important, and finally fused into that of Amen. Although it has been supposed
                    that the worship of Amen came from Meroe, it is now known that the Ethiopian
                    civilisation was comparatively of much more recent date than the Egyptian, and
                    that it was implanted in Ethiopia by the conquests of the Pharaohs, and
                    subsequently adopted by the later rulers of Meroe; and that the statements of
                    Herodotus, that it was brought from thence to the Oasis of Ammon are incorrect,
                    the existing temple at the Oasis <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n784/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0784-0741"/> not being older than the Persian rulers of Egypt,
                    while the worship of the god at Thebes dates from a much older epoch. The later
                    chapters of the <hi rend="italic">Ritual,</hi> added at the time of the
                    twentieth dynasty, which contain the mystic names and appellatives of the god in
                    the language of the negroes of Punt, are also of too late a date to throw any
                    light on the origin of Amen, which appears prior to the Hykshos, when the
                    Egyptian princes were driven to the south. The sheep was sacred to the god, and
                    the inhabitants of Thebes in consequence abstained from it; but it is said they
                    annually sacrificed a ram to Amen, and dressed the figure of the god in the hide
                    of the animal. The reasons assigned by classical authorities for this action, as
                    well as for the astronomical meaning of his horns, are not confirmed by
                    monumental evidence. On the conquest of Egypt Alexander the Great called himself
                    the son of Ammon, and his portraits wear the ram’s horn. In this he had only
                    imitated the Pharaohs of the nineteenth dynasty. Amen is only mentioned by the
                    Hebrew prophets in speaking of Diospolis as the city of No or No Amon.</p>
