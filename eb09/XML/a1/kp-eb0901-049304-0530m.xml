                    time its capital, was situated on the Mediterranean, 12 miles west of the
                    Canopic mouth of the Nile, in 31° 11' N. lat., and 29° 52' E. long. The ancient
                    city was oblong in form, with a length from east to west of 3 to 4, a breadth
                    from north to south of 1, and, according to Pliny, a circumference of 15 miles.
                    Lake Mareotis bathed its walls on the south, and the Mediterranean on the north;
                    on the west was the Necropolis, and on the east the Hippodrome. The city was
                    laid out in straight parallel streets, one of which, about 200 feet wide, ran
                    westward from the Canopic gate to the Necropolis. This street was decorated with
                    magnificent houses, temples, and public buildings, and <pb break="no"

                    and magnificence, running from south to north. Ancient Alexandria was divided
                    into three regions: (1.) The <hi rend="italic">Regio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Judoeorum,</hi> or the Jews’ quarter, forming the north-east portion of the
                    city. (2.) <hi rend="italic">Rhacotis</hi> on the west, occupied chiefly by
                    Egyptians. Its principal building was the Serapeum, or temple of Serapis,
                    containing an image of the god, brought probably from Pontus. A large part of
                    the famous library of Alexandria was placed in the Serapeum. (3.) <hi
                    rend="italic">Bruchewm,</hi> the Royal or Greek quarter, forming the remaining
                    and most magnificent portion of the city In the Brucheum were the chief public
                    buildings of Alexandria, the most noted of which was the splendid palace of the
                    Ptolemies, on a peninsula called the Lochias, which stretched out into the
                    Mediterranean towards the east of the city; the library proper, and the museum,
                    a sort of college, with a dining-hall and lecture-rooms for the professors (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Library)</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">Coesarium,</hi> or
                    temple of the Caesars, where divine honours were paid to the emperors; and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dicasterium,</hi> or court of justice. An artificial mole,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Heptastadium,</hi> nearly a mile in length,
                    stretched from the continent to the isle of Pharos. Between this mole and the
                    peninsula of Lochias was the greater harbour; on the other side of the mole was
                    the harbour called <hi rend="italic">Eunostos,</hi> or Safe Return. The two were
                    connected with each other by two breaks in the mole, crossed by two bridges,
                    which could be raised at pleasure. Within the harbour of Eunostos was an
                    artificial basin called <hi rend="italic">Kibotos, i.e.,</hi> the Chest,
                    communicating with lake Mareotis by a canal, from which a separate arm stretched
                    eastward to the Canopic mouth of the Nile. On the eastern point of the island of
                    Pharos was the famous lighthouse, said to have been 400 feet high. It was begun
                    by Ptolemy Soter, and finished by his successor, Philadelphus. It cost 800
                    talents, which, if Alexandrian, is equivalent to £248,000. In the time of
                    Diodorus Siculus (50 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> the population of
                    Alexandria was estimated at 300,000 freemen, with probably at least as many
                    slaves.</p>
                <p>The city was founded by Alexander the Great 332 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi>
                    but the island of Pharos was from an early period a refuge of Greek and
                    Phoenician sea-rovers, a fact commemorated in the name “Pirates’ Bay,” given to
                    a deep indentation on the north side of the island; and on the mainland was the
                    little town of Rhacotis, subsequently incorporated in the quarter of that name.
                    The architect employed by Alexander was the celebrated Dinocrates, who had
                    acquired a high reputation by rebuilding the temple of Diana at Ephesus. The new
                    city prospered greatly as a centre both of commerce and of learning,
                    particularly during the reigns of the earlier Ptolemies, to whose enlightened
                    liberality, indeed, its literary importance was largely due. But the later
                    monarchs of the house of Lagus were mostly weak and vicious men, under whom the
                    city declined in influence. In 80 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Ptolemy
                    Alexander bequeathed his city to the Romans; but the bequest did not immediately
                    take effect owing to the civil convulsions in Italy, into which Alexandria
                    itself was eventually drawn, and it was not until 30 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> that the city submitted to Augustus. It was by him made an imperial
                    city, governed by a prefect appointed by the emperor, while the functions of the
                    Alexandrian senate were suspended, a state of matters which continued until 196
                    A.D., when Severus restored its municipality.</p>
                <p>Alexandria seems from this time to have regained its old prosperity, becoming an
                    important granary of Rome, which, doubtless, was one of the chief reasons that
                    induced Augustus to place it directly under the imperial power. In 215 A.D. the
                    emperor Caracalla visited the city; and, in order to repay some insulting
                    satires that the inhabitants had made upon him, he commanded his troops to put
                    to death all youths capable of bearing arms. This brutal order seems to have
                    been carried out even beyond the letter, for a general massacre was the result.
                    Notwithstanding this terrible disaster, Alexandria soon recovered its former
                    splendour, and for a time was esteemed the first city in the world after Rome.
                    As the power of the Caesars decreased, however, their hold over Alexandria was
                    weakened, and the city itself suffered from internal commotions and
                    insurrections, which gradually destroyed its importance. In 616 it was taken by
                    Chosroes, king of Persia; and in 640 by the Arabians, under Amru, after a siege
                    that lasted fourteen months, during which Herac-lius, the emperor of
                    Constantinople, did not send a single ship to its assistance. Notwithstanding
                    the losses that the city had sustained, Amru was able to write to his master,
                    the caliph Omar, that he had taken a city containing “4000 palaces, 4000 baths,
                    12,000 dealers in fresh oil, 12,000 gardeners, 40,000 Jews who pay tribute, 400
                    theatres or places of amusement.” The following story, relating to the
                    destruction of the library, is told by Abulfaragius :—John the Grammarian, a
                    famous Peripatetic philosopher, being in Alexandria at the time of its capture,
                    and in high favour with Amru, begged that he would give him the royal library.
                    Amru told him that it was not in his power to grant such a request, but promised
                    to write to the caliph for his consent. Omar, on hearing the request of his
                    general, is said to have replied that if those books contained the same doctrine
                    with the Koran, they could be of no use, since the Koran contained all necessary
                    truths; but if they contained anything contrary to that book, they ought to be
                    destroyed; and therefore, whatever their contents were, he ordered them to be
                    burnt. Pursuant to this order, they were distributed among the public baths, of
                    which there was a large number in the city, where, for six months, they served
                    to supply the fires. Shortly after its capture, Alexandria again fell into the
                    hands of the Greeks, who took advantage of Amru’s absence with the greater
                    portion of his army. On hearing what had happened, however, Amru returned, and
                    quickly regained possession of the city. About the year 646 Amru was deprived of
                    his government by the caliph Oth-man. The Egyptians, by whom Amru was greatly
                    beloved, were so much dissatisfied by this act, and even showed such a tendency
                    to revolt, that Constantine, the Greek emperor, determined to make an effort to
                    reduce Alexandria. The attempt proved perfectly successful, Manuel,
                    Constantine’s general, capturing the city with inconsiderable loss. The caliph,
                    perceiving his mistake, immediately restored Amru, who, on his arrival in Egypt,
                    drove the Greeks within the walls of Alexandria, but was only able to capture
                    the city after a most obstinate resistance by the defenders. This so exasperated
                    him that he completely demolished its fortifications, although he seems to have
                    spared the lives of the inhabitants as far as lay in his power. Alexandria now
                    rapidly declined in importance. It was captured by Andalusian adventurers in
                    823; by the Moghrebins in 924, and again in 928. The building of Cairo in 969,
                    and, above all, the discovery of the route to the East by the Cape of Good Hope
                    in 1497, nearly ruined its commerce; and after this we hear little of the city
                    until the beginning of the present century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alexandria,</hi> the modern city, stands partly on what was
                    the island of Pharos, now a peninsula, but mostly on the isthmus by which it is
                    connected with the mainland. This was originally an artificial dyke connecting
                    the island with the land opposite; but, through the constant accumulation of
                    soil and ruins, it has attained its present dimensions. The principal public and
                    government buildings are on the peninsula. The ancient city was situated on the
                    mainland, adjacent to the modem town, and the extent of the ruins that still
                    exist sufficiently attests its <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0532-0495"/> greatness. The general appearance of Alexandria
                    is by no means striking; and from its situation its environs are sandy, flat,
                    and sterile. It was formerly surrounded by strong turreted walls, with extensive
                    outworks,' but in various parts the walls have lately been destroyed to make way
                    for improvements. In the Turkish quarter the streets are narrow, irregular, and
                    filthy, and the houses mean and ill-built. The Frank quarter, on the other hand,
                    presents the appearance of a European town, having handsome streets and squares,
                    and excellent shops. The streets have been much improved lately by being nearly
                    all paved. The principal hotels, shops, and offices are situated in the Great
                    Square, the centre of which forms a very agreeable promenade, being planted with
                    trees, and well provided with seats. It has also a fountain at each end. In the
                    suburbs are numerous handsome villas, with pleasant gardens. Among the principal
                    public buildings are the palace of the pasha, the naval arsenal, the naval and
                    military hospitals, custom-house, bourse, two theatres, several mosques,
                    churches, convents, &amp;c. There is an important naval school, and a number of
                    other educational institutions. Among the charities worthy of mention is the
                    hospital of the Deaconesses of Kaisersworth. Formerly the town was supplied with
                    water by means of the ancient reservoirs formed under the old city, which are in
                    many cases as perfect now as when first made, 2000 years ago. These were
                    annually filled with water by means of the canal from the Nile, at the time of
                    inundation; but a system of water-works has been formed by a public company, and
                    a constant supply of water is now obtained from the canal at some distance from
                    the town. The principal streets, squares, and railway stations, are lighted with
                    gas.</p>
                <p>Few of the remains of the ancient city are now visible. Most of those that were
                    to be seen a few years ago have since disappeared, but frequently in making
                    excavations portions of ancient masonry, broken columns, and fragments of
                    statues are discovered. Among the best known of the ancient relics are the two
                    obelisks commonly called “Cleopatra’s Needles.” They were originally brought
                    from Heliopolis to Alexandria in the reign of Tiberius, and were set up in front
                    of the temple of Caesar. They are of red granite, and covered with
                    hieroglyphics. One is still standing, and is 71 feet high and 7 feet 7 inches in
                    diameter at the base. The other, which is fallen and covered with debris, is in
                    a less perfect state, and not quite so long as the former. It was offered to the
                    English government by Mehemet Ali, but after some consideration was declined.
                    Near the obelisks are the ruins of an old round tower, commonly called the
                    “Roman Tower.” But the most striking of the ancient monuments is the column
                    styled “Pompey’s Pillar.” It stands on a mound of earth about 40 feet high, and
                    has a height of 98 feet 9 inches. The shaft consists of a single piece of red
                    granite, and is 73 feet long and 29 feet 8 inches in circumference. The capital
                    is Corinthian, 9 feet high, and the base is a square of about 15 feet on each
                    side. From an inscription it appears to have been erected in honour of the
                    emperor Diocletian, and it was formerly surmounted by a statue of that monarch.
                    To the S.W. of the city are the catacombs, which served for the burial of the
                    dead, and are formed by excavations in the calcareous rock of which the shore is
                    composed. They are of great extent, and one of the chambers is remarkable for
                    its elegance. The climate of Alexandria is mild and salubrious. The heats of
                    summer are modified by the N.W. winds from the sea, which prevail during nine
                    months of the year, the thermometer seldom rising above 85° Fahr. In winter a
                    good deal of rain falls, and throughout the year the atmosphere is generally
                    moist, being saturated with a saline vapour from the sea.</p>
                <p>Alexandria has been mainly indebted for its prosperity to the advantages of its
                    position for trade. It was this that first attracted the attention of its
                    far-seeing founder to the site, and its subsequent history in no way belied his
                    penetration. It soon rose to be the most important commercial city in the world,
                    and the great emporium of trade between Europe and the East. Subsequently its
                    fortunes fluctuated with those of its possessors, but the great blow to its
                    prosperity was the discovery of the route to India by the Cape of Good Hope, and
                    under the Turks it sank into insignificance, numbering only about 6000
                    inhabitants. Soon after Mehemet Ali became ruler of Egypt he turned his
                    attention to the restoration of Alexandria. One of the most important works that
                    he effected with this view was the opening of the Mahmoudieh Canal in 1820. This
                    was accomplished at a cost of about £300,000, and, for want of proper
                    management, at a melancholy loss of human life. It is about 50 miles in length,
                    with an average width of about 100 feet, and communicates with the Rosetta
                    branch of the Nile at the village of Atfeh. Since Alexandria became the centre
                    of the steam communication between Europe and India, and the principal station
                    on the Overland Route, its progress has been rapid. It has now regular
                    communication with England, Marseilles, Brindisi, Constantinople, &amp;c. In
                    1851 Mr Stephenson was instructed to form a railway between Alexandria and
                    Cairo, which was accomplished, and the line opened for traffic, in 1856. This
                    was shortly afterwards extended to Suez, and several extensions have since been
                    made to the cotton districts of the Delta. A short line of railway (not
                    belonging to the government) connects the town with Ramleh, a sea-bathing
                    village about 7 miles distant.</p>
                <p>Alexandria has two ports, an eastern and a western. The latter, called also the
                    Old Port, is by far the larger and better of the two. It extends from the town
                    westward to Marabout, nearly 6 miles, and is about a mile and a-half in width.
                    It has three principal entrances. The first, or that nearest the city, has about
                    17 feet of water, but is narrow and difficult of access, and only used by small
                    vessels and boats. The second or middle, which is also the principal entrance,
                    is about a quarter of a mile wide, and has, where shallowest, 27 feet of water.
                    The eastern side of this entrance is marked by buoys, and there are landmarks
                    for guiding to the channel. The third or western entrance has its western
                    boundary about three-eighths<pb break="no"

                    mile wide, and has from 25 to 27 feet of water where shallowest. Within the
                    harbour ships may anchor close to the town in from 22 to 40 feet of water.
                    Further improvements, in course of construction by a firm of English contractors
                    (at a cost to the Egyptian government of little short of two millions sterling),
                    will eventually render this one of the finest and most capacious harbours on the
                    Mediterranean. Among these are the formation of a breakwater, extending in a
                    south-westerly direction parallel to the shore for 2550 yards south-west of the
                    lighthouse on Cape Eunostos; a mole, springing from the shore, and extending in
                    a northerly direction for 1100 yards, and having a width of about 100 feet; and
                    the construction of nearly 3 miles of quays and wharves, for vessels of the
                    largest size, and with railway connection. The foundation-stone of the
                    breakwater was laid by the viceroy on 15th May 1871. The area of deep water, 30
                    feet and upwards, enclosed within the outer breakwater, is 1400 acres; the area
                    of 28 feet of water, enclosed by the harbour mole, will be 177 acres. The
                    workshops of the company are at the quarries of Mex, about 3 miles west of the
                    town. In the harbour is a magnificent floating dock, nearly 500 feet long and
                    100 feet broad. The old lighthouse, on the site of the ancient Pharos, having
                    been found insufficient, a new lighthouse has been erected on Ras-el-teen
                    (1842), bearing a one-minute revolving light, visible at a distance of 20 miles.
                    The eastern or new port, formerly the only port open to Christians, is now
                    little used, being exposed to the northerly gales, and having very limited space
                    for anchorage.</p>
                <p>In 1861 the total value of the exports was £2,638,822; and in 1871 this had risen
                    to £10,251,608, of which £7,706,442 was to England. The value of the imports for
                    the latter year was £5,753,020, of which £2,469,026 was from England. The
                    principal articles of export were cotton (£6,402,756), cotton seed (£1,008,278),
                    beans (£753,462), corn (£573,766), sugar (£379,456), gums (£307,932), coffee
                    (£122,110), ivory, wool, linseed, senna, and other drugs. The principal articles
                    of import were manufactured goods (£1,695,870), wool (£307,495), oils
                    (£251,158), wines and liqueurs (£239,944), raw silk, fruits. During that year
                    there entered 1841 sailing vessels and 883 steam vessels with cargoes, and 143
                    sailing vessels and 54 steam vessels in ballast; and there left 1085 sailing
                    vessels and 843 steam vessels with cargoes, and 797 sailing vessels and 62 steam
                    vessels in ballast. The total tonnage of the vessels that entered was 1,262,602;
                    and that left, 1,267,381. The opening of the Suez Canal will no doubt serve to
                    withdraw a portion of the traffic from Alexandria, but the improvements that are
                    now being made on its harbour, and its direct railway communication with Suez,
                    must still give it certain advantages over the other route, while it must
                    continue to be the great emporium for the rapidly extending trade of Egypt
                    itself.</p>
                <p>The population of Alexandria is of a very mixed character, consisting, besides
                    the native Turks and Arabs, of Armenians, Greeks, Syrians, Italians, French,
                    English, Germans, &amp;c. At one time the ancient city is believed to have
                    contained 600,000 inhabitants; but at the beginning of this century the number
                    probably did not exceed 6000. In 1825 this had increased to 16,000, in 1840 to
                    60,000, and in 1871 to 219,602, of whom 53,829 were foreigners.</p>
