                    changes and phases of the moon, eclipses of the sun and moon, the times of high
                    water at particular ports, &amp;c. In addition to these contents, which may be
                    regarded as essential to the almanac, it generally presents additional
                    information, which is more or less extensive and varied according to the many
                    different special objects contemplated in works of this kind. The derivation of
                    the word is doubtful The first syllable is the Arabic definite article; the rest
                    of the word has been variously derived from the Greek μ <hi rend="italic"
                    >ηv,</hi> a month; the Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">mona,</hi> the moon; and
                    (which appears the most probable derivation) the Arabic <hi rend="italic"
                    >manah,</hi> to reckon.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Calendar</hi> will be treated of in a separate article
                    (which see). Here we have to do with the publication which contains the calendar
                    of any particular year, along with other matter, astronomical, statistical,
                    political, &amp;c. The <hi rend="italic">Ephemeris</hi> again, it is to be
                    observed, is a strict astronomical term, being a register from day to day of the
                    places and motions of the heavenly bodies.</p>
                <p>The attention given to astronomy by Eastern nations, and the practice that
                    prevailed among them of divination by means of the stars, must have led to the
                    early construction of such tables as are comprised in our almanacs. Our
                    information respecting these is extremely scanty; but we are not left in the
                    same ignorance with regard to the practice of the ancient Romans. The peculiar
                    arrangement of their calendar is well known, and their <hi rend="italic"
                    >fasti</hi><hi rend="italic">sacri</hi> or <hi rend="italic">kalendar</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">es</hi> were very similar to modern almanacs. Originally knowledge
                    of the calendar was confined to the class of pontifices or priests, whom the
                    people had to consult not only about the dates of the festivals, but also
                    regarding the proper times of instituting various legal proceedings. But about
                    300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> one Cn. Flavius, the secretary of Appius
                    Claudius, possessed himself of the secret, either by the stealthy use of
                    documents in the possession of his master, or, according to Pliny, by repeatedly
                    consulting the pontifices and jurists, and collating the particulars of the
                    information he obtained from them. It was neither more nor less than publishing
                    an almanac when, as Livy<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“Fastos circa forum in albo proposuit, ut quando lege agi posset, sciretur”
                    (ix. 46).</p></note> relates, he exhibited the <hi rend="italic">fasti</hi> on
                    white tablets round the forum. From this time tablets containing the calendar,
                    the festivals, astronomical phenomena, and sometimes historical notices, seem to
                    have been common. The <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> of Ovid is a poetical
                    relation of incidents and traditions connected with the calendar. The researches
                    of antiquaries have brought to light numerous <hi rend="italic">fasti</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">calendaria</hi> cut on marble and other kinds of stone.
                    Representations of several of these will be found in Gruter’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inscriptiones.</hi> One figured there, the Farnese rustic calendar, is a
                    cubical block of stone, on each of the four vertical faces of which three
                    columns are engraved, detailing for each different month the number of days, the
                    date of the <hi rend="italic">nones,</hi> the lengths of the day and night, the
                    sun’s place in the zodiac (which is also indicated by a representation of the
                    sign at the top of the column), the tutelary deity of the month, the rural
                    operations of the season, and the chief festivals.</p>
                <p>Almanacs of a ruder kind, known as <hi rend="italic">clogg almanacs,</hi> were in
                    use in some parts of England as late as the end of the 17th century. Dr Robert
                    Plot, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum and professor of chemistry at Oxford, gives
                    a figure of one of these, with a very minute description, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Natural History of Staffordshire</hi> (Oxford, 1686); and another
                    is represented in Gough’s edition of Camden’s <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi>
                    (1806, vol. ii. p. 499). The cloggs were square blocks of hard wood, about 8
                    inches in length, with notches along the four angles corresponding to the days
                    of the year. The accompanying illustration shows the angle on which is
                    registered the almanac for the months of January, February, and March, taking it
                    from left to right. The marks on the under side in the figure exhibit the primes
                    or golden numbers of a cycle, which is fully described in Plot’s work. They
                    generally increase by 8, 19 being struck off when that number is exceeded; and
                    the same number will be found to stand against all the dates (approximately) of
                    new moon throughout the year. The cross mark is for X, and the hook at the end
                    of a line for V. The weeks are indicated by a deeper notch for every seventh
                    day, and a broadening stroke on the upper side in the figure represents the
                    first day of each month.</p>

                <p>The other charactere on the upper side are for saints’ days and festivals. Thus
                    Epiphany (Jan. 6) is indicated by a star, St Hilary (Jan. 13) by a bishop’s
                    double cross, the conversion of St Paul (Jan. 25) by an axe, St Valentine (Feb.
                    14) by a true lover’s knot, St Matthias (Feb. 24) by a battle-axe, &amp;c. All
                    the feasts of the Virgin, as the Purification (Feb. 2) and the Annunciation
                    (March 25), are denoted by a heart—Dr Plot was greatly puzzled to know why. St
                    Blaise (Feb. 3), St Agatha (Feb. 5), and others were indicated by their
                    initials; and opposite the day (March 1) consecrated to David, the patron saint
                    of Wales, is a symbol which some consider a harp and others a leek.</p>
                <p>The earliest almanac regarding which Lalande (whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliographie Astronomique,</hi> Paris, 1803, is the best authority on
                    publications of this kind) could obtain any definite information belongs to the
                    12th century. Manuscript almanacs of considerable antiquity are preserved in the
                    British Museum and in the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge. Of these the most
                    remarkable are a calendar ascribed to Roger Bacon (1292), and those of Peter de
                    Dacia (about 1300), Walter de Elvendene (1327), John Somers (1380), &amp;c. It
                    is to be remembered that early calendars (such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kalendarium</hi><hi rend="italic">Lincolniense</hi> of Bishop Robert
                    Grosseteste) frequently bear the names, not of their compilers, but of the
                    writers of the treatises on ecclesiastical computation on which the calendars
                    are based. In 1812 there was printed at Hackney what purported to be a
                    transcription of the greater part of an almanac for 1386. This, if it exists,
                    must be one of the earliest, perhaps <hi rend="italic">the</hi> earliest, in the
                    English language that has been preserved. The earliest English calendar in the
                    British Museum is one for the year 1431. The first printed almanac known is one
                    for the year 1457; the first of importance is that of Joannes de Monte-Regio,
                    better known as Regiomontanus, which appears to have been printed at Nuremberg
                    in 1472. In this work the almanacs for the different months embrace three
                    Metonic cycles, or the 57 years from 1475 to 1531 inclusive. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Ephemerides</hi> of Regiomontanus, which are to be distinguished
                    from his almanac, were sold, it is said, for ten crowns of gold, considerably
                    more than their own weight. The earliest almanac printed in England was <hi
                    rend="italic">The Kalendar of Shepardes,</hi> a translation from the French,
                    printed by Richard Pynson about 1497.</p>
                <p>The exclusive right to sell “almanacs and prognostications,” enjoyed in the time
                    of Elizabeth by two members of the Company of Stationers, was extended by James
                    I. to the two universities and the Stationers’ Company jointly; but the
                    universities commuted their privilege for an annuity from the company. About a
                    century ago one Thomas Carnan, a bookseller, conceiving that the company had no
                    just title to its monopoly, published an almanac for three successive years, and
                    was thrice imprisoned on that account by the company. In 1775 the case came
                    before the Court of Common Pleas, and was decided in Carnan’s favour. The
                    question argued was, “Whether almanacs were such public ordinances, such matters
                    of state, as belonged to the king by his prerogative, so as to enable him to
                    communicate an exclusive right of printing them to a grantee of the crown ?” and
                    the judges were unanimously of the opinion that the crown had no such right. The
                    minister, Lord North, made an attempt in 1779 to put the company in possession,
                    by a parliamentary enactment, of what the judges had denied it; but the proposed
                    monopoly was denounced by Erskine and others with such ability and severity that
                    the bill was thrown out by a majority of forty-five. In consequence of this loss
                    to the company of its exclusive right to issue almanacs, the universities lost
                    their title to their annuity, and in lieu of it they received a parliamentary
                    grant. The company continued, however, virtually to retain its monopoly by
                    buying up as much as possible all the almanacs issued by other publishers, and
                    by means of the great influence it possessed over the book trade. In more recent
                    times the power to control the sale of this class of publications has altogether
                    ceased, but a considerable proportion of the almanacs published in this country
                    still issue from the hall of the Stationers’ Company. A lively description of
                    “Almanac Day” at Stationers’ Hall will be found in Knight’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyclopaedia of London</hi> (1851), p. 588.</p>
                <p>The influence of the heavenly bodies on the conditions and affairs of men has
                    been believed in, and a superstitious importance has been attached to particular
                    times and seasons by the credulous from the remotest times. As might be
                    imagined, therefore, since the bases on which the whole system of judicial
                    astrology rested all fall within the field of the almanac-makers’ labours, great
                    prominence was given to omens and predictions in many of these publications. The
                    early almanacs had commonly the name of “prognostications” in addition, and what
                    they professed to show may be gathered from titles like the following, which is
                    quoted by Mr Halliwell :—“Pronosty-cacyon of Mayster John Thybault, medycyner
                    and astronomer of the Emperyall Majestie, of the year of our Lorde God <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">mcccccxxxπj.,</hi> comprehending the iiij. partes of this yere,
                    and of the influence of the mone, of peas and warre, and of the sykenesses of
                    this yere, with the constellacions of them that be under the vij. pianettes, and
                    the revolu-cions of kynges and princes, and of the eclipses and comets.” In 1579
                    Henry III. of France deemed it necessary to prohibit all almanac-makers from
                    indulging in predictions. No such restriction, however, existed in this country;
                    and it was to their prophesyings that the almanacs of the Stationers’ Company
                    were long indebted for much of their popularity. Among almanacs of this class
                    published in England, and principally by the Stationers’ Company, are Leonard
                    Digges’s <hi rend="italic">Prognostication Everlasting of Bight Good
                    Effect,</hi> for 1553, 1555, &amp;c.; William Lilly’s <hi rend="italic">Merlinus
                    Anglicus Junior,</hi> for 1644, &amp;c., and other almanacs and
                    “prognostications;” Booker’s <hi rend="italic">Bloody Almanac</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Bloody Irish Almanac,</hi> for 1643, 1647, &amp;c.—the last
                    attributed erroneously to Napier; Partridge’s <hi rend="italic">Mercurius
                    Coelestis,</hi> for 1681, <hi rend="italic">Merlinus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Redivivus,</hi> &amp;c. The name of Partridge has been immortalised in Pope’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Rape of the Lock;</hi> and his almanacs were very cleverly
                    burlesqued by Swift, who predicted Partridge’s own death, with all details of
                    time and circumstance, in genuine prognosticator’s style. The most famous of all
                    the Stationers’ Company’s predicting almanacs was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vox</hi><hi rend="italic">Stellarum</hi> of Francis Moore, dating from about
                    1680. Of a different but not a better sort was <hi rend="italic">Poor
                    Robin,</hi> dating from 1663, and published by the company down to 1828, which
                    abounded in coarse, sometimes extremely coarse, humour.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of January 1828 the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge
                    issued the <hi rend="italic">British Almanac</hi> for that year—a publication
                    greatly superior in every way to the almanacs of the time. To quote the
                    society’s <hi rend="italic">Almanac</hi> for 1829—</p>
                <p>“This was almost the first attempt in this country to produce an almanac that
                    should not only be useful to all classes, and of which the information should be
                    wholly of a popular character, but which should be purified from the
                    superstitions, prejudices, and indecencies which have characterised some of the
                    almanacs of which the circulation has been the most extensive. By a
                    parliamentary return of the year 1828 we find that the stamp duty paid upon the
                    almanacs of England exhibits a circulation of 451,593 annually. It may be safely
                    asserted that two-thirds of these publications contain some large portion of the
                    matter just described; and they thus keep alive a spirit of ignorance utterly
                    opposed to the desire for sound and practical information which distinguishes
                    our own times.” The success of the <hi rend="italic">British Almanac,</hi> with
                    its valuable <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n629/mode/1up"

                    the Almanac,</hi> led to a great improvement in this class of publications. The
                    Stationers’ Company issued the <hi rend="italic">English Almanac,</hi> a work of
                    a similar kind. The entire repeal in 1834, by the 3d and 4th Will. IV., c. 57,
                    of the heavy stamp duty on all almanacs of fifteenpence per copy, gave an
                    additional stimulus to the publication of almanacs of a better class, and from
                    that time the number has greatly increased. It is interesting to remark that the
                    <hi rend="italic">British Almanac</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Companion</hi>
                    still exist, and retain their original form and character, and that this has
                    from 1870 been the principal almanac published by the Stationers’ Company.</p>
                <p>The variety of extraneous matter included in almanacs, corresponding to the very
                    numerous other objects to which the almanac proper is often only secondary, can
                    be merely alluded to here. A number of publications, issued in Germany from the
                    middle of the 18th to the middle of the 19th century, under such titles <hi
                    rend="italic">Musenalmanach,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Almanach</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Muses,</hi> contain some of the best works of some of the most
                    celebrated German poets. The <hi rend="italic">Almanach</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Gotha,</hi> which has existed since 1764, and is published at present both in
                    French and German, gives a particular account of all the royal and princely
                    families of Europe, and ample details, compressed into little space, concerning
                    the administration and the statistics of the different states of the world. As
                    works of general statistical reference, the two national almanacs, <hi
                    rend="italic">Oliver and Boyd's New Edinburgh Almanac</hi> (from 1837) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Thom's Irish Almanac</hi> (from 1843), are of very great
                    value.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac</hi> is a publication the object of which
                    is to supply information that is indispensable to the navigator and the
                    astronomer. It gives with the utmost precision the positions of the principal
                    heavenly bodies at short intervals of time, and other important details of
                    celestial phenomena. The moon’s exact position is registered for every hour, and
                    also the angular distances at noon and midnight daily of the moon from the sun
                    and several fixed stars. By means of the data thus supplied, in connection with
                    observations of the heavenly bodies, time, latitude, and longitude can be
                    determined. The <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac</hi> has been published
                    regularly since the issue in 1766 of the Almanac for 1767. It was originated by
                    Dr Maskelyne, the astronomer-royal, who conducted it for many years. About 1830
                    the Lords of the Admiralty were induced by complaints of its defects to bring
                    the subject under the notice of the Royal Astronomical Society. The society
                    appointed a committee to consider what changes seemed necessary, and, on the
                    committee’s recommendation, the form was adopted which has continued with little
                    change from 1834 to the present time. During that period the Almanac has been
                    published under the superintendence of the Admiralty. It is issued generally
                    three years at least before it comes into use. The <hi rend="italic"
