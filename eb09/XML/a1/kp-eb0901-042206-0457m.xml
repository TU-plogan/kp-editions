                    the N. and W., by the Mahi Kánta on the N. and E., by the Kaira collectorate on
                    the E. and S., and by the gulf of Cambay on the S. The area of the district is
                    returned at 3844 square miles. The river Sábarmatí and its tributaries, flowing
                    from north-east to soutli-west into the gulf of Cambay, are the principal
                    streams that water the district The north-eastern portion is slightly elevated,
                    and dotted with low hills, which gradually sink into a vast plain, subject to
                    inundation on its western extremity. With the exception of this latter portion,
                    the soil is very fertile, and some parts of the district are beautifully wooded.
                    The total population of Ahmadábád is returned at 829,637 souls, the average
                    density, as compared with the area, being 216 to the square mile, and the
                    proportion of females 891 to every 1000 males. About 86 per cent. of the
                    population are returned as Hindus, 10 per cent. as Mahometans, and 4 as
                    Buddhists. The percentage of persons of other denominations is infinitesimal,
                    their total number being only 1237 souls.</p>
                <p>The hamlets for the most part consist of substantial houses of bricks and tiles,
                    with only a small proportion of huts. Some of the larger villages contain houses
                    with upper stories, and the general appearance of the inhabitants indicates
                    prosperity. The principal agricultural products are rice, wheat, bajrá, and
                    cotton, with a little sugar-cane, tobacco, and oil-seeds. Silk manufacture forms
                    an important industry of the city. The total revenue of the district in 1872
                    amounted to £152,344, of which £147,283 was derived from the land; the total net
                    expenditure on civil administration in the same year amounted to £21,700. The
                    fiscal system consists for the most part of settlements direct with the
                    husbandman, technically known as rayatwárí; but some villages are <hi
                    rend="italic">“tálukdárí"</hi> in which the “tálukdár” or landholder collects
                    the revenue, and pays 70 per cent. of it to Government, retaining the remaining
                    30 per cent for himself. The excise revenue is generally farmed out, but a
                    government distillery exists in the city. The land settlement is fixed for a
                    period of thirty years, and expires in different parts of the district between
                    the years 1884 and 1888. Seventy-five per cent. of the total area of the
                    district is cultivable, of which 55 per cent. is actually under cultivation, the
                    other 20 per cent. remaining fallow. The principal marts in Ahmadábád are
                    Dhollerá, Gogo, Dholká, and Víramgáon. Municipalities have been established in
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n458/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0458-0423"/> the towns of Ahmadábád, Dholká, Mandú, Gogo,
                    Dhandúka, Prántej, and Moráshá; the rate of municipal taxation per head of
                    population varies from 2s. 6 ½ d. in Ahmadabád to 4¼d. in Morâshá, the average
                    throughout the eight towns being 1s. 7⅝d. per head. The municipal income is
                    chiefly derived from octroi duties, which in some of the towns are farmed.
                    Thirteen towns are returned as containing a population exceeding 5000 souls,
                    namely, Ahmadábád, population 116,873; Dholká, 20,854; Víramgáon, 19,661;
                    Dhollerá, 12,468; Dhandúka, 9782; Gogo, 9571; Prántej, 8341; Moráshá, 7436;
                    Sanand, 7229; Mandú, 6774; Patri, 6320; Barwálá, 5813; and Ranpur, 5796. The
                    district contains 145 schools, in eight of which English is taught. The police
                    force numbers 1189 men. The Kolís contribute most largely to the criminal
                    population.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">AhmadAbad City,</hi> the capital of the district, is
                    situated on the east or left bank of the river Sábarrnatí, in 23° N. lat., and
                    72° 36' E. long. It was formerly one of the largest towns in India, celebrated
                    for its commerce and manufactures of gold and silver, silk and cotton fabrics,
                    articles of gold, silver, steel, enamel, mother of pearl, lacquered ware, and
                    fine wood-work. Excellent paper was also manufactured, and a large trade carried
                    on in indigo, cotton, and opium. With the rise of the Marhattá power, however,
                    Ahmadábád became the scene of repeated struggles between the Marhattás and the
                    Mussulmans, whose power was then on the wane, and from this period its
                    prosperity declined. It was captured by the Marhattás in 1755, and again by the
                    British in 1780. The latter soon afterwards gave the town back to the Marhattás,
                    who held it till it finally came into the hands of the English in 1818. The
                    present state of the city is flourishing. It contains a population of 116,873
                    souls, and is a large and important station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central
                    India Railway. It is the seat of important silk manufactures, and has two
                    cotton-mills worked by steam-power.</p>
                <p>The principal objects of architectural interest are the Jain temple of Seth
                    Hathisinh and the Juma Masjid or Great Mosque. The Jain temple is a modem
                    edifice, having been erected about twenty-five years ago by Hathi Sinh, a rich
                    Jain merchant, who dedicated it to Dharmnáth. This modern style shows that the
                    Jain style of architecture has hardly degenerated from its ancient excellence.
                    The external porch, between two circular towers, is of great magnificence, most
                    elaborately ornamented, and leads to an outer court, with sixteen cells on
                    either side. In the centre of this court is a domed porch of the usual form,
                    with twenty pillars. The court leads to an inner porch of twenty-two pillars,
                    two stories in height, with a roof of a shape very fashionable in modem Jain
                    temples, though by no means remarkable for beauty. This inner porch conducts to
                    a triple sanctuary. The exterior of the temple expresses the interior more
                    completely than even a Gothic design; and whether looked at from its courts or
                    from the outside, it possesses variety without confusion, and an appropriateness
                    of every part to the purpose for which it was intended. The Juma Masjid or Great
                    Mosque of Ahmadábád, although not remarkable for its size, is one of the most
                    beautiful mosques in the East, the Jain style of architecture being plainly
                    visible in its construction. Its external dimensions are 382 feet by 258
                    feet.</p>
