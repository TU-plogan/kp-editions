                    foot of the Klissoura Mountains, in 1741. He belonged to the Toske tribe, and
                    his ancestors had for some years held the title of Bey of Tepelini, this dignity
                    having become hereditary in his family. His grandfather fell in 1716 at the
                    siege of Corfu, which was then held by the Venetians. His father, who died when
                    Ali was in his fourteenth year, is represented by most authorities as a man of
                    amiable character and peaceful habits, who was despoiled of his territories by
                    the chiefs that lived around him; but his mother was a woman of fierce and
                    unyielding disposition. Inciting her son to recover the possessions of his
                    father, she roused in him a spirit of cruelty and aggression, tempered, however,
                    by a considerable amount of cunning and foresight, which bore bitter fruit in
                    his riper years. Many romantic stories are told of Ali’s adventures at the
                    outset of his career, but the only fact3 that are known with certainty are, that
                    after living in the mountains as a robber for some years, and enduring great
                    privations, he made himself master of his beylik of Tepelini by the aid of his
                    associates. He is said to have then murdered his brother and imprisoned his
                    mother, who died shortly after, on a charge of attempting to poison him. In
                    order to increase and establish his power, he then made overtures to the Turkish
                    government, by whose orders he attacked and defeated the pasha of Scutari, then
                    in rebellion against the sultan, and put to death Selim, pasha of Delvino. For
                    these acts he was rewarded by being placed in possession of the whole of his
                    father’s territories, and he was appointed lieutenant to the Derwend-pacha of
                    Rum-ili, an officer who was charged with the suppression of brigandage and
                    highway robbery in the district. Ali, however, by permitting the robbers to go
                    unchecked in return for a share of the spoil, brought his superior to disgrace
                    and death, but escaped himself by sending bribes to the ministers of the sultan.
                    For his services in the field in the war between Prussia and Turkey in 1787 he
                    was appointed pasha of Trikala in Thessaly, and Derwend-pasha of Rum-ili. He
                    soon cleared the country of robbers, mainly by summoning to his standard all who
                    were willing to serve under him, and by their aid he took forcible possession of
                    Joannina in 1788. By means of the powerful body of troops at his command, and
                    the wise measures that he introduced, he wrought considerable amelioration in
                    the districts under his charge, and the Porte seeing this, confirmed him in the
                    pashalik of Joannina. His whole attention was now turned to the aggrandisement
                    of his territory and personal power. He obtained possession of the western part
                    of Northern Greece, or Livadia as it was then called; but was baffled for many
                    years in his attempts to occupy the country of the Suliotes in the south-west of
                    Epirus. These brave and hardy mountaineers at last, in 1803, agreed to evacuate
                    their country, and were treacherously massacred by Ali while on their way to the
                    coast to embark for Corfu. When the French took Venice in 1797, Ali, by
                    pretending admiration for the principles of the revolution, induced Napoleon to
                    send him engineers, by whose aid he fortified Joannina; but failing to obtain
                    from him, as he had hoped, the Venetian ports on the seaboard of Epirus, he took
                    occasion, after the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt, to lay siege to Prevesa, which
                    was surrendered by the French troops. Ali had now a difficult part to play, but
                    he succeeded so well with his master the sultan, that he was confirmed in the
                    possession of the whole of Albania northwards from Epirus to Montenegro, over
                    which he had asserted his authority, partly by intrigue and partly by force of
                    arms. He also held the high position of governor of Rum-ili for a brief period
                    (1799), during which he amassed a large sum of money by his extortions. The
                    cruel massacre of the inhabitants of Gardiki, for an alleged insult to his
                    mother and sister about forty years previously, was perpetrated about this time.
                    He contrived to make his peace with the French in spite of the capture of
                    Prevesa, and in 1807 once more entered into alliance with them, with the view of
                    obtaining Parga, which he had attempted to capture, but without success, in
                    1800. Napoleon, however, neglected to secure Parga for him at the peace of
                    Tilsit, and the fortress remained in the hands of the French until it was taken
                    in 1814 by the English, who gave it up in 1817, ostensibly to the sultan, but in
                    reality to Ali. Ali was now at the height of his power: he was almost supreme
                    over Albania, Epirus, part of Thessaly, and the western part of Northern Greece;
                    while one of his sons held the pashalik of the Morea. So powerful was he that,
                    though he was nearly eighty years of age, the Porte feared and hated him, and
                    desired his death, but could find no good pretext for taking measures against
                    him until <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n611/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0611-0574"/> 1820, when Ali procured the assassination of an
                    officer who had left him and taken service under the sultan at Constantinople.
                    For this daring act the sultan proscribed Ali, and ordered all the European
                    pashas to march against him. He resisted every effort to capture him, but was at
                    last induced by Kourschid Pasha to surrender in January 1822 on promise of a
                    pardon from the sultan. On 5th February, on pretence of handing him the
                    necessary document, Kourschid Pasha procured an interview with him, and then
                    produced the firman authorising his execution. The brave old despot defended
                    himself with his usual resolution and courage, but was overpowered by numbers,
                    and his head was struck from his body and sent to Constantinople.</p>
