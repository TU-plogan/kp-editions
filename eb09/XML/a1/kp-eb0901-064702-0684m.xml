                <p><label type="entry">ALUMINIUM</label>, a metallic substance, first separated from
                    the chloride by Wöhler in 1828. It remained a laboratory product until Deville,
                    about 1858, succeeded in improving the mode of production, so as to render the
                    operations capable of management on the manufacturing scale. The process
                    consists in heating to a red heat a mixture of the double chloride of aluminium
                    and sodium, or the double fluoride of aluminium and sodium (cryolite), with the
                    metal sodium. A vigorous action takes place, chloride of sodium being formed and
                    the metal aluminium separated. On the large scale the reduction is effected by
                    throwing a mixture of 10 parts of the double chloride, 5 parts of cryolite, and
                    2 parts of sodium on the hearth of a reverberatory furnace. Immediately after
                    the action, the fused metal and slag, consisting of common salt and fluoride of
                    aluminium, are run out, and a new quantity of the previous mixture introduced.
                    The various patents that have been secured with reference to this manufacture
                    have all regard to the saving of the metal sodium. The metal aluminium may be
                    separated from the double chloride by electrolysis. For this purpose the fused
                    salt has the electric current from ten cells of a battery passed through it,
                    carbon poles being used. The metal appears at the negative pole in large
                    globules, which may be collected and melted together under a layer of fused
                    salt.</p>
                <p>Aluminium is a white metal resembling silver in appearance. It is very malleable
                    and ductile, and may be beaten and rolled into thin sheets, or drawn into fine
                    wire. By hammering in the cold it becomes as hard as soft iron, but may be
                    softened again by fusion. Being highly sonorous, it has been used for making
                    bells. It is very light, being only 2½ times heavier than water, and is thus
                    four times lighter than silver. After fusion it has a specific gravity of 2 ∙
                    56; by hammering this may be increased to 2 ∙ 67. It melts at a red heat, and is
                    non-volatile at very high temperatures. The metal conducts heat and electricity
                    as well as silver. Aluminium does not oxidise in air, even at a red heat, has no
                    action on water at ordinary temperatures, and is not acted upon by sulphuretted
                    hydrogen or sulphide of ammonium, and thus preserves its lustre where silver
                    would be tarnished and blackened. It is not attacked by nitric acid, even when
                    concentrated, and is not soluble in dilute sulphuric acid, but is readily
                    soluble in dilute or concentrated hydrochloric acid with evolution of hydrogen.
                    Solutions of caustic potash or soda dissolve the metal with great ease, forming
                    aluminate of potash or soda, and giving off hydrogen. Aluminium forms alloys
                    with most metals. The copper alloy called aluminium-bronze is the most important
                    because of its colour, hardness, and malleability, and is largely used for
                    articles of jewellery, for mounting sextants and other astronomical instruments,
                    and for making balance beams.</p>
