                    appearance to the <hi rend="italic">alumen scissile,</hi> and had a disagreeable
                    taste, but was useful in medicine. The general opinion is, that the sal-ammoniac
                    of the ancients was the same as that of the moderns; but the imperfect
                    description of Pliny is far from being sufficient to decide the point. The
                    native sal-ammoniac of Bucharia, described by Model and Karsten, and analysed by
                    Klaproth, has no resemblance to the salt described by Pliny. The same remark
                    applies to the sal-ammoniac of volcanoes. Dioscorides (v. 126), in mentioning
                    sal-ammoniac, makes use of a phrase quite irreconcilable with the description of
                    Pliny, and rather applicable to rock-salt than to our salammoniac. Sal-ammoniac,
                    he says, is peculiarly prized if it can be easily split into rectangular
                    fragments. Finally, we have no proof whatever that sal-ammoniac occurs at
                    present, either near the temple of Jupiter Ammon, or in any part of Cyrenaica.
                    These circumstances induce us to conclude that the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >sal-ammoniac</hi> was applied as indefinitely by the ancients as most of their
                    other chemical terms. It may have been given to the same salt which is known to
                    the moderns by that appellation, but was not confined to it.</p>
                <p>Some derive the name <hi rend="italic">sal-ammoniac</hi> from Jupiter Ammon, near
                    whose temple it is alleged to have been found; others, from a district of
                    Cyrenaica called Ammonia. Pliny’s derivation is from the sand (α∕qu,os) in which
                    it occurred.</p>
                <p>Whether our sal-ammoniac was known to the ancients or not, there can be no doubt
                    that it was well known to the alchemists as early as the 13 th century. Albertus
                    Magnus, in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De Alchymia,</hi> informs us that
                    there were two kinds of sal-ammoniac, a natural and an artificial. The natural
                    was sometimes white, and sometimes red; the artificial was more useful to the
                    chemist. He does not tell us how it was prepared, but he describes the method of
                    subliming it, which can leave no doubt that it was real sal-ammoniac. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Mineralia</hi> of Isaac Hollandus the
                    elder, there is likewise a description of the mode of subliming sal-ammoniac.
                    Basil Valentine, in his <hi rend="italic">Currus Triumphalis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Antimonii,</hi> describes some of the peculiar properties of
                    sal-ammoniac in, if possible, a still less equivocal manner.</p>
                <p>Egypt is the country where sal-ammoniac was first manufactured, and from which
                    Europe for many years was supplied with it. This commerce was first carried on
                    by the Venetians, and afterwards by the Dutch. Nothing was known about the
                    method employed by the Egyptians till the year 1719. In 1716 the younger
                    Geoffroy read a paper to the French Academy, showing that sal-ammoniac must be
                    formed by sublimation; but his opinion was opposed so violently by Homberg and
                    Lemery, that the paper was not printed. In 1719 Μ. Lemaire, the French consul at
                    Cairo, sent the Academy an account of the mode of manufacturing sal-ammoniac in
                    Egypt. The salt, it appeared, was obtained by simple sublimation from soot. In
                    the year 1760 Linnaeus communicated to the Royal <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n785/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0785-0742"/> Society a correct detail of the whole process,
                    which he had received from Dr Hasselquist, who had travelled in that country as
                    a naturalist. This account is published in the 51st volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> 1760, p. 504. Almost the only
                    fuel used in Egypt is the dung of cattle. The dung of black cattle, horses,
                    sheep, goats, &lt;tc., which contains the sal-ammoniac ready formed, is
                    collected during the first four months of the year, when the animals feed on the
                    spring grass, a kind of clover. It is dried, and sold to the common people as
                    fuel. The soot from this fuel is carefully collected and sold to the
                    sal-ammoniac makers, who work only during the months of March and April, for it
                    is only at that season of the year that the dung is fit for their purpose.</p>
                <p>The composition of this salt seems to have been first discovered by Tournefort in
                    1700. The experiments of the younger Geoffroy in 1716 and 1723 were still more
                    decisive, and those of Duhamel, in 1735, left no doubt upon the subject. Dr
                    Thomson first pointed out a process by synthesis, which has the advantage of
                    being very simple, and at the same time rigidly accurate, resulting from his
                    observation that when muriatic gas and ammoniacal gas, both as dry as possible,
                    are brought in contact with each other, they always combine in equal
                    volumes.</p>
                <p>The first attempt to manufacture sal-ammoniac in Europe was made, about the
                    beginning of the 18th century, by Mr Goodwin, a chemist of London, who appears
                    to have used the mother ley of common salt and putrid urine as ingredients. The
                    first successful manufacture of salammoniac in this country was established in
                    Edinburgh by Dr Hutton and Mr Davy, about the year 1760. It was first
                    manufactured in France about the same time by Baumé. Manufactories of it were
                    afterwards established in Germany, Holland, and Flanders.</p>
                <p>Chloride of ammonia is now manufactured in large quantity from the crude
                    carbonate of ammonia obtained in gasworks, or from the destructive distillation
                    of animal matter. This salt is changed into chloride by the addition of
                    hydrochloric acid or the mother liquor of salt-works, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >bittern,</hi> containing the chlorides of calcium and magnesium. When
                    hydrochloric acid is not easily got for neutralisation, the crude gas liquor is
                    transformed into sulphate, and this is mixed with an equivalent quantity of
                    common salt. During the subsequent evaporation the sulphate of soda separates in
                    hard granular crystals, which are apt to adhere to the sides of the boiler. The
                    liquor is agitated to prevent this adhesion taking place, and assist in the
                    separation of the sulphate of soda. The sulphate of soda is removed by drainers
                    as it is formed, and the mother liquor boiled up to the crystallising point, and
                    run off into coolers. The crystals of impure muriate of ammonia are dried
                    carefully and subsequently sublimed.</p>
                <p>Sal-ammoniac occurs usually in the form of a hard, white cake, opaque, or only
                    slightly translucent. Its taste is cooling, saline, and rather disagreeable. It
                    dissolves in 2∙72 parts of water at 18° *7 C. with great reduction of
                    temperature, and in about an equal weight of water at the boiling-point. The
                    feathery crystals it forms are found on microscopic examination &gt; to be
                    masses of cubes or octahedrons; their specific gravity is about 1’5. When
                    exposed to a moist atmosphere, the salt gradually absorbs water, and
                    deliquesces, though very slowly, becoming slightly acid. When heated, it
                    sublimes unaltered in a white smoke, having a peculiar smell, very
                    characteristic of sal-ammoniac. If a cold body be presented to this smoke, the
                    sal-ammoniac condenses on it, and forms a white crust. When thus sublimed, it
                    has the property of carrying along with it various bodies, which, when heated by
                    themselves, are perfectly fixed.</p>
