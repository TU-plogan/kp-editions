                <p>LINNAeUS originally employed this term to denote a class of the Animal Kingdom
                    comprising crocodiles, lizards and salamanders, snakes and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coecilioe,</hi> tortoises and turtles, and frogs; to which, in the later
                    editions of the <hi rend="italic">Systema,</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturoe,</hi>
                    he added some groups of fishes. In the <hi rend="italic">Tableau</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Elémentaire,</hi> published in 1795, Cuvier adopts Linnaeus’s term
                    in its earlier sense, but uses the French word “Reptiles,” already brought into
                    use by Brisson, as the equivalent of <hi rend="italic">Amphibia.</hi> In
                    addition, Cuvier accepts the Linnaean subdivisions of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphibia-Reptilia</hi> for the tortoises, lizards (including crocodiles),
                    salamanders, and frogs; and <hi rend="italic">Amphibia-Serpentes</hi> for the
                    snakes, apodal lizards, and <hi rend="italic">Coecilioe.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1799<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brongniart’s
                    “Essai d’une Classification Naturelle des Reptiles” was not published in full
                    till 1803. It appears in the volume of the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires présentés

                    pointed out the wide differences which separate the frogs and salamanders (which
                    he terms <hi rend="italic">Batrachia)</hi> from the other reptiles; and in 1804,
                    Latreille,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    >Animal.</hi></p></note> rightly estimating the value of these differences,
                    though he was not an original worker in the field of vertebrate zoology,
                    proposed to separate Brongniart’s <hi rend="italic">Batrachia</hi> from the
                    class of <hi rend="italic">Reptilia</hi> proper, as a group of equal value, for
                    which he retained the Linnaean name of <hi rend="italic">Amphibia.</hi></p>
                <p>Cuvier went no further than Brongniart, and, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Régne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal,</hi> he dropped the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphibia,</hi> and substituted <hi rend="italic">Reptilia</hi> for it.

                    classification, retained the term <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> in its earlier
                    Linnaean sense; and his example has been generally followed by German writers;
                    as, for instance, by Stannius, in that remarkable monument of accurate and
                    extensive research, the <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    he offered an alternative arrangement, in which the class <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reptiles</hi> is preserved and divided into two sub-classes, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ornithoides</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ickthyoides.</hi> The
                    latter are Brongniart’s <hi rend="italic">Batrachia, plus</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coecilioe,</hi> whose true affinities had, in the meanwhile, been
                    shown by Duméril; and, in this arrangement, the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphibiens</hi> is restricted to <hi rend="italic">Proteus</hi> and <hi

                    Müller gave far better anatomical characters of the two groups than had
                    previously been put forward. Moreover, following the indications already given
                    by Von Bär in 1828,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> δ</hi><hi rend="italic">Entwickelungs-Geschichte

                    attention of naturalists to the important fact, that while all the <hi
                    rend="italic">Squamata</hi> possess an amnion and an allantois, these structures
                    are absent in the embryos of all the <hi rend="italic">Nuda.</hi></p>
                <p>Müller makes an appeal for observations on the development of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coecilioe,</hi> and of those <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> which
                    retain gills or gill-clefts throughout life, which has unfortunately yielded no
                    fruits from that time to this.</p>
                <p>In 1825, Latreille published a new classification of the <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">,6</hi> which are primarily divided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hoematherma,</hi> containing the three classes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammifera,</hi><hi rend="italic">Monotremata,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aves</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hoemacryma,</hi> also
                    containing three classes <hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >Pisces.</hi> This division of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> into hot
                    and cold blooded is a curiously retrograde step, only intelligible when we
                    reflect that the excellent entomologist had no real comprehension of vertebrate
                    morphology; but he makes some atonement for the blunder by steadily upholding
                    the class distinctness of the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia.</hi> In this he was
                    followed by Dr J. E. Gray; but Duméril and Bibron in their great work,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Erpétologie
                    Générale, ou Histoire Naturelle complète des Reptile».</hi> 1836.</p></note> and
                    Dr Günther in his <hi rend="italic">Catalogue,</hi> in substance, adopt
                    Brongniart’s arrangement, the <hi rend="italic">Batrachia</hi> being simply one
                    of the four orders of the class <hi rend="italic">Reptilia.</hi> Professor
                    Huxley has adopted Latreille’s view of the distinctness of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphibia,</hi> as a class of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> co-ordinate
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Aves, Reptilia,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Pisces;</hi> and the same arrangement is accepted by
                    Gegenbaur and Haeckel. In the Hunterian lectures delivered at the Royal College
                    of Surgeons in 1863, Professor Huxley divided the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata</hi> into Mammals, Sauroids, and Ichthyoids, the latter division
                    containing the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pisces.</hi> Subsequently he proposed the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sauropsida</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ichthy-opsida tor</hi> the Sauroids and
                    Ichthyoids respectively. It is proper to mention, finally, that Professor Owen,
                    in his work on <hi rend="italic">The Anatomy of Vertebrates,</hi> follows
                    Latreille in dividing the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">Hoematotherma</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hoemar</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tocrya,</hi> and adopts Leuckart’s term of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dipnoa</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> are distinguished from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sauropsida</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> by very important and
                    sharply-defined characters. The visceral arches of the embryo develop gills,
                    which temporarily, or permanently, perform the respiratory function. There is no
                    trace of an amnion, and it is still a question whether the urinary bladder,
                    which all <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> possess, answers to the allantois of
                    the higher <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> or not. At any rate, it plays no
                    part in the respiration of the embryo, nor is it an organ by which nutriment is
                    obtained from the parent. There are two occipital condyles, and the
                    basi-occipital region of the skull is either very incompletely, or not at all,
                    ossified. There is no basi-sphenoidal ossification. When young, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> are provided with, at fewest, three, and usually
                    four, cartilaginous, or more or less ossified, branchial arches. From <hi
                    rend="italic">Pisces,</hi> on the other hand, they are distinguishable only by
                    the characters of their locomotive apparatus. When they possess median fins and
                    limbs, these never present fin-rays; and the limbs exhibit, in full development,
                    the type of structure which obtains among the <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Mammalia,</hi> and differ very widely from the fins of any
                    fish at present known. This difference obtains even among <pb break="no"

                    of the Carboniferous epoch. In other respects, the lower <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphibia</hi> approach the <hi rend="italic">Chimoeroe,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ganoidei,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi</hi> very closely;
                    while, in their development, they present curious approximations to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Marsipobranchii.</hi></p>
                <p>With respect to the primary subdivisions, or orders, of the class <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphibia,</hi> no one can doubt the propriety of the separation of
                    the recent forms into what may be broadly termed Newts <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Urodela)</hi>; Frogs and Toads <hi rend="italic">(Anura);</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Concilia (Peromela)</hi> effected by Duméril; while all that is
                    known of the organisation of the extinct <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> of the
                    newer Palaeozoic, and older Mesozoic, formations tends to show that they form a
                    fourth natural assemblage of equal value to each of the others.</p>
                <p>The names of <hi rend="italic">Urodela</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi>
                    given to the first two of these divisions, are undoubtedly open to criticism;
                    but if well-understood terms, which have acquired a definite scientific
                    connotation, are to be changed whenever advancing knowledge renders them
                    etymologically inappropriate, the nomenclature of taxonomy will before long
                    become hopelessly burdened; and, to set a good example, the names of <hi
                    rend="italic">Urodela, Anura, Peromela,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labyrintho-donta</hi> are adopted here for the four orders of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphibia,</hi> even although it be true that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labyrinthodonta</hi> do not all possess the dental structure on which the name
                    was founded; though there is reason to believe that some Labyrinthodonts were
                    devoid of limbs, or peromelous; that the <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi> are not
                    more tail-less than are the <hi rend="italic">Peromela;</hi> and that the tails
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Urodela</hi> are not more conspicuous than were those
                    of the Labyrinthodonts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Urodela,</hi> are <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> with
                    elongated bodies and relatively short limbs, devoid of scales or pectoral
                    plates, with numerous prae-caudal vertebrae, and with amphicoelous, or
                    opisthocoelous, vertebral centra. The hyoidean arch remains connected with the
                    suspensorium throughout life, and its cornua are large in proportion to its
                    body. The mandible is dentigerous. There are one or two pairs of limbs, the
                    pectoral arch and limbs being always present. The manus never possesses more
                    than four digits. The bones of the antebrachium and of the crus remain distinct,
                    and the tarsus is not elongated. So far as the spermatozoa are known, they are
                    elongated filaments with a vibratile fringe. The larva develops external gills
                    only; and, except <hi rend="italic">Siren,</hi> none are known to possess, at
                    any time, a homy masticatory apparatus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This circumstance appears to have been remarked only by
                    Muller. Speaking of the larvae of the Salamanders, he says—“Sie haben nicht den
                    Hornschnabel der Froscblarven.”— <hi rend="italic">(Beitrag zur Anat. der
                    Amphibien,</hi> p. 209.) Duméril and Bibron affirm the contrary <hi
                    rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> t. ix. p. 1G).</p></note></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Anura</hi> have relatively short and broad bodies, and
                    both pairs of limbs are constantly present, the hinder being the longer and
                    stronger. There are no scales, nor pectoral plates, but ossification sometimes
                    occurs in the dorsal integument. The vertebrae vary in character, but are
                    usually procoelous. The prae-sacral vertebrae never exceed nine in number, and
                    the caudal portion of the vertebral column is represented by a peculiar
                    styliform coccyx. The hyoidean arch detaches itself from the suspensorium, and
                    almost always becomes connected with the pro-otic region of the skull. The
                    cornua are usually slender, as compared with the broad body of the hyoid. The
                    mandible is almost always devoid of teeth. The bones of the antebrachium and of
                    the crus early ankylose, and the astragalus and calcaneum are much elongated.
                    The manus has a rudimentary fifth digit. Except in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bombinator,</hi> the spermatozoa have, flagelliform appendages, like those of
                    ordinary <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi> The larvae develop first external,
                    and afterwards internal, gills, and, so far as is known at present, are provided
                    with deciduous horny masticatory plates. The gill apertures are closed by the
                    growing over them of an opercular membrane.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Peromela</hi> have snake-like bodies, totally devoid of
                    limbs and limb arches. In most, the integument is provided with transverse rows
                    of imbedded cycloid scales, but there are no pectoral plates. The vertebrae of

                    are very few, and are free. The hyoidean arch is attached neither to the
                    suspensorium, nor to the skull; its cornua are very slender, and no distinct
                    body is developed; it is followed by several slender, hooplike, branchial
                    arches. The mandible is dentigerous. Nothing is known of the early stages of
                    development; but Müller discovered branchial clefts, with rudimentary branchial

                    antebrachium and crus remain distinct, and the tarsus is not elongated. The
                    manus and pes appear to have been pentadactyle. Three sculptured pectoral plates
                    and a peculiar dermal armour of small scales, confined to the ventral face of

                    vertebrae, the arches of which, in the adult condition (except, perhaps, in some

                    The latter may be amphicoelous, as in the lower <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi>

                    centra and intervertebral masses contain more or less distinct remains of the
                    notochord. The arches of the trunk vertebrae are connected by zygapophyses; the

                    of two subequal transverse processes, a dorsal “tubercular” process, and a
                    ventral “capitular” process. Sometimes this division prevails throughout the

                    only a small number of the vertebrae which succeed the atlas present traces of

                    form trihedral projections, their dorsal and ventral contours converging instead
                    of diverging, and giving a very characteristic aspect to these vertebrae.</p>

                <p>In some Labyrinthodonts, the capitular and tubercular processes, divergent and
                    subequal in some (probably the anterior) vertebrae, coalesce into one in other
                    vertebrae; and the capitular division being shorter than the tubercular,
                    transverse processes, like those of the middle thoracic region of the
                    crocodiles, are thus produced.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Peromela,</hi> there is a short capitular process, but
                    the tubercular process is represented by a mere facet placed below the

                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi> finally, the vertebrae have only a single
                    transverse process (possibly representing the coalesced double transverse
                    processes of the posterior trunk vertebrae of such <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urodela</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Menopoma),</hi> which, in some of the

                    last-named and some <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> they attain as great
                    relative dimensions as in other <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi> But they are
                    always vertebral ribs, no Amphibian being known to possess more than rudiments
                    of sternal ribs. The atlas is never provided with ribs. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peromela,</hi> ribs are borne by all the other vertebrae, except the very
                    hindmost. In the long-bodied <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> on the other hand,
                    they are restricted to a few of the anterior vertebrae. In the other <hi
                    rend="italic">Urodela</hi> they are usually confined to the prse-sacral and
                    sacral vertebrae; but, in some cases, one or two of the anterior caudal
                    vertebrae have free ribs. The form of the proximal end of the rib corresponds
                    with that of the transverse processes or process. Where this is double, the rib
                    presents a fork, formed by the capitulum and tuberculum; and when the capitular
                    and tubercular transverse processes are of equal length, the capitula and
                    tubercula of the ribs are equal; but when either of the former is shorter than
                    the other, the corresponding part of the rib is longer. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peromela</hi> have no sternum, and that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labyrinthodonta</hi> (if they possessed any) is unknown. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> the sternum never ossifies, and there is no trace of
                    even a cartilaginous sternum in <hi rend="italic">Proteus.</hi> In <hi
                    rend="italic">Menobranchus,</hi> there is a very small cartilaginous sternal
                    plate, which sends lateral prolongations into two of the intermuscular
                    ligaments, representing rudimentary sternal ribs.</p>
                <p>In the Newts<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Γarker

                    sternum becomes a broad and stout plate of cartilage, with a median, posterior,
                    cristate, xiphoid process, and with articular surfaces on its antero-lateral
                    margins for the reception of the coracoids. The sternum attains its highest
                    development in the raniform <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi> the xiphoid process
                    becoming elongated and dilated at its extremity, and more or less converted into
                    bone, while calcification of the body of the sternum itself may also occur.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> the first vertebra always presents two
                    slightly concave articular facets, the faces of which look outwards and forwards
                    to adapt themselves to the occipital condyles. Between these facets, the dorsal
                    moiety of the anterior face of the centrum gives rise to a process, which is
                    little more than a ridge in <hi rend="italic">Proteus,</hi> but in other genera
                    becomes very prominent, and has a curious resemblance to the odontoid process of
                    the axis vertebra of a bird. This “intercondyloid” process of the atlas
                    sometimes <hi rend="italic">{Amphiuma, e.g.)</hi> exhibits on each side, near
                    its termination, an articular facet, which plays on a corresponding facet of the
                    adjacent face of the occipital condyle.</p>
                <p>Mayer <hi rend="italic">(Analecten,</hi> p. 10) was misled by the form of this
                    process into the supposition that the vertebra to which it belongs is not the
                    atlas, but the odontoid, vertebra. But there is a similar process of the first
                    vertebra in the Rays, and the relations of the vertebra to the nerves show that
                    it is certainly not the homologue of the axis vertebra of other Vertebrates. The
                    first spinal nerve, which haa the distribution of the hypo-glossal of the higher
                    <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> passes out of the spinal canal, either
                    between the first and second vertebrae, or through a foramen in the arch of the

                    nerve. This is a very curious circumstance, and requires elucidation by the
                    study of development.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi> the atlas has the same general form, but the

                <p>Among the <hi rend="italic">Labyrinthodonta,</hi> the atlas of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mastodonsaurus</hi> only is known. It presents two concave facets anteriorly,
                    separated for about half their length by a notch, which probably lodged a
                    ligament.</p>
                <p>The atlas of the <hi rend="italic">Peromela</hi> has the two characteristic
                    facets for the occipital condyles, but the intercondyloid process is absent, and

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi> always possess a sacral vertebra (sometimes
                    ankylosed with its predecessor or successor), the transverse processes of which
                    are often enlarged, and sometimes greatly expanded, at their iliac ends. The

                    known.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> the anterior caudal vertebrae, except the

                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi> the caudal vertebrae are replaced by a long
                    coccyx, consisting of an osseous style, to the dorsal aspect of the anterior end

                    presents two concavities (one in <hi rend="italic">Bombinator</hi> and some
                    other genera), which articulate with the corresponding convexities on the
                    posterior face of the centrum of the sacral vertebra. The number of the

                    number of vertebrae (excluding the coccyx) is very constantly nine; though this
                    number undergoes an apparent reduction, in some cases, by the ankylosis of the

                    and that, the development of which has been most carefully studied, may be taken
                    as the starting-point from whence to follow the various modifications of the
                    Amphibian skull. At the sides of the occipital foramen, it presents two large
                    exoccipi-tal ossifications <hi rend="italic">(E. O.),</hi> which bear the
                    prominent occipital con dyles, and, in old specimens, may meet in the middle
                    ventral line.</p>
                <p>Dorsally, however, they remain separated by a narrow tract of cartilage, which
                    may become more or less calcified. External to the condyles, are the foramina,by
                    which the vagus and glosso-pharyn-geal nerves emerge from the cranial cavity;
                    and, beyond these, the bones expand outwards and forwards, so as to embrace the
                    posterior half of the <hi rend="italic">fenestra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ovalis,</hi> while above, they enclose the greater part of the posterior
                    vertical semicircular canal. The cartilage which incloses the summit of the arch
                    of that canal, however, appears always to remain unossified, and its place is
                    occupied by a groove in the dry skull (Fig.</p>
                <p>4, <hi rend="italic">Bp.)</hi> These ossifications, therefore, answer primarily
                    to the exoccipitals, but, in addition, represent the opisthotic and epiotic
                    elements. Above the <hi rend="italic">fenestra</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    belongs) in front. The outer extremity of the tegmen, however, remains
                    cartilaginous, and, in front, it passes into a curved band of cartilage, which,
                    as it is continued backwards into the suspensorium, may be termed the “dorsal
                    crus” of the suspensorium (Fig. 9, <hi rend="italic">c.d.)</hi> The T-shaped
                    squamosal bone (*S⅛∙) sends a broad, flat process inwards, which rests upon the
                    <hi rend="italic">tegmen</hi><hi rend="italic">tympani,</hi> while its long
                    descending process lies external to the cartilaginous suspensorium, and the
                    posterior half of its cross-piece, or proper squamoso-zygomatic part, has the
                    same relation to the dorsal crus of the suspensorium. The suspensorium has a
                    second attachment to the skull, by a “ventral crus” (Fig. 9, e.v.), which
                    diverges from the dorsal crus at the anterior extremity of the suspensorium, and
                    is continued into two branches. One of these, passing outwards and forwards,
                    becomes the pterygoid cartilage. The other (Fig. 9, <hi rend="italic">pd.),</hi>
                    directed backwards and inwards, may be termed the “pedicle of the suspensorium;”
                    it becomes thickened at its inner extremity, and articulates with a facet in
                    front of the <hi rend="italic">fenestra</hi><hi rend="italic">ovalis,</hi> and
                    close to the attachment of the hyoidean cornu. A thin fibrous band extends from
                    this inferior crus to the side walls of the skull, passing between the first
                    division of the fifth nerve in front, and the second and third divisions behind.
                    The space between the dorsal crus of the suspensorium and the pedicle is filled,
                    in the fresh state, with fibrous tissue, which constitutes the anterior boundary
                    of the tympanum. It is traversed (as Dugès long since pointed out) by the
                    posterior division of the seventh nerve, which therefore lies above the pedicle.
                    The pro-otic ossification <hi rend="italic">(Pr. 0.)</hi> not only walls in the
                    anterior part of the otic •capsule, but extends for a short distance forwards in
                    the side walls of the skull. Hence, the foramen of exit for the trigeminal and
                    <hi rend="italic">portio</hi><hi rend="italic">dura</hi> (V.) is pierced in this
                    portion of the pro-otic; and the foramen for the sixth nerve is seen at its
                    lower margin. In front of the pro-otic, the lateral walls of the skull remain
                    cartilaginous for some distance, and are perforated by the large optic foramen
                    (II.) Anteriorly to the exit of the optic nerves, the side walls of the skull
                    are formed by elongated plates of bone, which are parts of an extensive
                    ossification of the anterior moiety of the brain-case and the posterior part of
                    the nasal capsules, constituting the complex structure termed by Cuvier “os en
                    ceinture,” and by Dugès “ethmoide.” As it takes the place of the ethmoid,
                    presphenoid, and orbito-sphenoids, it may be termed the <hi rend="italic"

                    is divided by a longitudinal partition. This half is anterior, the longitudinal
                    partition being represented by the ossified mesethmoid; while the posterior,
                    undivided, half lodges the anterior portion of the cerebral hemispheres and the
                    olfactory lobes. The front wall of this posterior cavity is perforated by the
                    olfactory foramina; while the outer and posterior wall of each anterior, or
                    nasal, chamber presents, where it forms the anterior and inner boundary of the
                    orbit, a small aperture (V<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    ossifications which involve the chondrocranium, though they largely consist of
                    secondary bone. The supra- occipital is represented, if at all, by a mere
                    calcification of the cartilage, and the like is true of the quadrate, which is
                    an ossification of the distal end of the suspensorium. The quadrate, however,
                    very early becomes continuous with a slender style of membrane bone, the proper
                    jugal, which applies itself to the inner face of the posterior end of the
                    maxilla, and thus gives rise to the quadrato-jugal <hi rend="italic">(Q.J.)</hi>
                    Ligamentous fibres also connect the anterior end of the zygomatic process of the

                    fascia over the levators of the mandible, and encircling the orbit. A strong
                    band is continued forwards, over the ascending process of the maxilla, to the

                    which becomes connected with the nasal bones. The palatine bones (2V.) are

                    they come into contact with the pterygoids and maxillae; internally and

                    triradiate bone, with an anterior, an inner, and a posterior, or outer, ray. The

                    2</hi>) underlies the pedicle of the suspensorium, and comes into contact with
                    the end of the transversely elongated, sub-auditory, portion of the

                    suspensorium, along the inner side of which it lies, as far as the articulation
                    of the mandible.</p>
                <p>The vomers (<hi rend="italic">Vo.)</hi> are broad triangular plates of bone, with
                    irregularly-notched outer edges, which are closely applied to the ventral
                    surface of the sphen-ethmoid. Their inner edges are separated by a narrow
                    interval, and each bears numerous teeth, set along a line which is not quite
                    transverse to the axis of the skull. On the dorsal aspect of the skull two
                    elongated flattened bones, united in a median suture, represent the coalesced
                    frontal and parietals <hi rend="italic">(Fr., Pa.),</hi> which are separate in
                    the young frog. In front of these, also meeting in the middle line, are two
                    triangular bones, the apices of which extend outwards to the ascending processes
                    of the maxillae, and which roof over the nasal capsules (Act. ) These correspond

                <p>The parasphenoid has the form of a dagger with a very wide guard and short
                    handle. The latter lies beneath the ventral junction of the exoccipitals, while

                    sphen-ethmoid, but does not reach the vomers. The “guard” passes outwards on
                    each side beneath the auditory capsules, and ends by an abruptly-truncated

                    three portions—a middle elongated osseous rod, an inner swollen and enlarged
                    cartilaginous part, which articulates partly with the pro-otic and partly with
                    the stapes, and an outer portion, which is elongated at right angles to the
                    rest, fixed into the tympanic membrane, and attached by its dorsal end to the
                    <hi rend="italic">tegmen</hi><hi rend="italic">tympani.</hi></p>
                <p>The mandible presents one cartilaginous and three osseous constituents on each
                    side. Of the latter, one, the “Mento-Meckelian” (Parker), is a short curved rod
                    of bone, which unites with its fellow in the symphysis, and is, in fact, the
                    ossified symphysial end of Meckel’s cartilage, which extends thence through the
                    length of the ramus, becoming thicker posteriorly, and furnishing the articular
                    surface for the quadrate. The second, and largest, bony constituent of the
                    mandible is a long membrane bone, which ensheaths the inner and under region of
                    the outer surface of Meckel’s cartilage, rising at one part into a low coronoid
                    process. It obviously represents the angular, coronary, and splenial elements,
                    and may be termed the <hi rend="italic">angulo-splenial (An.)</hi> A small
                    dentary element, which bears no teeth, lies over the outer face of the anterior

                <p>The hyoidean apparatus of the adult frog (Fig. 8) presents a body and two slender
                    cornua. The body consists of a broad and thin squarish plate of cartilage,
                    produced on each side into three processes, which may be called anterior,
                    lateral, and posterior. The anterior process (a)-is slender, curves outwards,
                    and very soon divides into two processes, one short, anterior, forming a loop by
                    its ligamentary connection with the second, or posterior, branch, which passes
                    into the long and slender cornu of the hyoid. The lateral process (δ) passes
                    outwards and slightly dorsad—expanding into a broad, hatchet-shaped free
                    extremity. The posterior process <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> is a mere
                    prolongation of the postero-lateral angles of the body of the hyoid. Finally,
                    from the middle of the posterior margin of the body of the hyoid there project
                    two strong bony rods, wider at the ends than in the middle, which embrace the
                    larynx, and have been termed the <hi rend="italic">thyro-hyals (d).</hi></p>
                <p>The parieto-frontals, nasals, premaxillae, maxillae, squa-mosals, palatines,
                    pterygoids, and parasphenoid, the dentary and angulo-opercular bones, may be
                    removed from the frog’s skull without injury to the chondrocranium, the
                    structure of which then becomes apparent (Fig. 9).</p>
                <p>It furnishes a floor, side walls, and roof to the brain case, interrupted only by
                    a large space (fontanelle), covered in by membrane, which lies in the
                    interorbital region under the parieto-frontals; and by the foramina for the exit
                    of the cranial nerves. It consists entirely of cartilage, except where the
                    exoccipitals, the pro-otics, and the sphen-eth-moidjnvade its substance. In
                    front of the septum of the anterior cavity of the sphen ethmoid, it is continued
                    forward, between the two nasal sacs, as the cartilaginous septum narium, from
                    which are given off, dorsally and ventrally, transverse alae of cartilage, which
                    furnish a roof and a floor, respectively, to the nasal chamber. Of these, the
                    floor is the wider. The dorsal and ventral alae pass into one another where the
                    chondrocranium ends anteriorly, and give rise to a truncated terminal face,
                    which is wide from side to side, narrow from above downwards, and convex in the
                    latter direction. The lateral angles of this truncated face are produced
                    outwards and forwards into two flattened prae-nasal processes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(p. nl.)∙,</hi> these widen externally, and end by free edges, which support
                    the adjacent portions of the premaxillae and maxillae. From the ventral face,
                    just behind the truncated anterior end of the chondrocranium, spring two slender
                    cartilages <hi rend="italic">(r.p., r.p.),</hi> which do not seem to have been
                    noticed hitherto.</p>
                <p>Each of these inclines towards the middle line, and ends against the middle of
                    the posterior face of the ascending process of the premaxilla by a vertically
                    elongated extremity. These may be termed the <hi rend="italic">rhinal</hi>
                    processes. An oval nodule of cartilage is attached to the posterior face of the
                    dorsal end of the ascending process of the premaxilla, and serves to connect it
                    with the rhinal process. On the dorsal face of the chondrocranium, just above
                    the point of attachment of the rhinal processes, the external nasal apertures
                    are situated, and the outer and posterior margins of each of these apertures is
                    surrounded and supported by a curious curved process of the cartilaginous ala —
                    the alinasal process <hi rend="italic">(a.n.)</hi> Where the sphenoidal and the
                    ethmoidal portions of the sphen-ethmoid meet, a stout, transverse, partly

                    off, which is perforated, at its origin, by the canal for the orbito-nasal
                    nerve. It then narrows, but becoming flattened from above downwards, rapidly
                    widens again, and its axe-head-like extremity abuts against the inner face of
                    the maxilla. The anterior angle of the axe-head is free; the posterior angle is
                    continued back into a slender cartilaginous rod, whichbifurcates posteriorly;
                    the outer division passes into the ventral crus <hi rend="italic">(c.v.)</hi> of
                    the suspensorium. The inner <hi rend="italic">(pd.)</hi> is the pedicle of the

                <p>Meckel’s cartilage, articulated to the free end of the suspensorium, is

                    region is small in proportion to the orbito-temporal space. The fronto-parietals
                    are ankylosed together, and extend forwards as far as a line drawn along the
                    anterior edge of the antorbital <pb break="no"

                    bone, consisting of two broad alae, which lie between the anterior edge of the
                    frontal and the external nares, and of a median portion which is continued
                    forwards, as a narrow, flat, curved process, between the nasal chambers, being
                    received into a sort of groove of the chondrocranium. The bone is readily raised
                    up from the subjacent chondrocranium, of which it appears to be quite
                    independent. At the outer end of each of its alae, and between the antorbital
                    process and the nasal capsule, is a small, transversely elongated, slender bone,
                    loosely connected by fibrous tissue with the foregoing. The ethmoid is
                    completely cartilaginous. The parasphenoid has the ordinary sword shape, except
                    that the “guard” is extremely short; but its point extends along the base of the
                    skull, passing between the nasal sacs, underlying their septum, and terminating
                    close to the premaxillae. The vomers are represented by a transversely elongated
                    rhomboidal osseous plate, devoid of teeth, which lies between the two posterior
                    nasal apertures, and therefore much behind the anterior end of the parasphenoid.
                    The side walls of the cranial cavity are ossified from the antorbital process to
                    the anterior boundary of the foramen for the fifth nerve, just in front of which
                    they are pierced by the optic foramen. There is no palatine bone. The pterygoid,
                    in the main, resembles that of the ordinary frogs; but, in consequence of the
                    shortness and little backward extension of the suspensorium, the outer process
                    passes almost directly outwards, with hardly any backward inclination. A bony
                    plate, which extends backwards from the posterior edge of the inner and outer
                    branches of the pterygoid, underlies the tympanic cavity and the auditory
                    capsule, and forms the floor of the Eustachian canal. The squamosal is a short
                    broad bone, with a long anterior process, which becomes connected, by direct
                    articulation, with the pterygoid, and by ligament with the maxilla. The
                    premaxillae are small, and the maxillae are connected merely by ligaments with
                    the suspensorium, there being no jugal. The <hi rend="italic">columella</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">auris</hi> is remarkably strong, and is bent in the middle, so
                    that its two halves form an obtuse angle; the anterior half lies against the
                    inner face of the tympanic membrane. The posterior half runs parallel with the
                    posterior edge of the tegmen tympani, towards the fenestra ovalis. Ligamentous
                    fibres fix the columella firmly, though movably, to the superior margin of the
                    tympanic cavity, where it is bounded by the squamosal. The stout cartilaginous
                    hyoidean cornua are attached just beneath the anterior and inferior part of the
                    margin of the fenestra ovalis. The body of the hyoid is very small, but the two
                    “thyro-hyals” are extremely long and broad cartilages. There is no ossified
                    “mento-Meckelian” element.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Pipa,</hi> the skull is extraordinarily depressed and broad.
                    The nasal bones are wide, flat, triangular, and quite distinct from one another,
                    a forward prolongation of the coalesced fronto-parietals extending between the
                    two. The parasphenoid, very broad in the greater part of its extent, and having
                    the guard rudimentary, sends a narrow median process forwards underneath the
                    nasal septum, as in <hi rend="italic">Dactylethra.</hi> No trace of a vomer, or
                    palatine bone, was to be found in the specimen examined. The pterygoid is very
                    like that of <hi rend="italic">Dactylethra,</hi> but its inner branch is greatly
                    prolonged, and the floor sent under the Eustachian tube unites much more closely
                    with the produced exoccipital. The squamosal is very small, and the place of its
                    zygomatic process is taken by ligament. This ligament, however, unites with the
                    pterygoid in the same way as the bony process which answers to it in <hi
                    rend="italic">Dactylethra.</hi> The columella is less massive than in <hi
                    rend="italic">Dactylethra,</hi> and the end which abuts against the tympanic
                    membrane is imbedded in a disk of cartilage. The occipital condyles look
                    outwards and backwards, instead of inwards and backwards, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Dactylethra.</hi></p>
                <p>The hyoidean cornua are wanting, the thyro-hyals being large, but not so large
                    proportionally as in <hi rend="italic">Dactylethra.</hi></p>
                <p>The skulls of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Urodela</hi> present a very interesting
                    series of modifications, leading from a condition in which the cranium retains,
                    throughout life, a strongly-marked embryonic character, up to a structure which
                    closely approximates that found in the <hi rend="italic">Anura.</hi></p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus,</hi> for example, the chondrocranium of the
                    adult is in nearly the same state as that in which it exists in a young tadpole
                    or larval salamander (Figs. 10, 11, 12).</p>

                <p>Instead of there being a well-developed cartilaginous brain-case, interrupted
                    only by a dorsal fontanelle, as in the frog, both the floor and roof of the
                    cranial cavity are formed by merely fibrous tissue, which underlies the frontal
                    and parietal bones, and overlies the parasphenoid; and only its sides and its
                    anterior end are bounded by cartilage.</p>
                <p>The occipital region remains membranous in the middle line, both dorsally and
                    ventrally, and exhibits, in the latter aspect, the remains of the notochord. The
                    cartilaginous rods (7 <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> r.), which bound the
                    cranial cavity laterally, and represent the <hi rend="italic">trdbeculoe</hi> of
                    the embryonic vertebrate skull, are separated by a wide oval space, which
                    occupies the whole length of the floor of the cranial chamber. Anteriorly, they
                    converge, and, just before they do so, give attachment to the slender antorbital
                    processes (A. <hi rend="italic">O.}</hi> which lie behind the posterior nares.
                    They then unite, and, becoming applied together, coalesce into a flattened
                    narrow mesethmoid, to the anterior extremity of which the premaxillary bones are
                    applied. They give off neither alinasal nor subnasal processes, and therefore
                    furnish neither roof n®r floor to the nasal chamber. Posteriorly, they become
                    flattened from above downwards, and coalesce with the auditory capsules, and
                    with the cartilage which extends beneath these, and gives rise to the occipital
                    condyles (A. 0.)</p>
                <p>Each auditory capsule has a generally oval form, but is produced posteriorly, so
                    as to give rise to a conical epiotic process <hi rend="italic">(Ep. 0.),</hi>
                    which projects beyond the level of the occipital condyle. Fitted into the outer
                    wall of each is the relatively large, conical, stapes, whence strong ligamentous
                    fibres proceed to the posterior face of the suspensorium.</p>
                <p>Immediately in front of the auditory capsule, the suspensorium passes by a strong
                    pedicle (shown, but not lettered in Fig. 12) into the trabecula, and then,
                    directed outwards, downwards, and forwards, ends in the quadrate process
                    (&lt;?), with which the dorsal end of Meckel’s cartilage articulates. A large
                    process (o) ascends from the posterior face of the suspensorium, and applies
                    itself to the outer and anterior face of the auditory capsule. A small and
                    hardly perceptible elevation (p) is seen near the quadrate process of the
                    suspensorium. Finally, a flat process <hi rend="italic">(a,</hi> Fig. 11)
                    ascends above the pedicle, and applies itself to the dorsal face of the
                    trabecula.</p>
                <p>On comparing this with the suspensorium of the frog, it is clear that the
                    rudimentary process (p) answers to the pterygoid cartilage; and that the process
                    <hi rend="italic">o</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">otic</hi> process) answers to
                    the dorsal crus of the suspensorium. In fact, the posterior, or hyo-mandibular,
                    branch of the seventh nerve passes back beneath this, and above the stapedial
                    ligament, to its distribution.</p>
                <p>The pedicle answers to the part so named (including the ventral crus of the
                    suspensorium) in the frog, though it retains the embryonic relations to the
                    trabecula, such as exist in the tadpole. The ascending process (a) lies between
                    the orbito-nasal and the other branches of the trigeminal, the orbito-nasal
                    passing between it and the trabecula. A similar process is very generally found
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Urodela</hi> (being particularly large, for example, in
                    <hi rend="italic">Menopoma),</hi> but appears to be represented only by fibrous
                    tissue in the <hi rend="italic">Anura.</hi></p>
                <p>Meckel’s cartilage (3fc⅛., Fig. 12) is thick and deep at its articular end, but,
                    after furnishing a surface of attachment for the elevator muscles of the jaw, it
                    rapidly narrows, and ends in a point, at some distance from the symphysis of the
                    dentary bones.</p>
                <p>The hyoidean apparatus (Fig. 13) is represented, on each side, by a cartilaginous
                    rod, subdivided into a short <hi rend="italic">hypo-lιyal (IL</hi> Λ.) and long
                    <hi rend="italic">cerato-hyal (C.</hi> A.) A strong ligament extends from the
                    front face of the latter, below its free summit, to the suspensorium, reaching
                    this at the same place as the stapedial ligament, into which it is continued.
                    From a point a little above the attachment of this ligament, another ligamentous
                    band arises, and, crossing the former, on the inner side of which it passes,
                    becomes attached to the angle of the mandible. It answers to the interoperculum
                    of a fish, and has nearly the same relations as the stylo-maxillary ligament of
                    the higher Vertebrata.</p>
                <p>In the ventral median line, the hypo-hyals are connected only by fibrous tissue.
                    Firmly united with this, however, there is a median <hi rend="italic">first
                    basibranchial</hi> cartilage (72δ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>), succeeded by

                    constituent of the hyo-branchial apparatus. There are only three branchial

                <p>The most curious feature in the bony skull, <hi rend="italic"
                    >oτosteo-cranium,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus</hi> is the presence of
                    the prominent conical ossifications which lie external to the exoccipitals,and
                    occupy the place of the <hi rend="italic">epiotic</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >opisthotic</hi> bones. In possessing these elements of the skull, in so large
                    and distinct a form, <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus</hi> differs from all <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphibia,</hi> save <hi rend="italic">Proteus</hi> and the extinct
                    Labyrinthodonts. The parietal bones are separate from the frontals, and send, as
                    is usual in the <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> a long process forwards on each
                    side of the latter. In <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus,</hi> this process is
                    extremely long, reaching the olfactory foramen, the posterior margin of which it
                    bounds. There are no nasal nor prefrontal bones, nor any distinct
                    ali-sphenoidal, orbito-sphenoidal, or ethmoidal ossifications; of the maxilla,
                    nothing but a rudiment appears, and this is sometimes absent. There are no jugal
                    or quadrato-jugal ossifications. A palato-pterygoid plate, bearing teeth on its
                    expanded palatine portion, extends from the antorbital process to the inner face
                    of the suspensorium, which, as stated above, has a mere tubercle in the place of
                    a pterygoid process. The vomers are long, bear teeth along their outer edges,
                    and diverge backwards so as to leave an interspace between their inner edges.
                    Posteriorly, they articulate with the anterior ends of the

                <p>The squamosal is a long, slender, curved bone, devoid of any zygomatic process,
                    which extends from the articular end of the suspensorium, along its outer edge,
                    to the outer side of the epiotic. From its posterior margin it sends down a
                    short process over the stapedial ligament.</p>
                <p>The parasphenoid is a broad thin plate of bone, which extends from near the

                <p>The skull of <hi rend="italic">Proteus</hi> is, in its general characters,
                    similar to that of <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus,</hi> but is more extensively
                    ossified.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Siren,</hi> the skull, which has the same elongated form and
                    forwardly directed suspensoria as in <hi rend="italic">ΛIendbranchus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Proteus,</hi> possesses, in the epiotic region, two strong
                    crests, which project backwards beyond the level of the occipital condyles, but
                    are otherwise very different from the epiotics of the latter genera. The
                    “exoccipitals” and prootics are completely fused together, even in half-grown
                    specimens, a mere rim of cartilage being left around the fenestra ovalis. The
                    lateral walls of the skull present ossifications extending from the exits of the
                    orbito-nasal nerves, forwards to the mesethmoid, or internasal portion of the
                    trabeculae, and completely encircling the olfactory foramina. But these
                    ossifications remain distinct for a considerable time, if they ever coalesce.
                    Each, therefore, represents half of the sphen-ethmoid of the Frog.</p>
                <p>The flat and wide parasphenoid extends forwards to the space left by the
                    divergence of the vomers. On the roof of the skull, each broad parietal sends
                    forward a prolongation along the outer edge of the frontal, which reaches the
                    antorbital process. The premaxillae have very long ascending processes, which
                    lie upon the mesethmoid, and are received between the ends of the frontal bones.
                    Between these ascending processes one or two elongated ossifications are
                    situated. These were termed “nasals” by Cuvier, but their position does not
                    accord with this determination. The horizontal, or oral, portions of the
                    premaxillae, on the other hand, are very short and edentulous, each being coated
                    by a thin plate of horny substance. The maxillae are rudimentary or absent. The
                    vomers are two, flat, oval, bony plates, the ventral aspect of which is beset
                    with parallel rows of teeth set in obliquely-disposed curved lines, the
                    convexities of the curves being turned inwards and backwards. The vomers are in
                    contact anteriorly, but diverge posteriorly. The posterior extremity of each
                    abuts upon a plate of similar form, but much smaller, and bearing fewer series
                    of teeth, which lies on the ventral side of the origin of the antorbital
                    process, and represents the palatine bone. The aperture of the posterior nares
                    lies just opposite, and external to, the junction of these two bones.</p>
                <p>The suspensorium is short, thick, and completely cartilaginous. Dorsally and
                    internally, it is attached by a stout pedicle to the trabecula in front of the
                    auditory capsule, while its dorsal and posterior face lies against the truncated
                    anterior face of the pro-otic. The angle formed where this face joins the outer
                    face represents the otic process of <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus.</hi> There
                    is no pterygoid process, nor any trace of a pterygoid bone. Just above the
                    suspensorium, and seemingly connected with it, there proceeds from the anterior
                    face of the pro-otic region of the skull, a strong, triangular,
                    forwardly-directed cartilaginous process. From the free anterior end of this, a
                    band of fibrous tissue passes, and, encircling the eye, is attached to the
                    antorbital process. The squamosal is a slender curved bone, extending from the
                    epiotic ridge to the articular end of the suspensorium, where it is widest. It
                    exhibits only a rudiment of the well-marked process which extends towards the
                    stapes in <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proteus.</hi> The mandible presents a dentary, an angular, and a dentigerous
                    sρlenial element; and the proximal end of Meckel’s cartilage is ossified, giving
                    rise to a dense nodular <hi rend="italic">articulare.</hi> The dentary is
                    toothless, and supports the inferior horny beak.</p>
                <p>The cornu of the hyoid is very stout, and its ventral moiety is ossified. The
                    much thicker dorsal moiety is cartilaginous, and its recurved dorsal end extends
                    beyond the extremity of the skull. At a considerable distance below its apex, a
                    strong short ligament proceeds from its anterior face to the stapes. A broad
                    sheet of ligamentous fibres further unites the hyoid with the lateral walls of
                    the ear capsule, and with the posterior face of the suspensorium
                    (hyo-suspensorial ligament); and a slender ligament (mandibulo-hyoid) proceeds
                    from near the insertion of the hyo-stapedial ligament to the angle of the
                    mandible. There are two basibranchials, both ossified, the posterior ending in
                    short radiating processes; two cerato-branchials and four epibranchials.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Amphiuma,</hi> the suspensoria are very little inclined
                    forwards, and their long axes make nearly a right angle with that of the skull.
                    The portion of the skull which lies behind a line joining the articular ends of
                    the <hi rend="italic">ossa</hi><hi rend="italic">quadrata</hi> is very much
                    shorter than the region in front of it. Moreover, although the epiotic processes
                    are prominent, the occipital condyles project far beyond them. One bone
                    represents the exoccipital, epiotic, and opis∙∙ thotic on each side. The
                    pro-otic is large, and gives rise to the anterior moiety of a strongly-marked
                    temporal ridge. Its exposed surface presents two fossae, divided by a nearly
                    vertical linear elevation. The large pariétale form the posterior portion of the
                    temporal ridge, and diverge anteriorly, to be continued forwards, on each side
                    of the frontale, to the sphen-ethmoid. The frontals, in like manner, diverge in
                    front to receive a median ossification, which is continuous with the coalesced
                    median processes of the premaxillae. The anterior half of each frontal is
                    rugose, as are the exposed surfaces of the sphen-ethmoid and of the nasal bones,
                    and the integument is firmly adherent to these rugosities. The nasals are broad
                    and triangular. The truncated base of each lies over the nasal aperture; the
                    inner edge articulates with the ascending process of the premaxilla; the outer
                    edge joins first the maxilla, and then the sphen-ethmoid. The premaxillae are so
                    thoroughly ankylosed that no trace of their primitive distinctness is to be
                    seen. The large maxillae extend back for half the length of the skull, are
                    firmly united with the adjacent bones, and are connected by dense ligament with
                    the extremity of the quadrate bone. The greatly elongated vomers diverge but
                    little; nevertheless, they come in contact only by their anterior extremities.
                    In the rest of their extent they are separated, in front, by a median
                    ossification representing the anterior part of the sphen-ethmoid, and, behind,
                    by the anterior forked prolongation of the parasphenoid which embraces this
                    ossification. The rest of the parasphenoid is broad and flat; it widens a
                    little, in front of the auditory capsules, so as to form a rudiment of the
                    “guard” in the frog’s skull.</p>
                <p>The osseous pterygoid is a curved plate of bone, convex inwards and concave
                    outwards, which articulates posteriorly with the quadrate, and, in front, stops
                    short, at little more than half the distance from its posterior end to the
                    internal nostril. The cartilaginous pterygoid process of the suspensorium
                    extends some way beyond it, and, widening, is attached by ligament to the
                    maxilla. Posteriorly, the cartilaginous pterygoid is traceable, as a
                    comparatively narrow band, on the inner side of the bony pterygoid, to the
                    pedicle of the suspensorium, which is attached in front of the fenestra ovalis,
                    and above the rudimentary “guard” of the parasphenoid. An ascending process
                    passes from it between the orbito-nasal and the other divisions of the
                    trigeminal. The otic process of the suspensorium, which is articulated with the
                    outer face of the auditory capsule, is cartilaginous; but the rest of the
                    suspensorium is ossified as a quadrate bone. This is, as usual, clamped to the
                    skull by the squamosal, which is broad and expanded above, and narrow below.
                    Behind, the suspensorium is directly articulated<pb break="no"

                    the stapes. A very strong hyo-suspensorial ligament passes from near the distal
                    end of the suspensorium to the cornu of the hyoid. The mandibulo-hyoid ligament
                    is much weaker. The hyoidean apparatus presents a median basi-hyal, connected by
                    a rounded hypo-hyal on each side, with a long and curved cerato-hyal, which is
                    almost completely ossified. The first basibranchial is elongated and
                    cartilaginous—the second is absent. The first branchial arch is a single
                    elongated bone, representing the similarly coalesced cerato-branchial and
                    epibranchial in <hi rend="italic">Menopoma.</hi> The second cerato-branchial is
                    small and cartilaginous. The three posterior epibranchials are simple curved
                    cartilages; and the single branchial cleft is placed between the third and
                    fourth epibranchials.</p>
                <p>The skulls of the four genera, <hi rend="italic">AIenobranchus, Proteus,
                    Siren,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amphiuma,</hi> now described, resemble one
                    another, and differ from those of other <hi rend="italic">Amphibia,</hi> in
                    their elongated form; and, especially, in the relative narrowness of the facial
                    region in front of the orbits, which, as the case of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphiuma</hi> shows, arises, not from any want of development of the maxillary
                    bones, when they exist, but from their taking a direction which but slightly
                    diverges from parallelism with the axis of the skull. Moreover, they all possess
                    well-marked epiotic prominences. <hi rend="italic">Amphiuma</hi> differs widely
                    from the other three, in the great size of its maxillary bones, in the absence
                    of palatine bones, in the projection of the occipital condyles beyond the
                    epiotic processes, in the ankylosis of the premaxilløe, in the presence of
                    well-developed nasal bones, in the coalescence of the first cerato-branchial
                    with the first epibranchial, and in the transverse direction of the
                    suspensorium.</p>
                <p>In most of those respects, in which <hi rend="italic">Amphiuma</hi> differs from
                    <hi rend="italic">Aienobranchus, Proteus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Siren,</hi>
                    it approaches the Salamanders; especially if we take such forms as <hi
                    rend="italic">Anaides</hi> into account. On the other hand, in the entire
                    absence of a palatine bone, and in the fusion of the first cerato-branchial with
                    its epibranchial, it agrees with <hi rend="italic">Afenopoma</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cryptobranchus.</hi></p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Al·enopoma,</hi> the skull has a broadly-rounded snout, and
                    its posterior contour slopes forwards and outwards (without being interrupted by
                    conspicuous epiotic prominences), in the manner characteristic of the higher <hi
                    rend="italic">Urodela.</hi> The small pro-otics are separated from the
                    exoccipitals (which also represent the epiotics and episthotics), by a wide
                    cartilaginous interspace, in which the fenestra ovalis is situated. The parietal
                    sends a process forwards, along the outer edge of the frontal, between it and
                    the orbito-sphenoid. This meets a curved flat bone, which bounds the orbit
                    anteriorly and internally, and articulates with an ascending process of the
                    maxillary bone. It may therefore be regarded as a prefronto-lachrymal. The
                    frontale unite in a long median suture, and then, diverging, embrace the nasal
                    bones, and articulate externally with the fore part of the ascending process of
                    the maxillary bone, which is thus received between the frontal and the
                    prefronto-lachrymal. The very broad parasphenoid extends from the exoccipitals
                    to the vomers, with which it unites by a denticulated squamous suture. The wide
                    vomers are united by a median suture, and expand in front, ending in arched
                    edges, close behind which the teeth are set. The premaxillae are separate and
                    small, articulate with the arched edges of the vomers, and send up strong
                    ascending processes to the dorsal face of the skull, where they firmly unite
                    with the nasals. The squamosal is a flattened prismatic bone, as broad at one
                    end as at the other, which articulates with the parietal externally, and with
                    the quadrate internally. Like the suspensorium, which it covers, it stands out
                    at right angles with the axis of the skull. There is no palatine bone. The
                    pterygoid is broader and more square than in any other Amphibian, in consequence
                    of the great expansion of its internal process, which articulates by its whole
                    length with the parasphenoid. The anterior process ends in a free pointed
                    cartilage, directed outwards and forwards, and united with the maxilla by
                    ligament, as in the higher <hi rend="italic">Urodela.</hi> The external process
                    extends to the articular end of the quadrate, as usual, and is continued thence
                    along the cartilaginous suspensorium to its attached end.</p>
                <p>The chondrocranium forms a complete ring of cartilage round the occipital
                    foramen, continuous at the sides with the auditory capsules. From these the
                    trabeculae are continued forwards, as in <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus,</hi>
                    leaving a very wide ventral fontaneUe. At the anterior end of this they unite
                    and form the mesethmoid, from which roof and floor plates of the nasal capsules
                    are continued. The suspensorium is connected by a pedicle with the trabecula, in
                    front of the auditory capsule, and gives off a broad ascending process, which
                    becomes ossified continuously with the pterygoid, over the orbito-nasal nerve. A
                    stout otic process is articulated with a facet on the antero-external region of
                    the periotic capsule, and is further connected with it by ligamentous fibres.
                    The quadrate ossification involves a small portion of the articular end of the
                    suspensorium; it thence extends upwards, on the dorsal aspect of the
                    suspensorium, gradually becoming more slender, and nearly reaches the point at
                    which the otic process of the suspensorium articulates with the periotic
                    cartilage.</p>
                <p>The osseous skull of <hi rend="italic">Cryptobranchus</hi> is extremely like that
                    of <hi rend="italic">Afenopoma.</hi></p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Aienopoma</hi> the hyo-branchial apparatus presents the same
                    general structure as that of <hi rend="italic">Siredon,</hi> except that the
                    second basibranchial seems to be wanting, while the first is very broad and
                    rounded; at the same time, the epibranchial and the cerato-branchial of the
                    first arch aro represented by only one continuous cartilage.</p>

                    has taken place, the two posterior pairs of branchial arches present in <hi
                    rend="italic">Aienopoma</hi> having disappeared. The second arch still presents
                    a division into cerato-branchial and epibranchial, but the dorsal end of the
                    latter is closely united with that of the preceding arch. It is interesting to
                    observe, however, that the modification thus effected is quite different from
                    that which occurs in the Salamanders, in which, in the adult state, the first
                    branchial arch retains its ’ two segments; while the second, reduced to its
                    cerato-branchial, is applied against the first, at the junction of the
                    cerato-and epi-branchial; and the second basibranchial persists as the <hi

                    further differ from the proper Salamanders in having the vomerine teeth disposed
                    along the anterior edges of the expanded vomers. Unfortunately nothing is known
                    of the larvae of these forms, but it would seem as if, in them, the primitive
                    vomers enlarge by extension of ossification behind, and not in front of, the
                    originally existent teeth.</p>
                <p>Tn the remaining <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> the Salamanders proper, the
                    skull has the broadly-arched snout and the shelving posterior contour of <hi
                    rend="italic">Menopoma,</hi> but the vomers and pterygoids are very
                    different.</p>
                <p>The structure of the skull in these animals will be best understood by commencing
                    with that of <hi rend="italic">Siredon,</hi> which, though perenno-branchiate

                <p>An ossification on each side of the occipital foramen represents the

                    is sometimes united with its fellow of the opposite side. <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 1</hi> The skull is roofed in by pairs of parietal, frontal,
                    prefronto-laehrymal, and nasal bones. The maxillae are short, and are united
                    with the ends of the suspensorium only by fibrous tissue. There is a very broad
                    and flat parasphenoid, which extends from the inferior margin of the occipital
                    foramen, and ends, anteriorly, by a wide, irregularly convex edge, which does
                    not reach the vomers. The latter bones are elongated and curved, and their long
                    axes diverge posteriorly, as in <hi rend="italic">Meno-branchus;</hi> but their
                    anterior ends are far apart, and they lie, separated by the whole breadth of the
                    parasphenoid, and between that bone and the premaxilla and maxilla, adherent to
                    the ventral face of the subnasal process of the chondrocranium.</p>
                <p>The short palatine bones are situated immediately behind, and on the inner side
                    of, the posterior nares, but their somewhat tapering, external and posterior,
                    ends do not articulate directly with the pterygoids. The latter are triradiate
                    bones, with an inner process which passes towards the base of the skull; an
                    outer, which runs down the suspensorium; and a long anterior process, which
                    gradually diminishes in breadth forwards, and is connected only by ligament with
                    the palatine. Three ossifications embrace Meckel’s cartilage. The dentary covers
                    its outer face throughout its whole length. The angular lies on the inner face
                    of its posterior two-thirds, and the small dentigerous splenial is also applied
                    to its inner face between the angular and the dentary. The chondrocranium is in
                    much the same condition as that of <hi rend="italic">Menopoma.</hi> There is a
                    broad basicranial cartilage situated between the auditory capsules, and passing,
                    at the sides and above, into a complete occipital arch. But, in front, the
                    trabeculae, though they have increased in vertical height, remain united by
                    fibrous tissue only, both in the floor and in the roof of the skull, which thus
                    presents two great “fontanelles” when the parasphenoid, parietals, and frontals
                    are removed. In front, they coalesce, each giving off, as it does so, a flat
                    antorbital process, which is expanded at its outer end, where it supports the
                    maxilla. Below, this process gives attachment to the pala tine. By their
                    coalescence, the trabeculae give rise to a broad internasal septum (or
                    mesethmoid cartilage), and they expand, on each side, below, into subnasal
                    plates, which are separated, anteriorly, by a wide notch in the middle line. The
                    curved outer edges of these plates give attachment to the premaxillae and
                    maxillae, and they answer to the prae-nasal processes of the chondrocranium of
                    the frog. Between the posterior edge of each of these and the anterior edge of
                    the corresponding antorbital process, the posterior nostril is situated; and the
                    inferior surface of the subnasal plate gives attachment to the vomer.
                    Superiorly, the mesethmoid cartilage expands into a very thin (alinasal) plate,
                    which roofs in each nasal chamber, and supports the prefronto-laehrymal and
                    nasal bones.</p>
                <p>The suspensorium is connected, above and internally, with the trabecula of its
                    side by a pedicle; and it has an ascending process which lies over the
                    orbito-nasal nerve (which is therefore included between the pedicle and the
                    ascending pri <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> &gt;ess) immediately after its exit
                    from the skull. Posteriorly and superiorly, it gives off an otic process, which
                    is articulated with the outer and front part of the auditory capsule; while,
                    inferiorly and externally, it furnishes an articular surface to the mandible.
                    The pterygoid process has the form of a style tapering forwards, and nearly
                    reaching the antorbital process, with which it is connected, however, only by
                    ligamentous fibres. The posterior moiety of Meckel’s cartilage is very stout as
                    far as the coronoid process, and then tapers rapidly to its free, pointed,
                    symphysial extremity.</p>
                <p>The hyoidean and branchial apparatus is entirely fibrous and cartilaginous, none
                    of its parts having undergone ossification. Each cornu of the hyoid is connected
                    with the upper and posterior face of the suspensorium, and with the angle of the
                    mandible, by ligamentous fibres—the hyosuspensorial and mandibulo-suspensorial
                    ligaments. The cornua are not subdivided, and are united in the median ventral
                    line by ligament. A triangular first basibranchial extends back from their
                    junction, and is succeeded by a second, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Menobranchus;</hi> but this second basibranchial is not ossified. Two
                    cerato-branchials are attached to the posterior extremity of the first
                    basibranchial on each side, and the anterior is, as usual, followed by a long
                    and strong epibranchial, which supports the anterior gill. The posterior
                    cerato-branchial supports the second epibranchial directly, and the third and
                    fourth epibranchials indirectly.</p>
                <p>The interesting observations of Professor A Duméril have shown that, under
                    certain conditions, the ordinarily perenni-branchiate <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siredon</hi> passes into the caduci-branchiate <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amblystoma;</hi> and this metamorphosis is accompanied by some very interesting
                    modifications in the structure of the cranium, especially in the vomerine,
                    palatine, and pterygoid regions. Ossification extends forwards from the vomers
                    beneath-the prae-nasal processes, so that the series of teeth, which originally
                    lay along the anterior margins of these bones, come to be situated at their
                    posterior edges. At the same time they take up a direction at right angles to
                    the axis of the skull, instead of being greatly inclined to that axis, as they
                    are in <hi rend="italic">Siredon,</hi> and the two sets of vomerine teeth thus
                    form a single transverse row. Moreover, the anterior process of the pterygoid
                    moves outwards until it comes into contact with the inner face of the maxilla.
                    The one end of the palatine remaining attached to the vomer, the other swings
                    outwards, in correspondence with the change of position of the pterygoid, and
                    thus becomes directed transversely to the axis of the skull, immediately behind
                    the posterior nostril, its teeth continuing the transverse line of the teeth of
                    the vomers. Salamanders with the teeth thus disposed have been termed
                    “lechrio-dont.” The maxillary bones are larger than in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siredon,</hi> but the jugal arch remains ligamentous. The dorsal ends of the
                    cornua of the hyoid retain their ligamentous connection with the suspensorium,
                    and the ventral ends with the anterior basibranchial. The first cerato-branchial
                    and epibranchial persist, and retain their articulation with one another. The
                    second cerato-branchial remains, but its dorsal or outer end becomes attached to
                    the preceding, and all the three posterior epibranchials disappear. The second
                    basibranchial becomes detached as a Y-shaped piece, which lies in the middle
                    line, in front of the larynx.</p>
                <p>In all the other Salamanders, the vomers, in the adult, present the same
                    enlargement of the part in front of the teeth, at the expense of the region
                    behind them, as in <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma.</hi> But the teeth rarely offer
                    the same disposition. More commonly they form two series, inclined to one.
                    another at a more or less acute angle, open forwards, and supported upon bony
                    plates, which appear like prolongations of the vomers, extending backwards on
                    the ventral face of the parasphenoid. This “mc-codont” arrangement is strikingly
                    exemplified by <hi rend="italic">Salamandra maculosa,</hi> and still more
                    remarkably by <hi rend="italic">Plcthodon</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anaides,</hi> where these longitudinal series of teeth beneath the parasphenoid
                    are commonly termed “sphenoidal” teeth. Dugès <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> and
                    other observers, however, have shown that, in larval <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salamandrae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tritones,</hi> the vomerine and
                    palato-pterygoid apparatus have, at first, the same disposition as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Siredon;</hi> and Dugès has described the process by which the
                    palatine bones, becoming detached from the pterygoids, which rotate outwards,
                    ankylose with the vomers, taking up a position beneath the parasphenoid, and
                    more or less parallel with the axis of the skull; and it can hardly be doubted
                    that the so-called “sphenoidal” dentigerous plates of other genera of <hi
                    rend="italic">Salamandrida</hi> have the same origin. If this conclusion be
                    correct, it indicates a very curious morphological difference between the
                    “mecodont” and “lechriodont” <hi rend="italic">Salaman∙ drida.</hi></p>
                <p>In all the <hi rend="italic">Salamandrida</hi> the parietal bones send long
                    processes forw ards on each side of the frontals. The parasphenoid is a broad
                    flat .plate. V ery often the premaxillae are ankylosed into one bone, and the
                    bones of the periotic capsule coalesce. In some cases there are epiotic
                    processes or ridges. Maxillae are always present, and the snout is usually
                    broadly arched. Nasal bones, distinct from the prefronto-lachrymals, are usually
                    present.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="italic">Anaides</hi> the skull is comparatively long and
                    narrow, and the muzzle is less arched than usual. The single premaxilla, and the
                    two well-developed maxillae, follow the semicir∙ cular curve of the broad
                    subnasal plates, to the edges of which they are attached. The hinder free
                    extremities of the maxillae are curved upwards, and the jugal arch is
                    represented only by ligament. Thus far the skull is salamandrine; as it is also
                    in the presence of distinct nasal and prefronto-laehrymal bones, in the
                    disposition of the vomerine and so-called “sphenoidal” teeth, in the absence of
                    an apparent palatine bone, and in the manner in which the pterygoid is produced
                    into a long process, which becomes connected with the inner face of the maxilla.
                    But, in the well-marked downward and forward inclination of the suspensorium,
                    and in the strong crests into which the epiotic processes are developed, the
                    skull <hi rend="italic">oi Anaides</hi> is very like that of <hi rend="italic"

                    ossifications, which rise on to the roof of the skull, where they unite in a
                    short suture, and, spreading out so as to embrace the parietals, are continued
                    over the auditory apparatus, as far as the squamosal and the quadrate bones.
                    Ventrally, no indication of any suture between these bones and the broad
                    parasphenoid is visible; laterally, they pass forward into a continuous
                    ossification, which constitutes the side walls of the auditory capsule, and, in
                    front of this, is perforated by the wide foramen for the trigeminal nerve, and
                    enters largely into the lateral wall of the cranial cavity. The parietal bone
                    rests on the dorsal edge of this lateral ossification, which terminates,

                <p>excavated border, between which and the posterior margin of the βphen-ethmoid the
                    cranial wall is unossified. Throughout its whole extent, this large
                    ossification, which represents the exoccipitals, the elements of the periotic
                    capsule, and the alisphenoids, is firmly ankylosed with the parasphenoid. There
                    is a well-developed sphenethmoid, similar in its general characters to that of
                    the frog. It is very closely united, if not ankylosed, with the vomers and
                    premaxillae. The roof of the skull is completed by two parietals, two frontals,
                    and two large nasals, which unite in a long suture, except in front, where, for
                    a short distance, they are separated by the ascending processes of the
                    premaxillae. The dentigerous oral processes of these bones are short, and unite
                    by suture with the maxillae. These send up broad plates which lie in front of
                    and below the orbit, on the sides of the face. The canal for the suborbital
                    tentacle perforates the maxilla in front of the orbit. Posteriorly, the maxilla
                    unites with the squamosal, which is a broad plate firmly fixed to the quadrate,
                    but somewhat loosely united with the frontal and parietal and with the · complex
                    occipito-otic bone. A small crescentic post-orbital bone (denoted by 1 in Fig.
                    14) articulates with the maxillary and squamosal, and with another bone (2),
                    which answers very nearly to the prefrontal of a reptile. Between the nasal bone
                    and the premaxilla, above and below, and the maxilla behind, a small bone (3) is
                    fitted. The quadrate bone is represented by the ossification of the distal end
                    of the suspensorium, which is inclined a little backwards. The stapes is large
                    and well ossified. Two distinct ossifications, an angulo-articular and a
                    dentary, are discernible in the mandible; and the second short row of teeth,

                    element.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Labyrinthodonta</hi> the skull presents the extremes
                    of form which are met with among the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia,</hi> from the
                    elongation observable in <hi rend="italic">Archegosaurus,</hi> to the short and
                    broad form of <hi rend="italic">Metopias</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brachyops.</hi> The chief characters by which the laby-rinthodont cranium
                    differs from that of its existing allies are the following :—</p>
                <p>The occipital condyles in some genera remained long, if not permanently,
                    cartilaginous; and one or two supra-occipital ossifications (probably membrane
                    bones) very generally occur. The epiotics are prominent, and appear to remain
                    permanently separate from the adjacent bones. In front of them, and articulated
                    with the outer edges of the parietal and frontal, are two bones, which are
                    commonly identified with the “squamosal” and “post-frontal” of the higher
                    Vertebrata. The “post-frontal” articulates anteriorly with a large “prefrontal”
                    bone, which bounds the dorsal and anterior contour of the orbit. The outer edges
                    of the “squamosal” and “post-frontal” articulate with two bones, termed the
                    “postorbital” and the “supra-temporal.” The post-orbital lies in front of the
                    other, and contributes to the posterior margin of the orbit,— the rest of the
                    contour of which, between the post-orbital and the prefrontal, is usually
                    completed by a large jugal. Articulated, dorsally and internally, with the
                    “supra-temporal,” and, anteriorly, with the jugal, is a “quadrato-jugal,” which
                    sometimes extends into the articular surface for the lower jaw, and in some
                    cases, at any rate, overlaid a quadrate ossification. There are long paired
                    nasals, between the anterior ends of which the ascending processes of the
                    premaxillae are received; and between these bones, the unusually long maxillae,
                    and the prefrontals, distinct “lachrymal” ossifications occur.</p>
                <p>The vomers are large, meet in a long median suture, and bear teeth. The palatine
                    bones, also dentigerous, bound the posterior nares in front, and are elongated
                    antero-posteriorly.</p>
                <p>The mandible presents a dentary (probably including a splenial) element, an
                    angular and an articular ossification.</p>
                <p>Those surfaces of the cranial bones which were covered by the skin are usually
                    rugose, and sculptured much in the same way as those of the crocodiles, and they
                    frequently present symmetrically-disposed grooves, the so-called “mucous
                    canals,” which, very probably, lodged sensory apparatuses resembling the
                    similarly-named structures in fishes—the homologues of which are found in
                    existing <hi rend="italic">Urodela.</hi></p>
                <p>The hyoid is unknown, and what appears to be traces of a branchial apparatus have
                    been observed only in young specimens of <hi rend="italic">Archegosaurus.</hi>
                    Hence it is probable, not only that no known Labyrinth-odonts were
                    perennibranchiate, but that the air-breathing condition supervened early in the
                    course of their development.</p>
                <p>The Labyrinthodonts doubtless possessed a well-developed chondrocranium, but such
                    a structure would necessarily perish in the course of fossilisation. The
                    singular resemblance of the labyrinth-odont skull to that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Peromela,</hi> in the arrangement of the bones which bound the
                    cavity of the mouth, and the disposition of the teeth upon them, suggests a
                    comparison of the other cranial bones in the two groups. Starting from the
                    nasals of <hi rend="italic">Epicrium,</hi> which may be safely identified with
                    those of the Labyrinthodonts, the bone marked (2) in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epicrium</hi> corresponds very closely with the labyrinthodont “prefrontal;”
                    and that numbered (1), with the “post-orbital.” No. 3 in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epicrium,</hi> in some respects answers to the so-called “lachrymal” of the
                    Labyrinthodonts; while the maxilla of the Caecilian may be taken to represent
                    both maxilla and jugal of the Labyrinthodont. But if this be so, the squamosal
                    of <hi rend="italic">Epicrium</hi> corresponds with the supra-temporal of the
                    Labyrinthodont; and a question arises as to the true nature of the “squamosal”
                    and “post-frontal” of the latter.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The long bones, both in the fore and hind limbs, consist of an axis of cartilage,
                    sheathed in, and more or less replaced by, a diaphysis of membrane bone. The
                    extremities of the cartilages frequently undergo calcification, and are thus
                    converted into epiphyses. A strong crest characterises the humerus in many male

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Salamandrida</hi> usually have seven carpal elements. In
                    the proximal row there are two—a radiale and a coalesced intermedium and ulnare.
                    There is a single centrale and four distalia. These are variously ossified
                    until, in <hi rend="italic">Triton</hi><hi rend="italic">cristatus</hi> and <hi

                <p>No urodele amphibian has more than four digits in the manus, and the number may

                    When four digits are present the number of the phalanges is usually 2, 2, 3,
                    2.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi> Dugès and Gegenbaur have shown that <hi
                    rend="italic">Bom-binator</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pelobates</hi> have eight
                    distinct carpal bones—two in the proximal row (radiale, intermedium-ulnare),
                    five in the distal, and one between these two rows. This last, which is the
                    centrale, lies on the radial side of the manus, and articulates with the three
                    radial distalia, much as the navicular hone articulates with the three
                    cuneiformia in the mammalian tarsus. In <hi rend="italic">Rana</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">esculenta,</hi> there are also two bones in the proximal row, and
                    the centrale lies on the radial side of the carpus. But there are only three
                    bone3 in the distal row; one large, on the ulnar side, which bears the third,
                    fourth, and fifth metacarpals, and two small ossicles on the radial side, which
                    articulate with the first and second metacarpals.</p>
                <p>There are five digits in the manus of the <hi rend="italic">Anura;</hi> but the
                    pollex is rudimentary, being represented only by a cartilaginous or more or less
                    ossified style. The second and third digits usually have two phalanges each, and
                    the fourth and fifth, three (2, 2, 3, 3).</p>
                <p>The pectoral arch of the Labyrinthodonts is best known in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archegosaurus,</hi> where it presents three ossified elements, which probably
                    answer to the coracoid, praecoracoid, and scapula. The bones of the fore-limb in
                    the Labyrinthodonts are always weak relatively to the size of the body. There
                    appear to have been five digits, the carpus remaining unossified.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Proteus, Menobranchus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphiuma,</hi> the pelvic arch is not connected with any distinctly modified
                    sacral vertebra, and the ilium is very small. The pubes and ischia are
                    represented by broad cartilaginous plates, which unite, and may become fused
                    together in the middle line.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus,</hi> the pubic portion of the pelvis is
                    continued forwards into a broad triangular median process. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siredon, Menopoma, Cryptobranchus,</hi> and the Salamanders, there is a similar
                    median process, reminding one of the omosternum in the pectoral arch of the <hi

                    in the <hi rend="italic">Urodela.</hi></p>
                <p>Hyrtl has shown that <hi rend="italic">Cryptobranchus</hi> has no proper
                    knee-joint, the femur being united with the tibia and fibula by a solid fibrous
                    mass; and that, in <hi rend="italic">Menopoma,</hi> the cavity of the knee-joint
                    is very small.</p>
                <p>The tibia and fibula in the <hi rend="italic">Urodela</hi> arc always separate,
                    and the proximal elements.' of the tarsus are not elongated. The greatest number

                    rend="italic">Menopoma,</hi> which, according to Hyrtl, have three cartilages in

                    there is one more distal cartilage. The tarsus therefore consists of three

                    interesting to remark that the two fibular distalia sometimes become united into
                    a “cuboid.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Menobranchus</hi> has two (or three) proximal, one central, and

                    and two distal; <hi rend="italic">Proteus,</hi> two cartilages on the fibular,

                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi> the ilium is greatly elongated, and the
                    pubes and ischia are flattened, discoidal, and applied together by their inner

                    there is no praepubic process.</p>
                <p>The tibia and fibula coalesce into one bone. Two elongated bones form a proximal

                    >esculenta,</hi> the distal confluent ends of these bones (which possibly answer
                    to the astragalus and calcaneum) present a transversely elongated articular
                    surface, which is convex from the dorsal to the plantar side. Between this and
                    the proximal end of the second and third metatarsals lies a discoidal, more or
                    less calcified, cartilage. The convex distal face of this cartilage articulates
                    with these two metatarsals. From its fibular side a strong ligamentous band
                    passes to the proximal end of the fifth metatarsal, and a fibrous plate to the
                    fibular and plantar edge of the fourth metatarsal, so that the band and plate
                    are interposed between these metatarsals and the coalesced astragalus and

                    intestine. The latter opens into a cloaca, which receives the ducts of the
                    urinary and genital apparatus. The stomach and intestine are enclosed in

                <p>These five segments of the heart are so arranged, that the sinus and atrium lie

                    of a of winch the sinus and atrium occupy the upper, and the other segments the
                    lower half. But it also always presents, more or less, a lateral flexure,
                    between its anterior and posterior points of adherence to the middle line of the

                    and the left half by the atrium and sinus. The pylangium, in fact, always arises

                    above the ventricle, without sensibly projecting behind it, and the
                    sinu-auricular opening lies in the dorsal face of the atrium, in front of the
                    level of the auriculo-ventricular aperture. In other words, the segments of the

                    into two cavities, of which the left is smaller than the right, by a septum,
                    which extends from the left wall of the <hi rend="italic">atrium</hi> towards
                    the auriculo-ventricular aperture. The cavity of the auricular segment thuβ
                    becomes divided into a smaller, left, auricle, which lies behind and to the left
                    of the septum, and a larger, right, auricle, to the right and in front of the
                    septum. In the Frogs, the <hi rend="italic">septum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >auricularum</hi> is a complete partition, containing muscular fibres, and the

                <p>It divides the auriculo - ventricu - lar aperture, passing from one auriculo -
                    ventricular valve to the other, and ending between them by a free edge, which
                    might almost be said to lie in the cavity of the ventricle (Fig. 23).</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Lissotriton</hi><hi rend="italic">punctatus,</hi> and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Siredon,</hi> the septum, still complete, ends in the cavity of
                    the auricular segment by a free edge, which arches over the auriculo-ventricular
                    aperture. In <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus,</hi> the septum is reduced to
                    little more than a wide-meshed network of branched muscular bands, and, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Proteus,</hi> the existence of a septum is doubtful.</p>
                <p>The auriculo-ventricular aperture is always situated at the left side of the
                    posterior end of the auricular segment, where the latter joins the ventricle. In

                    valves, the free edges of which, directed towards the ventricular cavity, are
                    kept down by fine tendinous filaments.</p>
                <p>The common trunk, formed by the union of the two pulmonary veins, runs over the

                    passes between the two superior cavae, and, usually dilating, opens into the

                    separated from it only by the septum, which continues the direction of the right
                    wall of the pulmonary vein.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ventricular</hi> segment always has thick walls and a
                    comparatively small cavity, which lies in the anterior half or base of the

                    in reality, consists of the origins of the aortic arches, closely united
                    together <hi rend="italic">(synangium),</hi> while the former subdivision is the

                    each row; the lower or posterior row being close to the opening of communication
                    between the pylan-gium and the ventricle, while the other row is near the
                    anterior end of the pylangium.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Siredon</hi> (Figs. 15 and 16) there is the same division
                    into a pylangium proper and a large oval bulb-like synangium, formed by the
                    united aortic arches. Three valves in a transverse row are situated at each end
                    of the pylangium. An oblique ridge projects from the dorsal wall of the
                    pylangium, beginning low on the left side, and gradually increasing in size,
                    until it passes into the dorsal valve of the anterior row. There is a small
                    space in front of the anterior row of valves, into which projects the posterior

                    septum, which divides the cavity of the synangium. From this thick partition
                    thinner septa radiate to the walls of the synangium, which they thus divide into
                    five longitudinal canals, of which that which lies to the right is twice as
                    large as any of the others. In fact, it also becomes subdivided, further
                    forwards, by a longitudinal septum, and then there are six canals answering to
                    the six aortic arches which spring from the synangium, where it reaches the
                    anterior end of the pericardium. According to Hyrtl’s account, the pylan-gium of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cryptobranchus</hi> has a very similar structure; but the
                    synangium is completely split into two trunks, each of which contains three
                    canals.</p>
                <p>This leads to the structure of the <hi rend="italic">truncus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">arteriosus</hi> observed in the Frogs, which consists almost
                    wholly of the pylangium. Three thick semilunar valves are placed at the
                    ventricular end of this region, and three others, also of unequal dimensions, at
                    its synangial end. A longitudinal ridge, with a rounded, free, ventral edge,
                    projects from the dorsal wall of the pylangium. It is thicker anteriorly than
                    posteriorly, and is directed obliquely, so that its anterior end passes into the
                    right anterior valve, while its posterior extremity is close to the left
                    posterior valve. The anterior valves of the pylangium (v <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>) are much larger than the posterior valves; and, of the three anterior
                    valves, that which lies on the dorsal side is the smallest. Immediately beyond
                    it is situated the aperture <hi rend="italic">(p),</hi> which leads into the
                    pulmonary trunks. In front of the pulmonary aperture is a wide cavity, whence
                    the two great aortic trunks <hi rend="italic">(Ao, Ao</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> v</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> spring. A tongue-like projection
                    springs from the dorsal wall, and divides the cavity imperfectly. On the ventral
                    side of the base of this tongue are the two openings <hi rend="italic">(Ca)</hi>
                    which lead into the carotid trunks. The three trunks—carotid, aortic, and
                    pulmonary—pass out of the pericardium together, so closely united that they
                    appear one. It is only at some distance beyond the pericardium that they
                    separate,—the anterior ending in the <hi rend="italic">rete mirabile,</hi> which
                    has received the name of the “carotid gland;” the middle becoming the arch of

                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Peromela (e.g.</hi><hi rend="italic">Epier</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">turn),</hi> the heart presents many singular peculiarities (Fig.
                    24). In the first place, it is moved back to a distance which is relatively far
                    greater than in any other <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> and in most lizards.
                    Next, it is extremely elongated, and the <hi rend="italic">truncus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">arteriosus</hi> is relatively more prolonged than any other part
                    of the heart. But the relative proportions of the pylangium and Synangium are
                    the reverse of those which obtain in the <hi rend="italic">Anura.</hi> Tho two
                    transverse rows of valves which mark the boundaries of the pylangium are
                    situated close to one another, near the origin of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >truncus,</hi> all the rest of which is made up of the synangium. A longitudinal
                    partition, at first, divides the cavity of the synangium into two unequal
                    passages; but, towards its anterior end, it contains four equal canals. Having
                    reached the anterior extremity of the pericardium, the synangium divides, and
                    the two pairs of canals become independent, but closely united, trunks, which
                    run, on each side of the trachea, to about the level of the glottis. Here the
                    two trunks join, and pass into the single arch of the aorta, which turns sharply
                    back beneath the vertebral column. The carotid artery is given off from the
                    junction of the two trunks with the single dorsal aortic arch. Shortly before
                    the two trunks join, that upon the dorsal side gives off the pulmonary artery. A
                    single pulmonary vein opens into the left auricle; and it is worthy of notice,
                    that the auricles and sinus are situated as far forwards on the dorsal aspect of
                    the heart as in the Frogs.</p>
                <p>As regards the number and destination of the great vessels which arise from the
                    synangium, great differences obtain in the different groups of the <hi

                <p>In the perennibranchiate <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> each of the three, or
                    four, branchial arches has its appropriate aortic trunk, which springs
                    mediately, or immediately, from, the synangium. The three anterior aortic trunks
                    supply the gills, but are not wholly distributed to them; so that the trunks
                    which unite to form the dorsal aorta are derived partly from the gills and
                    partly come directly from the ventral aorta. The anterior aortic arch gives off,
                    on its ventral side, a hyomandibular artery to the walls of the oral cavity,
                    which appears to represent the remains of the hyoidean and mandibular aortic
                    arches, while, dorsally, it supplies the internal carotid. The pulmonary artery
                    is given off from the fourth aortic arch, or from the common trunk, which is
                    formed by the union of this with those which precede it.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Cryptobranchus,</hi> according to Hyrtl, three trunks are
                    given off on each side from the synangium. The most anterior corresponds with
                    the hyomandibular artery of the perennibranchiate forms. The second belongs to
                    the first branchial arch. It gives off no branch, but unites with the third and
                    largest vessel to form a common trunk, which unites with its fellow beneath the
                    vertebral column, and gives rise to the dorsal aorta. The posterior aortic arch
                    gives off the pulmonary artery (which supplies a branch to the alimentary
                    canal). From the common trunk a maxillary and an internal carotid artery are
                    supplied; while a third branch passes to the ventral side of the atlas, and,
                    turning backwards, passes between the transverse process of the second and
                    succeeding vertebrae as a collateral vertebral artery.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Salamamdra,</hi> there are four aortic arches. The most
                    anterior of these belongs to the first branchial arch. It gives off a
                    hyomandibular branch, then breaks up into a <hi rend="italic">rete
                    mirabile,</hi> whence the internal carotid artery is continued, and is connected
                    by a mere <hi rend="italic">ductus Botalli</hi> with the second arch. The second
                    and third arches give off no branches; but, along with the slender <hi
                    rend="italic">ductus Botalli</hi> of the fourth arch, coalesce into the trunk
                    which unites with its fellow to form the dorsal aorta. The fourth arch gives off
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n809/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0809-0766"/> pulmonary artery, and a smaller dorsal cutaneous
                    branch (Hyrtl). The pulmonary artery gives twigs to the stomach.</p>
                <p>It is clear that the posterior trunk of <hi rend="italic">Cryptobranchus</hi>
                    represents the second, third, and fourth aortic arches of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salamandra;</hi> and that the first aortic arch of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salamandra</hi> answers to the first and second trunks which spring from the
                    synangium of <hi rend="italic">Cryptobranchus.</hi></p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi> there are apparently only two aortic arches;
                    but, as has already been observed, each of them is divided into three canals.
                    The anterior canal ends in a <hi rend="italic">rete mirabile,</hi> whence the
                    internal carotid artery proceeds, and it gives off the hyomandibular or lingual
                    artery. It therefore answers to the first arch of the Salamanders. The second or
                    middle canal is the largest, and passes into a trunk which runs along the sides
                    of the gullet; and curving backwards, unites with that of the opposite side in
                    the dorsal aorta. The third canal ends in a trunk which divides into the
                    pulmonary and the great cutaneous arteries, which latter is distributed to the
                    dorsal integument. It answers to the third and fourth arches in the
                    Salamanders.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Peromela {Epicrium)</hi> the two aortic trunks which
                    spring from the <hi rend="italic">truncus</hi><hi rend="italic">arteriosus</hi>
                    would seem to correspond with the second and third of the frog, the first having
                    become absorbed into the second. This is a point which can be cleared up
                    satisfactorily only by the study of development; but it is obvious that the
                    heart and its arches have undergone greater changes in this group than in any of
                    the others.</p>
                <p>With respect to the venous system, it is worthy of notice that the blood
                    returning, from the hinder part of the body and the posterior extremities is, in
                    part, carried to the kidneys, and in part poured into a vein which runs in the
                    anterior wall of the abdominal cavity,—the <hi rend="italic">anterior abdominal
                    vein.</hi> Of the branches in which this vein terminates anteriorly, one
                    communicates with the portal vein, and one is distributed to the liver directly.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi> venous radicles in the integument covering
                    the back of the head and shoulders, unite to form a great cutaneous vein, which
                    passes backwards, perforates the external oblique muscle, and then turning
                    abruptly forwards, ends in the subclavian vein. This vein carries away a large
                    part of the blood of the cutaneous artery, which accompanies it in a great part
                    of its course.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lymphatic system</hi> has been most carefully studied in
                    the frog, where it consists of ( 1. ) widely-distributed lymphatic capillaries,
                    and sinuses which ensheath the blood-vessels; (2.) subcutaneous lymph sacs; (3.)
                    a large subvertebral <hi rend="italic">cisterna,</hi> enclosed between the
                    diverging lamellae of the mesentery, and placed in communication with the
                    peritoneal cavity by minute openings or stomata; (4.) four lymph hearts, two
                    situated close to the transverse process of the third vertebra and two at the
                    sides of the coccygeal style. These hearts pump the lymph into the adjacent
                    veins. As the two pairs of lymph hearts have been discovered in <hi

                    The glottis in the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> is situated in the middle

                    >Urodela,</hi> it is a very small longitudinal slit leading into a narrow
                    passage, which widens into a chamber into which the elongated pulmonary saca
                    open. The <hi rend="italic">Urodela</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Peromela</hi>
                    present mere cartilaginous rudiments of a larynx; but, in the <hi rend="italic"

                    The larynx is lodged in the angle between the two thyro-hyals, with which it is
                    closely connected. The chief part of the larynx is an annular cricoid cartilage,
                    with which two arytaenoid cartilages are articulated. Membranous folds, or
                    freely projecting cartilaginous processes of the arytaenoid cartilages <hi

                    arching over the anterior part of the fourth ventricle. The mesencephalon is
                    divided above, more or less distinctly, into two optic lobes. The cerebral
                    hemispheres are always relatively large, subcylin-drical in the <hi

                    many as three cutaneous branches, one of which runs along the junction of the
                    dorsal and ventral muscles to the binder part of the body. These lateral nerves
                    of the pneumogastric exist also in <hi rend="italic">Menopoma, Amphiuma,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Triton,</hi> and in tadpoles; but appear to be absent in

                <p>Fischer considers that a fine nerve, arising lower down than the vagus, and
                    distributed to the abductors of tho head in <hi rend="italic">Pipa,</hi> is to

                    also, are supplied from the pneumogastric, tho question of the presence or

                    Does the pneumogastric receive nerve fibres arising from the sides of the <hi

                    perforating the sides of the body of the atlas, and being distributed to a
                    muscle which passes from th⅛ vertebra to the occiput (Fischer, <hi rend="italic"

                    integument. The limbs make their appearance as buds from the sides of the body,
                    the anterior pair appearing first. The anterior limbs attain a considerable size

                    labial papillae, or beak-like armature of the jaw. The abdomen is slender, in
                    accordance with the brevity of the intestine, and the little animal is

                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi> on the other hand, teeth are not developed
                    until a later stage. A pair of cartilages appear in the roof of the mouth in

                    curtain-like lips, which surround the oral aperture, are also beset with horny
                    papillae, which call to mind the corneous teeth of the Marsipo-branchii. The
                    abdomen is swollen and almost globular, and lodges a long and spirally-coiled
                    intestine. The animal is herbivorous, though it does not despise animal food,
                    even in the shape of the weaker members of its own family.</p>
                <p>The space allotted to this article does not allow the details of the development
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> to be even sketched; but attention may be
                    directed to one or two of the more important points.</p>
                <p>The skull presents some singular differences in the course of its development in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Urodela (Triton, Siredon)</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anura (Rana, Aly</hi><hi rend="italic">tes)</hi> respectively. In the former,
                    the mandibular and trabecular arches become connected only at their dorsal ends,
                    by the pedicle of the mandibular arch; the pterygoid arch is developed late; and
                    the mandibular arch appears to give rise to no orbital process. In the latter,
                    the mandibular and trabecular arches not only unite at their dorsal ends by the
                    pedicle, but, at a very early period, the mandibular arch is united with the
                    antorbital process of the trabecula; and the pterygoid grows <hi rend="italic"
                    >pari passu</hi> with the subsequent divergence of the mandibular and the
                    trabecular arches. A large orbital process is developed from the mandibular
                    arch.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> the hyoidean and branchial apparatus
                    consists, at first, of elongated cartilaginous hyoidean cornua, united with a
                    median chondrification, which represents the basihyal and basi-branchial pieces,
                    to which last two cerato-branchials are attached. The first cerato-branchial is
                    continued dorsally into the first epibranchial, while the second
                    cerato-branchial supports the other three epibranchials. As the development of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Triton</hi> proceeds, the hyoidean arch becomes connected
                    with the suspensorium, and with the stapes, by ligament. The second
                    basi-branchial ossifies, detaches itself from the first, and lies as a forked
                    bone in front of the larynx; and only the two cerato-branchials, with the first
                    epibranchial, remain—the rest of the branchial apparatus disappearing.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi> the hyoidean arches are, at an early period,
                    very thick, and relatively short, and are articulated with the suspensoria. A
                    relatively broad and short cartilage represents the basihyal and basibranchial,
                    and at the sides of this are two very broad cartilages, which correspond with
                    the two cerato-branchials, inasmuch as their dorsal edges bear the four
                    epibranchial cartilages. As the tadpole grows older, the hyo-branchial apparatus
                    becomes more like that of the Urodele larva, the hyoid arch elongating into a
                    slender rod, and the two cerato-branchials becoming distinct. The basibranchial
                    region of the median cartilage, which unites the cerato-branchials ventrally,
                    becomes forked, and the processes which form the fork ossify and become the
                    thyro-hyals, which therefore would seem to correspond with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >os ypsiloides</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Urodela.</hi> Finally, the extreme
                    dorsal end of the hyoidean arch detaches itself from the suspensorium, and
                    enters into close union with the periotic capsule, from the outer wall of which
                    the <hi rend="italic">columella</hi><hi rend="italic">auris</hi> is

                    seems that these are peculiarly fitted for those animals, for frogs have been
                    introduced into Madeira, the Azores, and Mauritius, and have multiplied so as to
                    become a nuisance. But as these animals and their spawn are immediately killed
                    (with the exception, so far as is known, of one Indian species) by sea-water,
                    there would be great difficulty in their transportai across the sea, and
                    therefore we can see why they do not exist in strictly oceanic islands.”</p>
                <p>Leaving the oceanic islands aside, the distribution of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Am</hi><hi rend="italic">phibia</hi> is world-wide, but the different groups
                    are very remarkably localised.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> for example, are limited not only to the
                    arctogaeal province, but to the temperate parts of that province; and, in
                    curious correspondence with the Ganoid fishes, their headquarters are in North
                    America. <hi rend="italic">Siren, Menobranchus, Amphiuma, Menopoma, Dicamptodon,
                    Heredia, Anaides, Desmognathus, Batrachoseps, Hemidactylus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Plethodon</hi> are exclusively North American; and the majority of
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spelerpes</hi> appertain to that region,— <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma</hi>
                    being represented in North Asia, and <hi rend="italic">Spelerpes</hi> in the
                    circum-Mediterranean area. <hi rend="italic">Triton</hi> alone is spread over
                    the whole temperate arctogaeal area. <hi rend="italic">Salamandra, Pleurodeles,
                    Bradybates, Chioglossa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Salamandrina</hi> are
                    confined to Europe and North Africa. The singular <hi rend="italic">Salamandra

                    >Proteus</hi> to Camiola and Carinthia. Four genera— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ellipsoglossa, Isodactyliurm, Onychodactylus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ranodon—</hi> are confined to North Asia; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cryptobranchus,</hi> if it be a distinct genus, is limited to Japan.</p>
                <p>If the distribution of the <hi rend="italic">Urodela</hi> calls to mind that of
                    the Ganoid fishes, that of the <hi rend="italic">Peromela</hi> is rather
                    comparable to the distribution of the Tapirs. Of the four genera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Siphonops</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhinatrema</hi> are
                    exclusively inhabitants of the hotter part of the Austro-Columbian province—as
                    are the great number of the species of <hi rend="italic">Caecilia;</hi> but the

                    >Epicrium</hi> is confined to Java and Ceylon.</p>
                <p>In strong contrast with the foregoing, the <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi><note

                    represented in all the great provinces. A great preponderance of the genera and
                    species, however, are Austro-Columbian, the <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi> having
                    their headquarters in South America, as markedly as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urodela</hi> have theirs in the northern division of that continent. North
                    America, in fact, is poor in <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi> having only three

                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Rana</hi> itself, however, is characteristically
                    arctogaeal, having only a single species in the Mexican border-land of
                    Austro-Columbia, and none in Australia. <hi rend="italic">Rana</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">esculenta</hi> extends from France to China and Japan, and from

                    and in North America, as well as in North Asia and Japan.</p>
                <p>The Austro-Columbian region not only presents the greatest number of species, but
                    among them are some of the most singular forms, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pseudis, Ceratophrys, Braxhycephalus, Rhinoderma, Engystoma, Otilophus,

                    in which respect the South American <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi> run parallel
                    with the birds of the same region. And, as is seen in other cases, the nearest
                    allies of many of these singular forms are to be found in Ultra-Saharal
                    (Aethiopic) Africa, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Hemisus (Brachycephalies), Breviceps

                <p>The Australian region is remarkable for the absence of the genera <hi

                    Austro-Columbian, North American, and Aethiopian form, but does not occur in
                    India. If it were not for its tree-frogs, Australia would be poorer in <hi

                <p>These <hi rend="italic">Ailùra,</hi> modified for arboreal life, or “tree-frogs,”
                    are represented in all the distributional provinces—the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hyla</hi> having its chief seat in Austro-Columbia, and extending thence over
                    North America, Europe, North Africa, Western and Eastern Asia, and Australia,
                    but not into India or Ultra-Saharal Africa, in which other forms of the same

                <p>But, without underestimating the force of these considerations, it must be

                    of the limbs, in the <hi rend="italic">Anura.</hi></p>
                <p>It is to be regretted that nothing is known of the development of any of the <hi

                    far as these observations go, however, they tend to show that thelarvae of all
                    the <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi> possess the horny beak, which distinguishes
                    them from those of the <hi rend="italic">Urodela.</hi></p>
                <p>If we assume, as the fιmdamental similarities between the different divisions of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> lead us to do, that they have resulted from
                    the modification of some one primitive form, the problem, at present seemingly
                    insoluble, presents itself, whether these differences in structure and habit of
                    the larvae of the <hi rend="italic">Urodela</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anura</hi> indicate that the caudate ancestor of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anura</hi> was already different from the ancestor of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urodela,</hi> or whether they result from modifications which have taken place
                    in the larvae of the <hi rend="italic">Anura,</hi> since that group came into
                    existence.</p>
                <p>In view of this problem, <hi rend="italic">Siren</hi> possesses a particular
                    interest. Its horny jaw-sheaths might be compared to those of the Anuran
                    tadpole, and it might be regarded as showing the way by which the Anuran became
                    differentiated from the caudate original stock. But the homy sheaths in <hi
                    rend="italic">Siren</hi> rest directly upon the premaxillae and the dentaries,
                    and not on labial cartilages; and as to its habits of life, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siren</hi> appears to be eminently carnivorous (Duméril et Bibron, <hi
                    rend="italic">Erpétologie Générale,</hi> i. 196). As has been already stated, no
                    fossil remains of <hi rend="italic">Peromela</hi> are known, but <hi
                    rend="italic">Urodela</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi> occur in some
                    abundance, and, in certain cases, in an excellent state of preservation, as far
                    back as the middle of the Tertiary epoch. Now, these fossils show that the
                    Anurous and Urodelous types of organisation were, at that time, thoroughly
                    differentiated from one another. <hi rend="italic">Palaeobairachus,</hi> with
                    its three vertebrae ankyl03ed into a sacrum, is, in fact, a singularly modified
                    frog; while among the <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salamandrida,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Mcnopomida,</hi> and very possibly the
                    <hi rend="italic">Proteida,</hi> are severally represented. The young of the
                    Miocene <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi> were tadpoles so similar in form to those
                    of the existing frogs and toads, that there is no reason to doubt their
                    resembling them in other respects.</p>
                <p>There can be little question, then, that the Anurous and the Urodelous types must
                    have been represented before the Tertiary epoch; but here their history breaks
                    off, no amphibian belonging to any living groups having been discovered in
                    Mesozoic or older strata, as far as the Lias.</p>
                <p>From the Trias to the Carboniferous formations, inclusively, the fresh-water
                    deposits abound in <hi rend="italic">Amphibia.</hi> But all these, so far as we
                    have any positive knowledge, are referable to the Labyrintho-dont type. No
                    Labyrinthodont presents the slightest approximation towards the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anura;</hi> but elongated and apodal, as well as sala-mandroid
                    forms occur; and in their cranial structure, no less than in the presence of
                    scale-like dermal ossifications, they approach the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Labyrinthodonts present a few characters—such as the paired supra-occipital
                    ossifications and the complications of the folds of their teeth—by which they
                    approach the Ganoid fishes more than any other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it is worthy of notice that the
                    lowest Labyrinthodonts, such as <hi rend="italic">Archcgosaurus,</hi> present no
                    approximation to the cranial characters of the lower <hi rend="italic"

                    which is so characteristic of the latter.</p>
                <p>Thus, if upon such slender evidence as exists, it is justifiable to speculate at
                    all concerning the “phylogeny” of the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia,</hi> the most
                    probable conclusion appears to be that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labyrinthodonta,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Urodela,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anura</hi> diverged from one another at a very early period of
                    geological history; while, possibly, the <hi rend="italic">Peromela</hi> are the
                    last remnants of the peromelous modification of the Labyrinthodont type.</p>
                <p>With respect to the origin of the amphibian stock itself, the following
                    considerations appear to be of fundamental importance :— 1. The early stages of
                    development of the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> do not resemble those of any
                    known Ganoid, Telostean, or Elasmobranch fish, and are similar to the
                    corresponding stages of the <hi rend="italic">hiarsipobranchii. 2.</hi> The
                    skull of the lowest <hi rend="italic">Urodela</hi> has, in some respects,
                    advanced but little beyond the Marsipobranch stage. In the higher <hi
                    rend="italic">Urodela</hi> there are numerous points of resemblance with the
                    Ganoids. The skull of the tadpole, on the other hand, has much in common with
                    that of <hi rend="italic">Chimaera</hi> (as Müller has pointed out), and with
                    that of the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi,</hi> while the chondrocranium of the adult
                    frog has many singular affinities with that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elasmobranchii,</hi> and particularly of the Rays. 3. The only <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> besides the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia,</hi>
                    which have transitory external gills are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elasmobranchii,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi,</hi> and perhaps some
                    Ganoids. 4. The only fishes in which the cerebellum is rudimentary are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Marsipobranchii</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ganoidei.</hi> 5. The
                    only fishes in which the amphibian and embryonic connection between the male
                    reproductive organs and the renal efferent ducts is observed are the Ganoids. 6.
                    The only fishes which have a “pylangium,” with valves disposed as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphibia,</hi> are the Ganoids, Elasmobranchs, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Dipnoi. 7.</hi> The only fishes which possess morphological <hi
                    rend="italic">(Polypterus)</hi> or functional <hi rend="italic">(Dipnoi)</hi>
                    lungs are the Ganoids and <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi.</hi> The conclusions
                    suggested by these facts appear to be that the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi>
                    took their origin from some primordial form common to them, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elasmobranchii,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ganoidei,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi;</hi> and that the main distinction by which their
                    earliest forms were marked off from those of the other groups, was the
                    development of that pentadactyle type of limb, which is common to all the higher
                    <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi> And seeing that the Elasmobranch, Ganoid, and
                    Dipnous types were fully differentiated from one another in the Devonian epoch,
                    it is reasonable to believe that the existence of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphibia,</hi> as a group, dates back at least as far as that remote period of
                    the earth’s history.</p>

                    the <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi> than has yet been carried out seems to be
                    requisite before their classification can be placed upon more than a provisional
                    footing. The phases through which the Frog passes in the course of its
                    development, show that those <hi rend="italic">Anura</hi> which are devoid of a
                    tympanic cavity are of a more embryonic character than those which possess one.
                    The arboreal habit is so evidently adaptive, that it can hardly be regarded as a
