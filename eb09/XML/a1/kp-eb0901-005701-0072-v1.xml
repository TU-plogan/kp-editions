                <p><label type="entry">ABSALON</label>, Archbishop of Lund, in Denmark, was born in
                    1128, near Soroe in Zealand, his family name being Axel. In 1148 he went to
                    study at Paris, where a college for Danes had been established. He afterwards
                    travelled extensively in different countries; and returning to Denmark in 1157,
                    was the year after chosen Bishop of Roeskilde or Rothschild. Eloquent, learned,
                    endowed with uncommon physical strength, and possessing the confidence of the
                    king, Waldemar I., known as the Great, Absalon held a position of great
                    influence both in the church and state. In that age warlike pursuits were not
                    deemed inconsistent with the clerical office, and Absalon was a renowned warrior
                    by sea and land, as well as a zealous ecclesiastic, his avowed principle being
                    that “both swords, the spiritual and the temporal, were entrusted to the
                    clergy.” To his exertions as statesman and soldier Waldemar was largely indebted
                    for the independence and consolidation of his kingdom. In 1177 he was chosen by
                    the chapter Archbishop of Lund and Primate of the church, but he declared
                    himself unwilling to accept the appointment; and when an attempt was made to
                    install him by force, he resisted, and appealed to Rome. The Pope decided that
                    the choice of the chapter must be respected, and commanded Absalon to accept the
                    Primacy on pain of excommunication. He was consecrated accordingly by the papal
                    legate Galandius in 1178. He set the Cistercian monks of Soroe the task of
                    preparing a history of the country, the most valuable result being the <hi
                        rend="italic">Danish Chronicle</hi> of Saxo Grammaticus, who was secretary
                    to Absalon and his companion in an expedition against the Wendish pirates. A
                    tower or castle which the archbishop caused to be built as a defence against
                    these pirates, was the commencement of the present capital, Copenhagen, which
                    from this circumstance is sometimes known in history as Axelstadt. The
