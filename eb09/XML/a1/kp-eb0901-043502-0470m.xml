                    November 9th, 1721. His school was the free one founded by a former mayor of
                    Newcastle, Thomas Horsley. Later, one of the ministers of the Presbyterians
                    added to his school-acquired knowledge in private. In his sixteenth year he sent
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Gentlemans Magazine</hi> a copy of verses entitled “The
                    Virtuoso.” Sylvanus Urban graciously printed the poem; but the old man was not
                    difficult to please. Other verse contributions succeeded—imitative, yet not
                    without gleams of a true faculty. Some written in the Lake country, while on
                    visits with friends at Morpeth, have Wordsworthian touches. The memories of
                    these visits transfigure the <hi rend="italic">Pleasures of Imagination.</hi> In
                    his nineteenth year, being intended for the clerical profession, he proceeded to
                    the university of Edinburgh; but within one session, like many others, he
                    changed his purpose, and transferred his name from the theological to the
                    medical classes although, indeed, then, as still, the opening years were
                    occupied with the same studies for either. On his change he honourably returned
                    certain moneys which his fellow Presbyterians had advanced towards his
                    theological education. He attended the university for only two years. While
                    there, in 1740, a medical society, which combined with it a debating club, gave
                    him a fine field for the exercise of his oratorical powers. Dugald Stewart
                    states that Robertson the historian, then a student of divinity, used to attend
                    the meetings in order to hear Akenside’s speeches. Some of his minor poems
                    belong to this period, such as his Ode “for the Winter Solstice,” the elegy
                    called “Love,” and the verses “to Cordelia.” He returned to his native town in
                    1741, and then his friendship with Jeremiah Dyson had commenced, “a name never
                    to be mentioned by any lover of genius or noble deeds without affection and
                    reverence” (Willmott). In the years 1741 to 1743 he must have been ardent in his
                    wooing of the Muses. In the summer or autumn of 1743 Dodsley carried with him to
                    Pope at Twickenham a MS. for which the writer asked £120. The oracle of
                    Twickenham having read the poem, counselled the publisher to make no niggardly
                    offer, because “this was no every-day writer.” It was something for Pope to be
                    thus prescient in the absence of rhyme—albeit Pope’s insertions in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Seasons</hi> remain to attest that, supreme artist as he was
                    in rhyme, he could also manage blank verse with exquisite cunningness. The MS.
                    was the <hi rend="italic">Pleasures of Imagination,</hi> which Dodsley published
                    in 1744. In his twenty-third year the author, like Byron, awoke to find himself
                    famous. The assaults of Warburton and Hurd were scarcely a deduction from the
                    universal welcome. The poet’s “Epistle” to Warburton was effective. He went to
                    Leyden, and there pursued his medical studies with ardour. He obtained the
                    degree of M.D., May 16th, 1744; his inaugural dissertation describing the
                    formation and growth of the human foetus with original observation and
                    acuteness. He now returned to England, advancing more and more in his friendship
                    with the good and large-hearted Dyson. He chose Northampton as the place wherein
                    he should commence practice. It was an unfortunate selection, as Sir James
                    Stonehouse “possessed the confidence of the town,” and it was deemed an
                    intrusion. A not very creditable controversy arose; and we are at a loss whether
                    most to admire the stinging rebuffs in honeyed courtesies or the mutual pretence
                    of ultimate satisfaction and good-will. At Northampton Akenside was on friendly
                    terms with Dr Doddridge. There, too, he wrote his “Epistle to Curio," which Lord
                    Macaulay pronounced his best production, as “indicating powers of elevated
                    satire, which, if diligently cultivated, might have disputed the pre-eminence of
                    Dryden.” Willmott traces some of the most nervous lines of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pleasures of Hope</hi> to this “Epistle to Curio.” Not succeeding in his
                    profession at Northampton, he removed to Hampstead in 1747. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Odes</hi> had then been published. Dr Akenside came to Hampstead
                    under the aegis of the generous Dyson. Somehow, in Hampstead as at Northampton,
                    he manifested a vanity of self-display and hauteur of manner that made him many
                    enemies. Within three years he had to leave Hampstead for London. He set up in
                    Bloomsbury Square in a “fine house,” and with an annuity of £300 from the still
                    ungrudging Dyson. One is pleased to come on these words of a far greater poet a
                    century later, “I am not unfrequently,” wrote Wordsworth in 1837, “a visitor on
                    Hampstead Heath, and I seldom pass by the entrance of Mr Dyson’s villa at
                    Goulder’s Hill, close by, without thinking of the pleasure which Akenside often
                    had there.” The generous clerk of the House of Commons and secretary of the
                    Treasury nobly earned his imperishable place in the (revised) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pleasures of Imagination.</hi> Contemporaneous with his professional duties,
                    the poet became an essayist and reviewer for Dodsley in the now forgotten <hi
                    rend="italic">Museum.</hi> In 1753 the university of Cambridge bestowed on him
                    the degree of doctor of medicine. In 1754 he was elected a fellow of the College
                    of Physicians. In 1755 he read before the college the Gulstonian Lectures; and
                    in 1756 the Croonian Lectures. In 1759 he was chosen assistant, and two months
                    later chief, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0471-0436"/> physician of St Thomas’s Hospital. In this year
                    he had removed to Craven Street. In 1762 he changed once more to Burlington
                    Street. In 1760 was published the <hi rend="italic">Harveian Oration</hi> by
                    order of the College of Physicians. In 1761, along with Dyson, he passed from a
                    somewhat noisy Whiggery to the Tories, which added “renegade” to his name. In
                    1765-6 he was working upon the revised and enlarged copy of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pleasures of Imagination.</hi> His fame was widening
                    professionally and poetically, when a putrid fever carried him off suddenly on
                    June 23d, 1770. He was buried at St James’s Church on the 28th. As a man, the
                    nearer one gets to Akenside the less is there lovable about him; there seem to
                    have been ineradicable meannesses in his nature. Lavish in his expenditure while
                    practically dependent on Dyson, and remaining dependent after his professional
                    income ought to have released his patron, we cannot think of him as high-minded.
                    His personal vanity was constantly bringing him sorenesses. The “Doctor” in <hi
                    rend="italic">Peregrine Pickle</hi> was painted from the life, not a mere
                    creation of Smollett’s genius. As a poet, the place of Akenside is secure, but
                    it is not very lofty. His imagination is rhetorical rather than subtle,
                    consisting more of pomp of words than greatness of thought. His chief defect is
                    lack of emotion, and especially pathos. The enlarged <hi rend="italic">Pleasures
                    of Imagination,</hi> notwithstanding some noble additions, was a blunder. Some
                    of his minor pieces have a classical grace and charm of expression. (See the
