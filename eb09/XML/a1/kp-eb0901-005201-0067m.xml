                <p><label type="entry">ABORTION</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Midwifery</hi> (from
                    <hi rend="italic">aborior,</hi> I perish), the premature separation and
                    expulsion of the contents of the pregnant uterus. When occurring before the
                    eighth lunar month of gestation, <hi rend="italic">abortion</hi> is the term
                    ordinarily employed, but subsequent to this period it is designated <hi
                    rend="italic">premature labour.</hi> The present notice includes both these
                    terms. As an accident of pregnancy, abortion is far from uncommon, although its
                    relative frequency, as compared with that of completed gestation, has been very
                    differently estimated by accoucheurs. It is more liable to occur in the earlier
                    than in the later months of pregnancy, and it would also appear to occur more
                    readily at the periods corresponding to those of the menstrual discharge.
                    Abortion may be induced by numerous causes, both of a local and general nature.
                    Malformations of the pelvis, accidental injuries, and the diseases and
                    displacements to which the uterus is liable, on the one hand; and, on the other,
                    various morbid conditions of the ovum or placenta leading to the death of the
                    foetus, are among the direct local causes of abortion. The general causes
                    embrace certain states of the system which are apt to exercise a more or less
                    direct influence upon the progress of utero-gestation. A deteriorated condition
                    of health, whether hereditary or as the result of habits of life, certainly
                    predisposes to the occurrence of abortion. Syphilis is known to be a frequent
                    cause of the death of the foetus. Many diseases arising in the course of
                    pregnancy act as direct exciting causes of abortion, more particularly the
                    eruptive fevers and acute inflammatory affections. Prolonged irritation in other
                    organs may, by reflex action, excite the uterus to expel its contents. Strong
                    impressions made upon the nervous system, as by sudden shocks and mental
                    emotions, occasionally have a similar effect. Further, certain medicinal
                    substances, particularly ergot of rye, borax, savin, tansy, and cantharides, are
                    commonly believed to be capable of exciting uterine action, but the effects, as
                    regards at least early pregnancy, are very uncertain, while the strong purgative
                    medicines sometimes employed with the view of procuring abortion have no effect
                    whatever upon the uterus, and can only act remotely and indirectly, if they act
                    at all, by irritating the alimentary canal. In cases of poisoning with carbonic
                    acid, abortion has been observed to take place, and the experiments of Dr Brown
                    Sequard show that anything interfering with the normal oxygenation of the blood
                    may cause the uterus to contract and expel its contents. Many cases of abortion
                    occur without apparent cause, but in such instances the probability is that some
                    morbid condition of the interior of the uterus exists, and the same may be said
                    of many of those cases where the disposition to abort has become habitual. The
                    tendency, however, to the recurrence of abortion in persons who have previously
                    miscarried is well known, and should ever be borne in mind with the view of
                    avoiding any cause likely to lead to a repetition of the accident. Abortion
                    resembles ordinary labour in its general phenomena, excepting that in the former
                    hemorrhage often to a large extent forms one of the leading symptoms. The
                    treatment of abortion embraces the means to be used by rest, astringents, and
                    sedatives, to prevent the occurrence when it merely threatens; or when, on the
                    contrary, it is inevitable, to accomplish as speedily as possible the complete
                    removal of the entire contents of the uterus. The artificial induction of
                    premature labour is occasionally resorted to by accoucheurs under certain
                    conditions involving the safety of the mother or the foetus. For <hi
