                    may subsequently arise,—in the absence of a completely differentiated alimentary
                    canal, and in possessing thread cells, or nematocysts; but they present a
                    somewhat greater complexity of structure.</p>
                <p>This is manifest, in the first place, in their visceral tube, or “stomach,” as it
                    is often called, which is continued from the margins of the mouth, for a certain
                    distance, into the interior cavity of the body, but which is always open at its
                    fundus into that cavity. And, secondly, in the position of the reproductive
                    elements, which, in the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa,</hi> are always developed in
                    parts of the body wall which are in immediate relation with the external
                    surface, and generally form outward projections; while, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actinozoa,</hi> they are as constantly situated in the lateral walls of the
                    chambers into which the body cavity is divided. In consequence of this
                    arrangement, the ova, or sexually generated embryos, of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actinozoa</hi> are detached into the interior of the body, and usually escape
                    from it by the oral aperture; while those of the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa</hi>
                    are at once set free on the exterior surface of that part of the body in which
                    they are formed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa</hi> comprise two groups, which are very
                    different in general appearance and habit, though really similar in fundamental
                    structure. These are—</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Coralligena</hi> or sea-anemones, coral animals, and
                    sea-pens; and 2. The <hi rend="italic">Ctenophora.</hi></p>
                <p>(1.) The <hi rend="italic">Coralligena.—</hi> A common sea-anemone presents a
                    subcylindrical body, terminated at each end by a disk. The one of these
                    discoidal ends serves to attach the ordinarily sedentary animal; the other
                    exhibits in the centre a mouth, which is usually elongated in one direction,
                    and, at each end, presents folds extending down into the gastric cavity. This
                    circumstance greatly diminishes the otherwise generally radial symmetry of the
                    disk, and of the series of flexible conical tentacles which start from it; and,
                    taken together with some other circumstances, raises a doubt whether even these
                    animals are not rather bilaterally, than radially, symmetrical. Each tentacle is
                    hollow, and its base communicates with one of the chambers into which the cavity
                    of the body is divided, by thin membranous lamellae, the so-called mesenteries,
                    which radiate from the oral disk and the lateral walls of the body to the
                    parietes of the visceral tube. The inferior edges of the mesenteries are free,
                    and arcuated in such a manner as to leave a central common chamber, into the
                    circumference of which all the intermesenteric spaces open, while above, it
                    communicates with the visceral tube. The tentacles may be perforated at their
                    extremities, and, in some cases, the body wall itself exhibits apertures leading
                    into the intermesenteric spaces. The free edges of the mesenteries present
                    thickenings, like the hem of a piece of linen, each of which is much longer than
                    the distance between the gastric and the parietal attachment of the mesentery,
                    and hence is much folded on itself. It is full of thread cells. The mesoderm, or
                    middle layer of the body, which lies between the ectoderm and the endoderm,
                    consists of a fibrillated connective tissue, containing fusiform or stellate
                    nucleated celle, and possesses longitudinal and circular muscular fibres. These
                    are prolonged into the mesenteries, and attain a great development in the disk
                    of attachment, which serves as a sort of foot like that of a limpet.</p>
                <p>The question whether the <hi rend="italic">Coralligena</hi> possess a nervous
                    system and organs of sense, hardly admits of a definite answer at present. It is
                    only in the <hi rend="italic">Actinidoe</hi> that the existence of such organs
                    has been asserted; and the nervous circlet of <hi rend="italic">Actinia,</hi>
                    described by Spix, has been seen by no later investigator, and may be safely
                    assumed to be nonexistent. But Professor P. Μ. Duncan, F.R.S., in a paper “On
                    the Nervous System of <hi rend="italic">Actinia,”</hi> recently communicated to
                    the Royal Society, has affirmed the existence of a nervous apparatus, consisting
                    of fusiform ganglionic cells, united by nerve fibres, which resemble the
                    sympathetic nerve fibrils of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> and form a
                    plexus, which appears to extend throughout the pedal disk, and very probably
                    into other parts of the body. In some of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0145-0130"/> the <hi rend="italic">Actinidoe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g., Actinia mesembryanthemum),</hi> brightly coloured bead-like
                    bodies are situated on the oral disk outside the tentacles. The structure of
                    these “chromato-phores,” or “bourses calicinales,” has been carefully
                    investigated by Schneider and Röttekem, and by Professor Duncan. They are
                    diverticula of the body wall, the surface of which is composed of close-set
                    “bacilli,” beneath which lies a layer of strongly-refracting spherules, followed
                    by another layer of no less strongly refracting cones. Subjacent to these
                    Professor Duncan finds ganglion cells and nerve plexuses. It would seem,
                    therefore, that these bodies are rudimentary eyes.</p>
                <p>At the breeding season the ova or spermatozoa are evolved in the thickness of the
                    mesenteries, and are discharged into the intermesenteric spaces, the ova
                    undergoing their development within the body of the parent. The yelk, usually,
                    if not always, enclosed in a vitelline membrane, undergoes complete division,
                    and the outer wall of the ciliated blastodermic mass which results becomes
                    invaginated, the embryo being thereby converted into a double walled sac—the
                    external aperture of which is the future mouth, while the contained cavity
                    represents the body cavity. In this stage the larval <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actinia</hi> represents the <hi rend="italic">Gastrula</hi> condition of
                    sponges and <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa.</hi> The edges of the oral aperture grow
                    inwards, giving rise to a circular fold, which is the rudiment of the visceral
                    tube. This is at first connected with the body wall by only two mesenteries,
                    which are seated at opposite ends of one of the transverse diameters of the
                    body. As the mesenteries increase in number, the tentacles grow out as
                    diverticula of the intermesenteric spaces.</p>
                <p>In all the <hi rend="italic">Coralligena,</hi> the development of which has been
                    observed, the embryo is converted into a simple actinozoon in a similar manner;
                    but from this point they diverge in two directions. In one great group, the
                    mesenteries, and the tentacles which arise from the intermesenteric chambers,
                    increase in number to six; and then, in the great majority of cases, the
                    intermesenteric spaces undergo subdivision by the development of new
                    mesenteries, according to curious and somewhat complicated numerical laws, until
                    their number is increased to some multiple of five or six. In these <hi
                    rend="italic">Hexacoralla</hi> (as they have been termed by Haeckel) the
                    tentacles also usually remain rounded and conical. In the other group, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Octocoralla,</hi> the mesenteries and the tentacles increase to
                    eight, but do not surpass that number; and the tentacles become flattened and
                    serrated at the edges, or take on a more or less pennatifid character.</p>
                <p>There are no <hi rend="italic">Octocoralla</hi> which retain the simple
                    individuality of the young actinozoon throughout life; but all increase by
                    gemmation, and give rise to compound organisms, which may be arborescent, and
                    fixed by the root end of the common stem, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcyonidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gorgonidae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    or may possess a central stem which is not fixed, and gives off lateral branches
                    which undergo comparatively little subdivision, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pennatulidae.</hi></p>
                <p>The body cavities of the zooids of these compound <hi rend="italic"
                    >Octocoralla</hi> are in free communication with a set of canals which ramify
                    through the <hi rend="italic">coenosarc,</hi> or common fabric of the stem and
                    branches by which they are borne, and which play the part of a vascular
                    system.</p>
                <p>Except in the case of <hi rend="italic">Tubipora,</hi> the zooids and the
                    superficial coenosarc give rise to no continuous skeleton; but the deep or inner
                    substance of the coenosarc may be converted into a solid rod-like or branching
                    stem.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Hexacoralla,</hi> on the other hand, one large group,
                    that of the <hi rend="italic">Actinidoe,</hi> consists entirely of simple
                    organisms,—organisms that is, in which the primitive actinozoon attains its
                    adult condition without budding or fission; or if it bud or divide, the products
                    of the operation separate from one another. No true skeleton is formed, all are
                    to some extent locomotive, and some <hi rend="italic">(Minyas)</hi> float freely
                    by the help of their contractile pedal region. The most remarkable form of this
                    group is the genus <hi rend="italic">Cereanthus,</hi> which has two circlets,
                    each composed of numerous tentacles, one immediately around the oral aperture,
                    the other at the margin of the disk. The foot is elongated, subconical, and
                    generally presents a pore at its apex. Of the diametral folds of the oral
                    aperture, one pair is much longer than the other, and is produced as far as the
                    pedal pore. The larva is curiously like a young hydrozoon with free tentacles,
                    and at first possesses four mesenteries, whence it may be doubted whether <hi
                    rend="italic">Cereanthus</hi> does not rather belong to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Octocoralla.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Zoant-hidoe</hi> differ from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actinidoe</hi> in little more than their multiplication by buds, which remain
                    adherent, either by a common connecting mass or coenosarc or by stolons; and in
                    the possession of a rudimentary, spicular skeleton.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the proper stone-corals (as contradistinguished from the red
                    coral) are essentially <hi rend="italic">Actiniae,</hi> which become converted
                    into compound organisms by gemmation or fission, and develope a continuous
                    skeleton.</p>
                <p>The skeletal parts<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Kölliker’s <hi rend="italic">Icones Histologicae,</hi> 1866.</p></note> of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa,</hi> to which reference has been made, consist
                    either of a substance of a horny character; or of an organic basis impregnated
                    with earthy salts (chiefly of lime and magnesia), but which can be isolated by
                    the action of dilute acids; or finally, of calcareous salts in an almost
                    crystalline state, forming rods or corpuscles, which, when treated with acids,
                    leave only an inappreciable and structureless film of organic matter. The hard
                    parts of all the <hi rend="italic">Aporosa, Perforata,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Tabulata</hi> of Milne Edwards are in the last-mentioned
                    condition; while, in the <hi rend="italic">Octocoralla</hi> (except <hi
                    rend="italic">Tubipora)</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Antipathidoe,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Zoanthidoe,</hi> the skeleton is either horny, or consists, at any
                    rate, to begin with, of definitely formed spicula, which contain an organic
                    basis, and frequently present a laminated structure. In the organ coral <hi
                    rend="italic">(Tubipora),</hi> however, the skeleton has the character of that
                    of the ordinary stonc-corals, except that it is perforated by numerous minute
                    canals.</p>
                <p>The skeleton appears, in all cases, to be deposited within the mesoderm, and in
                    the intercellular substance of that layer of the body. Even the definitely
                    shaped spicula of the <hi rend="italic">Octocoralla</hi> are not the result of
                    the metamorphosis of cells. In the simple aporose corals the calcification of
                    the base and side walls of the body gives rise to the cup or <hi rend="italic"
                    >theca;</hi> from this the calcification radiates inwards, in correspondence
                    with the mesenteries, and gives rise to as many vertical <hi rend="italic"

                    while, in the centre, either by union of the septa or independently, a pillar,
                    the <hi rend="italic">columella,</hi> grows up. From the sides of adjacent septa
                    scattered processes of calcified substance, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >synapticul</hi><hi rend="italic">ae</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> may grow out
                    toward one another, as in the <hi rend="italic">Fungidae;</hi> or the
                    interruption of the cavities of the loculi may be more complete by the formation
                    of shelves stretching from septum to septum, but lying at different heights in
                    adjacent loculi. These are <hi rend="italic">interseptal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dissepiments.</hi> Finally, in the <hi rend="italic">Tabulata,</hi> horizontal
                    plates, which stretch completely across the cavity of the theca, are formed one
                    above the other and constitute <hi rend="italic">tabular dissepiments.</hi></p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Aporosa</hi> the theca and septa are almost invariably
                    imperforate; but in the <hi rend="italic">Perforata</hi> they present apertures,
                    and in some madrepores the whole skeleton is reduced to a mere network of dense
                    calcareous substance. When the <hi rend="italic">Hexacoralla</hi> multiply by
                    gemmation or fission, and thus give rise to compound massive or aborescent
                    aggregations, each newly-formed coral polype developes a skeleton <pb break="no"

                    of the others, or is united with them by calcification of the connecting
                    substance of the common body. This intermediate skeletal layer is then termed

                    the central part of the common stem of the compound organism becomes hardened,
                    either by conversion into a mere horny axis (which may be more or less
                    impregnated with calcareous salts) without spicula; or the cornification may be
                    accompanied by a massive development of spicula, either continuously or at
                    intervals; or the main feature of the skeleton may, from the first, be the
                    development of spicula, which become soldered together by a subcrystalline

                <p>(2.) The <hi rend="italic">Ctenophora.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> These are all
                    freely swimming, actively locomotive, marine animals, which do not multiply by
                    gemmation, nor form compound organisms such as the polyparies of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coralligena.</hi> Like the latter they are composed of a cellular
                    ectoderm and endoderm, between which a mesoderm, containing stellate connective
                    tissue corpuscles and muscular fibres, is interposed. But, in most parts of the
                    organism, the mesoderm acquires a great thickness and a gelatinous consistency;
                    so that the body of one of these animals differs in this respect from that of an
                    <hi rend="italic">Actinia</hi> in the same way as the body of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyan</hi><hi rend="italic">oe</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> differs
                    from that of a <hi rend="italic">Hydra.</hi> The bilateral symmetry, which is
                    obscure in most of the <hi rend="italic">Coralligena,</hi> becomes obvious in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ctenophora,</hi> in which the parts are disposed
                    symmetrically on each side of a vertical plane passing through the longitudinal
                    axis of the body. The oral aperture is situated at one end of this axis (or its
                    oral pole), while at the opposite extremity (or aboral pole) there is very
                    generally situated a sac containing solid mineral particles— the <hi
                    rend="italic">lithocyst.</hi></p>
                <p>The oral aperture leads into a visceral tube, which undoubtedly performs the
                    functions of a stomach. Nevertheless, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coralligena,</hi> it is open at its aboral end, and its cavity is thus placed
                    in direct communication with a chamber, whence canals are given off which
                    penetrate the gelatinous mesoderm. Of these canals, one continues the direction
                    of the axis of the body, and usually ends by two apertures at the aboral pole.
                    The others take a direction in a plane more or less at right angles with the
                    axis; and after branching out, terminate in longitudinal canals, which lie
                    beneath the series of locomotive paddles, or come into relation with the
                    tentacles when such organs are developed. In addition to these, two canals
                    frequently extend along the sides of the stomach towards the oral pole. The
                    paddle-like locomotive plates are disposed in eight longitudinal series <hi
                    rend="italic">(ctenophores)</hi> on the outer surface of the body. They are
                    thick at the base; thin and, as it were, frayed out into separate filaments, at
                    their free edges; and each plate is set transversely to the long axis of the
                    series of which it forms a part. The ovaria and testes are developed in the side
                    walls of the longitudinal canals. It is clear, therefore, that these canals
                    answer to the intermesenteric spaces of an <hi rend="italic">Actinia;</hi> that
                    the common cavity into which they and the stomach open answers to the common
                    cavity of the body of the <hi rend="italic">Actinia;</hi> that the apertures at
                    the aboral pole answer to the terminal aperture of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cereanthus;</hi> and that the wide interspaces between the longitudinal canals
                    represent the mesoderm of the Actinian mesenteries immensely thickened.</p>
                <p>In their development the <hi rend="italic">Ctenophora</hi> resemble the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coralligena</hi> in all essential respects, though they differ
                    from them in some details. Thus the process of yelk division goes on at a
                    different rate in the two moieties of the egg, so that the vitellus becomes
                    divided into one set of small and another set of large cells, whereof the latter
                    become overlaid by the former, and give rise to a large-celled hypoblast,
                    enclosed within a small-celled epiblast. But in the manner in which the body
                    cavity is formed, and the visceral tube (which becomes the stomach) is
                    developed, the <hi rend="italic">Ctenophora</hi> resemble the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actiniae.</hi> The paddles make their appearance at four points of the
                    circumference of the body, in the form of elevations beset with short cilia; but
                    each of these divides into two, and thus the eight definitive series are
                    constituted.</p>
                <p>There is a general agreement among anatomists respecting the structure of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ctenophora</hi> thus far; but the question whether they possess a
                    nervous system and sensory organs or not, is, as in the case of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coralligena,</hi> one upon which there exists great diversity of
                    opinion. Grant originally described a nervous ganglionated ring, whence
                    longitudinal cords proceed in <hi rend="italic">Cydippe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pleurobrachia);</hi><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0147-0132"/> but his observation has not been verified by
                    subsequent investigations. According to Milne Edwards, followed by others (among
                    whom I must include myself), the nervous system consists of a ganglion, situated
                    at the aboral pole of the body, whence nerves radiate, the most conspicuous of
                    which are eight cords which run down the corresponding series of paddles; and a
                    sensory organ, having the characters of an otolithic sac, is seated upon the
                    ganglion. Agassiz and Kölliker, on the other hand, have denied that the
                    appearances described (though they really exist) are justly interpreted. And
                    again, though the body, described as an otolithic sac, undoubtedly exists in the
                    position indicated in all, or most, of the <hi rend="italic">Ctenophora,</hi>
                    the question has been raised whether it is an auditory or a visual organ.</p>
                <p>These problems have been recently reinvestigated with great care, and by the aid
                    of the refined methods of modern histology, by Dr Eimer,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Zoologische Studien auf
                    Capri.</hi> 1873.</p></note> who describes a nervous system, consisting of
                    extremely delicate varicose ultimate nerve fibrils, which traverse the mesoderm
                    in all directions, and are connected here and there with ganglionic corpuscles.
                    These nerves are only discernible with high magnifying powers, as they are for
                    the most part isolated, and are collected into bundles only beneath the
                    longitudinal canals. The mass which lies beneath the lithocyst is composed of
                    cells, but these have none of the special characters of nerve cells. Eimer
                    states that he has traced the filaments, which he considers to be nerves, into
                    direct continuity with muscular fibres; and, around the mouth, into subepidermal
                    bodies, which he regards as rudimentary forms of tactile corpuscles. The
                    lithocyst is recognised as an auditory organ, and, in addition, eye-spots are
                    described.</p>
                <p>With a fundamental similarity of organisation, the form of the body varies
                    extraordinarily in the <hi rend="italic">Ctenophora.</hi> One of the genera

                <p>The body is ovate, truncated at the oral pole, the aboral being more or less
                    acuminate and mobile. The digestive cavity occupies a large portion of the body.
                    The oral margin is simple in <hi rend="italic">Beroë</hi> and Idyia; but in <hi
                    rend="italic">Rangia</hi> the interradial spaces are notched, and in each a
                    short process projects. The radial canals are connected by a circumoral canal.
                    No tentacles are present. The ctenophores of <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> do
                    not extend over more than half the body, as in the embryos of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The oral and aboral pole, or the oral only, bear lobate appendages. <hi
                    rend="italic">Boliná</hi> has a pair of oral lappets, into which the radial
                    canals are prolonged. The ctenophores corresponding to these lobes are the
                    longest, while the middle ones are much shorter, and are prolonged on to an
                    auricle or finger-like lobe. The tentacles are represented by a tuft of short
                    processes on either side of the mouth. The young <hi rend="italic">Boliná</hi>
                    has the form of <hi rend="italic">Cydippe,</hi> and like it bears a pair of
                    long-fringed tentacles. The aboral region, bearing the lateral ctenophores,
                    grows more rapidly than the oral, so as ultimately to project in two principal
                    lobes, by Which the similar outgrowth of the median aboral regions with its
                    ctenophores is arrested, the auricles being the dwarfed representatives of these
                    regions. These auricles in <hi rend="italic">Eucharis</hi> are longer, so that
                    the ctenophores are all of equal length. The tentacles of this genus are placed
                    at the oral pole; the oral lobes are equivalent to the median ctenophores of <hi
