                    who spread themselves over Europe during the decline of the Roman empire. The
                    name was probably at first confined to one tribe of Tatar race, whose original
                    seat was on the northern shores of the Caspian Sea, and was afterwards, as the
                    power of that race extended, applied to other tribes. It is supposed that their
                    first encounter with the Romans was during the Mithridatic war, when Pompey led
                    an expedition into the Caucasus. Isolated statements in <pb break="no"

                    frequently in conflict with the Roman power. In March 276 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> they received a decisive check in an attempt to make their way
                    eastward into Persia, being defeated by the emperor Tacitus, who forced them to
                    recross the Phasis. The most complete account of the Alani is to be found in the
                    pages of Ammianus Marcellinus (lib. xxxi.), who describes their manners and
                    customs at considerable length. From him, too, we learn of the advance of the
                    Huns, who signally defeated the Alani in a battle fought on the banks of the
                    Tanais in 375. The race thereupon divided, some retiring to the east, while the
                    great majority joined their conquerors in an invasion of the kingdom of the
                    Goths. Associated with the Vandals and Suevi, they left the settlements they had
                    in Pannonia and entered Gaul in 406, whence three years later they crossed the
                    Pyrenees into Spain, and founded a settlement in Lusitania and Baetica, where
                    they remained in peace for some years. In 418, however, they were attacked and
                    defeated by Wallia, king of the Visigoths, with whom they had quarrelled. Their
                    king, Ataces, was slain in the battle, and they became subject to Gunderic, king
                    of the Vandals, their national independence being lost. Those of the Alani who
                    had remained in Gaul when the others invaded Spain, settled near Valence and
                    Orleans. Though serving under Theodoric, they sympathised with Attila and the
                    Huns, and by deserting at Chalons (451), all but changed the victory of the
                    Romans into a defeat. Soon afterwards their separate national existence in Gaul
                    was merged in that of the Visigoths. The small portion of the Alani that had
                    remained in their original seat in the Caucasus are frequently noticed in
                    history down to the middle ages. In 572 they were allied with the Armenians
                    under King Saroes. They seem to have afterwards regained their independence. In
                    1221 they were defeated by Gengis Khan, and in 1237 they were so completely
                    subjugated by Batu-Khan that their very name disappears in subsequent
                    history.</p>
