                    race lived in perfect happiness on the fruits of the untilled earth, suffered
                    from no bodily infirmity, passed away in a gentle sleep, and became after death
                    guardian daemons of this world. The second or <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> race
                    was degenerate, and refusing to worship the immortal gods, was buried by Jove in
                    the earth. The third or <hi rend="italic">brazen</hi> race, still more degraded,
                    was warlike and cmel, and perished at last by internal violence. The fourth or
                    <hi rend="italic">heroic</hi> race was a marked advance upon the preceding, its
                    members being the heroes or demi-gods who fought at Troy and Thebes, and who
                    were rewarded after death by being permitted to reap thrice a-year the free
                    produce of the earth. The fifth or <hi rend="italic">iron</hi> race, to which
                    the poet supposes himself to belong, is the most degenerate of all, sunk so low
                    in every vice that any new change must be for the better. Ovid, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Metamorphoses,</hi> follows Hesiod exactly as to nomenclature and
                    very closely as to substance. He makes the degeneracy continuous, however, by
                    omitting the <hi rend="italic">heroic</hi> race or age, which, as Grote points
                    out, was probably introduced by Hesiod, not as part of his didactic plan, but
                    from a desire to conciliate popular feeling by including in his poem the chief
                    myths that were already current among the Greeks.</p>
                <p>A definite period in history distinguished by some special characteristic, such
                    as great literary activity, is generally styled, with some appropriate epithet,
                    an age. It is usual, for example, to speak of the age of Pericles, the Augustan
                    age, the Elizabethan age; of the age of the crusades, the dark ages, the middle
                    ages, the age of steam. Such isolated periods, λvith no continuity or necessary
                    connection of any kind, are obviously quite distinct from the ages or
                    organically-related periods into which certain <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n300/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0300-0279"/> eminent modern philosophers have divided the
                    whole course of human history. According to Fichte’s scheme there are five ages,
                    distinguished by the relative predominance which instinct, external authority,
                    and reason have in them respectively, instinct being supreme in the first and
                    reason in the last. Comte’s scheme distinguishes three ages according to the
                    state of knowledge in each, and he supposes that we are now entering upon the
                    third of these. In the first age of his scheme knowledge is <hi rend="italic"
                    >supernatural</hi> or fictitious; in the second it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >metaphysical</hi> or abstract; in the third it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >positive</hi> or scientific. Schemes somewhat similar have been proposed by
                    other philosophers, chiefly of France and Germany, and seem to be regarded by
                    them as essential to any complete science of history.</p>
                <p>In relation to individual as well as to social life, age is used with a
                    considerable variety of application. It frequently denotes the total duration of
                    life in man, animals, or plants, and in this sense belongs to the subject of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Longevity (</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> q.v.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">)</hi> It also denotes in man the various periods into which
                    his life may be divided, either from a physiological or from a legal point of
                    view. In the former aspect perhaps the most common division is into the four
                    ages of infancy, youth, manhood, and old age. These again have been increased to
                    six or seven by some physiologists—infancy, childhood, boyhood or girlhood,
                    adolescence, manhood or womanhood, age, and old age or second childhood. While
                    both schemes have a sufficient basis of scientific accuracy, they have also each
                    attracted the fancy of the poet. Ovid in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metamorphoses</hi> (xv. 198-213) makes a beautiful comparison between the four
                    ages of a man’s life and the four seasons of the year, in a passage which has
                    been frequently imitated; and the sevenfold division has been exquisitely cast
                    into poetic form by Shakespeare in <hi rend="italic">As You Like It,</hi> act
                    ii. scene 7. The division of human life into periods for legal purposes is
                    naturally more sharp and definite than the foregoing. It would be unscientific
                    in the physiologist to name any precise year for the transition from one of his
                    stages to another, inasmuch as that differs very considerably among different
                    nations, and even to some extent among different individuals of the same nation.
                    But the law must necessarily be fixed and uniform, and even where it professes
                    to proceed according to nature, must be more precise than nature. The Roman law
                    divided human life for its purposes into four chief periods, which had their
                    subdivisions—(1.) <hi rend="italic">Infantia,</hi> lasting till the close of the
                    seventh year; (2.) The period between <hi rend="italic">infantia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">pubertas,</hi> males becoming <hi rend="italic">puberes</hi> at
                    fourteen and females at twelve; (3.) <hi rend="italic">Adolescentia,</hi> the
                    period between puberty and majority; and (4.) The period after the twenty-fifth
                    year, when males become <hi rend="italic">majores.</hi> The first period was one
                    of total legal incapacity; in the second period a person could lawfully do
                    certain specified acts, but only with the sanction of his tutor or guardian; in
                    the third the restrictions were fewer, males being permitted to manage their own
                    property, contract marriage, and make a will; but majority was not reached until
                    the age of twenty-five. By English law there are two great periods into which
                    life is divided— <hi rend="italic">infancy,</hi> which lasts in both sexes until
                    the twenty-first year, and manhood or womanhood. The period of infancy, again,
                    is divided into several stages, marked by the growing development both of rights
                    and obligations. Thus at twelve years of age a male may take the oath of
                    allegiance; at fourteen both sexes are held to have arrived at years of
                    discretion, and may therefore choose guardians, give evidence, and consent or
                    disagree to a marriage. A female has the last privilege from the twelfth year,
                    but the marriage cannot be celebrated until the majority of the parties without
                    the consent of parents or guardians. At fourteen, too, both sexes are fully
                    responsible to the criminal law. Between seven and fourteen there is
                    responsibility only if the accused be proved <hi rend="italic">doli</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">capax,</hi> capable of discerning between right and wrong, the
                    principle in that case being that <hi rend="italic">malitia supplet</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">oetatem.</hi> At twenty-one both males and females obtain their
                    full legal rights, and become liable to all legal obligations. A seat in the
                    British Parliament may be taken at twenty-one. Certain professions, however,
                    demand as a qualification in entrants a more advanced age than that of legal
                    manhood. In the church a candidate for deacon’s orders must be twenty-three, and
                    for priest’s orders twenty-four years of age; and no clergyman is eligible for a
                    bishopric under thirty. In Scotland infancy is not a legal term. The time
                    previous to majority, which, as in England, is reached by both sexes at
                    twenty-one, is divided into two stages: <hi rend="italic">pupilage</hi> lasts
                    until the attainment of puberty, which the law fixes at fourteen in males and
                    twelve in females; <hi rend="italic">minority</hi> lasts from these ages
                    respectively until twenty-one. <hi rend="italic">Minority</hi> obviously
                    corresponds in some degree to the English <hi rend="italic">years of
                    discretion,</hi> but a Scotch minor has more personal rights than an English
                    infant in the last stage of his infancy, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> he may
                    dispose by will of moveable property, make contracts, carry on trade, and, as a
                    necessary consequence, is liable to be declared a bankrupt. Among foreign
                    nations the law on this matter is somewhat varied. In France the year of
                    majority is twenty-one, and the nubile age, according to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Code Napoleon,</hi> eighteen for males and fifteen for females, with a
                    restriction as to the consent of guardians. In Germany majority is usually
                    reached at twenty-four, though in some states (Bavaria, Saxony, Würtemburg, and
                    Baden) the age is twenty-one. In the United States the age qualification for a
                    president is thirty-five, for a senator thirty, and for a representative
                    twenty-five.</p>
