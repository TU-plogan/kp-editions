                    one of the most voluminous of our old English writers before the Conquest. He
                    flourished at the latter end of the 10th century and the beginning of the 11th.
                    Of his personal history little can be learned, and his birth and death are alike
                    involved in obscurity. We know that he was a. pupil of Ethelwold, the friend of
                    Dunstan, at Abingdon. On Ethelwold’s advancement to the see of Winchester,
                    Aelfric accompanied him, and filled the office of chief instructor in the
                    diocese. For the use of his scholars he wrote his Latin and English <hi
                    rend="italic">Grammar and Glossary</hi> and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colloquium.</hi> The last of these is in Latin, with an old English interlinear
                    translation, in which the Latin is rendered word for word. It is interesting for
                    its account of ancient manners, and shows that Aelfric made use of the
                    conversational method in his teaching. The words in his Glossary are not
                    arranged alphabetically, but grouped together into classes. Aelfric afterwards
                    removed to Cerne Abbey, in Dorsetshire, where he composed his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Homilies,</hi> the work on which his fame as an author chiefly depends. They
                    are 80 in number, and were edited by Thorpe in 1844-46 for the Aelfric Society.
                    In composing them, Aelfric drew largely from the fathers. Their style is very
                    simple and pleasing, and obscure words are carefully avoided in order to adapt
                    them to the capacity even of the most ignorant. Subsequent writers made great
                    use of them, and not a few are to be found unabridged in the transition
                    (semi-Saxon) English of the succeeding centuries. They excited great attention
                    about the time of the Reformation, and were appealed to—especially the “Paschal
                    Homily”—to prove that the doctrines of the English Church before the Conquest
                    were at variance with those held by the Church of Rome. Among Aelfric’s other
                    works may be mentioned his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Old and New
                    Testaments,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Abridgment of the Pentateuch and the
                    Book of Job.</hi> Of the rest of his life we have little on which we can rely.
                    He attained to the dignity of abbot, but he seems to be a different person from
                    Aelfric, archbishop of Canterbury (995-1006), with whom he is sometimes
                    confounded.</p>
