                    or “The Sack Carrier,” from the fact of his having been obliged in the early
                    part of his life to gain his livelihood by acting as a porter in the market,
                    lived at Alexandria during the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and
                    died there 241 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Very little is known of the events
                    of his life. He is said by Porphyry to have been born of Christian parents, and
                    to have belonged originally to their faith, from which he afterwards
                    apostatised. Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(Church History,</hi> vi. 19) denies
                    this apostasy, and affirms that Ammonius continued a Christian to the end of his
                    life. It is clear, however, that Eusebius is referring to another Ammonius, a
                    Christian who lived at Alexandria during the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> Ammonius, afteι long study and meditation, opened a school for
                    philosophy in Alexandria. Among his pupils were Herennius, the two Origens,
                    Longinus, and, most distinguished of all, Plotinus, who in his search for true
                    wisdom found himself irresistibly attracted by Ammonius, remained his close
                    companion for eleven years, and in all his later philosophy professed to be the
                    mere exponent of his great master. Ammonius himself designedly wrote nothing,
                    and the doctrines taught in his school were, at least during his life, kept
                    secret, after the fashion of the old Pythagorean society. Thus, while all the
                    later developments of neoPlatonism are in a general way referred to him as their
                    originator, little is known of his special tenets. From the notices of
                    Hierocles, a scholar of Plutarch, in the early part of the 5th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> preserved in Photius, we learn that his fundamental
                    doctrine was an eclecticism, or union of Plato and Aristotle. He attempted to
                    show that a system of philosophy, common to both and higher than their special
                    views, was contained in their writings. He thus, according to his admirers, put
                    an end to the interminable disputes of the rival schools. What other elements
                    Ammonius included in his eclectic system, and in particular how he stood related
                    to the Jewish and Christian theosophies, are points on which no information can
                    be procured. Few direct references to hin! exist, and even <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n787/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0787-0744"/> these are not of unquestionable authority. He
                    undoubtedly originated the neo-Platonic movement, but it cannot be determined to
                    what extent that philosophy, as known to us through Plotinus and Proclus,
                    represents his ideas. Eusebius <hi rend="italic">{Church History,</hi> vi. 19)
                    mentions some Christian works by Ammonius. As Porphyry expressly tells us that
                    Ammonius the philosopher wrote nothing, Eusebius must be referring to the later
                    Christian of the same name. To this later Ammonius belongs the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diates-saron, or Harmony of the Four Gospels,</hi> sometimes ascribed to the
                    philosopher. (See Fabricius, <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic"
