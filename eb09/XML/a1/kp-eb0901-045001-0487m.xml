                    and statesman, was born near Piacenza, probably at the village of Fiorenzuola,
                    on the 31st May 1664. His father was a gardener, and he himself became first
                    connected with the church in the humble position of verger in the cathedral of
                    Piacenza. Having gained the favour of Bishop Barni, he took priest’s orders, and
                    afterwards accompanied the son of his patron to Rome. During the war of the
                    Spanish succession Alberoni laid the foundation of his political success by the
                    services he rendered to the duke of Vendome, commander of the French forces in
                    Italy; and when these forces were recalled in 1706, he accompanied the duke to
                    Paris, where he was favourably received by Louis XIV. In 1711 he followed
                    Vendome into Spain as his secretary. Two years later, the duke having died in
                    the interval, Alberoni was appointed consular agent for Parma at the court of
                    Philip V. of Spain, being raised at the same time to the dignity of count. On
                    his arrival at Madrid he found the Princess des Ursins all but omnipotent with
                    the king, and for a time he judged it expedient to use her influence in carrying
                    out his plans. In concert with her he arranged the king’s marriage with
                    Elizabeth Farnese of Parma, whom he represented to be of such a facile
                    disposition that the princess’s power over Philip would be in no degree impaired
                    by the union. Alberoni was already in Parma to conclude the negotiation ere the
                    Princess des Ursins discovered that he had entirely deceived her as to the
                    character of Elizabeth. A messenger was at once despatched to prevent, if
                    possible, the ratification of the engagement; but he arrived too late. On
                    reaching Spain Elizabeth’s first act, prompted doubtless by Alberoni, was to
                    demand the instant dismissal of the outwitted favourite, who was compelled to
                    leave the Spanish dominions. The influence of the new queen being actively
                    exerted on Alberoni’s behalf, he speedily rose to high position. He was made a
                    member of the king’s council, bishop of Malaga, and in 1715 prime minister, and
                    was raised to the dignity of cardinal in 1717. His internal policy was
                    exceedingly vigorous, and, though carried out altogether regardless of popular
                    rights and liberties, might have restored the lost greatness of Spain had it not
                    been for his unscrupulous and audacious conduct of foreign affairs. The key to
                    his daring and crafty schemes is probably to be found in the desire of Elizabeth
                    to secure a throne for her son Don Carlos, born in 1716. Seizing the flimsiest
                    pretext for making war upon Austria, he invaded the island of Sardinia, then
                    Austrian territory, and took possession of Sicily. In France he pressed the
                    claims of Philip V. to the regency in opposition to the Duke of Orleans; he
                    sought to keep England employed at home by encouraging the Pretender, and he
                    pursued a similar policy towards Austria in connection with Ragotski of
                    Transylvania and the Sultan. An alliance which he formed with Russia and Sweden
                    led to no practical results, and his other schemes similarly failed. England,
                    France, Austria, and Holland united themselves in what is known as the Quadruple
                    Alliance against the aggressions of Spain; and though their first proposals were
                    rejected fearlessly by Alberoni, they were strong enough to succeed when, in a
                    second negotiation, they required of Philip the dismissal of his minister as an
                    indispensable condition of peace. On the 5th December 1719 he was ordered to
                    leave Spain, Elizabeth herself having taken an active part in procuring the
                    decree of banishment. He went to Italy, and there had to take refuge among the
                    Apennines, Pope Clement, who was his bitter enemy, having given strict orders
                    for his arrest. On the death of Clement, Alberoni boldly appeared at the
                    Conclave, and took part in the election of Innocent XIII. (1721), after which he
                    was for a short time imprisoned by the pontiff on the demand of Spain. At the
                    next election he was himself proposed for the papal chair, and secured ten votes
                    at the Conclave which elected Benedict XIII. Benedict’s successor, Clement XII.,
                    named him legate of Ravenna, in which capacity he incurred the pope’s
                    displeasure by the strong and unwarrantable measures he adopted to reduce the
                    little republic of San Marino to subjection to Rome. He was consequently
                    replaced by another legate in 1740, and soon after he retired to Piacenza, where
                    he founded a college which still bears his name. He died on the 16th June 1752,
                    leaving a sum of 600,000 ducats to endow the seminary he had founded, and the
                    residue of the immense wealth he had acquired in Spain to his nephew. Alberoni
                    left a large quantity of manuscripts; but the genuineness of the <hi
