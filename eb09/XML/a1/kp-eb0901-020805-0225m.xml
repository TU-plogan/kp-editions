                    Eleusis. The period of his youth and manhood coincides, therefore, with that
                    great uprising of the national spirit of the Greeks, caused by the successive

                    European neighbours on the north and west shores of the Aegean; and it was no
                    doubt as much for the advantage of his poetical faculty as for the development
                    of his manhood, that he took an active part in those famous military
                    achievements by which the march of the insolent Asiatic hosts was repelled. The
                    father of Attic tragedy helped, in the year 490, to drive the captains of Darius
                    into the marshes of Marathon, and, ten years later, encompassed with ruin the
                    multitudinous armament of Xerxes within the narrow strait of Salamis. The
                    glories of this naval achievement, the bard who had helped to win it with his
                    sword afterwards lived to celebrate with the lyre, and left to the world the
                    play of the <hi rend="italic">Persians,</hi> as a great national record of
                    combined poetry and patriotism almost unique in history. Of his subsequent
                    career at Athens only a few scanty notices remain, and those chiefly connected
                    with the representation of his plays. We know that he composed seventy plays,
                    and that he gained the prize for dramatic excellence thirteen times; further,
                    that the Athenians esteemed his works so highly as to allow some of them to be
                    represented after his death, —a privilege, in their dramatic practice,
                    altogether anomalous. We know, also, that in the course of his life he paid one
                    or two visits to Sicily, to which country he was attracted, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0226-0209"/> no doubt, by the same literary influence in the
                    person of its ruler Hiero, that drew thither Bacchylides, Simonides, and other
                    notable men of that rich epoch. There can, at the same time, be little doubt
                    that one cause of his visits to that island may have been a want of sympathy as
                    to political matters between him and the Athenian public; for while the
                    Athenians, from the time of Cleisthenes <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.c.</hi> 510),
                    had been advancing by rapid and decided steps to the full expansion of the
                    democratic principle, it is evident, from some passages in his plays, especially
                    from the whole tone and tendency of the <hi rend="italic">Eumenides,</hi> that
                    the political leanings of the poet of the <hi rend="italic">Prometheus</hi> were
                    towards aristocracy, and that, in the days of Pericles, he foresaw, with a
                    sorrowful fear, the ripeness of those democratic evils which within so short a
                    period led Xenophon to seek a new fatherland in Sparta, and opened to the
                    Macedonian a plain path to the sovereignty of Greece. But whatever may have have
                    been his motives for retiring from the scene of so many literary triumphs (and
                    the gossipers of ancient times have of course transmitted to us their pleasant
                    inventions on this point), it is certain that, in the year A.c. 456, two years
                    after the representation of his great trilogy, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orestiad,</hi> he died at Gela, in Sicily, in the sixty-ninth year of his age;
                    and the people of Gela, rejoicing in his bones, as Ravenna does in those of the
                    banished Dante, inscribed the following memorial on his tomb:—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> “Here Aeschylus lies, from his Athenian home </l>
                    <l part="N"> Remote, 'neath Gela’s wheat-producing loam; </l>
                    <l part="N"> How brave in battle was Euphorion's son, </l>
                    <l part="N"> The long-haired Mede can tell who fell at Marathon.” </l>
                </lg>
                <p>And thus he lives among posterity, celebrated more as a patriot than as a poet;
                    as if to witness to all times that the great world of books, with all its power,
                    is but a small thing unless it be the reflection of a greater world of action.
                    Of the seventy plays which an old biographer reports him to have composed, only
                    seven remain, with a few fragments of little significance save to the keen eye
                    of the professed philologist. These fragments, however, are sufficient to
                    justify the high esteem in which he was held by the Athenian public, and by that
                    greatest of all the great wits of a witty age and a witty people, Aristophanes.
                    In the grand trilogy which exhibits, in three consecutive tragedies, the story
                    of the murder of Agamemnon, and its moral sequences, we have a perfect specimen
                    of what the Greek tragedy was to the Greeks, as at once a complex artistic
                    machinery for the exhibition of national legend, and a grave pulpit for the
                    preaching of important moral truths; nor could a more worthy founder than
                    Aeschylus of such a “sacred opera” be imagined. His imagination dwells
                    habitually in the loftiest region of the stem old religious mythology of
                    primeval Greece; his moral tone is pure, his character earnest and manly, and
                    his strictly dramatic power (notwithstanding the very imperfect form of the
                    drama in his day), as exhibited more especially in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agamemnon,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Eumenides,</hi> and in some parts of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Prometheus,</hi> is such as none of his famous successors,
                    least of all Euripides, could surpass. Of his other plays, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seven against Thebes</hi> is a drama, as Aristophanes expressed it, “full of
                    war,” and breathes in every line the spirit of the age and of the people that
                    saved Europe from the grasp of oriental despotism; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Persians,</hi> though weak in some parts, contains sortie fine choral poetry,
                    and a description of the battle of Salamis, that will belong to the poetry of
                    the world so long as the world lasts; while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Suppliants</hi> presents much in a tasteful translation that makes us lament
                    the loss of the missing piece of the trilogy to which it belonged, no less than
                    the blundering of the thoughtless copyists of the middle ages, by whose pen it
                    has been so egregiously defaced. For in ancient times the flowing rhetorical
                    Euripides was found a more useful model for the schools of eloquence than the
                    lofty, stern, and sometimes harsh, and occasionally it may be obscure,
                    Aeschylus: therefore the text of the latter has been comparatively neglected,
                    and much work was left for the tasteful philologist before many parts of his
                    noblest choruses could be rendered legible. Of the editions of Aeschylus, the
                    most notable in the earlier times of modern scholarship is that of Stanley; in
                    more recent times, that of Schütz, who undertook the work of restoration with
                    much learning and great boldness. The impulse given by this scholar was
                    moderated by Wellauer, who, in his edition, along with some happy emendations,
                    principally endeavoured to vindicate the authority of the manuscript readings
                    from tho large license of conjectural critics; and now from the remains of the
                    great Hermann has been published a text that should present the just medium
                    between the timidity of Wellauer and the rashness of mere conjectural criticism,
                    though it is much to be feared that the learned German has been not seldom led
                    astray by the itch of emendation, which is the old besetting sin of critical
                    scholarship. Of English poetical translations there are the old one by Potter,
                    and recent ones by Blackie, Plumptre, and Swan wick. There is also a translation
                    in literal prose by Buckley. (J. S. B.)</p>
