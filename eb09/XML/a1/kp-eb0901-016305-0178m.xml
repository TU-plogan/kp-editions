                    a citizen, was enrolled in the family and <hi rend="italic">demus</hi> of the
                    adoptive father, whose name, however, he did not necessarily assume. In the
                    interest of the next of kin, whose rights were affected by a case of adoption,
                    it was provided that the registration should be attended with certain
                    formalities, and that it should take place at a fixed time—the festival of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Thargelia.</hi> The rights and duties of adopted children were
                    almost identical with those of natural offspring, and could not be renounced
                    except in the case of one who had begotten children to take his place in the
                    family of his adoptive father. Adopted into another family, children ceased to
                    have any claim of kindred or inheritance through their natural father, though
                    any rights they might have through their mother were not similarly affected.
                    Among the Romans the existence of the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gave</hi> a peculiar significance to the custom of adoption. The
                    motive to the act was not so generally childlessness, or the gratification of
                    affection, as the desire to acquire those civil and agnate rights which were
                    founded on the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas.</hi> It was necessary,
                    however, that the adopter should have no children of his own, and that he should
                    be of such an age as to preclude reasonable expectation of any being born to
                    him. Another limitation as to age was imposed by the maxim <hi rend="italic"
                    >adoptio imitatur naturam,</hi> which required the adoptive father to be at
                    least eighteen years older than the adopted children. According to the same
                    maxim eunuchs were not permitted to adopt, as being impotent to beget children
                    for themselves. Adoption was of two kinds according to the state of the person
                    adopted, who might be either still under the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas
                    (alieni</hi><hi rend="italic">juris),</hi> or his own master <hi rend="italic"
                    >(sui juris).</hi> In the former case the act was one of <hi rend="italic"
                    >adoption proper,</hi> in the latter case it was styled <hi rend="italic"
                    >adrogation,</hi> though the term adoption was also used in a general sense to
                    describe both species. In adoption proper the natural father publicly sold his
                    child to tho adoptive father, and the sale being thrice repeated, the maxim of
                    the Twelve Tables took effect, <hi rend="italic">Si pater</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >filium</hi><hi rend="italic">ter venunduit,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >filius</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">patre</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">liber esto.</hi> The process was ratified and completed by a
                    fictitious action of recovery brought by the adoptive father against the natural
                    parent, which the latter did not defend, and which was therefore known as the
                    <hi rend="italic">cessio</hi><hi rend="italic">in jure. Adrogation</hi> could be
                    accomplished originally only by the authority of the people assembled in the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n179/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0179-0164"/><hi rend="italic">Comitia,</hi> but from the time
                    of Diocletian it was effected by an imperial rescript. Females could not be
                    adrogated, and, as they did not possess the <hi rend="italic">patria
                    potestas,</hi> they could not exercise the right of adoption in either kind. The
                    whole Roman law on the subject of adoption will be found in Justinian’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutes,</hi> lib. i. tit. 11. In Hindoo law, as in nearly
                    every ancient system, wills are almost unknown, and adoptions take their place.
                    The strict law of adoption in India has been relaxed to the extent that a Hindoo
                    widow may adopt when her deceased husband has not done so. Adoption is not
                    recognised in the laws of England and Scotland, though there are legal means by
                    which one may be enabled to assume the name and arms and to inherit the property
                    of a stranger. In France and Germany, which may be said to have embodied the
                    Roman law in their jurisprudence, adoption is regulated according to the
                    principles of Justinian, though with several more or less important
                    modifications, rendered necessary by the usages of these countries respectively.
                    The part played by the legal fiction of adoption in the constitution of
                    primitive society and the civilisation of the race is so important, that Sir
                    Henry S. Maine, in his valuable work on <hi rend="italic">Ancient Law,</hi>
                    expresses the opinion that, had it never existed, the primitive groups of
                    mankind could not have coalesced except on terms of absolute superiority on the
                    one side, and absolute subjection on the other. With the institution of
                    adoption, however, one people might <hi rend="italic">feign itself</hi> as
                    descended from the same stock as the people to whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacra</hi><hi rend="italic">gentilicia</hi> it was admitted; and amicable
                    relations were thus established between stocks which, but for this expedient,
                    must have submitted to the arbitrament of the sword with all its
                    consequences.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adoption,</hi> as a Biblical term, occurs only in the <hi
                    rend="italic">New Testament.</hi> In Old Testament history the practice was
                    unknown, though cases approximating to it have been pointed out. In the New
                    Testament <hi rend="italic">υ</hi><hi rend="italic">ἱ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >o</hi><hi rend="italic">θ</hi><hi rend="italic">∈</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >σ</hi><hi rend="italic">ί</hi><hi rend="italic">α</hi> occurs in several
                    passages, on which is founded one of the leading doctrines of theology.</p>
