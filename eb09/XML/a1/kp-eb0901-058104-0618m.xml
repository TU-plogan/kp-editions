                    recently (1861) the Rev. Charles Stanford has retold his story and the story of
                    his age with great fulness of knowledge and historical fidelity. The Alleines
                    came out of Suffolk, and as early as 1430 some of them—sprang of Alan, lord of
                    Buckenhall—settled in the neighbourhood of Caine and Devizes, whence descended
                    the immediate ancestors of “worthy Mr Tobie Alleine of Devizes,” father of our
                    worthy. Joseph Alleine, fourth of a large family, was born at Devizes early in
                    1634. 1645 is marked in the title-page of a quaint old tractate, by an
                    eye-witness, as his “<hi rend="italic">setting forth in the Christian
                    race."</hi> His eldest brother Edward had been a clergyman, but in this year
                    died, in his twentyseventh<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0619-0582"/> year; and Joseph entreated his father that he
                    might be educated to succeed his brother in the work of the ministry. His father
                    consented, and he was immediately sent to Poulshot, then under a fellow of
                    Exeter College, Oxford (William Spinage). In April 1649 he set out for Lincoln
                    College, Oxford, in the presidency of Dr Paul Hood, with Dr John Owen as the
                    vice-chancellor of the university. A Wiltshire place becoming vacant in Corpus
                    Christi College, on the 3d Nov. 1651 he was chosen scholar of that house. Of his
                    student life it was written contemporaneously, “<hi rend="italic">He could toil
                    terribly.”</hi> On 6th July 1653 he took the degree of B.D., and thereupon
                    became a tutor of his college. He became also chaplain of Corpus Christi,
                    preferring this to a fellowship. In 1654 he had offers of high preferment in the
                    state, which he declined. The succeeding year (1655) brought him another offer,
                    which he did not decline. George Newton, of the great church of St Mary
                    Magdalene, Taunton, sought him for assistant; and putting from him all other
                    things, even forsaking further academical honours within his immediate grasp, he
                    accepted the invitation by proceeding at once to Taunton, undergoing the
                    accustomed probation, and at last being ordained as the associate of one of the
                    most venerable of the later Puritan fathers. The ministry that resulted stands
                    out lustrous and noble in the history of historical Taunton, and in the Life of
                    the junior pastor, as told by Baxter and Stanford. Almost coincident with
                    ordination came the marriage of the associate - pastor with Theodosia Alleine,
                    daughter of Richard Alleine. Friendships among “gentle and simple” —of the
                    former, with Lady Farewell, grand-daughter of Protector Somerset—bear witness to
                    the attraction of Alleine’s private life. His public life—in preaching after the
                    intense, awakening, wistful type; in catechising with all diligence and
                    fidelity; in visitation among the poor and mean and sad; in letter-writing,
                    tender and sympathetic; in devotional intercession through long consecrated
                    hours of day and night—was a model of pastoral devotion. This is all the more
                    remarkable as the pastor continued the student-toil of Corpus Christi, one
                    monument of which was his <hi rend="italic">Theologia Philosophica,</hi> a lost
                    MS., establishing the harmony between revelation and nature, and whose
                    learning—classical, patristic, and recondite—drew forth the wonder of Baxter.
                    Alleine was no mere scholar or divine, but a man who associated on equal terms
                    with the patriarchs of the Royal Society, then laying those broad and deep
                    foundations on which rests England’s present scientific renown. These scientific
                    studies and experiments, nevertheless, were ever kept in subordination to his
                    proper work. The extent of his influence was, in so young a man, unique, resting
                    fundamentally on the earnestness of his nature and the manifest power of his
                    ministry. The year 1662 found senior and junior pastors like-minded, and both
                    were of the Two Thousand. Alleine, when the Ejection blow fell, with John Wesley
                    (grandfather of the celebrated John Wesley) for fellowlabourer, also ejected,
                    carried on a kind of itineracy where-ever opportunity was found for preaching
                    the gospel. For this he was cast into prison, indicted at sessions, and suffered
                    as hundreds of England’s noblest men have suffered. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letters from Prison</hi> were an earlier <hi rend="italic">Cardi-phonia.</hi>
                    He was released on 26th May 1664; and spite of the Conventicle Act (Five Mile
                    Act), he returned to his beloved work as a preacher of the gospel. He found
                    himself again in prison, and again and again a sufferer. Tempestuous and
                    troubled were his remaining years. Now in hiding, now in great bodily weakness,
                    now coming to the front in some act of charity or patriotism, now at the waters
                    of Bath, slowly but serenely wearing out. He died November 17, 1668; and the
                    mourners, remember ing their beloved minister’s words while yet with them, “If I
                    should die fifty miles away, let me be buried at Taunton,” found a grave for him
                    in St Mary’s chancel. Pilgrims from over the sea read with dim eyes the brief
                    Latin inscription on his stone. No Puritan-Nonconformist name is so
                    affectionately cherished as is that of Joseph Alleine. “Being dead he yet
                    speaketh” through his imperishable practical books. (<hi rend="italic"
