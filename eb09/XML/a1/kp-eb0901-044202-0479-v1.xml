                        de</hi></label>, one of the most distinguished Spanish dramatists, bom at
                    Tasco in Mexico about the close of the 16th century, was descended from a noble
                    family belonging to Alarcon in Cuença. Nothing is known with certainty of his
                    early life, but it is probable that he was educated at one of the Spanish
                    universities. In 1622 he had taken up his residence at Madrid, and in 1628 he
                    was appointed to the office of <hi rend="italic">relator</hi> (reporter) of the
                    royal council of the Indies, which afforded him a competency. In the same year
                    he published the first volume of his comedies, dedicating it to “the rabble” in
                    a daringly contemptuous address. A second volume of comedies appeared at
                    Barcelona in 1634, in which he brought charges against several poets of
                    appropriating his productions. About the same time he was successful in an open
                    competition for a dramatic libretto to be played at ths fêtes in honour of
                    Philip IV. These two facts, combined with his haughty disdain both of the public
                    and of his literary brethren, made Alarcon very unpopular; and he was
                    scur-rilously lampooned by most of the poets and dramatists of the day, Calderon
                    honourably distinguishing himself by his silence. A further injustice was done
                    him in the piracy of his works by other and better known authors than himself.
                    To such an extent was this carried that Alarcon’s reputa-, tion as a dramatist
                    was almost extinct even before the close of his life, and it is only quite
                    recently that it has been revived. The date of his death is given, on doubtful
                    authority, as 1639. Alarcon holds a foremost place among Spanish dramatists,
                    being surpassed only, if at all, by Lope de Vega and Calderon. He is
                    distinguished by the correctness of his language, the harmony of his verse, and
                    the elevation of his sentiment. His <hi rend="italic">La Verdad Sospechosa</hi>
                    (Suspicious Truth) supplied Corneille with the materials for his <hi
                        rend="italic">Menteur,</hi> and called forth the highest praise from the
                    great French dramatist. His <hi rend="italic">Tejedor de Segovia</hi> (Weaver of
                    Segovia) and <hi rend="italic">Las Paredes</hi><hi rend="italic">Oyen</hi>
                    (Walls have Ears) are acted at the present day. A complete edition of his
                    comedies was published by Hartzenbusch at Madrid (1848-52).</p>
