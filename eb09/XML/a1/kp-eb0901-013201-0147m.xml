                <p><label type="entry">ACTION</label>, <hi rend="italic">in Law,</hi> is the process
                    by which redress is sought in a court of justice for the violation of a legal
                    right. The word is used by jurists in three different senses. Sometimes it is
                    spoken of as a right—the right, namely, of instituting the legal process;
                    sometimes, and more properly, it means the legal process itself; and sometimes
                    the particular form which it assumes. The most universally recognised division
                    of actions is the division established by the Roman lawyers into actions <hi
                    rend="italic">in rem</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in personam.</hi> An action <hi
                    rend="italic">in rem</hi> asserts a right to a particular thing as against all
                    the world; an action <hi rend="italic">in personam</hi> asserts a right only as
                    against a particular person. For the sake of convenience, the law relating to
                    actions ought to form a separate section by itself in a properly constructed
                    code.</p>
                <p>In Roman law the action passed through three historical stages—</p>
                <p>In the first period, which was brought to an end by the <hi rend="italic">Lex
                    Aebutia,</hi> about 573 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.u.c.,</hi> the system of <hi
                    rend="italic">legis actiones</hi> prevailed. These were five in number,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">actio sacramenti, per judicis postulationem, per condictionem, per
                    manus injectionem, per pignoris captionem.</hi> The first was the primitive and
                    characteristic action of the Roman law, and the others were little more than
                    modes of applying it to cases not contemplated in the original form, or of
                    carrying the result of it into execution when the action had been decided.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Action,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">English Law,</hi> means
                    the form of civil process hitherto observed in the Courts of Common Law. The
                    procedure in the Court of Chancery is totally distinct, but some account of the
                    former may be desirable in order to explain the new form of action introduced
                    for all the civil courts by the Judicature Act of 1873:—</p>
                <p>Actions at law are divided by Blackstone into three classes, according to the
                    relief which they are respectively intended to obtain. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Real</hi> actions are those “whereby the plaintiff claims title to have any
                    lands or tenements, rents, commons, or other hereditaments.” In <hi
                    rend="italic">personal</hi> actions the claim is “for debt or personal duty, or
                    damages in lieu thereof,” or for “satisfaction in damages for some injury done
                    to person or property.” <hi rend="italic">Mixed</hi> actions were supposed to
                    partake of the nature of both of these; that is to say, there was a demand both
                    for real property and for personal damages, as in the case of an action for
                    waste. The distinction has long ceased to be of any value. Blackstone speaks of
                    real actions as being in his time pretty generally laid aside, and successive
                    enactments have obliterated the distinctions altogether. The statute 3 &amp; 4
                    Will. IV. c. 27, abolished all the real and mixed actions, except three real
                    actions, and ejectment, which was a mixed action. The Common Law Procedure Act
                    of 1860 has assimilated the procedure in the former to an ordinary action, and
                    the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852 now regulates the proceedings in ejectment.
                    In those and other respects the three Common Law Procedure Acts of 1852, 1854,
                    and I860, very greatly simplified the proceedings in an action at law. The first
                    of these rendered it unnecessary any longer to select a <hi rend="italic"
                    >form</hi> of action in prosecuting a claim, and abolished many of the
                    technicalities which had accompanied the older forme. The divisions<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n148/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0148-0133"/> now observed may be regarded as indicating, not
                    so much forms of action in the old sense, as the character of the injury
                    sustained and the relief sought.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Action</hi> (under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act,
                    1873). By this Act, which establishes one supreme court in place of the Superior
                    Courts of Common Law and the High Court of Chancery, action is the name given to
                    the proceeding in the High Court of Justice, which takes the place of the old
                    actions at common law, suits instituted by bill or information in the Court of
                    Chancery, causes <hi rend="italic">in rem</hi> in the Court of Admiralty, or by
                    citation in the Court of Probate. For these various modes of obtaining redress
                    the Act substitutes one uniform proceeding, which retains most of the essential
                    features of the common law action. The form of action established by the Act is
                    in some measure a compromise between the old action at law and Chancery suit. It
                    may be described as putting an end to the unintelligible and even misleading
                    formulae of the one and reducing the prolixity and redundance of the other. <hi
