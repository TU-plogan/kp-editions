                    >(Onomasticon,</hi> s.v.) been interpreted highlanders, or inhabitants of the
                    heights, as Canaanites is supposed to mean lowlanders, or inhabitants of the
                    plains (cf. Num. xiii. 29; Deut. i. 44; Josh. v. 1, x. 6). Others call this in
                    question, and find an explanation rather in the tallness of stature by which
                    they seem to have been distinguished (Num. xiii 32, 33; Amos ii. 9, cf. Kurtz,
                    <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. Alt.</hi><hi rend="italic">Bundes,</hi> i. § 45;
                    Pusey, <hi rend="italic">Minor Prophets,</hi> 174, n.)</p>
                <p>That thia people had a certain preponderance among the Canaanitic tribes is shown
                    by their name often standing in Scripture for Canaanites in general (Gen. xv.
                    16; Josh, xxiv. 18; Jud. vi. 10). Their principal seat on the west of the Jordan
                    was the mountains of Judah and their southern slopes,—to the whole of which
                    mountainous region, indeed, the name the Mount of the Amorites is applied (Gen.
                    xiv. 7, 13; Num. xiii. 29; Deut i. 7, 20, 44; Josh, xi. 3; Jud. i. 36). We hear
                    of them also at Gibeon, north-west of Jerusalem (2 Sam. xxL 2), at Aijalou, west
                    of Gibeon, and in the northern part of the Philistine plain (Jud. i. 34, 35),
                    and in the land of Ephraim (Gen. xlviii. 22). On the east of Jordan, after
                    having driven back the Ammonites and Moabites, they occupied the whole of Gilead
                    and Bashan, from the Arnon, the northern limit of Moab, as far as Mount Hermon,
                    forming in this region at the epoch of Moses two powerful kingdoms,—that of
                    Sihon, whose capital was Heshbon, the more southerly; and that of Og, whose
                    capital was Ashtaroth, the more northerly (Num. xxi. 21-35; Deut. iii. 8, 10;
                    iv. 48). It was with this east-Jordanic section of the Amorites that the
                    Israelites first came into conflict. After these had been subdued, and after the
                    Israelites had crossed the Jordan and had begun to capture the Canaanitish
                    towns, five of the most powerful of the Amorite kings of the western section
                    formed a confederacy to oppose the advancing host (Josh. x. 5, sq.) When this
                    combination had been overthrown, a final attempt at resistance was made by the
                    more northerly portion of the Canaanites, under the auspices of Jabin, king of
                    Hazor; and in the united forces, which were overthrown at the waters of Merom,
                    Amorites were included (Josh. xi. 3). Those of this and the other tribes of the
                    Canaanites who survived the conquests of Joshua, either gradually became mingled
                    with the Philistines and others of the neighbouring nations, or they continued
                    to live among the Israelites in the condition of tributaries and slaves (Josh.
                    xi. 22; Jud. i. 34, 35; 1 Kings ix. 21; 2 Chron, viii. 8).</p>
                <p>In old Egyptian literature mention is frequently made, from the time of Sethos
                    I., of an Asiatic people called the Amar or Amaor, whom Egyptologers agree in
                    identifying with the Amorites (Bunsen, <hi rend="italic">Egypt's Place,</hi>
                    vol. iii. 212). There is as yet less agreement in regard to the position of
                    their country. Brugsch is of opinion that the people in question are located in
                    the north of Syria, on the banks of the Orontes (see his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geog.</hi><hi rend="italic">Inschriften,</hi> Bd. ii. 21; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist.</hi><hi rend="italic">d'Egypte,</hi> 132, 187). The later researches of
                    Chabas, however, have rendered the interpretation on which this view depends
                    very doubtful, and shown that in all probability their territory lies, in entire
                    harmony with the representations of Scripture regarding the Amorites, on the
                    west of the Dead Sea and south of the land of Judah (Chabas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Etudes</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ι</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiquité,</hi> 267, f.; <hi rend="italic">Recherches,</hi> 44, 107.) Among the
                    towns of the Amaor are mentioned Dapur and Kodesh, evidently to be identified
                    with the scriptural Debir and Kadesh.</p>
                <p>The language, <hi rend="italic">kc.,</hi> of the Amorites will be more
                    conveniently considered under <hi rend="smallcaps">Canaanites.</hi></p>
