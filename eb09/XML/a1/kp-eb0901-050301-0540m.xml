                    born at 25 Alfred Place, Bedford Row, London, October 7th, 1810 (died 1871). He
                    came <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n541/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0541-0504"/> of a Somersetshire family, five generations of
                    which, in direct succession, contributed clergymen of some distinction to the
                    English Church. The earliest of these, his greatgreat-grandfather, Thomas
                    Alford, who died in 1708, was for many years the vicar of Curry Rivell, near
                    Taunton—a living that passed from one to another of his descendants. The father
                    of Dean Alford studied for the bar, but after practising for a short time,
                    followed the course of his predecessors by taking holy orders; and, until his
                    death at a venerable age in 1852, had long been familiarly known and revered in
                    his part of the country as the rector of Aston Sandford in Buckinghamshire. His
                    first wife, the dean’s mother, whose maiden name was Sarah Eliza Paget, was the
                    younger daughter of a well-to-do banker of Tamworth in Staffordshire. A
                    twelvemonth after their marriage, her husband, then practising as a special
                    pleader, was by her premature death in childbed left a widower. The newly-born
                    infant, who remained to the last the bereaved parent’s only child, was confided
                    in the first instance to the affectionate care of the home-circle in the house
                    of his maternal grandfather. Towards the close of 1813 he was taken back to the
                    lonely hearth of his father, who had now entered upon his clerical duties as
                    curate of Steeple Ashton, near Trowbridge in Wiltshire. Being the only son of a
                    secluded scholar, the boy’s education was from an unusually early period
                    sedulously cared for; his father being his first instructor, and at the outset
                    his constant companion. So exceptional was his precocity that at six he had
                    already written a little MS. volume entitled (in round hand) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels of St Paid.</hi> Before he was eight he had penned a
                    collection of Latin odes in miniature. When he was scarcely nine he had
                    compiled, in the straggling characters of a schoolboy, a compendious <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Jews;</hi> besides drawing out a chronological
                    scheme in which were tabulated the events of the Old Testament. Prior to the
                    completion of his tenth year he actually produced a series of terse sermons or
                    laconically outlined homilies, the significant title of which was <hi
                    rend="italic">Looking unto Jesus.</hi> During the absence of his father, who had
                    gone abroad as the travelling chaplain of Lord Calthorpe, Henry, at seven years
                    of age, began the round of three academies, at Charmouth and Hammersmith; the
                    happiest time of all for him as a schoolboy being three years and upwards passed
                    in the grammarschool at Ilminster. His character was already displaying a marked
                    individuality. He could repeat not only readily but appreciatively an
                    astonishing number of lines in Greek, Latin, and English, selected from what
                    were then and always afterwards his favourite classic authors. He indulged, too,
                    in those early days, in the luxury of original versification. Then it was also
                    that he first began to manifest that singular capacity for ingenious contrivance
                    and that surprising neatness and dexterity of manipulation for which he was
                    afterwards remarkable. It was said of him later in life, that he could construct
                    an organ and then play upon it; and when his reputation for profound scholarship
                    had been long established, his constructiveness was curiously manifested by his
                    adaptation to the purposes of utility of the seemingly ordinary walking-stick he
                    carried when travelling on the Continent. In its upper joint he secreted his
                    surplus money and his drawing materials; in its lower joint, pens, ink, wax, and
                    pencils. Strangely contrasting with this ineradicable passion for nicety and
                    precision was his delight at all times in giving himself up to the most
                    diversified occupations, and in yielding, often at an instant’s notice, as he
                    sometimes notes with regret, to the temptation of mere discursiveness.</p>
                <p>It was in the October of 1827 that the university life of Alford commenced. At
                    seventeen he went up to Cambridge, having won his scholarship, and had his name
                    entered at Trinity College. During the midsummer of his fourth year at
                    Cambridge, in the June of 1831, he had obtained the second prize essay. As the
                    autumn deepened into winter he was nervously preparing to go in for honours at
                    the examinations. In the possibility of his success he had not the slightest
                    confidence, yet on the 21st January 1832 he appears as thirty-fourth wrangler;
                    while on the 25th February his name comes out eighth on the first-class list of
                    the classical tripos. He now began to take pupils, and within the interval which
                    elapsed between his taking his degree and giving himself up more completely to
                    the great work of his life—the elaboration of his edition of the Greek New
                    Testament—it is believed that he had under his charge at least sixty. These
                    included barristers, clergymen, peers, and members of parhament; many of whom
                    afterwards attained positions of eminence, all of them having their characters
                    moulded more or less under the inspiring influence of his. In his twenty-sixth
                    year he was united in marriage to his cousin Fanny, a daughter of his uncle, the
                    Rev. Samuel Alford, who was then, as his father and his great-grandfather had
                    been before him, vicar of Curry Rivell. Surviving her husband after nearly
                    thirty-five years of wedded life, during which she had seen the development of
                    his intellectual powers and the realisation of some portions at least of his
                    many-sided ambition, she brought out in 1872 his journals and correspondence,
                    carefully edited by herself. A curiously characteristic side-light is thrown
                    upon Alford’s inner nature, both moral and intellectual, by the circumstance
                    there recorded—that, with a view to enable his future wife to read the New
                    Testament in Greek, he wrote with his own hand, in the interval between
                    betrothal and marriage, an elementary Greek grammar of sixty folio pages. The
                    incident is all the more interesting as affording the earliest glimpse of what
                    soon proved to be his dominant aspiration. His researches in secular scholarship
                    were at this time becoming every year more and more adventurous. He shrank not
                    from proclaiming even then that he regarded Niebuhr as “one of the greatest men
                    in this ignorant and obstinate world.” Meanwhile, in the midst of his excursive
                    inquiries as a student in the most opposite directions, he was indulging at
                    every available opportunity in the lotos-delight of his own day-dreamings; and
                    in February 1833, he published his maiden work as a lyrist, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poems and Poetical Fragments.</hi> Simply as an instructor he was working
                    steadily seven hours a-day; but the time came when, in furtherance of his
                    favourite researches, he was known to toil at the desk sometimes twelve or
                    fourteen.</p>
                <p>Resolved from childhood to tread the path of life in the footsteps of his
                    forefathers, Alford was ordained deacon on the 26th October 1833, and at once
                    began active professional work as curate of Ampton. So modest was his own
                    estimate of his intellectual capabilities, that it was with unaffected surprise
                    he found his name second on the list of the six Fellows of Trinity who were
                    elected on the 1st of the following October. On the 6th November he was admitted
                    to priest’s orders, and four months afterwards, upon the 4th March 1835—scarcely
                    a week before his marriage—entered upon his parochial labours of eighteen years’
                    duration as vicar of Wymeswold in Leicestershire. Twice during the interval of
                    his scholarly seclusion in that quiet vicarage he was vainly tempted with the
                    offer of a colonial bishopric, first in 1841 as bishop of New Zealand, and again
                    in 1844 as bishop of New Brunswick. He contentedly drudged on for years together
                    in comparative obscurity among his pupils and parishioners. Although a ripe
                    scholar, and remarkable for his splendid versatility, it was less by the
                    brilliancy of his achievements than by the sheer force of the most diligent
                    perseverance that he pushed his way eventually into the front rank, and
                    commanded at last the recognition of his contemporaries.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n542/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0542-0505"/>
                <p>whatever he put his hand to he carried out with a zeal that at times looked
                    almost like dogged determination. Thrown from his horse in the February of 1847
                    when going to deliver his first lecture, although very seriously shaken and
                    disfigured, he nevertheless punctually appeared before his audience with his
                    face and head covered with surgical bandages, and—resolutely lectured. His
                    reputation as a lecturer of exceptional power was within a few years from that
                    time thoroughly established. Several of his discourses, notably one on Saul of
                    Tarsus, with others on themes as varied as astronomy, music, scenery, and
                    Christianity, acquired in the end a certain amount of celebrity. For two years
                    together, in 1841 and 1842, he held the chair at Cambridge of Hulsean lecturer.
                    As the result of his labours in that capacity, two substantial volumes
                    afterwards made their appearance. Meanwhile, in the midst of his more serious
                    avocations, he was at uncertain intervals making good his claim to be regarded
                    as one of the more subtle and tender of the minor religious poets of England.
                    Adopting an old forgotten title of Quarles’s, he brought out, on his arrival at
                    Wymeswold (1835), in two volumes, his <hi rend="italic">School of the
                    Heart,</hi> coupled with a reissue of his minor poems and sonnets. In 1838, he
                    edited, in six vols., the works of Donne, prefixing a luminous preface, at once
                    critical and biographical. Throughout the year 1839 and part of 1840 he edited a
                    monthly magazine called <hi rend="italic">Deardens Miscellany.</hi> In 1841 he
                    published, with other new poems, his <hi rend="italic">Abbot of Muchelnaye.</hi>
                    A collection of <hi rend="italic">Psalms and Hymns</hi> appeared from his hand
                    in the spring of 1844. A couple of years before that, in 1842, he had first
                    entered upon his duties at Somerset House, where he acted for many years as
                    examiner in logic and moral and intellectual philosophy in the university of
                    London. So youthful was his appearance at the date of his first receiving this
                    appointment, that on his entering the apartment where he was awaited by the
                    candidates, he was mistaken for one of themselves.</p>
                <p>What eventually proved to be the noblest of all his literary undertakings, his
                    new edition, with running commentary, of the <hi rend="italic">Greek
                    Testament,</hi> engrossed his attention for fully twenty years together, from
                    1841 to 1861. Originally designed for the use of students in the universities,
                    the work, from its modest first projection, grew in his hands to enormous
                    proportions. He fancied at starting that a single year might witness its
                    completion, and that a couple of thin octavos might embrace both text and
                    commentary. By the time the expanding scheme was actually realised twenty years
                    had elapsed, and the work had swollen into four ponderous tomes, the contents of
                    which were as weighty as they were comprehensive. The idea of the work was
                    suggested to Alford’s mind as he listened one day to a sermon at Cambridge. What
                    he proposed to himself at the outset was simply to adopt the main text, and to
                    combine with it the greater part of the readings of Philipp Buttmann and Karl
                    Lachmann. This, however, led to a more extended plan of critical labour and
                    research, including a comprehensive digest of the various readings founded on
                    the latest collations of the principal manuscripts, the Codex Vaticanus, the
                    Codex Sinaiticus, the Codex Alexandrinus, and others. With a view to illustrate
                    more clearly than ever the verbal and idiomatic or constructional usages of the
                    sacred text, an entirely new collection of marginal references was compiled.
                    Added to this there was a copious abundance of English notes, both exegetical
                    and philological. Conscious of the vast stores of learning that had been
                    accumulating in Germany, Alford from an early date determined to render himself
                    as thoroughly as possible a master of the German language and at home in German
                    literature. This intention was fairly carried out at Bonn before the close of
                    the summer of 1847. Then, but hardly till then, he felt himself at last duly
                    qualified to edit the <hi rend="italic">Greek Testament.</hi> From that time he
                    prepared in earnest to open up systematically to the contemplation of English
                    readers the wealth of German criticism, actually made plain for the first time
                    in our language through his <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> and subsequent
                    incidental commentary. In November 1849 (the month the author took his B.D.
                    degree at Cambridge), vol. i. of the <hi rend="italic">Greek Testament</hi> was
                    published, containing the four Gospels. Through it theological students in this
                    country had placed within their reach in an epitomised form the latest results
                    of the labours of continental critics on the Greek text, including portions even
                    of those of Constantine Tischendorf. Issued from the press volume by volume, the
                    work, as already remarked, was not completed till long afterwards. In January
                    1861 the fourth or final volume, beginning with the Epistle to the Hebrews and
                    ending with the Book of Revelation, made its appearance. What is chiefly
                    noticeable in regard to the work is its strictly critical character. It is the
                    production of a philologist rather than of a theologian. Abbreviations,
                    punctuations, elisions of orthography, systematic ellipses, the merest turns of
                    the pen in this or that manuscript, are weighed against microscopic scruples in
                    the balance of his judgment. There can be little question that the work
                    appreciably increased the aggregate amount of the biblical knowledge of Alford’s
                    immediate contemporaries. So carefully matured were his researches in the
                    regions of exegesis, already crossed and recrossed by the footprints of
                    countless commentators, that the work is regarded as in many respects
                    authoritative even among those who differ from him widely on many important
                    questions.</p>
                <p>Early in 1853 Alford first preached in Quebec chapel, London, the building in
                    which his father had been ordained deacon forty years before. Before the year
                    was out, on the 26th September, he had removed from his picturesque church in
                    the wolds of Leicestershire to the plain conventicle in Tyburnia. There he
                    remained for nearly four years, toiling assiduously, preaching twice every
                    Sunday to a large and cultured congregation. Seven volumes, issued from the
                    press at intervals, have, under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Quebec Chapel
                    Sermons,</hi> preserved 153 of the more remarkable of these discourses—those
                    preached by him in the morning—all of which were carefully prepared beforehand.
                    As a preacher his style was severe and earnest rather than eloquent or
                    impassioned. Perhaps the finest discourse he ever delivered was the one on the
                    text, “A great multitude which no man could number.” It was preached from the
                    cathedral pulpit shortly after his advancement by Lord Palmerston, in March
                    1857, to the deanery of Canterbury. Throughout his life, but especially towards
                    its close, his chief delight intellectually appears to have been the rapid
                    alternation of his pursuits. While he was yet in the midst of his biblical
                    researches he was, simultaneously, at the beginning of 1851, translating the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> arranging his poems, with additions for their
                    American republication, and preparing an article for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">St Paul</hi> of Conybeare and
                    Howson. A series of ingenious lectures, delivered by him in his capacity of
                    philologist, on being compacted into a manual of idiom and usage, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Queen’s English,</hi> attained a high degree of popularity.
                    Nevertheless, in spite of their wholly unpretentious and essentially humorous
                    character, these mere casual notes on spelling and speaking drew down upon their
                    author one of the sharpest criticisms he ever provoked, sarcastically entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">The Dean’s English.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Contemporary
                    Review</hi> was inaugurated under his editorship; and from January 1866 to
                    August 1870 was conducted by him as a sort of neutral ground for religious
                    criticism. Under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Year of Prayer,</hi> Alford
                    in 1866 published a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n543/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0543-0506"/> book of family devotion; and in 1867, a
                    collection of original hymns called <hi rend="italic">The Year of Praise,</hi>
                    works of little pretension, but by which his name was widely popularised. His
                    latest poetic effusion of any considerable length was <hi rend="italic">The
                    Children of the Lord's Prayer,</hi> which appeared in 1869 as the letterpress
                    accompaniment to designs by F. R. Pickersgill, R.A. The miscellaneous papers he
                    had contributed to periodicals were, the same year, collected under the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Essays and Addresses.</hi> He brought out, in 1865, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters from Abroad,</hi> eminently characteristic records of
                    travel, mainly descriptive of Italian cities and scenery; and in 1870, a
                    collection of spirited pen and pencil sketches of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Riviera,</hi> the latter being reproduced from his water-colour drawings by the
                    aid of chromo-litho-graphy. The artist faculty, it has been observed, and not
                    extravagantly, “would have made him a great landscape painter had he not, either
                    from preference or necessity, become a great Greek scholar and a dean.” Such
                    were the pliancy and the resilience of his nature that he would turn with zest,
                    after hours of severe study given to the collation of a Hebrew manuscript or to
                    the examination of the exegetical subtleties of a German commentator on the
                    Greek Testament, to doctoring the hall clock and making it strike the
                    half-hours, to tuning the piano in the drawing-room, or to playing games with
                    his children in the nursery. The wooden front of the organ (which instrument he
                    could play with the hand of a master) was carved according to his own ingenious
                    design and by his own dexterous chiselling. A <hi rend="italic">Masque of the
                    Seasons,</hi> performed as a holiday pastime on New Year’s Day 1861, in the
                    deanery, owed to him both the words and the music—he himself, besides, enacting
                    in it the part of “Father Christmas.” A couple of years before his death he
                    appeared as a novelist, conjointly with his niece producing the story of <hi
                    rend="italic">Netherton on Sea.</hi> The last work of any magnitude upon which
                    he adventured as a biblical scholar was his <hi rend="italic">Commentary on the
                    Old Testament.</hi> In the diversity of his avocations, and the thoroughness
                    with which they were, one and all, carried to a successful issue, he was his own
                    severest taskmaster. Throughout life, until he was stretched upon his deathbed,
                    he never seemed to indulge in the luxury of inaction. The end came at length to
                    him calmly, on the 12th January 1871, and five days afterwards his remains were
                    interred under a yew tree in St Martin’s churchyard, within view of the towers
                    of Canterbury Cathedral. It is significant of the tender poetical quaintness of
                    his whole character, that there is inscribed above his tomb, in obedience to his
                    own directions, “Diversorium Viatoris Hierosolymam Proficiscentis.” A statue of
                    the dean, by Pfyffers, was unveiled, before the year of his demise had run out,
                    in a niche on the west front of the most ancient of our cathedrals. Dean Alford
                    was a man as variously accomplished as any of his generation; and he would
                    unquestionably have risen to far greater eminence than he ever achieved in
                    poetry, in oratory, in music, in painting, in theology, or in general
                    literature, if he had aimed at excelling in one or two alone of those arts or
                    sciences, instead of endeavouring to shine in all of them alike. (c. K.)</p>
