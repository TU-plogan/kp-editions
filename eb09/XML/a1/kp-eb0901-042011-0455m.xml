                    Menander, preserved by Josephus, lead to the conclusion that Ethbaal, father of
                    Jezebel, was identical with Ithobal, priest of Astarte, who usurped the throne
                    of Tyre after murdering Pheles the king. It is not improbable that Ahab’s
                    marriage with such a princess was the means of procuring him great riches, which
                    brought pomp and luxury in their train, along with the material and social
                    influence that give a certain security to monarchy. We read of his building an
                    ivory palace and founding new cities, the effect perhaps of a share in the
                    flourishing commerce of Phoenicia. But his matrimonial connection with Tyre and
                    Sidon, however fruitful in wealth, was in many respects detrimental. His wife
                    was a strong-minded, passionate devotee of idolatry, who exercised an injurious
                    influence over him. Led by her, he gave a great impulse to the worship of Baal
                    and Astarte in his kingdom. For the former he built a temple with an altar <hi
                    rend="italic">; of</hi> the latter he made the well-known image which existed
                    long after. Under the patronage of Jezebel, the Phoenician cultus assumed
                    important dimensions, for Baal is said to have had 450, Astarte 400 priests and
                    prophets. The infatuated queen was especially hostile to the prophets and
                    priests of Jehovah, whom she tried to exterminate; but the former in particular,
                    though sore pressed, were not entirely cut off. They still held their ground;
                    and Elijah, the most conspicuous of them, came off victor in the contest with
                    Baal’s ministers. Jehovism triumphed in the person of the intrepid Tishbite,
                    whom the queen was unable to get into her power. Ahab was a public-spirited and
                    courageous monarch. He defeated the Syrians twice, and concluded a peace with
                    Benhadad on favourable terms. Mesha, king of Moab, paid him a large yearly
                    tribute. In conjunction with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, he went forth to battle
                    a third time against the Syrians, and was slain at Ramoth-Gilead. It speaks
                    favourably for his disposition that he repented of the cruel measures taken
                    against Naboth, and that he humbled himself before the Lord. Though he feared
                    Elijah and Micaiah, he was not insensible to their utterances <hi rend="italic"
                    >; nor</hi> could he have suffered so many as 400 prophets to live in his
                    kingdom without some little regard for their office. The prophetic voice, held
                    as it was in small esteem, must have had some influence upon his administration,
                    especially when political grounds coincided with it. His evil courses were due
                    much more to the influence of Jezebel than to his own vicious impulses.</p>
                <p>As the accounts of Ahab are fragmentary, it is not always easy to make out from
                    them a clear or connected history of his reign. There is room for conjecture and
                    misconception. Thus Ewald represents him as building a splendid temple, with an
                    oraclegrove of Astarte near his favourite palace at Jezreel, on the basis of 1
                    Kings xvi. 32, xviii. 19; but this is imaginary, since the original does not
                    speak of <hi rend="italic">a grove</hi> but of <hi rend="italic">Astarte</hi>
                    (xviii. 19); nor is it probable that a second structure of the kind mentioned
                    existed elsewhere in addition to Baal’s temple in Samaria. Neither can it be
                    held as likely that a large statue of Baal was set up in front of his temple,
                    and small statues of him in the interior, merely because we read in 2 Kings x.
                    26, 27, first of bringing forth the <hi rend="italic">images</hi> of Baal, and
                    then of breaking <hi rend="italic">the image</hi> of the same sun-god. Rather
                    were the smaller images in the porch and the chief one in the interior, so that
                    the reading or punctuation of verse 26 should be slightly altered. Whether the
                    450 or 400 prophets were distinct from the priests is doubtful. Identifying
                    them, we believe that the priests acted as prophets, procuring for themselves
                    greater renown among the ignorant people by their arts of necromancy and
                    magic.</p>
                <p>For the biography of this monarch we are indebted almost exclusively to the books
                    of Kings, where the writers consider him in a theocratic rather than a political
                    aspect. Viewing him from their later prophetic standpoint, their portrait is
                    somewhat one-sided, though correct in the main. It is observable that the
                    portions of the Kings in which he is spoken of are somewhat different in
                    character and expression, betraying the use of different sources by the
                    compiler. 1 Kings xvi. 29-33, xxii. 39, 2 Kings x. 25-28, are more historical
                    than the rest, which contain almost all that is related of Ahab, and were
                    derived from tradition. It has been conjectured by Hitzig that the 45th psalm
                    owes its origin to Ahab, being the joyous poetical expression of a matrimonial
                    connection with 'Tyre, which augured unusual prosperity for the distracted
                    kingdom. But the assumption is improbable, because, as De Wette observes, an
                    event belonging to Ephraim was hardly a fitting subject for a poem included in
                    the canon.</p>
                <p>Another Ahab, a false prophet in the time of the Babylonian exile, is mentioned
                    by Jeremiah (xxix. 21), and threatened with terrible punishment. (s. <hi
