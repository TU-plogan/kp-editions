                <p><label type="entry">AIR, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Asben</hi></label>, a country of
                    central Africa, lying between 15° and 19° N. lat. and 6° and 10° E. long. The
                    northern and best known portion of this region is of a very diversified
                    character. It has numerous mountain ranges, some of which rise to a height of
                    5000 feet, with richly-wooded hollows and extensive plains interspersed. The
                    mimosa, the dum-palm, and the date are abundant; and the valleys are covered
                    with the exuberant vegetation of the tropics. Some of the plains afford good
                    pasturage for camels, asses, goats, and cattle; others are desert tablelands. In
                    the less frequented districts wild animals abound, notably the lion and the
                    gazelle. The country generally is of sandstone or granite formation, with
                    occasional trachyte and basaltic ranges. There are no permanent rivers; but
                    during the rainy season, from August to October, very heavy floods convert the
                    water-courses in the hollows of the mountains into broad and rapid streams.
                    Numerous wells supply the wants of the people and their cattle. To the south of
                    this variegated region lies a desert plateau, 2000 feet above the level of the
                    sea, destitute of water, and tenanted only by the wild ox, the ostrich, and the
                    giraffe. Still further south is the district of Damerghu, nominally tributary to
                    Air, undulating and fertile, and yielding rich crops. Notwithstanding the
                    fertility of the valleys in the northern portion of the country, there is little
                    of the soil under cultivation except in the neighbourhood of the villages, where
                    slaves are employed in tillage. Millet, dates, indigo, and senna are the
                    principal productions. The great bulk of the food supplies is brought from
                    Damerghu, and the whole materials for clothing are also imported. Were it not
                    for the traffic in salt between Bilma and the Hansa states of Soudan, the
                    country could scarcely maintain its present limited number of inhabitants. A
                    great caravan annually passes through Air, consisting of several thousand
                    camels, carrying salt from Bilma to Sokoto. Air was called Asben by the native
                    tribes until they were conquered by the Berbers. The present inhabitants are for

                    personal traits of the Berbers with the characteristics of the negro. The king
                    or sultan of Air occupies a very precarious position, being to a great extent
                    dependent on the chiefs of the Tawarek tribes inhabiting a vast tract of the
                    Sahara to the north-west, who are continually at war among themselves. A large
                    part of the revenue of the king is derived from tribute exacted from the salt
                    caravan. His authority does not seem to be great in the outlying parts of his
                    dominions. The chief town of Air is <hi rend="smallcaps">Agades</hi> (<hi
