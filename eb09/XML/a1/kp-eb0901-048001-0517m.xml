                <p><label type="entry">ALEXANDER III</label>., commonly called “The Great,” son of
                    Philip II., king of Macedonia, and of Olympias, daughter of the Molossian chief
                    Neoptolemus, was born at Pella, 356 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> His father
                    was a man of fearless courage and the soundest judgment; his mother was a woman
                    of savage energy and fierce superstition. Alexander inherited the qualities of
                    both his parents, and the result was the combination of a boundless ambition
                    with the most sober practical wisdom. The child grew up with the consciousness
                    that he was the heir of a king whose power was rapidly growing; and the stories
                    told of him attest at the least the early awakening of a mind formed in the
                    mould of the heroes of mythical Hellas. Nay, the blood of Achilles was flowing,
                    as he believed, in his veins; and the flattery of his Acarnanian tutor
                    Lysimachus, who addressed him as the son of Peleus, may have strengthened his
                    love of the immortal poems which told the story of that fiery warrior. By
                    another tutor, the Molossian Leonidas, his vehement impulses were checked by a
                    wholesome discipline. But the genius of Alexander, the greatest of military
                    conquerors, was moulded in a far greater degree by that of Aristotle, the
                    greatest conqueror in the world of thought. At the age of thirteen he became for
                    three years the pupil of a man who had examined the political constitutions of a
                    crowd of states, and who had brought together a vast mass of facts and
                    observations for the systematic cultivation of physical science. During these
                    three years the boy awoke to the knowledge that a wonderful world lay before
                    him, of which he had seen little, and threw himself eagerly, it is said, into
                    the task of gathering at any cost a collection for the study of natural history.
                    While his mind was thus urged in one direction, he listened to stories which
                    told him of the great quarrel still to be fought out between the East and the
                    West, and learnt to look upon himself as the champion of Hellas against the
                    barbarian despot of Susa.</p>
                <p>The future conqueror was sixteen years of age when he was left at home as regent
                    while his father besieged Byzantium and Perinthus. Two years later the alliance
                    of Thebes and Athens was wrecked on the fatal field of Chaeronea, where
                    Alexander, now eighteen years of age, encountered and overcame the Sacred Band
                    which had been foremost in the victories of Leuctra and Mantinea (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Epaminondas)</hi>; but the prospects of Alexander himself
                    became now for a time dark and uncertain. Philip had divorced Olympias and
                    married Cleopatra, the daughter of Attalus. This act roused the wrath not only
                    of Olympias, but of her son, who with her took refuge in Epirus. Cleopatra
                    became the mother of a son. Her father, Attalus, rose higher in the king’s
                    favour, and not a few of Alexander’s friends were banished. But the feuds in his
                    family were subjects of serious thought for Philip, who sought to <pb break="no"

                    between his daughter and her uncle, the Epirot king Alexander, the brother of
                    Olympias. The marriage feast was celebrated at Aegae. Clothed in a white robe,
                    and walking purposely apart from his guards, Philip was approaching the theatre
                    when he was struck down by the dagger of Pausanias.</p>
                <p>It is certain that Alexander, if he mourned his father’s death at all, deplored
                    it only as involving himself in political difficulties; but he took care to act
                    as if he were grieved by it, and he revenged it, we are told, by putting out of
                    the way some whose claims or designs might clash with his own. The Greeks of
                    Thebes and Athens knew little what sort of man had taken the place of Philip.
                    Demosthenes, who, although he was mourning for the death of his own daughter,
                    appeared in festal attire to announce the death of the Macedonian king, held up
                    Alexander to ridicule as a bragging and senseless Margites. But they had to
                    reckon with one who could swoop on his prey with the swiftness of the eagle.
                    Barely two months had passed from the death of his father before the youth of
                    twenty years stood with his army on the plains of Thessaly. The argument of the
                    Macedonian phalanx was not to be resisted. The Thessalians recognised him as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Hegemon</hi> or leader of the Greeks; and the young king
                    passed on to Thebes, the citadel of which had been held by a Macedonian garrison
                    since the fight at Chaeronea. Thence he took himself across the isthmus to
                    Corinth. Here he was met by Athenian envoys, who brought him apologies more
                    abject and honours more extravagant than any which had been paid to his father.
                    He received them in an assembly, from which he demanded and obtained the title
                    of supreme leader of the Hellenic armies, and to which he guaranteed, at the
                    utmost with a feigned reluctance, the autonomy or independence of every Hellenic
                    city. No one knew better than Alexander that from the whole armoury of weapons
                    which might be employed to reduce Greeks to slavery, none could more effectually
                    do his work than a theory of freedom which meant dissension, and of
                    self-government which meant endless feud, faction, and war.</p>
                <p>Alexander was now eager to carry out his great design against Persia; but he
                    could not do so with safety until he had struck a wholesome terror of his power
                    into the mountain tribes which hemmed in his dominions, His blows descended
                    swiftly and surely on the Thracians of Mount Haemus <hi rend="italic">(the
                    Balkan),</hi> on the Triballians, and on some clans of Getae, whom he crossed
                    the Danube to attack. But these expeditions led him away from the world of the
                    Greeks. Silence led to rumours of his defeat, and the rumours of defeat were
                    followed by more confident assertions of his death. At Thebes and at Athens the
                    tidings were received by some with eager belief. The covenant made with
                    Alexander was made only with him personally. The Theban exiles at Athens were
                    anxious to repeat the attempt which half a century earlier had been made against
                    the Spartan garrison of the Cadmea by Pelopidas. With help in arms and money
                    from Demosthenes and other Athenians, they entered Thebes, and summoned the
                    Macedonian garrison to surrender. The answer was a blunt refusal, and a double
                    line of circum-vallation was drawn around the citadel, while envoys were sent to
                    call forth aid from every quarter; but these efforts could not affect the issue.
                    The belief in Alexander’s death was to be dispelled, by no gradual reports of
                    his escape from the barbarians, but by his own sudden appearance at the Boeotian
                    Onchestus. He had just defeated the Illyrians when he heard of the revolt, and
                    he determined to smite the rebels without turning aside to take even a day’s
                    rest at Pella. In little more than a fortnight his army was encamped on the
                    southern side of Thebes, thus cutting off all chances of aid from Athens. It was
                    his wish to avoid an assault, and he contented himself with demanding the
                    surrender of two only of the anti-Macedonian leaders. The citizens generally
                    were anxious to submit, but the exiles felt or feared themselves to be too
                    deeply committed; and the answer took the form of a defiance, accompanied by a
                    demand for the surrender of Antipater and Philotas. They had sealed their own
                    doom. Personal bravery was of no use against the discipline, the numbers, and
                    the engines of the enemy. The defenders were driven back into the city; the
                    invaders burst in with them; and the slaughter which followed was by no means
                    inflicted by the Macedonians alone. The Plataeans, Thespians, and Orchomenians
                    felt that they had old scores to settle. To these and to the rest of his Greek
                    allies Alexander submitted the fate of the city. The sentence was promptly
                    pronounced. The measure which the Thebans had dealt to Plataeae, and would have
                    dealt to Athens, should now be dealt out to themselves. The whole town was razed
                    to the ground, the house of the poet Pindar being alone spared from demolition,
                    and his descendants alone allowed to retain their freedom. Alexander had gained
                    his end. The spirit of the Greeks was crushed; a great city was blotted out, and
                    the worship of its gods was ended with its ruin. These gods, it was believed,
                    would in due time take vengeance on the conqueror; but for the present the only
                    hindrance to his enterprise was removed from his path. Without turning aside to
                    Athens, he went on to Corinth to receive the adulations of the independent
                    Greeks, and to find, it is said, a less courtly speaker in the cynic Diogenes.
                    From Corinth he returned to Macedonia, having left Greece for the last time.</p>
                <p>Six months later he set off from Pella, crossed the Hellespont at Sestus, to
                    appease at Ilium by a costly sacrifice the wrath of the luckless Priam; and then
                    marched on, with not more perhaps than 30,000 infantry and 4000 cavalry, and
                    with a treasure-chest almost empty, to destroy the monarchy of Cyrus. With him
                    went men who were to be linked with the memory of his worst crimes and of his
                    most astonishing triumphs—Clitus, Hephaestion, Eumenes, Seleucus, Ptolemy the
                    son of Lagos, and Parmenion, with his sons Philotas and Nicanor. The effects of
                    Macedonian discipline were to be seen at once on the banks of the Granicus, a
                    little stream flowing to the Propontis from the slopes of Ida. Losing, it is
                    said, only 60 of his cavalry and 30 of his infantry, he annihilated the Persian
                    force, 2000 out of 20,000 foot soldiers being taken prisoners, and nearly all
                    the rest slain. The terror of his name did his work as he marched southwards.
                    The citadel of Sardis might with ease have been held against him: before he came
                    within eight miles of the city, the governor hastened to surrender it with all
                    its treasure. At Ephesus he found the city abandoned by its garrison. Miletus he
                    carried by storm. Before Halicarnassus he encountered a more obstinate
                    resistance from the Athenian Ephialtes; but the generalship of the latter was of
                    no avail. Alexander entered Halicarnassus, and the Rhodian Memnon remained shut
                    up in the citadel. Leaving Ptolemy with 1000 men to blockade it, he spent the
                    winter in conquering Lycia, Pamphylia, and Pisidia, ending his campaign at
                    Gordium, on the river Sangarius. Here was preserved the ancient waggon of
                    Gordius, the mythical Phrygian king. Whoever could untie the knot, curiously
                    twisted with fibres of the cornel tree, which fastened its pole to the yoke,
                    was, so the story ran, to be lord of Asia. Alexander, as much at a loss as
                    others to unloose it, cut it with his sword; but the prophecy was none the less
                    held to be fulfilled. If he was thus favoured by sentiment, he was still more
                    favoured by the infatuation which led Darius to abandon the policy of defence by
                    sea <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n519/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0519-0482"/> for offensive warfare by land. From all parts of
                    his vast empire was gathered a host, numbering, as some said, 600,000 men; and
                    the despot was as much elated at the sight as Xerxes, when he looked down on his
                    motley multitudes at Doriscus. Like Xerxes he had one (the Athenian Charidemus)
                    by his side to warn him that Asiatic myriads were not to be trusted in an
                    encounter with the disciplined thousands of Alexander; but he lacked the
                    generosity which made Xerxes dismiss Demaratus with a smile for his good-will
                    Darius seized the exile with his own hand, and gave him over to the executioner.
                    “My avenger,” said Charidemus, “will soon teach you that I have spoken the
                    truth.” The Persian acted as though he wished to bring about the speediest
                    fulfilment of the prediction. The Greek mercenaries were withdrawn from the
                    fleet to be added to the land forces; but although a hundred of these could have
                    effectually barred the passage of Alexander across the range of Taurus, and the
                    passes of the Amanian, Cilician, and Assyrian gates, the invader was suffered to
                    cross these defiles without the loss of a man. Nay, so great was the contempt of
                    Darius for the few thousands of the enemy, that he wished to give them a free
                    path until they reached the plain from which he would sweep them away. But he
                    could not wait patiently for them in his position to the east of the Amanian
                    range. Alexander had been ill, and he had work to do in subjugating western
                    Cilicia. When at length he set out on his march to the southern Amanian pass,
                    Darius, with his unwieldy train, crossed the northern pass, and entered Issus
                    two days after Alexander had left it. He had placed himself in a trap. In a
                    space barely more than a mile and a half in width, hemmed in by the mountains on
                    the one side and the sea on the other, Darius, in his royal chariot, in the
                    midst of multitudes who had scarcely room to move, awaited the attack of
                    Alexander, who fell suddenly on his right wing. The first onset was enough. The
                    Persians broke and fled. Darius, thinking himself in danger, fled among the
                    foremost. The Persian centre behaved well; but it mattered little now what they
                    might do. Even the Greek mercenaries were pushed back and scattered. Four
                    thousand talents filled the treasure-chest of the conqueror, and the wife,
                    mother, and son of Darius, appearing before him as prisoners, were told that
                    they should retain their royal titles, his enterprise being directed, not
                    against Darius personally, but to the issue which was to determine whether he or
                    Alexander should be lord of Asia.</p>
                <p>The true value of armed Asiatic hordes was now as clear to all as the sun at
                    noonday. Parmenion advanced to attack Damascus, but he needed not to strike a
                    blow. The governor allowed the treasure in his charge to fall into his hands,
                    and then surrendered the city. Alexander himself marched southward to Phoenicia.
                    At Marathus he replied to a letter in which Darius demanded the restoration of
                    his family and reproached him for his wanton aggression. His answer repeated
                    what he had already said to his wife, adding that, if he wrote again, Darius
                    must address him, not as his equal, but as his lord. “I am now master of Asia,”
                    he wrote, “and if you will not own me as such, I shall treat you as an
                    evil-doer. If you wish to debate the point, do so like a man on the battlefield.
                    I shall take care to find you wherever you may be.” The island city of Aradus
                    was surrendered on his approach. Sidon opened her gates. From the Tyrians he
                    received a submission which demurred only to his entering their city. A siege of
                    seven months ended in its fall; and Alexander hanged 2000 of the citizens, it is
                    said, on the sea-shore. The survivors, with the women and children, were sold as
                    slaves. Before the catastrophe of the great Phoenician city he had received a
                    second letter, in which Darius offered him his daughter in marriage, together
                    with the cession of all lands to the west of the Euphrates. “Were I Alexander,”
                    said Parmenion (if we may believe the story), “I should take these terms, and
                    run no further risk.” “So should I,” answered Alexander, “if I were Parmenion;
                    but as I am Alexander, I cannot.” “You offer me,” he wrote accordingly to
                    Darius, “part of your possession, when I am lord of all. If I choose to marry
                    your daughter, I will do so whether you like it or not.” Darius sent no more
                    letters. The issue, he saw, must be determined by the sword. For the present he
                    was left to himself. Alexander’s face was turned towards Egypt. Gaza dared to
                    resist; but a siege of two months was followed by a ruin as complete as that of
                    Tyre. From Gaza a march of seven days brought him to Pelusium. The Persian
                    governor opened its gates to receive him; and the Egyptians expressed their
                    delight at exchanging a Persian for a Macedonian master. Marching in triumph to
                    Memphis, he offered solemn sacrifice to the calf-god Apis; and then, with the
                    true instinct of the ruler and the statesman, he hastened to found for his new
                    kingdom a new capital, which, after more than two millenniums, remains a highway
                    for the commerce of three continents.</p>
                <p>Success thus unparalleled was, it would seem, already producing its effects upon
                    him. Calmly reviewing the course of his march from Sestus and Ilium to Memphis,
                    he could explain it only on the supposition that he was no child of a human
                    father, and he determined to obtain from the oracle of Ammon, in the Libyan
                    Oasis, a solution of this mystery. The response greeted him as the son, not of
                    Philip, but of Zeus; and he returned, it is said, with the conviction that the
                    divine honours paid to Hercules and Perseus were his own by indubitable right.
                    Marching back through Phoenicia, he hastened to Thapsacus, and then crossed the
                    Euphrates. Thence turning northwards, he made a sweep which brought him to the
                    Tigris below Nineveh <hi rend="italic">(Mosul),</hi> and there, without
                    opposition, crossed a stream where the resistance of a few hundreds might have
                    destroyed his army. After a few days’ march to the south-east, he received the
                    news that Darius, with all his host, was close at hand. Still convinced that
                    mere numbers must, with ample space, decide the issue of any fight, and
                    attributing his defeat at Issos only to the cramped position of his troops, he
                    had gathered a vast horde, which some represent as more than a million, on the
                    broad plain stretching from Gaugamela eastwards to Arbela. His hopes were
                    further raised by changes made in the weapons of his troops, and more
                    -especially in the array of his warchariots. For the Macedonians it is enough to
                    say that they were led by a man whose consummate generalship had never shone
                    more conspicuously than in the cautious arrangements which preceded the battle
                    of Arbela, or rather of Gaugamela. All went as he had anticipated. As at Issus,
                    Darius fled; and the bravery and even gallantry of the Persians opposed to
                    Parmenion were of no avail when the main body had hurried away after the king.
                    So ended the last of the three great battles (if such they may be termed) which
                    sufficed to destroy the Persian empire, or rather to make Alexander king of
                    Persia; and so ended the first act in the great drama of his life.</p>
                <p>The victory of Gaugamela opened for the conqueror the gates of Babylon and Susa.
                    The treasures found in the former furnished an ample donation for all his men:
                    those of Susa amounted, it is said, to nearly twelve millions of pounds
                    sterling. The Persian king had wasted men on the battlefield; he had hoarded
                    coin which, freely spent in getting up a Greek army under Greek generals, might
                    have rendered the enterprise of Alexander impossible. From Susa the conqueror
                    turned his face towards Persepolis, the ancient capital of Cyrus. Before him lay
                    the fortresses of the Uxii, to whom the Persian monarchs had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n520/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0520-0483"/> been accustomed to pay tribute when they went
                    from the one capital of their kingdom to the other. The same demand was now made
                    of Alexander, who told them to come to the pass and take it, and then, following
                    a new track which had been pointed out to him, descended on their villages, and
                    taught them that they had now to deal with a sovereign of another kind. With
                    Persepolis, Pasar-gadae, the city containing the tomb of Cyrus, opened its gates
                    to receive the avenger of the iniquities of Xerxes. As such, he determined to
                    inflict on Darius a signal punishment. Five thousand camels and a crowd of mules
                    bore away the treasure, amounting, it is said, to nearly thirty millions of
                    pounds sterling, and then the citadel was set on fire. The men in the city were
                    killed, the women made slaves.</p>
                <p>For a month Alexander allowed his main army to rest near Persepolis; for himself
                    there could be no repose. With his cavalry he overran, and, in spite of the
                    rigours of winter, subdued, the whole region of Farsistan. Then returning to
                    Persepolis, he set forth on his march to Media, where the fugitive king had
                    hoped to be safe from his pursuit. Darius had left Agbatana (Ecbatana) eight
                    days before his pursuer could reach it. In this ancient fastness of the Median
                    and Persian sovereigns Alexander deposited his treasures, exceeding, we are
                    told, forty millions sterling in amount, under the charge of a strong Macedonian
                    garrison headed by Parmenion. He then hastened on towards the Caspian gates, and
                    learnt, when he had passed them, that Darius had been dethroned, and was now the
                    prisoner of the Bactrian satrap Bessus. The tidings made Alexander still more
                    eager to seize him. His efforts were so far successful that Bessus felt escape
                    to be hopeless unless Darius could be made to leave his chariot and fly on
                    horseback. He refused to obey, and was left behind, mortally wounded. Before
                    Alexander could reach him, he was dead.</p>
                <p>The conqueror now regarded, or professed to regard, himself as the legitimate
                    heir and successor of Xerxes. His course of conquest was still unbroken; but
                    successful forays against the Mardians on the northern slopes of Mount Elburz,
                    against the Arians of the modern Herat, and the Drangians of the present
                    Seistan, were followed by an exploit of another sort. He had heard that a
                    conspiracy against himself had been revealed to Philotas, who for two days had
                    kept the secret to himself. On being asked why he had done this, Philotas
                    answered that the information came from a worthless source and deserved no
                    notice. Alexander professed himself satisfied with the explanation; but
                    Philotas, it seems, had spoken freely to his mistress Antigone of the large
                    share which he and his father had had in the conquests of Alexander, and
                    Antigone had in her turn become an informer. Of real evidence against Philotas
                    there was none; and a letter from Parmenion to his sons, found when Philotas was
                    treacherously arrested, could tell against them only in the eyes of one who was
                    resolved that Philotas should die. But Alexander could not rest content with his
                    death alone. There had been nothing yet, even in the way of shadowy slander, to
                    criminate Parmenion, and he resolved that the needful charges should be drawn by
                    tortures from his son. Hidden by a curtain, the conqueror of the world watched
                    the agonies and scoffed at the screams of the friend who had fought by his side
                    in a hundred fights. The issue was, or was said to be, what he desired. Philotas
                    had confessed; and Alexander sent off to Ecbatana a man bearing two despatches,
                    one to cheat Parmenion into a false security, the other carrying to the officers
                    next to him in command the real order for his assassination. The old man was
                    reading the lying letter of the despot when he received a mortal stab in his
                    back. The soldiers, on hearing of what had been done furiously demanded the
                    surrender of the murderers, and were with difficulty withheld from taking
                    summary vengeance on seeing the written orders of Alexander. The command of
                    Philotas, who had been at the head of the companion-cavalry, Was shared between
                    Clitus and Hephaestion; and Alexander turned from private murder to public war.
                    The autumn and winter were spent in overrunning parts of the modern Afghanistan
                    and Cabul, in the formation of the Caucasian Alexandria, and in the passage of
                    the Hindu-Kush. He was now in the satrapy of Bessus. The surrender of Aornus and
                    Bactra was followed by the passage of the Oxus and by the betrayal of Bessus,
                    who was sent naked and in chains to the city which had been his capital. His
                    next exploit (there is but slender ground for calling it into question) was the
                    slaughter, in Sogdiana, of the descendants of the Milesian Branchidae, who,
                    having incurred the hatred of their fellow Greeks by surrendering to Xerxes the
                    treasures of their temple, had followed the despot on his retreat, and by him
                    had been placed in these distant regions. Five generations had passed away since
                    that time, when Alexander gave the order that not one of them, man, woman, or
                    child, should be left alive. From the ruined city, by way of Maracanda <hi
                    rend="italic">(Samarkand),</hi> he reached the Jaxartes (which he believed to be
                    the Tanais or <hi rend="italic">Don),</hi> and having laid on its banks the
                    foundation of another Alexandria, he crossed the river to chase some Scythians
                    who had shown themselves on the further side. The end of this chase marked the
                    northernmost point reached in his campaigns. The winter was spent in the
                    Bactrian city of Zariaspa, where Alexander, summoning Bessus before him, had his
                    nose and ears cut off, and then sent him to be killed by his countrymen at
                    Ecbatana.</p>
                <p>In the following summer his army was gathered again at Maracanda. Repose from
                    field-work left room for the display of the overbearing pride to be expected
                    from one who had convinced himself that he was a god, and for the boundless
                    flattery of those who found their interest in keeping up the delusion. But there
                    were not wanting others to whom this arrogance and servility were intensely
                    disgusting, and whose anger was the more fierce from the necessity of avoiding
                    all open expression of it; and in the banquets of the divine son of Ammon there
                    was always a risk that these pent-up feelings might burst forth like a winter
                    torrent. The catastrophe was not long in coming. In a feast at Maracanda,
                    Alexander, boasting of all that he had done since the death of his father, took
                    credit further for the victories of Philip in the later years of his reign. The
                    patience of Clitus had long been severely taxed, and in the heat of the revel
                    all thought of prudence was cast aside. He spoke his mind plainly, telling
                    Alexander that all his exploits taken together were not equal to those of the
                    man who had found Macedonia a poor and distracted country, and had left it a
                    mighty and coherent state; and that his own greatest victories had been won
                    through th® aid of Philip’s old soldiers, some of whom he had murdered. Stung to
                    the quick, Alexander gave utterance to his rage; but his retort only led Clitus
                    to remind him of the battlefield of the Granicus, where he had saved him from
                    death by cutting off the arm of the Persian whose sword was raised to smite him,
                    and to warn him that, if he could not bear to listen to the words of truth, he
                    should confine himself to the society of slaves. Alexander felt for his dagger:
                    it had purposely been placed out of his reach. He called to his guards to sound
                    an alarm: they hesitated to obey the orders of a raving drunkard. Some of the
                    more sober and moderate of the party held him in their arms, praying him to do
                    nothing hastily. By way of answer he reviled them for keeping him a prisoner as
                    Bessus had kept Darius, and shaking himself free, snatched a pike from one of
                    the guards, and thrust it through the body of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0521-0484"/> Clitus, bidding him go to Philip and Parmenion.
                    The rage of the tiger was followed by a furious remorse, in which, with
                    considerable truth, he denounced himself as unfit to live. For three days he
                    would neither eat nor drink; and the army, alarmed at the threatened starvation
                    of their king, voted that Clitus had been justly slain, and that his body should
                    not receive the rites of burial. By reversing this vote, Alexander seemed to
                    feel that he had gone a long way towards acquitting himself; whatever might be
                    yet lacking to restore his self-complacence was supplied by the prophets, who
                    assured him that the disaster had been brought about wholly by the Theban
                    wine-god Dionysus, to whom he had offered no sacrifice on the day of the
                    banquet.</p>
                <p>A few weeks after this murder Alexander captured the Sogdian rock, a fastness
                    from which common care would have sent him away baffled Having next reduced the
                    rock of Chorienes, he returned to Bactra to celebrate his marriage with Roxana,
                    the daughter of Oxyartes, who had been among the captives taken on the Sogdian
                    rock. The feast was seized by Alexander as an opportunity for extracting from
                    his Greek and Macedonian followers a public acknowledgment of his divinity. It
                    was arranged that the sophist Anaxarchus (or, as some said, the Sicilian Cleon)
                    should make a speech, advising all to worship at once the man whom they would
                    certainly have to worship after his death. The speech was delivered. The silence
                    of most of the Macedonian officers showed their disgust; but none ventured to
                    speak until the Olynthian Callisthenes, the nephew of Aristotle, insisted on the
                    impiety of all attempts to confound the distinctions between gods and men.
                    Conceding to the conqueror the highest place amongst military leaders and the
                    first rank amongst statesmen, he rebuked Anaxarchus for making a suggestion
                    which ought to have come from any one rather than from himself. The applause
                    which his words drew from the Macedonians taught Alexander that open opposition
                    would be useless; but he was none the more turned from his purpose, nor was it
                    long before he found a pretext for carrying it out. A conspiracy was discovered
                    amongst his pages. These unfortunate men were tortured (but without extracting
                    from them anything to implicate Callisthenes), and then stoned to death,—as
                    Alexander would have it, not by his orders, but by the loyal impulse of his
                    army. Callisthenes he was resolved, he said, to punish himself, together with
                    those who had sent him,—an insinuation, manifestly, against his uncle Aristotle,
                    possibly also against all other Greeks, for whom freedom of speech and action
                    had not yet altogether lost its value. The philosopher who had extolled
                    Alexander as the greatest of earthly generals and statesmen was first tortured
                    and then hanged; and the conqueror went calmly on to subdue the regions between
                    the Hindu-Kush and the right bank of the Indus, and to storm the impregnable
                    rock of Aornus.</p>
                <p>The next river to be crossed was the Indus. The bridge was constructed by
                    Hephaestion and Perdiccas, probably near the present Attock. The surrender of
                    Taxila left Alexander an open path until he reached the Hydaspes <hi
                    rend="italic">(Jhelum),</hi> where Porus was beaten only after a severe
                    struggle. The Indian prince was taken prisoner, and treated with the courtesy
                    which the family of Darius had received after the battle of Issus. Here died
                    Alexander’s horse Boukephalos (Bucephalus), and the loss was commemorated by the
                    founding of Bucephalia. The passage of the Acesines <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Chenab),</hi> running with a full and impetuous stream, was not accomplished
                    without much danger; that of the Hydraotes <hi rend="italic">(Ravee)</hi>
                    presented less formidable difficulties, but he was encountered on the other side
                    by Indians, who entrenched themselves in their town of Sangala. Their resistance
                    ended, it is said, in the slaughter of 17,000 and the capture of 70,000. About
                    40 miles further to the south-east flowed the Hyphasis <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Sutlej).</hi> Alexander approached its bank, the limit of the Panjab, in the
                    full confidence that a few days more would bring him to the mighty stream of the
                    Ganges; but he had reached the goal of his conquests. The order for crossing the
                    river called forth murmure and protests at once from his officers and his
                    soldiers, who expressed plainly their refusal to march they knew not whither.
                    Alexander in vain laid before his officers his schemes of further conquest; and
                    when he offered the sacrifice customary before crossing a river, the signs were
                    pronounced to be unfavourable. The die was cast. Twelve huge altars remained to
                    show that Alexander had advanced thus far on his conquest of the world; and, in
                    the midst of deluges of rain, the army set out on its westward journey. The
                    reinforcements which he found on reaching the Hydaspes might, if they had
                    advanced as far as the Hyphasis, have turned the scale in favour of progress to
                    the east; they enabled Alexander to undertake with greater ease a voyage down
                    the Hydaspes to its junction with the Indus after receiving the waters of the
                    Acesines, Hydraotes, and Hyphasis, and thence onwards to the Indian Ocean. From
                    the mouth of the Indus he ordered his admiral Nearchus to take the fleet along
                    the shores of the ocean and the Persian Gulf to the mouth of the Tigris. The
                    army marched by land through the Gedrosian desert, suffering more from thirst
                    and sickness than they had suffered in all their battles and forced marches. At
                    length he reached Pasargadae, to find the tomb of Cyrus broken open and
                    plundered, and to avenge the insult offered to the man whom he now regarded as
                    the founder of his own dynasty. Early in the following year he entered Susa, and
                    there, celebrating his marriage with Statira, the daughter of Darius and of
                    Parysatis the daughter of his predecessor Ochus, he offered to pay the debts of
                    those soldiers who would follow his example by taking to themselves Persian
                    wives—a strange mode of inviting sober and steady men who had no debts, but an
                    effectual argument for the spendthrifts and ruffians of his army. His new levies
                    of Persian youths, armed and disciplined after the Macedonian fashion, had now
                    made him independent of his veteran soldiers; and his declared intention of
                    sending home the aged and wounded among them called forth the angry
                    remonstrances of their comrades, who bade him complete his schemes of conquest
                    with the aid of his father Ammon. Alexander rushed into the throng, seized some
                    and had them executed, and then disbanded the whole force. For two days he shut
                    himself up in his palace; on the third he marshalled his Persian levies <hi
                    rend="italic">(Epigoni,</hi> as he called them) into divisions bearing the
                    Macedonian military titles, under Persian officers. The spirit of the veterans
                    was broken by this ignoring of their existence. They threw down their arms at
                    the palace gates, and begged forgiveness with cries and tears. Alexander
                    accepted their contrition, and the restoration of harmony was celebrated by a
                    sumptuous sacrifica</p>
                <p>But for Alexander past victories were only a stimulus to further exploits. Arabia
                    still remained unsubdued, and for this conquest a large addition was needed to
                    his fleet. Orders were sent to Phoenicia for the construction of ships, which
                    were to be taken to pieces and sent overland to Thapsacus on the Euphrates,
                    while others were to be built at Babylon. His journey to Ecbatana was marked by
                    a violent quarrel between Eumenes and Hephaestion. Their reconciliation was soon
                    followed by the death of the latter from an attack of fever. The grief of the
                    conqueror was as fierce as that of Achilles, if we may not set it down as a
                    manifest imitation of it. For two days he neither ate nor drank; he cut his hair
                    short, and ordered that the horses and mules in his army should have their manes
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n522/mode/1up"

                    with prudence on his pyre; but he was resolved that his friend should begin his
                    life in the unseen world with unstinted wealth, and the precious things destined
                    to be consumed on his funeral pile represented, it is said, a sum of nearly two
                    millions and a half pounds sterling. Messengers were sent to the Egyptian oracle
                    to ask if the dead man might be worshipped as a god, and Eumenes, with many
                    others, took care to anticipate its answer by offering him such honours as might
                    fall in with the humour of the divine mourner. His grief seemed only to render
                    his bursts of passion more fearful. None dared to address him except in language
                    of the most grovelling flattery; and, in the words of Plutarch, his only
                    consolation was found in his old habit of man-hunting. The diversion was this
                    time furnished by some mountain tribes between Media and Farsistan. His march to
                    Babylon steeped him still more in the intoxication of success. As he advanced on
                    his road he was met by ambassadors not only from Illyrians and Thracians, from
                    Sicily and Sardinia, from Libya and Carthage, but from Lucanians and Etruscans,
                    and, as some said, from Rome itself. The lord of all the earth could scarcely
                    look for wider acknowledgment or more devout submission; but his
                    self-gratulation may have been damped by the warning of the Chaldean priests
                    that it would be safer for him not to enter the gates of Babylon. For a while he
                    hesitated, but he had more to do than to heed their words. The preparations for
                    his Arabian campaign must be hurried on; all that might be needed must be done
                    to improve the navigation of the Euphrates, and a new city must be built to
                    rival, perhaps, the Alexandria which he had founded by the banks of the Nile.
                    More than all, he had to celebrate the obsequies of Hephaestion, whose body had
                    been brought to Babylon from Ecbatana. The feasting which everywhere accompanied
                    the funeral rites of the ancient world was exaggerated by the Macedonians, as by
                    other half rude or savage tribes, into prolonged revelry. Alexander spent the
                    whole night drinking in the house of his friend Medius, and the whole of the
                    next day in sleeping off his drunkenness. Throughout the following night the
                    same orgies were repeated. When he next awoke he was unable to rise. Fever had
                    laid its grasp upon him, and each day its hold became tighter, while he busied
                    himself incessantly with giving orders about his army, his fleet, his generals,
                    until at length the powers of speech began to fail. When asked to name his
                    successor, he said that he left his kingdom to the strongest. His signet-ring he
                    took from his finger and gave to Perdiccas. Throughout the army the tidings of
                    his illness spread consternation; old grudges were all forgotten; his veterans
                    forced themselves into his presence, and with tears bade farewell to their
                    general, who showed by signs that he still knew them. A few hours later
                    Alexander died, after a reign of less than thirteen years, and before he had
                    reached the age of thirty-three.</p>
                <p>That the schemes of conquest with which almost to the last moment he had been
                    absorbingly busied would, if he had lived, have been in great part realised, can
                    scarcely be doubted, unless we suppose that causes were at work which at no
                    distant period would have disturbed and upset the balance of his military
                    judgment, and deprived him of that marvellous power of combination and of
                    shaping means to circumstances in which Hannibal and Napoleon are perhaps his
                    only peers. It would be rash to say that such a darkening of his splendid powers
                    might not have been brought about, even before he could reach middle age, by
                    habits which, if we may judge from the history of his later years, were fast
                    becoming confirmed. In truth, except as a general, he had lost the balance of
                    his mind already. The ruling despot who fancied himself a god, who could thrust
                    a pike through the body of one friend and sneer at the cries drawn forth from
                    another by the agonies of torture, was already far removed from the far-sighted
                    prudence of the politic statesman and ruler. His conquests served great ends;
                    and before he set out on his career of victory he may have had a distinct vision
                    of these ends. Desire for knowledge; the wish to see new forms of human and
                    animal life; the curiosity of traversing unknown lands, of laying open their
                    resources, of bringing them all within the limits and the influence of the
                    Macedonian, or, as he preferred to put it, the Greek world; the eagerness to
                    establish over all known, possibly over all unknown, regions a mighty
                    centralised empire, which should avail itself of all their forces, and throw
                    down the barriers which rendered the interchange of their wealth impossible,—may
                    have mingled with his alleged or his real purpose of avenging on the Persian
                    king the misdoings of Xerxes, Darius, and Cyrus. But there is little evidence or
                    none that these motives retained their power undiminished as he advanced further
                    on his path of victory, while there seems to be evidence, only too abundant,
                    that all other motives were gradually and even fast losing strength as the lust
                    of conquest grew with his belief or his fancy of his superhuman power and
                    origin. During his sojourn with Aristotle he must have learnt that real
                    knowledge can be reached and good government insured only where there is freedom
                    of thought and speech, and where the people obey their own laws. A few years
                    later he had come to look on Aristotle as an enemy to be punished with scarcely
                    less severity than Callisthenes. But at the least it must be remembered that his
                    work was left unfinished; possibly he may have regarded it as little more than
                    begun. Looking at it from this point of view, we can neither shut our eyes to
                    the solid benefits accruing from his conquests both for the East and the West,
                    nor, in spite of his awful crimes, can we place him in the rank of those
                    scourges of mankind among whom Alaric and Attila, Genghiz, Timour, and Napoleon
                    stand pre-eminent. Of the several accounts of his career which have come down to
                    us, not one, unhappily, is strictly contemporary; and mere fairness calls upon
                    us to give him the benefit of a doubt, when doubt can be justly entertained, in
                    reference even to deeds which carry with them an unutterable horror and shame.
                    It is impossible to deny that with a higher sense of duty Alexander would better
                    have deserved the title of Great; but the judgment which may be passed on some
                    of his actions cannot affect his transcendent glory as the most consummate
                    general of ancient times, and perhaps even of all ages.</p>
