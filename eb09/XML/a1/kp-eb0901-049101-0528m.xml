                    Canmore, succeeded his brother Edgar in 1107, and died in 1124. He was better
                    educated than any of his predecessors, owing to the care of his mother, the
                    amiable Margaret of England. All the qualities of his nature, both good and bad,
                    were strongly marked; from the terror he inspired, he was styled by his subjects
                    <hi rend="italic">the Fierce.</hi> His reign is distinguished by the determined
                    opposition he offered to any interference on the part of English bishops in the
                    affairs of the Scottish Church. He contrived by energy and valour to subdue the
                    turbulence of his kingdom; specially noticeable are the promptness and vigour he
                    displayed in suppressing the insurrection of Angus, grandson of Lulach, a son of
                    Macbeth’s queen. He died at Stirling, and, being childless, was succeeded by his
                    brother David I.</p>
                <p><hi rend=" smallcaps"> Alexan</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">der,</hi> II., King of
                    Scotland, was born at Haddington in 1198 (died 1249), and succeeded his father,
                    William the Lion, in 1214. Though still young, he exhibited the same prudence
                    and firmness which marked his whole conduct in life. He was excommunicated in
                    1216 for associating with the English barons in their opposition to King John;
                    but his prudence enabled him to recover the good opinion of the pope, and placed
                    him on the best footing with the English king, Henry III., John’s successor. His
                    fidelity to Henry was shown by the assistance he rendered him in protecting,
                    during Henry’s absence in France, the northern borders of England, and the
                    friendliness of the kings was strengthened by the marriage of Alexander to
                    Henry’s sister Joan (1221). Joan died in 1238, and in May 1239 Alexander married
                    Mary de Coucy. In 1244 Henry marched against Scotland to force from Alexander
                    the homage due to him for the lands he held in the north of England, but in
                    August a peace was concluded at Newcastle. Like Alexander I., he was zealous in
                    defence of the privileges of the Scottish Church; and in 1222 he put to death
                    400 persons who had been implicated in the murder of the bishop of Caithness.
                    While engaged in quelling an insurrection in Argyleshire, he died of fever in
                    the island of Kerrera in 1249.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi> III., King of Scotland, son of Alexander II.
                    by his second wife, Mary de Coucy, was born at Roxburgh on the 4th September
                    1241 (died 1286), and suc-ceded to the throne on the death of his father in
                    1249. The fact that in this case the succession of a minor was unopposed is
                    noteworthy, as showing that the hereditary principle had now established itself.
                    By a provision of the treaty of Newcastle Alexander had been betrothed in
                    infancy to the daughter of the king of England, and it suited Henry’s policy to
                    insist on an early fulfilment of the contract. Notwithstanding the extreme youth
                    of the parties, the marriage was celebrated at York on the 25th December 1251.
                    On this occasion Alexander is said by Matthew Paris to have done homage for his
                    estates in England, and to have refused homage for his kingdom of Scotland, on
                    the ground that he had not consulted on the matter with his proper advisers. The
                    story, however, seems inconsistent with Henry’s policy at the time, and is
                    therefore questionable. With a king so young, in times so unsettled, the hopes
                    and efforts of contending factions were naturally stimulated. At the
                    commencement of his reign Alexander was under the power of the Cornyns, the most
                    influential family among the Scottish nobility. A rival party, under the
                    leadership of Durward the justiciar, was supported by England, and in 1254
                    succeeded in seizing Edinburgh castle, and freeing the king and queen from the
                    domination of the Cornyns. Meanwhile Henry had himself marched to Scotland with
                    an army, and in September he met Alexander at Roxburgh. There a regency was
                    arranged, from which the Cornyns were entirely excluded. In 1257, however, the
                    latter regained their ascendancy, and obtained possession of the person of the
                    king, whom they kept prisoner at Kinross and Stirling. In the following year a
                    new regency was formed, in which both the opposing parties were represented, and
                    the king was liberated. In 1260 he and his queen paid a visit to the court of
                    England. While at Windsor the queen gave birth to a daughter, Margaret,
                    afterwards married to Eric of Norway. An account of the invasion of Scotland in
                    1263 by Haco, king of Norway, and of the disastrous defeat at Largs, belongs
                    rather to the history of the country than to the personal biography of the king.
                    Three years after the invasion, Magnus, king of Norway, ceded to Alexander the
                    Isle of Man and the Western Isles, receiving in return a ransom of a thousand
                    marks and an annual rent of a hundred marks. The Orkney and Shetland islands
                    still remained under the dominion of Norway. Alexander was involved in a
                    protracted and on the whole successful struggle with the papal power for the
                    independence of the Scottish Church. The chief matter in dispute was the proper
                    valuation of church lands for the purpose of taxation. In connection with this,
                    Boiamund or Bagi-mond came from Rome in 1275 with a commission to draw up the
                    valution known as Bagimond’s roll, which remained the basis for the taxation of
                    church lands down to the time of the Reformation. The internal condition of the
                    country seems to have improved greatly during the latter years of Alexander’s
                    reign. A wise and vigorous administration ensured peace and consequent
                    prosperity. The prospect of Scotland was perhaps never brighter in all her early
                    history than towards the close of his reign, but it was suddenly overcast. A
                    series of calamities, following each other in quick succession, left the nation
                    at the mercy of its foes within and without. In 1275 Alexander’s wife died, and
                    a few years later he lost both his children. The succession in the direct line
                    was thus left to the precarious chance of the single life of the infant princess
                    known in history as the “Maid of Norway.” In 1285 Alexander married Joletta,
                    daughter of the Count of Dreux. Any hope of strengthening the succession by this
                    union was, however, destroyed by the calamitous event of the following year. On
                    the 12th March 1286 the king was killed by a fall from his horse while riding on
                    the coast of Fife opposite Edinburgh. A spot near Kinghorn, known as the King’s
                    Wud End, is pointed out as the scene of the tragical event. The death of
                    Alexander was a turning-point in Scottish history. The national independence,
                    which he maintained so steadfastly against the insidious claims of England,
                    while avoiding an open rupture, was once more placed in jeopardy. The popular
                    estimate of the calamity is well expressed in the following lines, believed to
                    be the earliest specimen of Scotch poetry extant :—</p>
