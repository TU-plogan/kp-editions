                <p><label type="entry">ALCOHOL</label>, a volatile organic body, constantly formed
                    during the fermentation of vegetable juices containing sugar in solution. It is
                    extracted from spirituous liquors of different kinds by successive distillations
                    or rectifications; the alcohol being more volatile than water, gradually
                    accumulates in the first portion of each distillate. After a few operations the
                    spirit obtained is as strong as it can be made by this process, and further
                    repetition does not enable us to separate more water from it. In commerce the
                    strongest spirit is known as spirit of wine, and contains about 90 per cent. of
                    alcohol. The remaining 10 per cent. of water must be removed by some chemical
                    agent that will combine with water and retain it at the boiling-point of the
                    spirit, and be without any specific action on the alcohol. The dehydrating
                    substances in general use are certain anhydrous salts, such as carbonate of
                    potash, acetate of potash, or sulphate of copper. These rapidly absorb water at
                    low temperature, and part with -it at a red heat; so that they may be used over
                    and over again. The most efficient dehydrating agent is caustic lime or caustic
                    baryta. Lime is generally used in making the absolute alcohol of commerce. For
                    this purpose the caustic lima is broken into small pieces about the size of a
                    walnut, and placed in a retort; spirits of wine is now poured into the vessel,
                    just sufficient to cover the lime, and the whole is left to digest for a night.
                    During this time the lime gradually slakes from the absorption of water, and the
                    anhydrous alcohol is left, ready to distill off at the temperature of the
                    water-bath. Absolute alcohol is a very mobile colourless liquid, having a high
                    refractive power, and possessing a feeble agreeable smell and an acid burning
                    taste, which, however, diminishes as it is diluted with water. The caustic taste
                    is in great part due to the rapidity with which it takes water from any living
                    tissue with which it comes in contact, producing coagulation if the fluids are
                    albuminous. Alcohol has a specific gravity of 0∙794 at a temperature of 60°
                    Fahr., and boils at 173° ∙1 Fahr., barometer being at 30 inches. It does not
                    conduct electricity, and has never been obtained in the solid state, although at
                    very low temperatures it becomes viscid. For this reason alcohol is always used
                    to fill thermometers for registering low temperatures, as mercury freezes, and
                    cannot be employed as an index of temperature below - 39° Fahr. Its high
                    co-efficient of expansion makes alcohol a very sensitive fluid for thermometric
                    purposes. Alcohol has a great tendency to absorb water from the atmosphere, and
                    must be kept in thoroughly sound vessels. It mixes with water in all
                    proportions, and during the dilution there is a considerable amount of heat
                    evolved. When alcohol and water are mixed, a contraction of volume occurs, which
                    augments until 100 parts of alcohol are mixed with 116∙23 parts of water;
                    103∙775 volumes of alcohol and water mixed in that ratio contracting to 100.
                    Addition of water beyond the proportion given above causes less and less
                    contraction, and finally no diminution of volume can be observed. As alcohol is
                    diluted with water its volatility and its power of dilatation diminish, whereas
                    the specific gravity increases, continually approaching that of water. Next to
                    water, alcohol is the substance most generally employed as a solvent. It
                    dissolves many organic substances, and is especially used in the arts for the
                    manufacture of varnishes. In medicine it is invaluable as a solvent of the
                    active principle of many substances that are insoluble in water, and would soon
                    decompose in aqueous solution. These alcoholic solutions are generally called
                    tinctures.</p>
                <p>Alcohol is an excellent antiseptic agent. As a preservative of animal structures
                    it is generally used in the impure state—known in commerce as methylated spirit.
                    This is spirits of wine mixed with 10 per cent. of commercial wood spirits,
                    which does not interfere with its preservative or solvent powers, although it
                    renders it unfit for use as a beverage.</p>

                <p>Grape sugar. Alcohol. Carbonic acid.</p>
                <p>The complex body, grape-sugar, breaks up by the action of the ferment or yeast
                    into alcohol or carbonic acid, without anything being added. This kind of
                    chemical change is sometimes called an action of presence, or catalytic action,
                    because the substance inducing it does not enter into the composition of the
                    products of the reaction. The alcohol ferment or yeast is a minute cellular
                    plant that grows rapidly in sugar solution, especially if albumenoid matter is
                    also present, and during the continuance of its vital functions causes a
                    rearrangement of the atoms of the sugar. In order that fermentation may proceed
                    regularly, a temperature of about 60° Fahr. is required, and an amount of sugar
                    in solution not exceeding 10 per cent. The sugar is principally obtained from
                    malt, which is barley that has been allowed to germinate for a certain time, and
                    is then arrested in its growth by heating to a high temperature. During this
                    process of germination there is a peculiar ferment produced called diastase;
                    this has the remarkable property of changing starch into grape-sugar. When the
                    malt is treated with water, the ferment causes all the starch originally present
                    in the grain to appear in solution as grape-sugar. All kinds of starch may be
                    changed into grape-sugar by boiling with dilute sulphuric acid, which in this
                    case acts somewhat like a ferment, because it is not decomposed during the
                    action. The sulphuric acid is afterwards separated by treating with lime, which
                    produces insoluble sulphate of lime (gypsum), and leaves the sugar in solution.
                    In this way sugar for the alcohol manufacture is now largely made from the
                    potato and other starch-yielding plants. Cane-sugar is too expensive to be
                    employed in the distillery. Molasses, or the uncrystallis-able portion of the
                    cane-sugar, is, however, largely used.</p>
                <p>Alcohol, when acted on by other chemical substances, produces a great variety of
                    new compounds. With acids a remarkable class of bodies are produced called
                    ethers, of which ordinary ether is the type. The majority of them are very
                    volatile fluids, that in many cases have a very agreeable odour, and are not
                    readily soluble in water. Many ethers are obtained by simply heating a mixture
                    of the acid and alcohol in a closed vessel to a temperature of <hi rend="italic"
                    >212°</hi> Fahr., and subsequently treating with water. The water dissolves the
                    alcohol not acted upon, and leaves the ether floating on the surface.</p>
                <p>When alcohol is treated with chlorine, absorption occurs, and hydrochloric acid
                    is continuously evolved for many hours, the temperature rising considerably
                    during the action. Many substances are formed in succession, but the principal
                    product, after long-continued action, is the substance chloral, now largely used
                    as an anaesthetic. Bromine produces a similar body called bromal. Iodine does
                    not act on alcohol at ordinary temperatures, further than to pass into solution.
                    When treated with a solution of chloride of lime, alcohol is violently attacked,
                    and the result of the action is the well-known substance chloroform. Acted on by
                    oxidising agents, alcohol gives two new substances—aldehyde and acetic acid. The
                    ease with which acetic acid is produced by heating with a mixture of bichromate
                    of potash and sulphuric acid gives a delicate method of detecting and estimating
                    very small quantities of alcohol. When the vapour of alcohol is passed through a
                    red-hot tube filled with fragments of pumice-stone, com plete decomposition
                    takes place. Among the products are found naphthalin, benzol, hydrogen, marsh
                    gas, ethylene, and other bodies.</p>
                <p>The synthesis of alcohol has been effected by means of the hydro-carbon called
                    olefiant gas, which may be made directly from carbon and hydrogen. When this gas
                    is shaken with strong sulphuric acid it gradually combines with it; and if it is
                    afterwards diluted with water and distilled, alcohol passes over. As olefiant
                    gas is one of the constituents of common coal-gas, this substance may be used to
                    make alcohol by the above method. The action that takes place is represented
                    thus :—</p>
                <p>C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + H <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi> O olefiant Gas. Water. Alcohol.</p>
                <p>As the value of spirituous liquors depends mainly on the quantity of alcohol they
                    contain, it is essential to find some simple and rapid means of ascertaining the
                    percentage amount of the substance present. For this purpose three methods may
                    be employed, viz., specific gravity determination, temperature of ebullition, or
                    rate of expansion. The easiest plan, and the most generally used, is the density
                    method. Very accurate tables are published of the specific gravity of mixtures
                    of alcohol and water in all proportions, so that it is only necessary to refer
                    to these tables to get the percentage composition. In the case of liquors, like
                    wines or beers, that contain many other substances in solution in addition to
                    alcohol, it is necessary to separate the alcohol from the extractive
                    matters—sugar, salts, &amp;c.—by distillation, and to take the density of the
                    volatile portion. As wines contain many volatile ethers that would pass over
                    with the alcohol in the above process, and interfere with accurate results being
                    obtained, they are generally decomposed by heating with an alkali before the
                    distillation commences.</p>
                <p>The physiological action of alcohol is a subject to which considerable attention
                    has been directed of late years, and many investigators have attacked the
                    problem. The most important contribution to our knowledge of the subject is due
                    to Dr Parkes, who has made a long series of observations on soldiers living on a
                    constant diet with and without the use of alcohol. In these experiments the
                    weight of the body, the amount of nitrogen in the urine and faeces, the amount
                    of urea, the pulse, and the temperature of the body were all determined daily.
                    The following are the principal conclusions deduced from the investigation
                    :—</p>
                <p>The elimination of nitrogen during exercise was unaffected by brandy; and since a
                    similar result occurred in a series of experiments made during rest, it seems
                    certain that in healthy men on uniform good diet alcohol does not interfere with
                    the disintegration of nitrogenous tissues.</p>
                <p>The heat of the body, as judged of by the axilla and rectum temperature, was
                    unaffected by the amount given. The apparent heat after alcohol must therefore
                    be owing to subjective feelings connected with the quickened circulation, rather
                    than to an actual rise of temperature.</p>
                <p>The pulse was increased in frequency by 4 ounces of brandy, and palpitation and
                    breathlessness were brought on by larger doses to such an extent as greatly to
                    lessen the amount of work the man could do, and to render quick movements
                    impossible. As the effect of labour alone is to augment the strength and
                    frequency of the heart’s action, it would appear obviously improper to act on
                    the heart still more by alcohol. Whether on a heart exhausted by exertion
                    alcohol would produce good or bad effects is not shown by these experiments.</p>
                <p>Neither exercise nor alcohol produced any effect on the phosphoric acid of the
                    urine, or the free acidity, or the chlorine.</p>
                <p>As the action of alcohol in dietetic doses on the elimination of nitrogen and on
                    the bodily temperature is so entirely negative, it seems reasonable to doubt if
                    alcohol can have the depressing effect on the excretion of pulmonary carbon
                    which is commonly attributed to it. It can hardly depress, one would think, the
                    metamorphosis of tissues or substances furnishing carbon, without affecting
                    either the changes of the nitrogenous structures or bodily heat.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0508-0471"/>
                <p>The elimination of alcohol from the body has been a matter of dispute between
                    different observers. Previous to the year 1860 it was the generally-received
                    opinion that the greater portion of any alcohol taken was oxidised in the
                    system, and only a small fraction eliminated unaltered. In that year Messrs
                    Perrin and Lallemand published an elaborate memoir on the subject, in which they
                    maintained that all, or at least nearly all, the alcohol taken is eliminated
                    unaltered. This subject has been recently reinvestigated by Dr Austin, Dr
                    Thudichum, and especially by Dr A. Dupré. The main results of Dr Dupré’s series
                    of observations may be summed up as follows :—</p>
                <p>The amount of alcohol eliminated per day does not increase with the continuance
                    of the alcohol diet; and therefore all the alcohol consumed daily must of
                    necessity be disposed of daily; and as it certainly is not eliminated within
                    that time, it must be destroyed in the system.</p>
                <p>The" elimination of alcohol following the ingestion of a dose or doses of alcohol
                    ceases in from nine to twenty-four hours after the last dose has been taken.</p>
                <p>The amount of alcohol eliminated in both breath and urine is a minute fraction
                    only of the amount of alcohol taken.</p>
                <p>In the course of these experiments the author found that, after six weeks of
                    total abstinence, and even in the case of a teetotaller, a substance is
                    eliminated in the urine, and perhaps also in the breath, which, though
                    apparently not alcohol, gives all the reactions ordinarily used for the
                    detection of traces of alcohol. The quantity present in urine is, however, so
                    small that the precise nature of the substance has not as yet been determined.
                    The author points out an apparent connection between this substance and alcohol.
                    It was found that, after the elimination due to the ingestion of alcohol had
                    ceased, the amount of this substance eliminated in a given time at first
                    remained below the quantity normally excreted, and only gradually rose again to
                    the normal standard. A careful study of this connection may perhaps serve to
                    throw some light upon the physiological action of alcohol.</p>
