                    account of its adherence to the doctrines of the Reformation, had to surrender
                    the kingdom to the Albertine or younger branch, which is still in possession of
                    it. The marriage of his parents proving an unhappy one, they separated in 1824,
                    and the young prince never again saw his mother, who died in 1831. He was
                    educated, along with his elder brother Ernest, under the care of <hi
                    rend="italic">Consistorial-Rath</hi> Florschütz, who, in a memorandum drawn up
                    after the prince’s death, speaks in the highest terms of his pupil’s benevolent
                    disposition and studious habits. At the proper age the brothers proceeded to the
                    university of Bonn, where Herr Florschütz still continued to exercise a general
                    superintendence of their studies. Prince Albert devoted himself especially to
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n489/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0489-0452"/> natural sciences, political economy, and
                    philosophy, having for teachers men of such world-wide fame as Fichte, Schlegel,
                    and Perthes. He also diligently cultivated at this period the sister arts of
                    music and painting, and thus qualified himself for some of the most valuable
                    services he was afterwards to render to the land of his adoption. His feeling
                    for art in all its forms was very sensitive, and his executive skill, both as a
                    musician and painter, very considerable. In gymnastic exercises he greatly
                    excelled, carrying off the first prize for fencing in a competition with a large
                    number of students.</p>
                <p>In 1836 the prince visited England in company with his father, and met his future
                    consort for the first time. The idea of a matrimonial alliance between the
                    cousins had occurred to various members of the family, and had been cherished
                    especially by their grandmother the dowagerduchess of Coburg, and their uncle
                    Leopold, the king of the Belgians. From the time of the queen’s accession there
                    seems to have been a family understanding on the subject, though, owing to the
                    youth of the prince and his cousin, no formal engagement was entered into till
                    two years later. In the winter of 1838-9 the prince travelled in Italy,
                    accompanied by Mr Seymour, a young English gentleman, who was selected doubtless
                    out of regard to the probable future of his charge. A year later the hopes of
                    many were realised when, on the 23d Nov. 1839, the queen announced to the Privy
                    Council her intended marriage with her cousin. The circumstances of the
                    engagement have been fully made known since the prince’s death, and they show
                    that the union was founded upon mutual choice, springing from mutual affection.
                    On the 10th February 1840 the marriage was celebrated at the chapelroyal, St
                    James’s, amid universal rejoicings. A few days before the event two bills had
                    been passed in parliament, one naturalising the prince as a British subject, and
                    the other providing an annuity of £30,000 a year for the maintenance of his
                    establishment. The ministry had proposed that the sum should be £50,000,
                    following the precedent established in the case of Prince Leopold; but the
                    reduction was made on the motion of Colonel Sibthorpe, who received the support
                    of the radicals and the entire opposition. The result of the vote caused the
                    prince considerable vexation and disappointment, which were enhanced when
                    difficulties were raised in parliament as to the precedence to be accorded to
                    him. The latter question was only settled by an exercise of the queen’s
                    prerogative. Letters patent were issued on the 5th March, giving the prince
                    precedence next to the queen.</p>
                <p>The position in which the prince was placed by his marriage, while it was one of
                    distinguished honour, was also one of peculiar difficulty, and it was only the
                    possession of a rare discretion that enabled him to fill it so irreproachably as
                    he did. Published letters and memoranda show how thoroughly he appreciated the
                    delicate nature of his duties, and how clearly he perceived the limits within
                    which his influence must be confined if it was to be legitimately and usefully
                    exerted. A letter to the Duke of Wellington, declining, after mature
                    consideration, to be designated to the office of commander-in-chief of the army,
                    is especially noteworthy as containing an admirable description of the proper
                    functions of a princeconsort. Generally, his idea was that it was his duty to
                    merge his personality as completely as possible in that of the sovereign, while
                    giving her in all things real but unobtrusive advice and support; and that he
                    acted during his whole life in conformity with this idea those who had the best
                    means of knowing were the readiest to testify. Once, indeed, at the commencement
                    of the Crimean war, it was generally believed that he had overstepped the limits
                    of his position by interfering unwarrantably with the foreign policy of the
                    country and the patronage of the army. The charges were so definite and so
                    widely circulated that it was deemed necessary to take notice of them in
                    parliament. They were met by a complete and emphatic denial on the part of the
                    ministry, and no one now believes that they had any real foundation. It was, of
                    course, both natural and proper that the prince should interest himself deeply
                    in the affairs of the country over which, by an Act passed on the 4th Aug. 1840,
                    he had been named regent in the event of the death of the queen before the heir
                    to the crown had attained the age of eighteen years. He had also a right to
                    interest himself in the administration of the army, as being himself a
                    field-marshal and a colonel of hussars.</p>
                <p>It was fortunate for the prince, shut out as he was by the circumstances of his
                    station from any share in party politics, that he found other and more congenial
                    work sufficient to engage all his energies. He was qualified, as few of his rank
                    are, to deal with those social and scientific problems in the solution of which
                    men of all parties are equally interested. He engaged himself especially in
                    endeavours to secure the more perfect application of science and art to
                    manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 originated in a suggestion
                    he threw out at a meeting of the Society of Arts, and owed the greater part of
                    its success to his intelligent and unwearied efforts. Similar institutions, on a
                    smaller scale but with a kindred aim, always found in him warm advocacy and
                    substantial sup port. It was chiefly at meetings in connection with these that
                    he found occasion for the delivery of addresses characterised by profound
                    thought and comprehensiveness of view, a collection of which was published in
                    1857. One of the most favourable specimens of his powers as a speaker is the
                    inaugural address which he delivered as President of the British Association for
                    the Advancement of Science when it met at Aberdeen in 1859, printed in an
                    edition of his speeches which appeared in 1862. The education of his family and
                    the management of his domestic affairs furnished the prince with another very
                    important sphere of action, in which he employed himself with conscientious
                    devotedness. The training of the Prince of Wales was carried on under his own
                    superintendence, in accordance with a plan he himself had drawn up; and it may
                    be questioned whether so much wisdom and care was ever bestowed on the
                    upbringing bf an heir to the British throne. The estates of the Duchy of
                    Cornwall, the hereditary appanage of the Prince of Wales, were so greatly
                    improved under his father’s management that the rent-roll rose from £11,000 to
                    £50,000 a year. Prince Albert, indeed, had a peculiar talent for the management
                    of landed estates. His model farm at Windsor was in every way worthy of the
                    name; and the grounds at Balmoral and Osborne, so universally admired, were laid
                    out entirely in conformity with his designs.</p>
                <p>A character so pure, and a life so useful and well-directed in all its aims,
                    could scarcely fail to secure universal respect. As the prince became better
                    known, the mistrust, of which the adverse votes in parliament were undoubtedly
                    to some extent an expression, gave way, and the people vied with their queen in
                    showering deserved honours upon him. After a keen contest with Earl Powis, he
                    was elected chancellor of the university of Cambridge in 1847; and he was
                    afterwards appointed master of the Trinity House. In 1857 the formal title of
                    “Prince-Consort” was conferred upon him by letters patent, in order to settle
                    certain difficulties as to precedence that had been raised at foreign courts. As
                    he had previously possessed no distinctive title, the precedence he had received
                    was only by courtesy.</p>
                <p>It was in the prime of manhood and the full career of his usefulness that the
                    prince-consort was removed by death. He had been greatly occupied during the
                    autumn <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n490/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0490-0453"/> of 1861 with the arrangements for the projected
                    international exhibition, and it was just after returning from one of the
                    meetings in connection with it that he was seized with his last illness. He died
                    of typhoid fever on the 14th of Dec. 1861. Few have ever been more sincerely or
                    more universally mourned. The grief of the queen was deep and lasting, and the
                    whole nation sympathised in the truest sense with her in her sorrow. Perhaps
                    never before, except on the occasion of the death of the Princess Charlotte, had
                    all classes of the people been so closely knit together in the feeling of a
                    common bereavement and a common sorrow. A national memorial, to be erected
                    partly by parliamentary vote and partly by public subscription, was at once
                    resolved upon, and nearly every town of importance throughout the kingdom
                    embodied in a statue or some other form its tribute to the memory of “The Good
                    Prince.” The magnificent mausoleum at Frogmore, in which his remains were
                    finally deposited, was erected at the expense of the Queen and the royal family.
