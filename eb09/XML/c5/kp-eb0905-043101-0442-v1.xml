                        >χάρτης,</hi> thick paper or parchment, came to be applied, from the
                    substance on which it was written, to a document granted by a prince conferring
                    or acknowledging privileges to be enjoyed by either the whole or a portion of
                    the people under his rule. In England, from the Conquest downwards, there was a
                    struggle between those who sought to enforce the feudal exactions which the
                    Normans had learned in France and those who attempted to resist the innovation
                    and hold to the old Saxon customs. If at first it was a contest between the
                    monarch with his Norman followers on the one side and the Saxon population on
                    the other, the conditions had changed during the lapse of nearly a century and a
                    half preceding the reign of John, and the barons were so frequently incensed by
                    the oppressions and exactions of the ambitious kings, to whose power they had
                    contributed <pb break="no"

                    demand for “the good old laws of Edward the Confessor.” Even so early as the
                    reign of the Conqueror himself, there was a royal acknowledgment of franchises
                    or liberties, and the charters, renewals, or confirmations granted by subsequent
                    kings are inextricably numerous. Coke, without exhausting them, counts
                    thirty-two. The Great Charter of King John (1215) has so conspicuous a place in
                    history, not only from its comparative completeness, but because it was exacted
                    by men with arms in their hands from a resisting king, and was thus an enforced
                    stipulation likely to be rigidly interpreted, instead of a concession carelessly
                    conceded and readily forgotten. A great many of the stipulations of the Great
                    Charter refer to feudal exactions now so long obsolete that the restraints on
                    them cease to be intelligible; and those who have looked at the “palladium of
                    our liberties,” expecting to find in it high-sounding definitions of freedom
                    like those in modern Continental declarations of right, have been much
                    disappointed. Even in the comparatively popular langιΛlge of Blackstone there is
                    not much to convey a distinct expression to unprofessional modern readers.</p>
                <p>“It fixed,” he says, “the forfeiture of lands for felony in the same manner as it
                    still remains, and prohibited for the future the grants of exclusive fisheries,
                    and the erection of new bridges so as to oppress the neighbourhood. With respect
                    to private rights, it established the testamentary power of the subject over
                    part of his personal estate, the rest being distributed among his wife and
                    children; it laid down the law of dower as it has continued ever since; and it
                    prohibited the appeals of women, unless for the death of their husbands. In
                    matters of public police and national concern, it enjoined a uniformity of
                    weights and measures, gave new encouragements to commerce by the protection of
                    merchant strangers, and forbade the alienation of lands in mortmain. With regard
                    to the administration of justice, besides prohibiting all denials or delays of
                    it, it fixed the court of common pleas at Westminster, that the suitors might no
                    longer be harassed with following the king’s person in all his progresses; and
                    at the same time brought the trial of issues hc&gt;me to the very doors of the
                    freeholders, by directing assizes to be taken in the proper counties, and
                    establishing annual circuits. It also corrected some abuses then incident to the
                    trials by wager of law and of battle, directed the regular awarding of inquests
                    for life or member, prohibited the king’s inferior ministers from holding pleas
                    of the Crown, or trying any criminal charge, whereby many forfeitures might
                    otherwise have unjustly accrued to the exchequer, and regulated the time and
                    place of holding the inferior tribunals of justice, the county court, sheriff’s
                    turn, and court-leet. It confirmed and established the liberties of the city of
                    London, and all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports of the kingdom. And,
                    lastly, it protected every individual of the nation in the free enjoyment of his
                    life, his liberty, and his property, unless declared to be forfeited by the
                    judgment of his peers or the law of the land.”</p>
                <p>The material feature of the document is that, so slightly referred to in the
                    above extract, which says, “No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be
                    disseised of his freehold or liberties, or free customs, or be outlawed or
                    exiled, or any otherwise damaged, nor will we pass upon him, nor send upon him,
                    but by lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.” In this
                    stipulation there is inferred that supremacy of the fixed principles of the law
                    over the will and power of the monarch, which has rendered the fanatical
                    devotion of the English lawyers to their common law so justifiable; and as a
                    farther security, the right of trial by peers or jurymen appointed a perpetual
                    popular tribunal to check the official judges, should they be tempted to sell
                    the liberties and privileges of the subject. Hallam, a <hi rend="superscript">
                        ,7</hi> ery competent judge, says, “The institutions of positive law, the
                    far more important changes which time has wrought in the order of society during
                    600 years subsequent to the Great Charter, have undoubtedly lessened its direct
                    application to our present circumstances. But it is still the keystone of
                    English liberty. All that has since been obtained is little more than a
                    confirmation or commentary; and if every subsequent law were to be swept wpy,
                    there would still remain the bold features that distinguish a free from a
                    despotic monarchy.”— <hi rend="italic">(Middle Ages,</hi> chap, viii.)</p>
                <p>Exemplars of the Great Charter were preserved among the muniments of cathedrals,
                    and in other places calculated to preserve public archives. The Record
                    Commission, when they published their edition of the statutes of the realm, were
                    desirous to print the best authenticated version of the charter of King John;
                    and they state, that “in Lincoln Cathedral, an original of the Great Charter of
                    Liberties, granted by King John in the seventh year of his reign, is preserved
                    in a perfect state. This charter appears to be of superior authority to either
                    of the two charters of the same date preserved in the British Museum. From the
                    contemporary indorsement of the word <hi rend="italic">Lincolina</hi> on two
                    folds of the charter, this may be presumed to be the charter transmitted by the
                    hands of Hugh, the then bishop of Lincoln, who is one of the bishops named in
                    the introductory clause.”— <hi rend="italic">(Introduction,</hi> xxix.)</p>
                <p>Among the other concessions of a less comprehensive nature, the Charter of the
                    Forest was deemed next in importance to Magna Charta. In nothing was the selfish
                    rapacity of the Norman monarchs more conspicuous than in their relentless
                    clearings of great districts of country for the establishment of forests or
                    chases, where the sanctity of their field-sports was protected with a strict
                    legal severity not conceded to the protection of ordinary property and personal
                    freedom. The Charter of the Forest imposed wholesome limits on such inroads, and
                    hence, along with the Great Charter, it has been printed at the commencement of
                    the English statutes. The position of these documents in a series of Acts of
                    Parliament is not so anomalous as it might seem; for it would be very difficult
                    to distinguish the charters from the earliest statutes, which were concessions
                    or admissions granted by the monarch on the requisition of the principal persons
                    of the realm assembled together. Our statutes, indeed, still bear in their
                    phraseology a testimony to this origin.</p>
                <p>The early use of the word “charter,” as a foundation of constitutional liberties,
                    led to its being applied on various occasions to fundamental constitutional
                    codes or rules of government adopted by various nations. The most memorable
                    instance is the French <hi rend="italic">Charte,</hi> containing the
                    constitution of the French Government, as adjusted at the restoration in 1815,
                    and amended at the revolution of 1830, which had its origin in an attempt of
                    Charles X. to stretch one of its dubious clauses.</p>
                <p>From such public acts as Magna Charta, the concession of privileges by charter
                    from the Crown descended through various grades. Both in England and Scotland
                    the privileges of municipal corporations either were conferred of old by
                    charter, or were presumed to have been so conferred. The power of the Crown has
                    in this form long virtually departed, but it is still competent to incorporate
                    collective bodies with certain limited powers by royal charter; though, in
                    general, it is deemed necessary when the powers might affect personal or public
                    interests to secure them by Act of Parliament. Insidious privileges were
                    sometimes granted by charter, and were among the objects of the attacks on the
                    Crown’s power to grant monopolies in the 17th century.</p>
                <p>By the practice of mimicking the usages of the sovereign through all grades of
                    feudality, it became the custom for every feudal lord or superior, high or low,
                    when conceding any privilege as to his fief or landed property, to do so by a
                    charter. Thus, throughout the British empire, and in Scotland especially, one of
                    the most ordinary deeds connected with the commerce in land assumes to this day
                    the shape of a concession of privileges by a sovereign or other high feudal lord
                    to his vassal. One of the essential features which the student of Scottish law
                    has to master in the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n444/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0444-0433"/> practice of conveyancing is the constitution
                    of the charter. Although modern practice has ingrafted on it other classes of
                    deeds, to suit the exigencies of the commerce in land, such as the disposition,
                    the assignation, &amp;c., yet “the charter” is the original source from which
                    the spirit and tenor of the whole system of conveyancing are to be acquired.</p>
