                    (Greek, <hi rend="italic">ΙΑίμβροί),</hi> an ancient nation of unknown affinity,
                    which was one of the most formidable enemies υf the Roman power, and has proved
                    one of the most difficult subjects for the historical investigator. About 113
                    B.c., in company with the Teutones, they defeated the consul Papirius Carbo near
                    Noreia in Styria; and in 109 B.c. they routed another army under the consul
                    Silanus. By the latter success they opened their way to Gallia Narbonensis; and
                    in 105 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> they began to threaten the Roman territory
                    itself. They were joined by the Gauls from all quarters; and the Roman army sent
                    against them under Caepio and Manlius was almost exterminated. Only ten men with
                    two generals are said to have escaped; and, in accordance with a vow which they
                    had made before the battle, the conquerors destroyed all the spoil. The gold and
                    silver they flung into the Rhone; they drowned the horses, and put all the
                    prisoners to death. The Romans were thrown into consternation; but a new army
                    was raised with all expedition, and the command was bestowed on Marius, who at
                    that time enjoyed a high reputation on account of his victories in Africa. The
                    Cimbri were approaching over the eastern Alps, and the Teutones and the other
                    allies over the western. He first attacked and defeated the latter division at
                    Aquae Sextiae, and then returned to face the Cimbri, who had meanwhile seen the
                    backs of the soldiers of Catullus and Sylla. The vast host attacked the Romans
                    with the utmost fury in the Campi Raudii near Vercellae (101 B.c.); but,
                    unaccustomed to the heats of Italy, they soon began to yield and were easily
                    overcome. They had put it out of their own power to fly; for, that they might
                    the better keep their ranks, they had, like true barbarians, tied themselves
                    together. It is said that 120,000 were killed on the field of battle and 60,000
                    were taken prisoners. The people of the Italian districts known as the Sette
                    Communi in Vicenza and the Tredeci Communi in Verona have a belief that they are
                    descended from the remnants of the Cimbrian army, but it is much more probable
                    that they are the posterity of German settlers introduced by the bishops of
                    Trent. Be this at it may, it is certain that after the victory of Marius the
                    Cimbri were no longer of much importance as antagonists of Rome.</p>
                <p>Two great questions have claimed the attention of the historian in regard to this
                    people; but to neither of them has anything like a definite answer been
                    obtained. The first has to do with their local habitation, and the second with
                    their ethnographical connection. Caesar, Sallust, Cicero, and Diodorus Siculus
                    seem to have regarded them as GauLs, and assign them a position within the
                    Gallic area; whereas Strabo, Velleius Paterculus, and Tacitus treat them as
                    Germans and locate them beyond the Rhine. The modern district of Jutland was
                    familiarly known as the Cimbric Chersonese, and mention is made in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Mon.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ancyranum</hi> of an emoassy from
                    the Cimbrians of that peninsula to Augustus. Beyond this our ancient authorities
                    do not carry us, and modern discussion has done little but maintain a continual
                    oscillation of opinion. That they were closely connected with the Teutones is
                    evident, and that the Teutones at least were Germanic was for a time regarded as
                    certain; but more elaborate investigation shows that even this is open to
                    dispute, and can afford no support as an argument. The ancient identification of
                    the people with the Cimmerii’ and the modern identification with the Cymry are
                    well-nigh exploded, and probably owe their origin to mere similarity of
                    names.</p>
