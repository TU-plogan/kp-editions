                    the North-Western Provinces, lies in 25° and 26° N.lat., and 79° and 80° E.
                    long. It is bounded on the N. by the province of Oudh, the Ganges River forming
                    the boundary line; on the E. by Fathïpur district, on the S. by the Jamná,
                    separating it from Hamirpur and Jalaun districts, and on the W. by Etawah and
                    Farrakhábád districts. The district is situated between the Ganges and Jamná
                    rivers, and is a portion of the well-watered and fertile tract known as the
                    Duáb. The general inclination of the country is from north to south. Besides the
                    two great rivers, the principal streams are the Arand or Rhind, the Karan or
                    Singar, the Isan, and the Pandu. An extension of the great Ganges Canal also
                    passes through the district. The total area is 2336’53 square miles. The census
                    of 1872 returned the total population of Cawnpur district at 1,156,055, made up
                    as follows :—Hindus, 1,065,786, or 92’20 per cent, of the total population;
                    Muhammadans, 89,215, or 7*72 per cent; Christians (z.e., Europeans, Eurasians,
                    and native Christians), 1054, or O8 per cent. Total number of villages and
                    townships, 1985; total number of houses, 272,232. Only two towns in the district
                    contain a population of upwards of 5000 souls, namely Cawnpur town and
                    cantonments, population 122,778, and Bilhaur, population 5954. Of the total area
                    of the district, viz., 2336’53 square miles, 1351’42 square miles are
                    cultivated, and 236’15 cultivable, the remainder being uncultivable waste. The
                    staple crop is wheat, but cotton of an excellent quality has of late years been
                    much cultivated. The principal industry is leather work, which is very
                    extensively carried on throughout the district,—Cawnpur saddlery and harness
                    being exported to all parts of India. The trading towns of importance besides
                    Cawnpur are,—Bilhaur, population 5954; Akbarpur, population 4911; and Kashi-pur,
                    population 4663. Most of the towns and large villages have markets once or twice
                    a week for the sale of local produce and cattle. The only regularly-constituted
                    municipality in the district is Cawnpur, but ten small towns have a municipal
                    committee, and carry out conservancy and sanitary arrangements, &lt;fcc., by
                    means of taxes assessed on the householders. The last settlement of the land
                    revenue of the district expired in 1872, and a new one is in progress.</p>
                <p>The district revenue in 1872-73 was £576,587, of which £212,276 was derived from
                    land, £12,163 from opium, and £15,882 from stamps. The district police force in
                    1873 numbered 555, costing £9165, 8s.; the village watchmen, or rural police
                    (maintained by the villagers/, 2985, estimated cost £10,746; municipal police,

                    £3183, 12s.. At the charitable dispensaries 2634 patients received treatment
                    during 1873, at a cost of £1131, 5d., of which Government contributed
                    two-thirds. The Government and aided schools in the district in 1873 numbered
                    391, attended by 10,731 pupils.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cawnpuk City,</hi> the administrative headquarters of the
                    district of the same name, and a large military cantonment, situated on the
                    right or south bank of the Ganges, in 26° 29' N. lat. and 80° 25' E. long. The
                    river here is about 500 yards wide in summer, but when swollen by the rains
                    increases to about a mile in breadth, with a strong and rapid current. It is
                    navigable southwards to the sea, a distance of 1000 miles; and upwards as far as
                    Sukertál, 300 miles to the north-west. A bridge of boats crosses the Ganges at
                    Cawnpur, and the <hi rend="italic">ghAts,</hi> or landingplaces, on the bank
                    present a busy scene of commerce. The city is built on a sandy plain; and,
                    together with the cantonments, contained in 1872 a total population of 122,710
                    souls, classified as follows :—Hindus, 90,582; Muhammadans, 31,888; Christians,
                    300. This classification apparently excludes the European soldiers. The
                    cantonment forms one of the large military stations of Northern India, and has
                    accommodation for 7000 fighting men. Excluding the cantonment, the population
                    within the limits of the Cawnpur municipality amounted to 98,476 in 1872. The
                    municipal income in 1871-72 amounted to £19,323, and the expenditure to £15,639.
                    Cawnpur is a station on the East India Railway, and also a terminus of the Oudh
                    and Rohilkhand Railway. The principal thoroughfare in the native town is the
                    Chandni Chauk, or “street of silver,” upwards of 100 feet in width. Cawnpur is
                    noted for the excellence and cheapness of its leather manufactures, such as
                    saddlery, harness, boots and shoes, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The importance of Cawnpur
                    city dates from its selection as a military post, when the Ceded Provinces were
                    acquired by the East India Company in 1801. The one great event in its history
                    is the siege of the British position by the rebel Sepoys during the mutiny of
                    1857, and the treacherous massacre which followed on the surrender of the
                    garrison. The story of the mutiny and massacre of Cawnpur has been fully
                    chronicled by Sir J. W. Kaye, Colonel Mowbray Thomson, and Mr G. O. Trevelyan.
                    On the deposition of Máhárájá Báji Rao, the last Marhattá Peshwá, or sovereign
                    of Puná, by the East India Company, he received an annuity of £80,000 a year,
                    and had a princely residence assigned to him at Bithur, a short distance from
                    Cawnρur. Here he lived in great state until his death in 1851. His heir was an
                    adopted son, named Sirík Dandhu Γanth, more commonly known as the Náná Sáhib,
                    who succeeded to the late Peshwa’s estate at Bithur, and to the great
                    accumulations of wealth which he had left behind him. An application of Náná
                    Sáhib for a continuance of the annuity or pension granted to his adoptive father
                    was, however, disallowed by the Indian Government; and on appeal, this decision
                    was upheld by the Board of Control and by the Privy Council in England. For this
                    refusal to grant what he looked upon as his right, Náná Sáhib cherished a bitter
                    grudge against the English, which, however, he carefully concealed until the
                    outbreak of the mutiny afforded him his opportunity for revenge.</p>
                <p>In May 1857 the European force in the Cawnpur cantonment consisted of a handful
                    of artillery and infantry, making about 300 fighting men, including the English
                    officers of the Sepoy regiments. The native force comprised the 1st, 53d, and
                    65th regiments of native infantry, and the 2d regiment of Bengal cavalry, about
                    3000 men in all. The division was commanded by General Sir Hugh Wheeler. The
                    native troops began to manifest, early in 1857, the same symptoms of disquiet as
                    other native regiments stationed in Bengal and Upper India. When the news of the
                    outbreak at Meerut and Delhi reached Cawnpuτ, the excitement among the native
                    soldiery, camp followers, and city population increased to such a degree that
                    General Wheeler deemed it expedient to throw up defensive works, within which
                    the whole Christian population might gather in event of a rising. Unfortunately,
                    the site chosen for the eutrenchment proved unsuitable in almost every respect.
                    “The fortifications,” writes Sir John W. Kaye, “were so paltry, that an English
                    subaltern could have ridden over them on a cast horse from the company’s stud.
                    The earthworks were little more than 4 feet high, and were not even bullet-proof
                    at the crest. The apertures for the artillery exposed both our guns and our
                    gunners, whilst an enemy in adjacent buildings might find cover on all sides.”
                    Towards the end of May it became evident that the rising of the Sepoys was only
                    a question of time, and accordingly all women, children, and non-combatants were
                    gathered within the improvised entrenchments. On the night of the 4th June the
                    crisis arrived. The 2d cavalry set the example of open rebellion, and were
                    immediately followed by the 1st regiment of foot. The treasury was robbed, and
                    the magazine, with its enormous supplies of ammunition and artillery, was taken
                    possession of by the mutineers. The following morning the 53d and 56th native
                    regiments joined their comrades.</p>
                <p>The Náná’s opportunity had now come. He placed himself at the head of the rebels,
                    and was proclaimed Peshwá of the Marhattás, in feudatory allegiance to the Delhi
                    emperor. On the 6th June he sent notice to General Wheeler that he was about to
                    attack the position. Within this slight fortification upwards of a thousand
                    souls had taken refuge, of whom 465 were men of all ages and professions. Every
                    one able to bear arms was told off to the defence. At noon began the siege, “the
                    miseries of which to the besieged,” says Sir J. W. Kaye, “have never been
                    exceeded in the history of the world. All the wonted terrors of a multitudinous
                    enemy without, of a feeble garrison and scant shelter within, of the burden of
                    women and children and sick people, with little to appease their wants or to
                    allay their sufferings, were aggravated bý the burning heat of the climate. The
                    June sky was little less than a great canopy of fire; the summer breeze was as
                    the blast of a furnace; to touch the barrel of a gun was to recoil as from
                    red-hot iron. It was the season when European strength and energy are ever at
                    their lowest point of depression; when military duty in its mildest form taxes
                    the powers of Englishmen to the utmost, and English women can do little more
                    than sustain life in a state of languid repose, in shaded apartments, with all
                    appliances at command to moderate the temperature and mitigate the suffering.
                    But now, even under the fierce meridian sun, this little band of English
                    fighting men were ever straining to sustain the strenuous activity of constant
                    battle against fearful odds, whilst delicate women and fragile children were
                    suddenly called to endure discomforts and privations which it would have been
                    hard to battle with in strong health under their native skies.”</p>
                <p>The deficiencies of the position as'a place of defence soon became apparent. It
                    was exposed to a continuous cannonade from heavy siege guns, taken from the
                    magazine, and to a ceaseless hail-storm of musketry fire from a range of
                    buildings just outside the entrenchments. All attempts of the mutineers to push
                    forward were fiercely driven back, and a general attack upon the British
                    position was defeated with heavy loss to the assailants. But the contest was too
                    unequal to last long. By the end of the first week our fifty-nine artillerymen
                    were all wounded or killed at their posts. On the eighth day of the siege a
                    great calamity befel the garrison. The building assigned as a shelter for the
                    women and children was burned down, and the sick and wounded had henceforth
                    neither roof over head to shelter them by day, nor any bedding between them and
                    the bare earth at night. The miseries of hunger and thirst and disease were now
                    added to the fire of the enemy and the exposure to the burning sun. During the
                    three weeks which the siege lasted, 250 of the little garrison were interred in
                    the well within the entrenchment.</p>
                <p>Fearfully reduced in numbers, with their guns almost unserviceable, their
                    ammunition nearly expended, and starvation staring them in the face, they found
                    it impossible to hold out much longer. When thus almost at the last extremity of
                    despair, a written message came from the Náná, offering to provide a safe
                    passage to Allahábád to all who laid down their arms. The question of
                    capitulation was long and anxiously discussed before the measure was decided on;
                    but the consideration of the women and children, and of the sick and wounded,
                    led to the acceptance of the Náná’s terms on the 26th June, and it was arranged
                    to evacuate the entrenchment next morning, the Náná engaging to provide safe
                    conduct for the garrison to the river side, and sufficient boats to convey them
                    to Allahábád.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, on the following morning, the remnant of the little garrison left
                    the entrenchment and feebly dragged themselves to the river-stairs appointed as
                    the place of embarkation. Here ensued the act of treachery which was destined
                    for long years to embitter the feelings between the English nation and the
                    Indian races. The boats were in waiting as arranged, and the embarkation was
                    accomplished. No sooner, however, were all on board than on a signal the native
                    boatmen deserted their vessels and clambered to shore. A murderous fire was
                    opened on the boats from both sides of the river, and presently the thatched
                    roofs of the vessels burst into flames, having been ignited by hot cinders. The
                    boats were aground <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n290/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0290-0279"/> at the time of their abandonment by their crewg.
                    On the opening of the fire every attempt was made to get them afloat in
                    midchannel, but most of them remained immovable. “The sick and wounded,” says
                    Sir J. W. Kaye, “were burnt to death or more mercifully suffocated by the smoke;
                    whilst the stronger women with children in their arms took to the river, to be
                    shot down in the water, to be sabred in the stream by mounted troopers who rode
                    in after them, to be bayoneted on reaching land, or to be made captives and
                    reserved for a later and more cruel immolation.” The male prisoners were
                    immediately killed, but of women and children it is computed that 200 were
                    spared for the time by order of the Náná, and conveyed back to Cawnpur. Of the
                    boats which got afloat only one succeeded in forcing its way through the swarms
                    of enemies on both banks of the river, and of its occupants only four men, two
                    officers and two privates, survived to relate the story of Cawnpur. The rest of
                    the tale is soon told. English troops were being hurried forward by forced
                    marches to the relief of Cawnpur under Major Renaud and General Havelock. On the
                    12th July they came up with the rebel army at Fathipur, and after a short
                    encounter —it could not be called a fight—utterly routed it. Another engagement
                    with a like result took place at Aoung on the 15th July, 22 miles from Cawnpur.
                    On this day, the 15th, the Náná heard of the defeat at Fathipur, and learned
                    that Havelock’s little army was in full march upon Cawnpur. Furious at the news,
                    he resolved upon a great final act of butchery. Orders went forth for the
                    massacre of the women and children, the survivors of the dreadful day at the
                    river side. Four or five men who were among the prisoners were first shot in the
                    presence of the Náná, and then the women and children were slashed to death in
                    their prison by Muhammadan butchers from the bazaar, and one or two of the
                    Náná’s followers. Their bodies (some, it is said, with life not quite extinct)
                    were thrown into the well which had served as an improvised cemetery during the
                    siege. After this crowning act of infamy Náná Sáhib resolved upon making one
                    last stand for Cawnpur, and gave battle to Havelock a few miles south of the
                    city on the 16th July. The fight was more hotly contested than those which had
                    preceded it, but ended in the same result. During the night Náná Sáhib fled with
                    the remnant of his army, and the next morning Havelock entered Cawnpur, but too
                    late to save the captives whom he had hoped to rescue. A marble shrine with a
                    statue of the Angel of Peace by Marochetti now covers the well, and the sad
                    scene has been surrounded by a lovely garden. The spot is one of the most
                    pathetic in India, and, to quote the words of the legend round the shrine, will
                    for ever be “Sacred to the perpetual memory of a great company of Christian
                    people, chiefly women and children” who lie beneath. A memorial church has also
