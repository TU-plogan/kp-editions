                    the northern spurs of the Balkan or Haemus range. The western extremity is at
                    Presburg in Hungary, on the same river. The breadth of the Carpathian Mountains
                    is between 100 and 200 miles. They form the main water-shed between the northern
                    seas and the Black Sea. The valley of the March divides them from the Silesian
                    and Moravian chains; the valley of the Lower Danube, from the system of the
                    Alps. They are almost entirely in Austrian territory. The chief divisions are
                    the Little Carpathians on the west, between the Waag and the March; to the east
                    of these, the Jablunka Mountains; then the Western Carpathians, or Carpathians
                    proper; and lastly, the East Carpathians to the south-east of Transylvania. The
                    Western Carpathians include the groups of the Tatra, Lomnitz, and Bisztra. Of
                    these the highest is the Tatra, some of the peaks of which are free from snow
                    only one month in the year. The Gerlsdorfer Spitze, the loftiest <pb break="no"

                    northern side are some small glaciers, which, however, hardly deserve the name.
                    It is here that the mountain lakes, or “eyes of the sea” are found, in deep
                    hollows between the steep and jagged granitic peaks. The main ridge of the
                    Carpathians running east from the Tatra is called the Waldgebirge, the highest
                    points of which are 2800 feet above sea-level. The Tatra and adjoining groups
                    have a very important influence on the climate of the regions lying south of
                    them, serving as a protection from the north wi nd. The East Carpathians, the
                    southernmost member of the chain, occupy a quadrangular tract of about 25,500
                    square miles. The highest point is Mount Butschetje, in South Transylvania; it
                    is 9528 feet in altitude. The chief passes of the Carpathians are those of
                    Tergova, leading from Orsova to Temesvar; Vulcan, in the valley of the Schyl,
                    and Rothe Thurm, in the Aluta valley, at the foot of Mount Surul, both on the
                    south border of Transylvania; Türsburg, between Bucharest and Kronstadt; Ojitos
                    and Gymos between Moldavia and Transylvania; Borgo, leading from Bistritz to
                    Bukowina; Jablunka on the route from Presburg to Cracow. The Carpathians are
                    rich in metallic ores; lead and quicksilver, and also rock-salt, are obtained
                    from them; there are large copper-workings in Zips, gold and silver mines at
                    Kremnitz and Schemnitz in Hungary, and rich gold ores at Nagyag in Transylvania.
                    Besides these substances, the Carpathians furnish a variety of minerals. Granite
                    is an important constituent of the range. In the Liptau Mountains it is overlain
                    by limestone; and in the Zipfer Mountains it is associated with limestone and
                    gneiss. In the Waldgebirge the large deposits of sandstone afford a poor soil
                    for cultivation. Basalt and other igneous rocks, with the remains of ancient
                    craters, are met with in some districts of the Transylvanian Alps. On the slopes
                    of the Carpathians large quantities of wheat and maize are raised; cattle and
                    sheep are pastured in great numbers; and vineyards and orchards flourish. The
                    vegetation presents four zones, that of the beech extends to 4000 feet above the
                    sea, that of the Scotch fir to 1000 feet higher; above this grows a species of
                    pine, which becomes dwarfed and disappears at an altitude of about 6000 feet,
                    beyond which height is a zone of lichen and moss covered or almost bare
                    rock.</p>
