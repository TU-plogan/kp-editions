                <p><label type="entry">CARAVANSERAI</label>, a public building, for the shelter of
                    caravans and of wayfarers generally. It is commonly constructed in the
                    neighbourhood, but not within the walls, of some town or village, and bears the
                    form of a quadrangle, with a dead wall outside, only pierced below by a few
                    narrow air-holes, but with small windows higher up. Within, a cloister-like
                    arcade, surrounded by cellular storerooms, forms the ground-floor; and a
                    somewhat lighter arcade, giving access to little dwelling-rooms, runs round it
                    above. Broad, open flights of stone steps connect the stories. The central court
                    is open to the sky, and generally has in its centre a well with a fountain-basin
                    beside it; but sometimes the well is outside the building. A spacious portal,
                    high and wide enough to admit the passage of a loaded camel, forms the sole
                    entrance, which is furnished with heavy iron-plated folding doors, and is
                    further guarded within by massive iron chains, drawn across at night. Each side
                    of the entry is also provided with stone seats, and the entry paved with
                    flagstones. The court itself is most often paved also, and large enough to admit
                    of three or four hundred crouching camels or tethered mules; the bales of
                    merchandize are piled away under the lower arcade, or stored up in the cellars
                    behind it; the upstairs apartments are for human lodging; but cooking is usually
                    carried on in one or more corners of the quadrangle below. Should the
                    caravanserai be a small one, the merchants and their goods alone find place
                    within, the beasts of burden being left outside. A porter, appointed by the
                    municipal authority of the place, is always present, lodged just within the
                    gate, and sometimes one or more assistants. These form a guard of the building
                    and of the goods and persons in it, and have the right to maintain order and,
                    within certain limits, decorum; but they have no further control over the
                    temporary occupants of the place, which is always kept open from prayer-time at
                    early dawn till late in the evening for all arrivals. A small gratuity is
                    expected by, and is generally given by the guests to, the porter; but he has no
                    legal claim for payment from travellers, his maintenance being provided for out
                    of the funds of the institution. Neither food nor provender is supplied in a
                    caravanserai, water and shelter only; the rest the caravan has to find for
                    itself. Many caravanserais in Syria, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia are possessed of
                    considerable architectural merit; their style of construction is in general that
                    known as Saracenic; their walls are massive, <pb break="no"

                    grand. The portals especially are often decorated with intricate carving; so
                    also is the prayer-niche within, that indicates the direction of the Meccan
                    Kibleh. These buildings, with their belongings, are works of charity, and are
                    supported, repaired, and so forth, out of funds derived from pious legacies,
                    most often of land or rentals Sometimes a municipality takes on itself to
                    construct and maintain a caravanserai; but in any case the institution is
                    registered as tax-free, and its revenues as inalienable. When, as sometimes
                    happens, those revenues have been dissipated by peculation, neglect, or change
                    of times, the caravanserai passes through downward stages of dilapidation to
                    total ruin (of which only too many examples may be seen by the Eastern
                    traveller), unless some new charity intervene to repair and renew it. In the
                    general decline of wealth, public spirit, and prosperity actually prevailing
                    throughout the Mahometan Levant, such better fortune is, however, rare. “Khans,”
                    or places more analogous to our own town-inns and hotels, where not lodging
                    only, but often food and other necessaries or comforts may be had for payment,
                    are sometimes by inaccurate writers confounded with caravanserais, though having
                    really nothing in common with them, except that they are also for the use of
                    travellers. These “Khans” are generally to be found within the town or village
                    precincts, aud are of much smaller dimensions than caravanserais. The “Khan”
                    called that of Asaad Pasha at Damascus is a model of constructive skill and
                    architectual beauty. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">g. p.)</hi></p>
