                    co-extensive parliamentary borough of the same name, in the province of Ulster,
                    in Ireland. It is enclosed by the county of Antrim, except on the S. where it is
                    skirted by the Bay of Carrickfergus (Belfast Lough). It comprises an area of
                    16,702 acres, of which 129 are occupied by the town. The surface is in general
                    hilly; Lough Mourne, a lake of about 90 acres in extent, is 556 feet above the
                    level of the sea, and the highest mountain, Slieve True, which commands a
                    magnificent prospect, attains an elevation of 1100 feet. The land near the
                    sea-shore is an alluvial plain. The farms are small, except in the hilly
                    district, where grazing is carried on. The chief crops are oats and potatoes,
                    for which sea-weed, with lime and vegetable <pb break="no"

                    long been famous for the manufacture of cheese. The fisheries are valuable and
                    extensive, and the oysters taken off the coast are highly prized for their size
                    and flavour. At Duncrue, about a mile and a half from the town, on the property
                    of the marquis of Downshire, rock-salt of remarkable purity and in large
                    quantity is found in the Triassic sandstone.</p>
                <p>According to ecclesiastical arrangement, this burgal county forms a single
                    rectory in the diocese of Connor. The population numbered 8520 persons in 1851,
                    and 9397 in 1871,—4280 males and 5117 females. The borough returns one member to
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>The town of Carrickfergus, from which the county and adjoining bay take their
                    name, is 9½ miles north-east of Belfast by rail. It stretches along the shore of
                    Belfast Lough, is about one mile in length, and consists of the old or walled
                    town in the centre, the Irish quarter on the west, and the Scotch quarter on the
                    east,—the last being chiefly inhabited by fishermen, descendants from a colony
                    driven by religious persecution from Galloway and Ayrshire about the year 1665.
                    The town is irregularly built, and deficient in neatness. The principal building
                    is the old castle, standing on a projecting rock, from which the town derives
                    the name Carrick; it was formerly a place of much strength, and is still
                    maintained as an arsenal, and mounted with heavy guns. The ancient donjon or
                    keep, 90 feet in height, is still in good preservation. The parish church, an
                    antiquated cruciform structure, was originally a chapel or oratory dependent on
                    a Franciscan monastery. The entrance to a subterranean passage between the two
                    establishments is still visible under the communion-table of the church. The
                    jail, built on the site of the above-mentioned monastery, was formerly the
                    county of Antrim prison. The court-house, which adjoins the jail, is a neat
                    modern building. When Carrickfergus was the county town of Antrim (which it
                    ceased to be in 1850), the assizes were held there. The town has some trade in
                    domestic produce and in linen manufactures, there being several flax
                    spinning-mills and a bleach-work in the immediate neighbourhood. Distilling is
                    carried on in the town. Vessels of 100 tons burden can discharge at the pier,
                    and there is a patent slip on the shore. The population of the municipal town
                    was 3543 in 1851, and 4212 in 1871, with an excess at the latter date of 528
                    females. In 1871 567 were Catholics and 3645 Protestants, and of the latter 2056
                    were Presbyterians.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth the town obtained a charter, and this was
                    confirmed by James I., who added the privilege of sending two burgesses to the
                    Irish parliament. The corporation, however, was superseded, under the provisions
                    of the Municipal Reform Act of 1840, by a board of municipal commissioners. In
                    1182, John de Courcy, to whom Henry II. had granted all the parts of Ulster he
                    could obtain possession of by the sword, fixed a colony in this district. De
                    Courcy built the castle which afterwards came into possession of the De Lacy
                    family, who, being ejected, invited Edward Bruce to besiege it (1315). After a
                    desperate resistance the garrison surrendered. In 1386, the town was burned by
                    the Scots, and in 1400 was destroyed by the combined Scots and Irish.
                    Subsequently, it suffered much by famine and the occasional assaults of the
                    neighbouring Irish chieftains, whose favour the townsmen were at length
                    necessitated to secure by the payment of an annual tribute. In the reign of
                    Charles I. many Scotch Covenanters settled in the neighbourhood to avoid the
                    persecution directed against them. In the civil wars, from 1641, Carrickfergus
                    was one of the chief places of refuge for the Protestants of the county of
                    Antrim; and on July 10, 1642, the first Presbytery held in Ireland met there. In
                    that year the garrison was commanded by General Munroe, who having afterwards
                    relinquished the cause of the English Parliament, was, in 1648, surprised and
                    taken prisoner by Sir Robert Adair. At a later period Carrickfergus was held by
                    the partisans of James IL, but surrendered in 1689 to the forces under King
                    William’s general Schomberg; and in 1690 it was visited by King William, who
                    landed here on his expedition to Ireland. In 1760 it was surprised by a French
                    squadron under Commodore Thourot, who landed with about 1000 men, and, after
                    holding the place for a few days, evacuated it on the approach of the English
                    troops. Eighteen years later Paul Jones, in his ship the “Ranger,” succeeded in
                    capturing the “Drake,” a British slocp-of-war, in the neighbouring bay; but he
                    left without molesting the town.</p>
