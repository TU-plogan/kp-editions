                    in Whitehall ChapeL He was removed in 1687 on the chance of election into
                    Winchester College. Caius Cibber, however, had not then presented that
                    institution with his statue of William of Wykeham, and his son’s claim was
                    ignored. The boy went to London, and amused himself with the theatre, for which
                    he had a passion. It was presently decided, on his own recommendation, that he
                    should not return to school, but that he should go straight to Cambridge, for
                    certain colleges in which university the sculptor was then executing
                    commissions; meantime he was invited to Chatsworth, the seat of his father’s
                    patron. On his way thither, the Revolution broke out, and father and son met at
                    Nottingham, where Colley Cibber was received, at the instance and in the place
                    of Cains Cibber, into Devonshire’s company of volunteers. He served in the
                    bloodless campaign that resulted in the coronation of the Prince of Orange, and
                    on its conclusion, at his father’s request, presented a Latin petition to the
                    earl—afterwards duke—imploring his interest and protection. By that nobleman’s
                    desire the young man returned to London, and ere long his craze for things
                    histrionic enrolled him in Betterton’s grand company of actors. After playing
                    “full three quarters of a year” without salary, as was then the custom of all
                    apprentice actors, he began to be paid ten shillings a week. His rendering of
                    the little part of the chaplain in Otway’s <hi rend="italic">Orphan,</hi>
                    procured him a rise of five shillings; and a subsequent impersonation, on an
                    emergency, and at the author’s request, of Lord Touchwood in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Double Dealer,</hi> advanced him, on Congreve’s recommendation, to
                    a pound a week. On this he contrived to live with his wife and family, and to
                    produce a play— <hi rend="italic">Lords Last Shift.</hi> Of this comedy, highly
                    praised by Southern and Dorset, Congreve said that it “had only a great many
                    things that were like wit in it;” Vanbrugh honoured it by writing his excellent
                    <hi rend="italic">Relapse</hi> as a sequel. In 1697 Cibber was included by
                    Collier among the reprehensible in the famous <hi rend="italic">Short View.</hi>
                    In 1704 he brought out, for himself and Mrs Oldfield, his best play, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Careless Husband,</hi> the most striking scene in which is said to
                    have been suggested by an episode in the life of the notorious Mrs Brett (better
                    known as the Countess Macclesfield) to whom the MS. had keen submitted. In 1711,
                    with Collier, Wilks, and Dogget, he became a patentee of Drury Lane theatre,
                    where, in 1712, Addison’s <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> was produced under his
                    management. In 1715, on the occasion of the Rebellion, Cibber adapted the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nonjuror</hi> from Molière’s <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe;</hi> the
                    play, a mere <hi rend="italic">pièce de circonstance,</hi> ran eighteen nights,
                    and the author received from George I,, to whom it was dedicated, a present of
                    two hundred guineas. In 1726 he pleaded the cause of the patentees against Sir
                    Richard Steele (who had succeeded Collier as manager of Drury Lane) be <pb

                    case. In 1730 Mrs Oldfield died, and her loss was followed in 1731 by that of
                    Wilks; Cibber, who had been named laureate on the death of Eusden, sold his
                    share in the theatre, and retired from the stage, and only appeared thereafter
                    on rare occasions. In 1742 occurred the quarrel with Pope, which resulted in the
                    exclusion of Theobald and the elevation of Cibber as the hero of the <hi
                    rend="italic">D&gt;ιntiad.</hi> At seventy-four he appeared on the stage for
                    thedast time as Panulph in his own poor tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Papal
                    Tyranny.</hi> His conversation (of which Johnson said that “taking from it all
                    that he ought not to have said, he was a poor creature ”) was agreeable to the
                    last, and he died as full of worldly honours as of years.</p>
                <p>Cibber’s reputation has suffered greatly from the acrid censure of Pope and the
                    rough scorn of Johnson. There can be no doubt that he was by no means an
                    unamiable character, and that he was deficient neither in wit, sense, tact, nor
                    feeling. The little passages of dramatic criticism and reflection scattered
                    through his <hi rend="italic">Apology,</hi> while they prove his extreme
                    perspicuity and excellence of experience, are perhaps the most delicate and
                    subtle of their kind in the literature of his time; while the fact that his
                    version of <hi rend="italic">Ridιard III.</hi> should have kept the stage for a
                    century is of itself no mean proof that his scenic sagacity and instinct were
                    remarkable. As a dramatist, he has neither the broad humour and strong comic
                    vein of Vanbrugh, nor the fine English and the masterfulness of Congreve, nor
                    the frolicsome gaiety and airy fancy of Farquhar. His characters are flat; his
                    plots are neither natural nor well conducted; his dialogue is often flippant. He
                    attempted, moreover, to extract a highly moral end from his sympathetic studies
                    of social weakness and impurity, and the result (particularly in his
                    continuation of Vanbrugh’s unfinished <hi rend="italic">Journey to London)</hi>
                    is not happy. His <hi rend="italic">Odes,</hi> the subject of several of
                    Johnson’s keenest pleasantries, are wretched. His best work is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Apology for his Life,</hi> a book which the same critic declared
                    to be a standing proof that any man might do well who was able and willing to
                    keep to his own ground.</p>
