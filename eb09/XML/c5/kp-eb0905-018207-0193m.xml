                    connect the town with all parts of Germany. The streets of the old town are
                    narrow and crooked, but those of the upper and lower new town, and the three
                    suburbs, are not surpassed by any in Germany. The principal streets are the
                    Königsstrasse (5100 feet long and 60 broad), the Bellevue-Strasse, and the
                    Friedrich Wilhelm Strasse (180 feet broad with four rows of linden trees). The
                    Friedrich’s Platz is the largest square in Germany, being 1000 by 450 feet. It
                    contains a marble statue of Landgrave Frederick IL, and commands a fine view
                    from the open side. The former residence of the electors fronts this square, as
                    well as the Museum, considered the finest building in the town. This museum
                    contains various valuable collections of curiosities, interesting mosaics, a
                    library of 100,000 volumes and valuable manuscripts. In the cabinet of
                    curiosities there is a complete collection of clocks and watches (including the
                    so-called Egg of Nuremberg), from the earliest to the present time. Among other
                    public places and buildings worthy of notice are the Roman Catholic church, with
                    a splendid interior; the Military School; the Königs Platz, with a remarkable
                    echo; the Karl’s Platz, with the statue of Landgrave Charles; the Martin’s
                    Platz, with a large church containing the burial-vaults of the Hessian
                    princes.</p>
                <p>The Gallery of Paintings in the Bellevue Castle has attracted of late many
                    visitors to Cassel, as it contains numerous <hi rend="italic">chefs d'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">oeuvre,</hi> the most of which, before 1866, were not accessible
                    to the public. Among these are fine specimens of Holbein, Cranach, Dürer,
                    Rembrandt, Vandyck, Rubens, Mabuse, Teniers, Metzu, Wouvermann, P. Potter,
                    Ruysdael, Titian, Guido Reni, C. Dolce, the Caraccis, Veronese, Murillo, and
                    many other eminent painters. The town contains numerous educational
                    institutions, including a polytechnic school, an academy of the fine arts, a
                    lyceum, and a military academy. The descendants of the French refugees who
                    founded the upper new town have a church of their own and a hospital, and the
                    Jews, a very handsome synagogue. Music is much cultivated and there is a good
                    opera with a first-rate orchestra, of which Louis Spohr was at one time
                    conductor. The opera house or theatre was built by Jerome Napoleon. Trade has
                    very much increased of late, and among the manufactures are steam engines and
                    locomotives, articles in silver and gold, philosophical instruments, tobacco,
                    sugar, cotton and linen cloths, hats, leather, carriages, porcelain, soap, and
                    chemicals. There are also several breweries; and two fairs are held annually.
                    The celebrated chemists Bunsen and Kolbe are natives of Cassel. In the vicinity
                    of the town are the Orangerie Chateau, and the Auegarten, a favourite promenade,
                    with a marble bath.</p>
                <p>On a slope of the Habichtswald Mountains, three miles from Cassel, and approached
                    by an avenue, is the famous summer palace (with park and forest) of
                    Wilhelmsböhe, sometimes called the Versailles of Germany. Napoleon III. resided
                    here after the battle of Sedan. The surrounding gardens are beautifully adorned
                    with fountains, cascades, lakes, and grottoes, the principal fountain sending up
                    a jet of water 180 feet high and 12 feet in diameter. Here also is an
                    interesting building called the Loewenburg, erected a century ago in the style
                    of a fortified castle, and containing among other things portraits of the Tudors
                    and Stuarts. The principal curiosity is the Karlsburg cascade, which is placed
                    in a sort of broad ravine, thickly wooded on both sides. A staircase of 900
                    steps leads to the top. On one of the landings is a huge rudely-carved stone
                    figure of the giant Enceladus, and at the top is an octagon building called the
                    Riesenschloss, surmounted by a colossal copper figure of the Farnese Hercules,
                    31 feet high, whose club alone is sufficiently capacious to accommodate from
                    eight to ten persons. In different parts of the park, and especially from the
                    Octagon, charming views are obtained. The park was first formed by Landgrave
                    Frederick II. (whose consort was Mary, daughter of George II. of England), and
                    was finished by his successor, after whom it was named, and who is said to have
                    employed 2000 workmen for fourteen years in its construction</p>
                <p>Perhaps the earliest mention of Cassel occurs in a document of the year 913, when
                    the name appears in the form of Chassala. The town was fortified by the
                    Landgrave Philip the Magnanimous in the 16th century; and in 1687 it was
                    augmented by the formation of the Upper New Town by the Landgrave Charles. In
                    1762 it was captured by Frederick of Brunswick, after an obstinate siege, during
                    which it had been defended by the French under Diesbach; and not long after its
                    fortifications were dismantled. In 1807 it became the capital of the kingdom of
                    Westphalia; in 1813 it was bombarded and captured by the Russian general
                    Chemicheff; in 1830, 1831, and 1848 it was the scene of violent commotions; from
                    1850 to 1851 it was occupied by the Prussians, the Bavarians, and the Austrians;
                    and in 1866 it passed definitively into the possession of Prussia. Of late it
                    has become a very thriving town, and is now a very favourite residence for
                    strangers. Population (1875), 50,000.</p>
