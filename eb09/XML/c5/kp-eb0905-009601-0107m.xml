                    of its use. This uncertainty is easily explained by the fact that both the thing
                    and the name were at no time appointed and created, but grew up by successive
                    and mainly abusive encroachments legitimatized by usance, and from time to time
                    more formally by Papal briefs and bulls. There can be little doubt that the word
                    was originally applied to priests in the same sense in which it was and is
                    applied to other things, as synonymous with “principal,” that on which a thing

                    article on Anastasius, the Roman librarian (Ncr. <hi rend="italic">Eccl.,</hi>
                    vol. ii. p. 56, col. ii.) quotes the words of Pope Leo (about 848) respecting

                    have been put forward,—as that the priests so termed attended the pontiff when
                    celebrating mass, standing at the corners <hi rend="italic">(cardines)</hi> of
                    the altar, that cardinal priests were those refugees from persecution <hi

                    clerical body of churches more happily circumstanced, and some others—maybe
                    deemed the fanciful inventions of later writers in search of originality. What
                    priests those were, who in fact or by privilege used this title in the earliest
                    ages of the church, is a much larger and more debatable question, on which
                    scores of volumes have been written. If, however, a guide is to be chosen, no
                    safer can be found than Bingham,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Eccl. Antiq.,</hi> bk. ii. ch. 19, sec.
                    18.</p></note> who says, when pointing out that archpresbyters were by no means
                    the same thing as cardinal presbyters, that the use of the term cardinal cannot
                    be found in any genuine writer before the time of Gregory the Great (+ 604).
                    For, says he, the Roman Council, on which alone Bellarmine relies to prove the
                    word to have had a greater antiquity, is a mere figment. For the authorities for
                    an earlier use of the term, such as they are, the reader may consult Gaetano
                    Moroni’s <hi rend="italic">Dizιonario</hi> at the word Cardinal. As regards the
                    term “genuine” in Bingham’s statement, it may be mentioned that both Baronins
                    and Bellarmine regard the council said to have been held at Rome by Sylvester I.
                    in 324 as genuine. Van Espen, on the other hand, considers it to be apocryphal.
                    Further, in alluding to the origin of the name, Bingham notices the opinion of
                    Bellarmine that the word was first applied to certain principal churches, and
                    remarks that others have supposed that those among the priests in populous
                    cities who were chosen from among the rest to be a council for the bishop were
                    first called cardinals. And Stillingfleet<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Irenicon,</hi> pt. ii. ch. 6.</p></note>
                    says,—“When afterwards these titles<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Z.e., those principal incumbencies which from the earliest
                    ages of the Church of Rome had been so called,—a use of the word of which a
                    curious survival may be traced in the common phrase “a title to holy
                    orders.”</p></note> were much increased, those presbyters that were placed in
                    the ancient titles, which were the chief among them, were called Cardinales
                    Presbyteri, which were looked on as the chief of the clergy, and therefore were
                    the chief members of the council of presbyters to the bishop.” Stillingfleet
                    appears, however, to have been think ing exclusively of Rome. Various other
                    churches in France, Italy, Germany, and Spain—as Bourges, Metz, Ravenna, Fermo,
                    Salerno, Naples, Cologne, Compostella, &amp;c.,—claimed the title of cardinal
                    for their canons as by privilege, in most cases probably usurped and not
                    granted. But the name appears gradually to have been understood to appertain
                    only to those whom the pope specially created cardinals. And at last, in 1567,
                    Pope Pius V. definitively decreed that none should assume the title of cardinal
                    save those created such by the Roman pontiff, and the word from that time to
                    this has been exclusively so applied.</p>
                <p>If the origin and early use of the term cardinal is obscure, the institution of a
                    collegiate body consisting of cardinals and of none other is yet more so. There
                    seem to be traces of such a conception in the life of Leo III. (+ 816) written
                    by Anastasius the librarian. And Moroni cites many passages from various authors
                    and documents between the above date and 1100, with a view of showing that, at
                    all events, by the end of that time the body of cardinals was recognized as a
                    collegiate corporation. But his citations seem to prove rather the reverse. Nor
                    do wo reach solid ground in this respect till we come to the bull
                    “Postquam”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, however,
                    Cave, <hi rend="italic">Script. Eccl. Hist. Lit.,</hi> vol. ii. p. 124, who says

                    >(asciti</hi><hi rend="italic">sunt),</hi> in an Apostolic College.</p></note>
                    of Sixtus V. (3d December 1585) which finally regulates the composition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sagro</hi><hi rend="italic">Collegio.</hi> By this instrument
                    seventy is fixed as the maximum number of the sacred college “after the example
                    of tho seventy elders appointed by God as counsellors of Moses.” Nor has the
                    number ever been exceeded since that time, though it is expressly laid down by
                    the authorities on the subject, that no canonical disability exists to prevent
                    the pope from exceeding that number should he see fit to do so. By the same bull
                    “Postquam,” it is also provided that the seventy of the Sacred College should
                    consist of six cardinal bishops, fifty cardinal priests, and fourteen cardinal
                    deacons. The six cardinal bishops are the bishops of the sees lying immediately
                    around Rome. The fifty cardinal priests take their “titles” from the principal
                    churches in Rome, but are many of them bishops or archbishops of distant sees,
                    and four must be by regulation members (usually the “generals ”) of the monastic
                    orders. The fourteen deacons take their titles from the “deaconries” established
                    in the earliest ages of the Church for the assistance and protection of the
                    widows and orphans of the faithful. It may be added here that Sixtus V., by the
                    above-mentioned bull, decrees that if any person created a cardinal be not in
                    deacon’s orders, he must receive them within the year. But “dispensations,” by
                    virtue of which the dignity has been held for many years by men not even in
                    deacons’ orders, have been common. If any cardinal should be in such a position
                    at the time of the Pope’s death, he cannot enter conclave or participate in the
                    election, unless by immediately qualifying himself by taking orders.</p>
                <p>As the institution of cardinals was entirely arbitrary and an abuse, so, despite
                    the shadow of an attempt to find or make a <hi rend="italic">raison d'etre</hi>
                    for their existence in the assignment of such dignities to certain special sees

                    very soon became purely nominal and formal; and everything connected with the
                    selection of them depended wholly on the will of the pontiff. Not so, as will be
                    seen presently, their prerogatives when they had been created. And the limits,
                    which might be supposed to have bounded the field from which the Pope could
                    select the objects of his favour, became constantly enlarged. A few only of the
                    many instances of creations illustrating this fact which are on record can be
                    here mentioned. Clement VI., in 1348, created his nephew Peter Roger cardinal
                    when he was seventeen. Sixtus IV., in 1477, created John of Aragon cardinal at
                    the age of fourteen, and at the same time his nephew Raffaelle Riario who was
                    seventeen. Innocent VIII. (f 1492) created Giovanni de’ Medici, afterwards Leo
                    X., cardinal at fourteen, his eminence having been Apostolic Protonotary ever
                    since he was seven! Ippolite d’Este had been an archbishop for the last nine
                    years, when Alexander VL created him cardinal in his seventeenth year. Alfred of
                    Portugal was made cardinal by Leo X. when he was seven years old, on condition,
                    however, that he should not assume the outward insignia of the dignity till he
                    should be fourteen. The same pontiff made John of Lorraine cardinal at twenty,
                    Alexander VL having previously made him coadjutor of the bishop of Metz at four
                    years old. Clement VII. made Odet di Cohgny cardinal at twelve. Paul IIL Farnese
                    (t 1549), created his nephew Alexander Farnese cardinal at fourteen; his
                    grandson Guido Ascanio Sforza, the son of his daughter Costanza, at sixteen; his
                    cousin Niccolò Gaetani at twelve; his relative Giulio Feltre della Rovere, at
                    eleven; and a second grandson, Ranuccio Farnese, at fifteen, having made him
                    archbishop of Naples the year before. Paul also created Charles of Lorraine,
                    brother of Mary Queen of Scots, cardinal at twenty-two, although he had a
                    brother in the Sacred College at the time, which is contrary to the
                    constitutions and the decree of one of the Pope s predecessors. But this is only
                    one out of a hundred facts which demonstrate the futility of the attempt to bind
                    the hands of one infallible autocrat by the rules enacted by his predecessors.
                    Sixtus V. (t 1590), a great reformer of abuses, made his nephew Alexander
                    Peretti cardinal at fourteen. Paul V. (+ 1621) created Maurice of Savoy cardinal
                    at fourteen, Carlo de’ Medici at nineteen, and Ferdinand of Austria at ten.
                    Clement XII. (+ 1740) made Luigi di Borbone archbishop of Toledo and cardinal at
                    the age of eight. And, lastly, Pius VII. (+ 1823) created a second Luigi di
                    Borbone, the son of the above-mentioned archbishop of Toledo, cardinal at
                    twenty-three. The list of such creations might be much extended. Previously to
                    the publication of the bull “Postquam” by Sixtus V. the number of the Sacred
                    College was extremely variable. John XXII., requested in 1331 to make two French
                    cardinals, replied that there were only twenty cardinals’ hats, that seventeen
                    of these were already French, and that he could, therefore, only make one more.
                    At the death of Clement VI. (1352) the cardinals determined that their number
                    should not exceed twenty. Urban VI. (+ 1389) created a great number; and we find
                    the college making representations to Pius II. (t 1464) to the effect that the
                    dignity of the purple was diminished by such excess. Sixtus IV. (+ 1484),
                    however, multiplied the number of his creations to an unexampled extent; and
                    Alexander VL (+ 1503) exceeded him. Leo X. created thirty-one cardinals at one
                    batch, leaving at his death sixty-five, a number unprecedented up to that time.
                    Paul III., however, created seventy-one. But Paul IV. (+ 1559) issued the bull
                    called “Compactum,” by which it was decreed that the number of cardinals should
                    never exceed forty. His immediate successor, however, Pius IV. (+ 1565) raised
                    the number to forty-six In 1590 came the final settlement at seventy by Sixtus
                    V., as has been said.</p>
                <p>Many volumes have been written on the different forms used by the popes in the
                    creation of cardinals in different ages, and many more still larger treatises
                    <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">professo</hi> on the strictly
                    ecclesiastical, as well as what may be more properly called the social, portions
                    of the accustomed ceremonial. But it must suffice here to characterize very
                    generally the differences which have prevailed from age to age in the first
                    respect, and to say but a few words on the second head.</p>
                <p>The general tendency of the changes which have taken place in the methods used
                    for the creation of cardinals may be very shortly stated. They have been such as
                    indicate the steadily increasing absolutism of the pontiffs. A proclamation to
                    the congregation including an invitation to any person to state any ground of
                    objection known to him soon gave place to a real consultation of the college by
                    the Pope, and a real assent on the part of the cardinals to the proposed new
                    nominations, which in its turn dwindled off at a very early period to a mere
                    form of asking and receiving consent. In the earlier centuries the creations
                    almost always took place on the first Wednesday of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quattro</hi><hi rend="italic">Tempora,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The <hi rend="italic">Quattro</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    commenced.</p></note> and generally in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.
                    There, after the <hi rend="italic">Introit</hi> and collect of the Mass had been
                    said, a reader ascended the pulpit and proclaimed the intended creation of such
                    and such persons, ending with an invitation precisely similar to that used in
                    our churches in the publication of banns of marriage, and a real inquiry
                    followed the statement of any objector. At a later period the Pope asked of the
                    cardinals assembled in secret consistory whether in their opinion there should
                    be a creation of cardinals, and of how many? And a deputation was sent to the
                    residence of any cardinals who might be ill to bring back their replies to the
                    same questions. Then, satisfactory answers having been obtained from at least
                    the majority, the Pope said <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Portetur
                    nuda</hi><hi rend="italic">cathedra.”</hi> The chair was brought, and placed at
                    his right hand. Thereupon all the cardinals rose, and stood ranged against the
                    wall at a distance out of earshot of the Papal throne. The dean of the Sacred
                    College placed himself in the empty chair, and the Pope told him in a low voice
                    whom he purposed to create, adding <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Quid</hi><hi rend="italic">vobis videtur</hi><hi rend="italic">ì”</hi> One by
                    one all present were similarly interrogated, and then the Pope said aloud, “<hi
                    rend="italic">Deo</hi><hi rend="italic">gratias habemus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">personis creandis concordiam omnium fratrum?</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">“quasi omnium,”</hi> or <hi rend="italic">“majoris
                    partis,”</hi> as the case might be. And then the pontiff at once proclaimed the
                    new dignitaries :—“<hi rend="italic">Auctoritate</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dei</hi><hi rend="italic">Omnipotentis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sanctorum</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">Patris,</hi><hi rend="italic">dec., Amen,”</hi> and the consistory
                    was at an end.</p>
                <p>In later times the proclamation having been made in consistory by the simple
                    announcement, “<hi rend="italic">Habemτιs</hi><hi rend="italic">fratres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">”</hi> so and so, the act of conferring the dignity with its
                    insignia on the new recipients was performed at the Papal palace, and was
                    accompanied by a mass of minutely ordered ceremonial which rendered it one of
                    the most pompous and gorgeous scenic performances of the Roman Church and court.
                    It would need many pages to describe the form and order of the ceremony, the
                    intricacies of which no one was ever expected to remember or understand save the
                    professional masters of the ceremonies, whose business it is to have mastered
                    the science. And a description of it <pb break="no"

                    amazement at the overgrown mass of frivolity which the constant tendency to
                    extinguish significance under heaps of material forms and show, has led the old
                    men who compose the Roman court to accumulate.</p>
                <p>The social portion, as it may be called, of the ceremonial attendant on the
                    creation of a cardinal, in which the city and all the inhabitants are concerned,
                    is as pompous, and as much regulated by a whole code of traditional uses and
                    customs, as the more pu rely ecclesiastical part of the business. The making of
                    presents and payment of fees to persons of all sorts of conditions, from the
                    high and reverend officials of the Curia to the cardinal’s lackeys, makes a
                    great part of it. And the amount of all these payments is minutely regulated.

                    stationed before the residences of the foreign ministers. The new cardinal opens
                    his palace for a great full-dress reception, where all who have a decent coat,
                    and specially all strangers, are welcomed. These are great and noted occasions
                    for the display of the diamonds and toilettes of the Roman patrician ladies.</p>
                <p>Before quitting the subject of the method of creating cardinals, the custom of
                    reserving cardinals “<hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Pector</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e”</hi> must be briefly noticed. Various causes occasionally arose
                    to lead a pontiff to deem it undesirable to declare to the world the person whom
                    it was his purpose to create a cardinal. Martin V. (+ 1431) was the first who
                    thus secretly created cardinals. But the practice then and subsequently differed
                    essentially from that which the ever-increasing despotism of the popes brought
                    it to under Paul III. and thenceforward. Martin and his successors, till Paul
                    III. took the members of the college into their confidence, only strictly
                    enjoining them not to divulge the fact that such and such persons were in fact
                    cardinals. He died leaving four cardinals thus unpublished, having taken the
                    oaths of the other cardinals that they would in case of his death recognize
                    them. Notwithstanding their oaths, however, they refused when the Pope died to
                    do so. And the popes have never been able to secure the admission to the college
                    of those whose creation has been left by their deaths in this inchoate state.
                    Sometimes the college has recognized them, and admitted them to the conclave;
                    sometimes the succeeding Pope has re-created them out of respect for the wishes
                    of his predecessor. Sometimes they have altogether lost the promotion intended
                    for them. The change which Paul III. introduced consisted in confining the
                    secret of the unpublished nominations to his own breast, keeping it “<hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">pectore.”</hi> His practice was, and that
                    of his successors has been, to add to the form of proclamation in consistory,
                    <hi rend="italic">“Alios duos</hi> (or more or less) <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">pectore reservamus arbitrio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nostro quandοcumgue</hi><hi rend="italic">declarandosP</hi></p>
                <p>Before quitting the subject of ceremonial, a word or two may be said of the
                    singular practice of closing and subsequently opening the mouth of a newly
                    created cardinal. Like almost everything else connected with the subject this
                    form had once a real significance, but has become a mere meaningless formality.
                    Some reasonable time was originaUy allowed to elapse before the pontiff in one
                    consistory formally pronounced the mouth to be opened which he had declared to
                    be closed in a previous consistory. Now the form of opening is pronounced within
                    a few minutes of the form of closing. As may be readily understood the cardinal
                    whose mouth was closed could not speak or vote in any assembly of the cardinals,
                    but on!y hear. When it has occurred that a cardinal has been left at the death
                    of a Pope with closed mouth, the college have usually empowered one of their
                    number to open the mouth of the cardinal so circumstanced. But it is a great
                    mistake to suppose, as many have imagined, that a cardinal, whose mouth remained
                    closed, was ineligible to the Papal throne. For not only any such cardinal, but
                    any person whatever, clerk or lay, not being an avowed heretic, and not
                    labouring under any canonical impediment to holy orders, is perfectly eligible
                    as pope.</p>
                <p>The chief of the insignia of a cardinal’s dignity is the scarlet hat,—the
                    original significance of which was, we are told, to remind the wearer that he
                    was to be at all times ready to shed his blood in martyrdom for the faith. At an
                    early period it became, and has since continued to be, a huge unwearable
                    construction of silk and hanging tassels, such as may be seen suspended from the
                    roofs of cathedrals over the tombs of cardinals. So much is the hat the main
                    mark of a cardinal’s dignity, that “to receive the hat” is in common parlance
                    equivalent to being made a cardinal. The canonical vestments of a cardinal are
                    scarlet,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Save in the
                    case of memhers of the monastic orders, whose dress, similar in form to the
                    others, is in colour that enjoined by their special rule.</p></note> and in the
                    cityand in their homes the hems and such like of their coats, and also their
                    stockings, are of the same colour,—in Italian parlance “purple.” Hence, “to
                    aspire to'the purple,” “to receive the purple,” is also equivalent to being a
                    candidate for or being made a cardinal. Their Eminences also wear a scarlet
                    “beretta,” a four-cornered cap of the shape well known in pictures and
                    engravings, and a scarlet “berettina,” or skull-cap. Until the time of Urban
                    VIII. the cardinals were styled “Illustrissimi;” but that pope decreed that they
                    should for the future be called “Emi-nentissimi,” and addressed as “your
                    Eminence.”</p>
                <p>It remains to add a few words on the privilege of a cardinal as an elector of the
                    pontiff; and though the subject is a large one, a very few words will suffice,
                    because the treatment of it falls more properly and conveniently under other
                    headings. In perfect consistency with every other portion of the history of the
                    institution, the right and privilege of the cardinals to elect the Pope is an
                    abuse, and has been attained by a long series of encroachments which have
                    gradually eliminated the originally democratic constitution of the Church. The
                    popes were at first chosen by the whole body of the faithful; then by the whole
                    body of the clergy; then by the cardinals with the consent of the clergy, and,
                    ultimately, absolutely and exclusively by the cardinals. That the mode of
                    election has passed through these phases is certain; but the chronological
                    details of the changes are extremely obscure. The methods pursued in the
                    election belong to another place. And this article may be concluded by a
                    statement of the fact, often misapprehended, that the right of a cardinal to
                    enter conclave with his brethren and vote for the new Pope is indefeasible; and
                    he is not to be deprived of it by any declaration of the late Pope or deposition
                    by him, or by any amount of unworthiness, however patent. Cases are on record in
                    which popes have sought by every means in their power to prevent certain
                    cardinals from taking part in the election that would follow their death, and
                    some in which monstrous crimes have rendered such exclusion reasonable and right
                    in every point of view. But in every such case the college has overruled the
                    provisions of the deceased pontiff, and admitted the acknowledged member of
                    their body to take part in the election. (τ. <hi rend="smallcaps">a.
