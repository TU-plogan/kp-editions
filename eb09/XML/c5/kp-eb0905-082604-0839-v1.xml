                <p><label type="entry">CLERGY</label>, a collective term signifying the body of
                    “clerks,” that is, in English, men in holy orders. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Clericus,</hi> however, has, both itself and its equivalents in the
                    languages of the Catholic countries of the Continent, a wider ecclesiastical
                    signification; while in England a use of the word, originally abusive, but now
                    so entirely accepted as to constitute a proper secondary meaning of the term,
                    comprises in the class of persons signified by it all those employed in duties
                    the discharge of which demands the acquirements of reading and writing, which
                    were originally supposed to be the exclusive qualification of the clergy.</p>
                <p>The word is derived from the Greek <hi rend="italic">κλήρος,</hi> which signifies
                    a lot; but the authorities are by no means agreed in which sense the root is
                    connected with the sense of the derivative, some conceiving that the original
                    idea was that the clergy received the service of God as their lot or portion;
                    others that they were the portion of the Lord; and others again, with, as
                    Bingham <hi rend="italic">(Orig. Eccl.,</hi> lib. i. cap. 5, sec. 9) seems to
                    think, more reason, maintain that the word has reference to the choosing by lot,
                    as was the case in early ages, of those to whom public offices were to be
                    entrusted.</p>

                <p>In the primitive times of the church the term canon was used as synonymous with
                    clerk, from the names of all the persons in the service of any church having
                    been inscribed on a roll or <hi rend="italic">κανών,</hi> whence they were
                    termed <hi rend="italic">canonici,</hi> a fact which shows that the practice of
                    the Roman Catholic Church in modern times of including all persons of all ranks
                    in the service of the church, ordained or unordained, in the term clerks, or
                    clergy, is at least in conformity with the practice of antiquity. The Roman
                    hierarchy now reckons four grades of clerks :—1st, those who are merely tonsured
                    as a sign of the ecclesiastical destination, but have received no orders of any
                    kind; 2d, those who have received any of the four minor orders, as <hi
                        rend="italic">hostiarii,</hi> readers, exorcists, or acolytes; 3d, those who
                    have received orders as subdeacons, deacons, or priests; 4th, those who have
                    been consecrated to bishoprics, archbishoprics, or other of the higher dignities
                    of the church. Monks, whether eremitic or coenobite, have not at any time formed
                    as such any part of the body of the clergy. But it would seem that in the
                    earliest ages of the church they were not deemed even eligible to the
                    priesthood, inasmuch as it is said that St Siricius, who became Pope in the year
                    384, first permitted them to receive priests’ orders. And we read in the
                    epistles of St Ambrose that monks began to be ordained priests towards the end
                    of the 4th century,—St Athanasius having been the first who ordained monks to
                    the church of Alexandria, in which course he was imitated in the West by St
                    Eusebius, bishop of Vercelli.</p>
                <p>At a very early period the church began to find the necessity of taking measures
                    to stem the evil arising from the numbers of persons who embraced an
                    ecclesiastical career from improper motives, and often without any intention of
                    performing any of the duties of it. Of course the same evil has vexed the church
                    in every age. From the first moment in which she became rich, worldly men were,
                    and have alway been, found eager to share her riches without sharing her work.
                    But in the early times, even while she was poor, the state of society was such
                    that many unworthy motives operated to induce men who neither had nor fancied
                    themselves to have any call to the priesthood, to seek its immunities. Not only
                    was an ecclesiastical career the only one which offered to the studious or the
                    lazy man any hopes of a tranquil life, and to the un warlike immunity from the
                    necessity of fighting, but it offered very solid and valuable privileges in the
                    shape of specialities of jurisdiction both in civil and criminal causes, and in
                    exemption from taxes. There is a very early decree of a congregation of bishops,
                    ordering that no more persons shall be ordained than are needed for the service
                    of each church. And the germ of a politico-economical idea may be observed in
                    the reason given for the prohibition, which one would hardly have expected to
                    find at that period, and which both ecclesiastical and civil rulers altogether
                    lost sight of at a later time. Clerks, it was decreed, should not be
                    unnecessarily multiplied to the prejudice of the poorer laity. Casuists of a
                    later age have pronounced it to be sinful to receive first orders, without the
                    intention of proceeding to take full orders. Gregory the Great likens those who
                    entered the ecclesiastical state merely for the sake of a benefice to the crowds
                    who followed the Saviour only because He multiplied the miraculous loaves. The
                    Council of Trent also at its twenty-fourth sitting, chap. 4, directs the refusal
                    of ordination to those who may with probability be supposed to desire it for
                    other than godly reasons.</p>
                <p>Soldiers, slaves, comedians, tax-gatherers, those who had been married twice, and
                    all persons exercising a mean and servile occupation could not be ordained. To
                    which classes Bingham, particularizing more accurately, adds <hi rend="italic"
                        >(0τig. Eccl.,</hi> lib. 4) :—“No stranger from another diocese, unless by
                    letters dismissory; no one who has performed public penance; no homicide,
                    adulterer, or who had in time of persecution denied the faith; no usurer; no one
                    who had mutilated any of his members; no one who had been baptized only by a
                    medical attendant, or by a heretic, or whose baptism was in any wise irregular;
                    no one belonging to any guild of artificers; no legal official of the Roman
                    court; no guardian of a ward, as long as that office lasted; none who had ever
                    suffered from insanity or diabolic possession; to which certain other canonical
                    impediments might be added.”</p>
                <p>Bingham <hi rend="italic">(0rig.,</hi> lib. 2. cap. 6. sec. 4) says that in some
                    churches the clergy lived in common. Moroni says (article “Clero,” <hi
                        rend="italic">Did. Eccles.)</hi> that in the 4th and following centuries it
                    is certain that almost everywhere the clergy adopted the practice of living in
                    common. The first assertion seems to be somewhat too narrow in its scope, the
                    second too wide. It is certain that the practice was more common than seems to
                    be indicated by the phrase, “in some churches ;” but the instance which Moroni
                    gives in support of his assertion seems to show that the practice was far from
                    universal. We read in a chronicle of the church of Augsburg, that in the time of
                    Constantine, when a church was dedicated to St Afra, “clerks were established
                    there living in common, according to the apostolic rule.” Of the church of
                    Rino-cotura in Mauritania, Sozomen tells us that the clerks there had “their
                    dwelling, their table, all things, in short, in common.” The venerable Bede says
                    that Gregory I. ordered that the same rule should be observed in England.
                    Eusebius, bishop of Vercelli, is praised by St Ambrose for restoring the
                    practice in question in his church. Leo IX. ordered that cloisters should be
                    established in connection with the churches in order that the clergy might live
                    in common. Hence divers churches were anciently called monasteries, and in a
                    history of the church of Besançon it is stated “that nothing is more common in
                    ancient writings than to find any church called a monastery.”</p>
                <p>The immunities enjoyed by clerks of course differed largely at different times
                    and in different countries, the extent of them having been gradually curtailed
                    from a period a little earlier than the close of the Middle Ages. They consisted
                    mainly in exemption from public burdens, both as regarded person and pocket, and
                    in immunity from lay jurisdiction. This last enormous privilege, which became
                    one of the main and most efficient instruments of the subjection of Europe to
                    clerical tyranny, extended to matters both civil and criminal; though, as
                    Bingham shows, it did not (always and everywhere) prevail in cases of heinous
                    crime. The reader will find the whole subject lucidly set forth in the 5th book
                    of Bingham’s work.</p>
                <p>This diversity of jurisdiction, and subjection of the clergy only to the
                    sentences of judges bribed by their <hi rend="italic">esprit de corps</hi> to
                    judge leniently, led to the adoption of a scale of punishments for the offences
                    of clerks avowedly much lighter than that which was inflicted for the same
                    crimes on laymen. This part of the subject will be found fully elucidated in the
                    1st chapter of Bingham’s 17th book; in the remaining chapter of which the penal
                    portion of the canon law as regarding clerks is succinctly treated. (τ. <hi
