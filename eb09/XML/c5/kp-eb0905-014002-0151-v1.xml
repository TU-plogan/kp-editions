                <p><label type="entry">CARTAGENA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Carthagena</hi></label>, a
                    seaport town on the northern coast of South America, in the United States of
                    Colombia, in 10° 25' 48" lat. and 75° 34' W. long. It is situated on a low sandy
                    island, which, with the island south of it, Tierra Bomba, forms the harbour of
                    Cartagena. To the east of the town, and connected with it and the mainland by
                    bridges, is the suburb of Xiximani, on another island. The houses of Cartagena
                    are of stone, with lattices and balconies of wood, and are regularly built, but
                    mostly only one story high. The streets are well-paved, but dark and narrow;
                    arrangementshave lately been made for lighting them by petroleum gas. The
                    principal buildings are the fortresses, some convents and churches, and the
                    public hospitals. The town possesses a park and a theatre. The large cisterns in
                    the walls contain a supply of excellent water. The mean temperature of Cartagena
                    is about 83° Fahr. In the summer the heat is excessive, and yellow fever often
                    commits great ravages; leprosy, also, is not unfrequent. The harbour, which is
                    second to none on the north coast of South America, covers 40,000 acres; it
                    affords complete security to ships in all weathers, and great facilities for
                    loading and unloading. It is divided into three sections, Boca Grande and
                    Pascaballos, and the Caldera, which have a depth of about 15 fathoms; and Boca
                    Chica, which is deeper. The entrance to Boca Chica <pb break="no"

                    Fernando. Its narrowness, the shallows at its mouth, and the irregularity of the
                    tides render a pilot necessary for ships passing through it. The roadstead for
                    large vessels is about three miles from the city. A chain of salt-lakes, which
                    open into the Bay of Cartagena to the S.W., and extend towards the Magdalena, in
                    a valley through which that river may at one time have flowed, was taken
                    advantage of by the Spaniards in former times for the construction of a canal.
                    Very little cutting seems to have been necessary, except at Calamar, the point
                    of junction with the river. During the War of Independence the old channel
                    became choked up; it was reopened, however, in 1846, after which the flooding of
                    the valley rendered the channel once more unnavigable, except for barges of
                    light draught. On account of the closing of the Digue, the rival port of
                    Baranguilla has been created, and a great amount of commerce has been
                    transferred to Santa Martha. The rapidly-increasing requirements of trade in
                    Colombia, and the great superiority of Cartagena as a shipping depot, cannot
                    fail, however, of securing before long the reopening of the route by the Digue.
                    The imports of Cartagena from the United Kingdom are cotton goods, linen and
                    woollen cloth, crockeryware, glass, cutlery and hardware. The exports are sugar,
                    tobacco, coffee, cotton, dividivi and dye woods, ivory-nuts, balsam of Tolu,
                    caoutchouc, cocoa-nuts and fibre, and hides. Most of the cotton is obtained from
                    wild plants, and the export is falling off year by year, as is also that of
                    caoutchouc, from the wasteful cutting down of the indiarubber trees. The
                    cultivation of sugar bids fair to succeed, for the climate and rich soil are
                    adapted for the growth of the cane. The difficulty of obtaining labour has
                    hitherto been a clog on agricultural enterprise in Cartagena. The value of
                    bullion exported from Cartagena on British account in the year ending August 31,
                    1873, was £6237. The value of the imports was £153,160; the customs revenues,
                    £41,400. There are no duties on exports. The number of vessels which entered the
                    port in 1873 was 50, tonnage 30,637. The population of Cartagena, formerly
                    estimated at 28,000, is now about 9000 only; four-fifths of these are black or
                    coloured people. The town of Cartagena is the chief naval arsenal of New
                    Granada. It was founded in 1533 by Pedro de Heredia; in 1544 it was seized by
                    the French; it was taken in 1585 by Sir Francis Drake, and in 1697 by the
                    French, who obtained from it over a million of money. In 1741 Vernon
                    unsuccessfully besieged the town. It was taken by Bolivar in 1815, and
                    surrendered to the royalists in the same year. Finally, it was captured by the
                    republicans, September 25, 1821.</p>
