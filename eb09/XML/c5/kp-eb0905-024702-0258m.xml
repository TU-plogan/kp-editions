                    received on external evidence require to be confirmed or corrected by reference
                    to allusions contained in these writings. The most important of these external
                    evidences are the statements of Jerome, in the continuation of the Eusebian <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi> under the year 87 B.c.: “Gaius Valerius Catullus,
                    scribtor lyricus Veronae nascitur,” and, under 57 B.c.: “Catullus xxx. aetatis
                    anno Romae moritur.” Questions have been raised, and variously answered, in
                    regard to the correctness both of the names assigned to the poet, and of the
                    dates of his birth and death given in these passages. Although he appears to
                    speak of himself in his poems only by the name of Catullus, there is no
                    controversy as to the Gentile name, <hi rend="italic">Valerius.</hi> Suetonius,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Julius Caesar</hi> (ch. 73), mentions the poet
                    by the names “Valerium Catullum.” Other persons who had the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cognomen</hi> Catullus belonged to the Valerian gens. Among these, the best
                    known is Μ. Valerius Catullus Messalinus, one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Delatores</hi> in the reign of Domitian, and one of the personages introduced
                    in the famous scene at the Alban Villa of the emperor, described in the fourth
                    satire of Juvenal :—</p>
                <p>“Et cum mortifero prudens Veiento Catullo.”</p>
                <p>The testimony of inscriptions shows, further, that this name was common in the
                    native province of Catullus, and belonged to other inhabitants of Verona,
                    besides the poet and his family (Schwabe, <hi rend="italic">Quaestiones
                    Catullianae,</hi> p. 27). Scholars are still divided in opinion as to whether
                    his <hi rend="italic">proenomen</hi> was <hi rend="italic">Gaius</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Quintus.</hi> In the best MSS. the volume is called simply <hi
                    rend="italic">Catulli Veronensis</hi><hi rend="italic">liber,</hi> and this is
                    the title which his English editor, Prof. Robinson Ellis, adopts. For the name
                    Gaius we have the undoubted testimony, not only of Jerome, which rests on the
                    much earlier authority of Suetonius, but also that of Apuleius. In support of
                    the second, a passage is quoted from the <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi>
                    of Pliny (xxxvii. 6, 81), where in some editions the praenomen Q. is prefixed to
                    the name. The Q. is, however, omitted in the best MSS., and in other passages of
                    the same author the poet is spoken of as “Catullus Veronensis.” The mistake is
                    supposed to have arisen from a confusion with Q. Catulus, the colleague of
                    Marius in the Cimbric War, himself also the author of lyrical poems. The only
                    other ground in favour of adopting the latter name is a conjectural emendation
                    of Scaliger in the 67th poem (line 12), where he changes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >qui te</hi> of the MSS. into “Quinte.” Though a question on which such eminent
                    scholars as Mommsen, Haupt, L. Müller, and apparently Mr Ellis, take one side,
                    while Schwabe, W. S. Teuffel, and Mr Munro <hi rend="italic">(Journal of
                    Philology,</hi> iii.) take the other, can scarcely be considered absolutely
                    settled, yet the arguments adduced by Schwabe and Mr Munro for accepting the
                    authority of Jerome and Apuleius seem difficult to answer. A more important
                    question is raised concerning the dates of the poet’s birth and death. It is
                    quite certain, from allusions contained in the poems, that the date of his death
                    given by Jerome (57 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> is wrong, and that Catullus
                    survived the second consulship of Pompey (55 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)
                    (c∕. lv. 6, cxiii. 2), and was present in</p>
                <p>August of the following year at the prosecution of Vatinius, by Licinius Calvus
                    <hi rend="italic">(cf</hi> liii.) From the allusion in lii. 3.—</p>
                <p>“Per consulatum perierat Vatinius,”</p>
                <p>it was assumed, till the appearance in 1862 of Schwabe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quaestiones Catullianae,</hi> that Catullus must have lived to witness the
                    consulship bestowed on Vatinius in the end of 47 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    This consideration induced Lachmann to fix on 77 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    instead of 87 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> as the date of the poet’s birth. It
                    has, however, been shown by Schwabe, and is now generally admitted, that the
                    line “Per consulatum,” &lt;fcc., refers to the fact that Vatinius, after being
                    praetor in 55 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was in the habit of boasting of
                    the certainty of his attaining the consulship, as Cleopatra was in the habit of
                    confirming her most solemn declarations by appealing to her hope of one day
                    administering justice in the Capitol <hi rend="italic">(cf</hi> Haupt.
                    “Quaestiones Catullianae,” contained in vol. i. of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Opuscula,</hi> 1875). We have thus certain evidence that Catullus lived till
                    the month of August 54 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> but there is no allusion
                    in his poems to any event of a later date than the prosecution of Vatinius. Some
                    of the poems (as xxxvii. and lii.) may very probably have been written during
                    his last illness. He seems to have lived just long enough to collect his works
                    together, to dedicate them to Cornelius Nepos, and to see his</p>
                <p>“lepidum novum libellum Arido modo pumice expolitum.”</p>
                <p>If he died in 54 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> or early in 53 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> there must be a further error either in the first or
                    the second of Jerome’s statements. Catullus must either have been born later
                    than 87 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> or have lived to a greater age than
                    thirty. The difficulty in regard to the first supposition is that it increases
                    the disproportion between the ages of the poet and his mistress Clodia, who must
                    have been born about 94 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But as he was supplanted
                    in her affections by a still younger man, Μ. Caelius Rufus, who appears for a
                    time to have been equally infatuated by her, and as Cicero in his defence of
                    Caelius describes her as one “quae etiam aleret <hi rend="italic"
                    >adolescentes</hi> et parsimoniam patrum suis sumptibus sustentaret” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pro M.</hi><hi rend="italic">Caelio,</hi> ch. xvi. 1), this
                    difficulty is not a serious objection to the date. Catullus is described by
                    Ovid, in true keeping with all the characteristics of his poetry, as “hedera
                    juvenilia cinctus Tempora” <hi rend="italic">(Amor.,</hi> iii. 9, 61); and this
                    description seems more applicable to a man who dies in his thirtieth year than
                    to one who dies three or four years later. Further, the age at which a man dies
                    is more likely to be accurately remembered than the particular date either of
                    his death or of his birth. The common practice of recording the ages of the
                    deceased in sepulchral inscriptions must have rendered a mistake less likely to
                    occur in that respect, than in respect of the consulship in which he was born.
                    Other instances can be given of the carelessness of Jerome in respect to dates,
                    and Mr Munro gives a probable explanation of the mistake in the confusion
                    between the first and the last of the four consulships of Cinna.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is also suggested as
                    possible by Schwabe, who, however, prefers adhering to the date 87

                    “xxx. aetatis anno” are correct, and that Catullus was born in 94 B.C., in the
                    consulship of Cn. Papirius Carbo II. and L. Cornelius Cinna IV.</p>
                <p>The statement that he was born at Verona is confirmed by passages in Ovid and
                    Martial. Pliny the elder, who was born at Como, speaks of Catullus in the
                    preface to his <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> as his “countryman” (
                    conterraneus) <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> and the poet speaks of Verona as his
                    home, or at least his temporary residence, in more than one place (Ixvii. 34,
                    lxviii. 27, XXXV. 3); and in mentioning the Transpadani <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n259/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0259-0248"/> among the other inhabitants of Italy, he adds the
                    words “ut <hi rend="italic">meos</hi> quoque attingam” (xxxviii. 13).</p>
                <p>His occasional residence in his native place is further attested by the statement
                    of Suetonius <hi rend="italic">(Julius Caesar,</hi> 73), that “Julius Caesar
                    accepted the poet’s apology for his scurrilous verses upon him, invited him to
                    dine with him on the same day, and continued his intimacy with his father as
                    before.” As this incident could only have happened during the time that Julius
                    Caesar was Proconsul, the scene of it must have been in the Cisalpine province,
                    and at the house of the poet’s father, in or near Verona. The verses apologized
                    for were those contained in poems xxix. and lvii., the former of which must have
                    been written after Caesar’s invasion of Britain, so that this interview probably
                    took place in the winter of 55-54 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The fact that
                    his father was the host of the great proconsul, and lived on terms of intimacy
                    with him, justifies the inference, that he was, in wealth and rank, one of the
                    principal men of the province, an inference confirmed by the social position
                    which Catullus himself assumed in Rome, and by his enjoyment of property
                    independent of his father <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> poems xxxi. and xliv.)
                    during his father’s lifetime. The only other important statement concerning the
                    poet’s life which rests on external authority is that of Apuleius, that the real
                    name of the Lesbia of the poems was Clodia. One other statement, not concerning
                    the poet’s life, but concerning the reputation which he enjoyed after his death,
                    is given in the <hi rend="italic">Life of Atticus</hi> by Cornelius Nepos (12,
                    4). It is to the effect that he regarded Lucretius and Catullus as the two
                    greatest poets of his own time.</p>
                <p>The volume of poems which Catullus collected and published before his death
                    consists of 116 pieces, varying in length from 2 to 408 lines, the great mass of
                    them being, however, short pieces, written in some lyric or iambic, or in
                    elegiac metre. These poems are not arranged either in chronological order or in
                    accordance with the character of the topics with which they deal. The only
                    principle which seems to have guided the author in his arrangement was that of
                    placing the longer poems, of a less personal and fugitive character, in the
                    middle of the volume, while the first part contained those written in lyric or
                    iambic metres, and the latter part consisted entirely of verses written in the
                    elegiac metre. Many of the last treat of the same topics and refer to the same
                    persons as those forming the subject of the short poems at the beginning of the
                    volume. The elegiac, as well as the phalecian and iambic metres, were employed
                    by him as the vehicle both of his tenderest and his bitterest feelings. Though
                    no chronological order is observed, yet internal evidence enables us to
                    determine the occasions on which many of the poems were written, and the order
                    in which they followed one another. They give a very vivid image of various
                    phases of the poet’s life, and of the strong feelings with which persons and
                    things affected him. They throw much light also on the social life of Rome and
                    of the provincial towns of Italy in the years preceding the outbreak of the
                    second civil war. Apart from their poetic charm, they thus possess the interest
                    of bringing vividly before us some aspects of one of the most critical epochs in
                    the history of the ancient world. In this respect they may be compared with the
                    letters of Cicero, which record the impression produced by the same time on a
                    man of similar susceptibility of feeling and keenness of apprehension, but of
                    character and pursuits as far removed as possible from those of the provincial
                    poet, who modestly contrasts the greatness of the “most eloquent of the
                    descendants of Romulus” with his own humble pretensions.</p>
                <p>The poems extend over a period of seven or eight years, from 61 or 62 till 54 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Among the earliest are those which record the various
                    stages of the author’s passion for Lesbia. It is in connection with this passion
                    that he is generally mentioned, or alluded to, by the later Roman poets, such as
                    Propertius, Ovid, Juvenal, and Martial The real name of Lesbia, as we learn from
                    Apuleius, was Clodia. The admiration which Catullus felt for the great Lesbian
                    poetess, which is clearly indicated by the imitation of her language in his 51st
                    and 62d poems, affords an obvious explanation of the Greek name which he gave to
                    his Roman mistress. After the exhaustive examination of the subject by Schwabe,
                    it may be regarded as certain that she was the notorious sister of Publius
                    Clodius Pulcher, the <hi rend="italic">βοωπις</hi> who plays an important part
                    in the drama of Cicero’s fortunes, brought before us in the first three books of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Letters to Atticus,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the
                    “Palatina Medea,” whose character stands out so prominently in the speech <hi

                    Clytemnestra,” as she was called by her lover Caelius <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Quintilian,</hi> viii. 6, 23), in reference to the suspicion she incurred of
                    having poisoned her husband, Q. Metellus Celer (consul, 60 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>) in 59 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi>
                    Munro, <hi rend="italic">Journal of Philology,</hi> iii.) In the year 56 she
                    charged Μ. Caelius Rufus, after tiring of him, as she had of Catullus, with an
                    attempt to poison her. It was in defence of him that Cicero described the spell
                    she exercised over young men, in language which might have been applied to her
                    previous relations with the youthful poet, as well as those with the youthful
                    orator and politician.</p>
                <p>It may probably have been on hearing of this defence, that Catullus, whose
                    feelings had by that time changed from passionate devotion to scornful
                    animosity, wrote the short poem (xlviii.) <hi rend="italic">Disertissime Romuli
                    nepotum,</hi> which associates his name with the great orator of the age. Poems
                    concerning Lesbia occur both among the earliest and the latest of those
                    contained in the series. They record the various stages of passion through which
                    Catullus passed, from absolute devotion and a secure sense of returned
                    affection, through the various conditions of distrust and jealousy, attempts at
                    renunciation, and short-lived “amoris integrationes,” through the “odi et amo”
                    state, and the later state of savage indignation against both Lesbia and his
                    rivals, and especially against Caelius Rufus, till he finally attains, not
                    without much suffering and loss, the last state of scornful indifference. Among
                    the earliest of the poems connected with Lesbia, and among those written in the
                    happiest vein, are ii. and in. <hi rend="italic">(Passer, delicioe mere
                    puelloe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lugete, 0 Veneres Cupidinesqux),</hi> and v.
                    and vii. The 8th, <hi rend="italic">Miser</hi><hi rend="italic">Catulle, desinas
                    ineptire,</hi> perhaps the most beautiful of them all, expresses the first
                    awakening of the poet to a sense of her unworthiness, before the gentler have
                    given place to the fiercer feelings of his nature. His final renunciation is
                    sent in a poem written after his return from the East, with a union of

                    brother in the Troad, had heard of Lesbia’s infidelity, and, in consideration of

                    among the poems written either during this period or perhaps in the early and
                    happier years of his liaison, some of the most charming of his shorter pieces,
                    expressing the affection for his young friends Verannius and Fabullus (ix.,
                    xii., xiii.), may be included.</p>
                <p>In the year 57 the routine of his life was for a short time broken, by his
                    accompanying the Propraetor, C. Memmius, the friend to whom Lucretius dedicates
                    his great poem, as one of his staff, to the province of Bithynia. The desire of
                    seeing foreign lands, which was as strong a passion among cultivated Romans as
                    among cultivated Englishmen of the present day, was probably the chief
                    inducement to this temporary change of life, especially as Catullus had the
                    prospect of gratifying this passion in congenial society; for the testimony of
                    Cicero as well as of Lucretius shows that Memmius, whatever else he was, was a
                    man of some accomplishment in literature and poetry; and among his younger
                    companions, in the praetor’s train, was his friend and brother-poet Helvius
                    Cinna (c∕. x.) Some expressions in x., written shortly after his return, imply
                    that he had some hopes of bettering his fortunes by this absence from Rome, as
                    humorous complaints of poverty and debt (xiii., xxvi.) show that his ordinary
                    means were insufficient for his mode of life. He frankly acknowledges the
                    disappointment of these hopes, and still more frankly his disgust with his chief
                    (x., xxviii.) Some of the most charming and perfect among the shorter poems
                    express the delight with which the poet changed the dulness and sultry climate
                    of the province for the freedom and keen enjoyment of his voyage home in his
                    yacht, built for him at Amastris on the Euxine, and for the beauty and peace of
                    his villa on the shores of Lake Benacus, which welcomed him home “wearied with
                    foreign travel.” To this period and to his first return to Rome after his visit
                    to his native district belong the poems xlvi., ci., iv., xxxi., and x., all
                    showing by their freshness of feeling and vivid truth of expression the gain
                    which the poet’s nature derived from his temporary escape from the passions,
                    distractions, and animosities of Roman society. This happier vein is not to be
                    traced in many of the poems which can be assigned to the years intervening
                    between this time and the poet’s death. Two poems, written in a very genial and
                    joyous spirit, and addressed to his younger friend Licinius Calvus (xiv. and
                    1.), who is ranked as second only to himself among the lyrical poets of the age,
                    and whose youthful promise pointed him out as likely to become one of the
                    greatest of Roman orators, may, indeed, with most probability be assigned to
                    these later years (xiv.) From the expression “Odissem te odio Vatiniano,” in the
                    third line of xiv., it may be inferred almost with certainty that the poem was
                    written not earlier than December (the “Saturnalia ”) of the year 56 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> as it was early in that year, as we learn from a
                    letter of Cicero to his brother</p>
                <p>Quintus (ii. 4, 1), that Calvus first announced his intention of prosecuting
                    Vatinius. The short poem numbered liii. records an incident in connection with
                    the actual prosecution which occurred in August 54 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The poems which have left the greatest stain on the fame of
                    Catullus—those “referta contumeliis Caesarå,” the licentious abuse of Mamurra,
                    and probably some of those personal scurrilities addressed to women as well as
                    men, or too frank con fessions, which posterity would willingly have let die—
                    were written in the last years of his life, under the influence of the
                    bitterness and recklessness induced by his experience. The complaint expressed
                    in poem xxxviii.—</p>
                <p>“Male est, Cornifici, tuo Catullo,” and one or two other short poems such as
                    lii.— “Quid est, Catulle? quid moraris emori?” appear to be expressive of his
                    state of mind in his last illness. In the first of them we recognize the tender
                    trustfulness, in the last the “saeva indignatio” of his temperament. There is a
                    return of the old graciousness and playfulness of his nature in the dedication
                    to Cornelius Nepos (i.)—</p>
                <p>“Quoi dono lepidum novum libellum,” which must have been written immediately
                    before the publication of his volume.</p>
                <p>Of several of the more interesting among the minor poems, as, for instance,
                    xvii., xxxiv., and xlv., we have no means of determining the date. Nor can it be
                    determined with certainty whether the longer and more artistic pieces, which
                    occupy the middle of the volume—the <hi rend="italic">Epithalamium</hi> in
                    celebration of the marriage of Manlius Torquatus; the 62d poem, written in
                    imitation of the Epithalamia of Sappho “Vesper adest: iuvenes, consurgite;” the
                    <hi rend="italic">Attis,</hi> and the Epic Idyll representing the marriage
                    festival of Peleus and Thetis—belong to the earlier or the later period of the
                    poet’s career. If the conjecture of Schwabe and other commentators is correct,
                    that the person addressed in the first part of the 68th is the Manlius of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Epithalamium,</hi> and that the lines from 3 to 8—</p>
                <p>“Naufragum ut eiectum .... pervigilat,”</p>
                <p>refer to the death of Junia, it would follow that the first Epithalamium was
                    written some time before that poem, and thus belongs to the earlier time. We
                    should be inclined to attach as much weight to the consideration that the
                    ringing, cheerful notes of the poem proclaimed it to be the utterance of the
                    unclouded dawn of his genius, before his nature was saddened and embittered by
                    the two great griefs of his life—the faithlessness of his mistress and the death
                    of his brother. The fact that the translation of Sappho,—</p>
                <p>“Ille mi par esse deo videtur,”</p>
                <p>and the translation from Callimachus (lxvi.),—</p>
                <p>“Omnia qui magni dispexit lumina mundi,” belong to the earlier period might
                    afford grounds for conjecturing that the other poems not relating to personal
                    topics, and written after the manner of Sappho or the Alexandrine poets,
                    belonged to the same period. But the <hi rend="italic">Attis</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Peleus</hi><hi rend="italic">and Thetis,</hi> although perhaps
                    suggested by the treatment of the same or similar subjects in Greek authors, are
                    executed with such power and originality as declare them to be products of the
                    most vigorous stage in the development of the poet’s genius. That his genius
                    came soon to maturity and did not need the ripening process of time and
                    experience through which Horace attained to the perfection of his art, is a
                    reason for hesitation in assigning any particular time between 62 and 54 <hi

                    poem. But the criticism of Mr Munro in his edition of Lucretius, which shows
                    similarities of expression, which cannot be mere casual coincidences, between
                    the Ariadne-episode in the <hi rend="italic">Epithalamium</hi> of Catullus (from
                    line 52 to 266) and the poem of Lucretius, leaves little doubt that that portion
                    at least of the poem was written after the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">rerum natura,</hi> in the winter of 55-5-4 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> There is no reason for supposing that Catullus could
                    have had any access to that poem in the lifetime of Lucretius, and even if he
                    were personally known to him and had been acquainted with his poem before its
                    publication, the liberty which ancient poets assumed of using the thoughts and
                    language of previous or contemporary writers could not have included the right
                    of appropriating them before they saw the light.</p>
                <p>No ancient author has left a more vivid impression of himself on his writings
                    than Catullus. Neither the <hi rend="italic">Letters to Atticus</hi> of Cicero
                    nor the <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> of
                    Horace afford more trustworthy indications of feeling and character. The
                    interests which occupied his life and inspired his poetry were limited to the
                    passions and the purer pleasures of youth, such as friendly intercourse with men
                    of congenial and cultivated tastes, the enjoyment of outward nature and foreign
                    travel, the cultivation of his art, and the study of the early Greek lyric and
                    the later Alexandrine poets. Coming to Rome in early youth from a distant
                    province, not art that time included within the limits of Italy, he lived as an
                    equal with the men of his time of most intellectual activity and refinement, as
                    well as of highest social and political eminence. Among those to whom his poems
                    are addressed we find the names of Hortensius, Cicero, and Cornelius Nepos,
                    attesting the fact that his society was valued by older men of established
                    reputation and graver pursuits. With Memmius he was at least on sufficiently
                    intimate relations to form one of the members of his staff during the time of
                    his provincial government. He lived on terms of affectionate friendship with
                    Licinius Calvus, with Helvius Cinna, whose distinction (whatever his real merits
                    as a poet may have been) is attested in Virgil’s line—</p>
                <p>“Nam neque adhuc Vario videor, nec dicere Cinna Digna,”</p>
                <p>with Varus, in all probability the Quintilius Varus whose death Horaee laments to
                    Virgil in the 24th ode of the first book, and other poets and men of letters
                    contemporary with him. It is interesting to notice among those mentioned as
                    belonging to the circle of his younger friends, one who lived to become one of
                    the most eminent men as statesman, orator, and man of letters in the following
                    generation, Asinius Pollio, characterized by Catullus as—</p>
                <p>“leporum</p>
                <p>“Disertus puer et facetiarum.”—xii. 8.</p>
                <p>Catullus brought into this circle the genius of a great poet, the social vivacity
                    of a vigorous nature, the simplicity and sincerity of an unambitious, and the
                    warmth of an affectionate disposition. He betrays all the sensitiveness of the
                    poetic temperament, but it is never the sensitiveness of vanity, for he is
                    characterized by the modesty rather than the self-confidence which accompanies
                    genius, but the sensitiveness of a heart which gives and expects more sympathy
                    and loyalty in friendship than the world either wants or cares to give in
                    return. He shows also in some of his lighter pieces the fastidiousness of a
                    refined taste, intolerant of all boorishness, pedantry, affectation, and sordid
                    ways of life. The passionate intensity of his temperament displays itself with
                    similar strength in the outpourings of his animosity as of his love and
                    affection. It was, unfortunately, the fashion of the time to employ in the
                    expression of these animosities a licence of speech and of imputation which it
                    is difficult for men living under different social conditions to understand,
                    still more difficult to tolerate. Cicero, in reference to such imputations says,
                    in his defence of Caelius (ch. iii.)—“Sunt ista maledicta pervulgata in omnes,
                    quorum in adolescentia forma et species fuit liberalis;” and a few sentences
                    later he says of this kind of <hi rend="italic">maledictio,</hi> “si petulantius
                    iactatur, convicium, si facetius, urbanitas nominatur.” It is not easy to
                    realize what the style of those scurrilities must have been, which were “more
                    petulant” and “less urbane” than those of Catullus. But the language of Cicero
                    implies that they were taken, and meant to be taken, merely as a <hi
                    rend="italic">façon</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">parler,</hi>
                    and would not be regarded either by the objects of them or by those who read
                    them as conveying the serious belief of the writer. Mr Munro <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Journal of Philology,</hi> iii.) has examined the 29th poem—</p>
                <p>“Quis hoc potest videre, quis potest pati,”</p>
                <p>the longest and most important of the lampoons on Caesar and Mamurra, and has
                    shown with much learning and acuteness the motives and intention of Catullus in
                    writing them. Had Julius Caesar really believed, as Suetonius writing two
                    hundred years afterwards says he did, that “an eternal stigma had been cast upon
                    him by the verses concerning Mamurra,” we should scarcely apply the word
                    magnanimity to his condonation of the offence. But these verses survive as a
                    memorial not of any scandal affecting Julius Caesar which could possibly have
                    been believed by his contemporaries, but of the licence of speech which was one
                    of the symptoms of the social and political disorganization of the age, of the
                    jealousy with which the younger members of the Roman aristocracy, who a little
                    later fought on the side of Pompey, at that time regarded the ascendency both of
                    the “father-in-law and the son-in-law,” and the social elevation of some of
                    their instruments, and also, to a certain extent, of the deterioration which the
                    frank and generous nature of Catullus underwent from the passions which wasted
                    and the faithlessness which marred his life.</p>
                <p>The great age of Latin poetry extends from about the year 60 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    own: the first represented by Lucretius and Catullus, the second by Virgil and
                    Horace, the last by Ovid. Force and sincerity are the great characteristics of
                    the first period, maturity of art of the second, facility of the last. The
                    educating influence of Greek art on the Roman mind was first fully experienced
                    in the Ciceronian age, and none of his contemporaries was so susceptible of that
                    influence as Catullus. With the susceptibility to art he combined a large share
                    of the vigorous and genial qualities of the Italian race. Like most of his
                    younger contemporaries, the <hi rend="italic">vcωτeρoι</hi> of whom Cicero
                    speaks <hi rend="italic">(Epist. αd</hi><hi rend="italic">Atticum,</hi> vii. 2),
                    he studied in the school of the Alexandrine poets, with whom the favourite
                    subjects of art were the passion of love, and stories from the Greek mythology,
                    which admitted of being treated in a spirit similar to that in which they
                    celebrated their own experiences. It was under this influence, that Catullus
                    wrote the <hi rend="italic">Coma Berenices,</hi> the 68th poem, which, after the
                    manner of the Alexandrines, interweaves the old tale of Protesilaus and Laodamia
                    with the personal experiences of the poet himself, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epithalamium</hi> of Peleus and Thetis, which combines two pictures from the
                    Greek mythology, one of the secure happiness of marriage, the other of the
                    passionate despair of love betrayed. In this last poem Catullus exercises a
                    power of creative pictorial imagination far transcending that displayed in any
                    of the extant poetry of Alexandria. We have no means of determining what
                    suggested the subject of the <hi rend="italic">Attis</hi> to Catullus, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n262/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0262-0251"/> whether the previous treatment of the subject by
                    some Greek writer, some survival of the myth which he found still existing
                    during his residence among the “Phrygii Campi,' ’ or the growth of various forms
                    of Eastern superstition aud fanaticism, at Rome, in the last age of the
                    Republic. Whatever may have been its origin, it is the finest specimen we
                    possess, in either Greek or Latin literature, of that kind of short poem more
                    common in modern than ancient times, in which some situation or passion entirely
                    alien to the writer, and to his own age, is realized with dramatic intensity.
                    But the genius of Catullus is, perhaps, even happier in the direct expression of
                    personal feeling than in artistic creation, or the reproduction of tales and
                    situations from mythology. The warmth, intensity, and sincerity of his own
                    nature are the sources of the inspiration in these poems. The most elaborate and
                    one of the finest of them is the <hi rend="italic">Epithalamium</hi> in honour
                    of the marriage of a member of the old house of Manlius Torquatus with Junia
                    (or, according to another reading,Vinia) Aurunculeia, written in the glyconic in
                    combination with the pherecratean metre. To this metre Catullus imparts a
                    peculiar lightness and grace by making the trochee, instead of the spondee as in
                    Horace’s glyconics and pherecrateans, the first foot in the line. His elegiac
                    metre is constructed with less smoothness and regularity than that of Ovid and
                    Tibullus or even of Propertius, but as employed by him it gives a true echo to
                    the serious and plaintive feelings of some of his poems, <hi rend="italic"
                    >t.g.,</hi> lxxvi.—</p>
                <p>“Si qua recordanti benefacta priora voluptas,” xcvi.,</p>
                <p>“Si quicquam mutis gratum acceptumque sepulchris,” and ci.,</p>
                <p>“Multas per gentes et multa per aequora vectus,”</p>
                <p>while it adapts itself, as it did later in the hands of Martial, to the
                    epigrammatic terseness of his invective. But the perfection of the art of
                    Catullus is seen in his employment of those metres which he adapted to the Latin
                    tongue from the earlier poets of Greece, the pure iambic trimeter, as in
                    iv.—</p>
                <p>“Phaselus ille quem videtis hospites,”</p>
                <p>the Scazon iambic, employed in viii. and xxxi.—</p>
                <p>“Paeninsularum, Sirmio, insularumque,”</p>
                <p>and the phalecian hendecasyllabic, a slight modification of the Sapphic line,
                    which is his favourite metre for the expression of his more joyful moods, and of
                    his lighter satiric vein. The Latin language never flowed with such ease,
                    freshness, and purity as in these poems. Their perfection consists in the entire
                    absence of all appearance of effort or reflexion, and in the fulness of life and
                    feeling, which gives a lasting interest and charm to the most trivial incident
                    of the passing hour. In reference to these poems Mr Munro has said with truth
                    and force: “A generation had yet to pass before the heroic attained to its
                    perfection; while he (Catullus) had already produced glyconics, phalecians, and
                    iambics, each ‘one entire and perfect chrysolite,’ ‘cun-ningest patterns ’ of
                    excellence, such as Latium never saw before or after,—Alcseus, Sappho, and the
                    rest then and only then having met their match” <hi rend="italic">(Journal of
                    Philology,</hi> No. iii.)</p>
                <p>From expressions in some of the poems (xvi. 12, liv. 7) it is clear that several
                    of them had been published or circulated separately before they were finally
                    collected in the, edition which has come down to us. Lines are quoted from
                    Catullus by ancient writers which are not found in any of the poems which we
                    possess. If these passages are correctly attributed to Catullus it follows that
                    he must have omitted some of his earlier poems from the collection which he made
                    before his death. In some of the older editions (as for instance that of Döring,
                    1834) two poems addressed “ad Hortorum Deum,” and numbered 19 and 20, have been
                    included, of which there is no ground to believe Catullus to have been the
                    author. The lines numbered in Döring’s edition 18 are attributed to him by an
                    ancient grammarian, though they are not included in the MSS. of his collected
                    works. The text, as it has reached us, is in many places corrupt, and its
                    restoration still exercises the acuteness of English and German scholars. There
                    appears to have been one MS. of Catullus extant in France in the 9th century,
                    from which the 62d poem, <hi rend="italic">Vesper αdest, iuvcηes,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">consurgite,</hi> &amp;c., was copied at that time into an
                    anthology of Latin poems. Another MS. is known to have existed in Verona in the
                    middle of the following century. This MS. is not again heard of till the
                    beginning of the 14th century, when it was again discovered and read by
                    Petrarch. It was soon after lost again. The two oldest extant MSS. are rmmedrate
                    copies of it. One of these, dated 1375, now belongs to the Paris Library, the
                    other to the Bodleian <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Bahrens, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prolegomena).</hi> The <hi rend="italic">edüio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >princeps</hi> appeared in 1472, and other editions appeared a few years later
                    at Parma and Venice. “In the 16th century Catullus, like most of the chief Latin
                    classics, was corrected and illustrated with signal zeal and success. The
                    editions of Avancius, Guariuus, Muretus, Statius, and Scaliger do honour to the
                    learning of Italy and France, even in that age of erudition” (Munro, <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal of Philology,</hi> iii.) Nothing more was done of any
                    importance, in the way of emendation or commentary, till Lachmann published his
                    edition of the text in 1829. Since that date editions have appeared by Haupt,
                    Rossbach, Schwabe, Müller, Bàhrens (1876), and other German editors, and by
                    Professor Robinson Ellis—the last accompanied by an elaborate <hi rend="italic"
                    >apparatus</hi><hi rend="italic">criticus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >prolegomena,</hi> &amp;c. Most important contributions to the interpretation of
                    the matter and meaning of Catullus have been made by Haupt, Schwabe, and Mr
                    Munro in the <hi rend="italic">Journal oj Philology.</hi> Among recent English
                    translations may be mentioned those of Mr Theodore Martin, Dr Cranstoun, and Mr
                    R. Ellis—the last being written in the metres of the original poems. ( W. Y.
