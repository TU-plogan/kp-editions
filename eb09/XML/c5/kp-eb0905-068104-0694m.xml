                <p><label type="entry">CHOISEUL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Étienne François,
                    Ducde</hi></label> (1719-1785), a French statesman, was born on the 28th June
                    1719. Under the name of Count de Stainville, he entered the army, and rose to
                    the rank of lieutenant-general. Having contracted a wealthy marriage, and gained
                    the friendship of Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV., he entered
                    political life as envoy, first to Rome, and then to Vienna; and in November 1758
                    he was created Due de Choiseul and peer of France, and appointed minister of
                    foreign affairs. His first act was to sign a secret treaty of alliance with
                    Maria Theresa of Austria, who had the sympathy and support of Madame de
                    Pompadour. An invasion of Great Britain was ChoiseuΓs next project; and so eager
                    was he to carry out this ill-fated scheme, that the French interests in America
                    and the West Indies were miserably neglected. Choiseul is also responsible for
                    allowing the possessions of France in India to be lost without adequate
                    resistance, and for not interfering in time to prevent the dismemberment of
                    Poland.</p>
                <p>The principal achievement of ChoiseuΓs policy is known as the “Family Compact,”
                    by which all the sovereigns of the house of Bourbon, viz., the kings of France,
                    Spain, and the two Sicilies, were united in an offensive and defensive alliance
                    (1761). Portugal also was afterwards persuaded to join the confederation in war
                    against England. Great enthusiasm was awakened in France; and Choiseul, having
                    handed over to his cousin, Choiseul-Praslin, the department of foreign affairs,
                    devoted himself to the reorganization of the army and navy. But the plans of
                    Pitt proved successful, and, in November 1762, France was obliged to cede to
                    England, by the treaty of Fontainebleau, Acadia, Canada, Cape Breton, and all
                    the islands of the Saint Lawrence, all Louisiana to the left of the Mississippi,
                    Ohio, the isles of Grenada and Minorca, and a large part of her possessions in
                    India.</p>
                <p>Much more fortunate was his policy against the Jesuits. It was partly due to his
                    influence that they were driven out of Spain; in 1764 he effected their
                    banishment from France; and ten years later he prevailed on Pope Clement XIV. to
                    declare their order abolished.</p>
                <p>Until the end of 1770 Choiseul continued to be foremost among the directors of
                    French policy. But after the death of Madame de Pompadour, the intrigues of the
                    Due d’Aiguillon, the Abbé Terray, and Chancellor Maupeou, backed by the
                    influence of Madame du Barri, whose friendship Choiseul had scornfully rejected,
                    created an estrangement between him and the king, who banished him to his estate
                    at Chanteloup. His fall, however, only increased his popularity, and on his
                    departure the most distinguished of the courtiers crowded round him to bid him
                    farewell. The four years of his retirement were spent chiefly in writing his
                    autobiography, which was published at Paris in 1790. He was recalled to Paris by
                    Louis XVI. in 1774, and died there in May 1785. Choiseul appears to have been a
                    man of considerable, but not first-rate ability; his disposition was haughty but
                    courteous; and such was the magnificence of his habits that, notwithstanding his
                    vast wealth, he died leaving enormous debts. See his Autobiography and the <hi
