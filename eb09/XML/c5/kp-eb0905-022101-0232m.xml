                    definite and technical signification. So also in Aristotle the verb <hi
                    rend="italic">κατήγορόν,</hi> to accuse, takes the specific logical sense, to
                    predicate; <hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi><hi rend="italic">κατηγορούμενον</hi>
                    becomes the predicate; and <hi rend="italic">κατηγορική πρότασις</hi> may be
                    translated as affirmative proposition. But though the word thus received a new
                    signification from Aristotle, it is not on that account certain that the thing
                    it was taken to signify was equally a novelty in philosophy. We do find in the
                    records of Oriental and early Greek thought something corresponding to the
                    Aristotelian classification.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of Hindu philosophy, and of the relations in which it may have
                    stood to Greek speculation, is not yet adequate to give decisive answers to
                    various questions that naturally arise on observation of their many resemblances
                    , and it might therefore appear irrelevant to introduce into an historical
                    notice of a peculiarly Western doctrine any reference to its Eastern
                    counterpart. Yet the similarity between the two is so striking that, if not
                    historically connected, they must at least be regarded as expressions of similar
                    philosophic wants. The Hindu classification to which we specially refer is that
                    of Kanada, who lays down six categories, or classes of existence, a seventh
                    being generally added by the commentators. The term employed is Padârtha,
                    meaning “signification of a word.” This is in entire harmony with the
                    Aristotelian doctrine, the categories of which may with truth be described as
                    significations of simple terms, τα <hi rend="italic">κατά</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >μηδεμiav</hi><hi rend="italic">συμπλοκήν Χεγόμενα.</hi> The six categories of
                    Kanada are Substance, Quality, Action, Genus, Individuality, and Concretion or
                    Co-inherence. To these is added Non-Existence, Privation, or Negation. <hi
                    rend="italic">Substance</hi> is the permanent sub-strate in which <hi
                    rend="italic">Qualities</hi> exist. <hi rend="italic">Action,</hi> belonging to
                    or inhering in substances, is that which produces change. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Genus</hi> belongs to substance, qualities, and actions; there are higher and
                    lower genera. <hi rend="italic">Individuality,</hi> found only in substance, is
                    that by which a thing is self-existent and marked off from others. <hi
                    rend="italic">Concretion</hi> or Co-inherence denotes inseparable or necessary
                    connection, such as that between substance and quality. Under these six classes,
                    <hi rend="italic">γένη</hi><hi rend="italic">τoυ ovτoς,</hi> Kanada then
                    proceeds to range the facts of the universe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Within Greek philosophy itself there were foreshadowings of the Aristotelian
                    doctrine, but nothing so important as to warrant the conclusion that Aristotle
                    was directly influenced by it. Doubtless the One and Many, Being and Non-Being,
                    of the Eleatic dialectic, with their subordinate oppositions, may be called
                    categories, but they are not so in the Aristotelian sense, and have little or
                    nothing in common with the later system. Their starting-point and results are
                    wholly diverse. Nor does it appear necessary to do more than mention the
                    Pythagorean table of principles, the number of which is supposed to have given
                    rise to the decuple arrangement adopted by Aristotle. The two classifications
                    have nothing in common; no term in the one list appears in the other; and there
                    is absolutely nothing in the Pythagorean principles which could have, led to the
                    theory of the categories.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The supposed origin of that theory in the treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >∙περ∖</hi><hi rend="italic">τοΰ παντός,</hi> ascribed to <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Archytas</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> has been proved to be an error. The
                    treatise itself dates in all probability from the Neo-Pythagorean schools of the
                    2d century A.D.</p></note></p>
                <p>One naturally turns to Plato when endeavouring to discover the genesis of any
                    Aristotelian doctrine, and undoubtedly there are in the Platonic writings many
                    detached discussions in which the matter of the categories is touched upon.
                    Special terms also are anticipated at various times, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">πιοιότης</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Theoetetus,
                    πoιεlv</hi> and <hi rend="italic">πάσχαν</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gorgias,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">πρός</hi><hi rend="italic">τι</hi> in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sophist.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    209, <hi rend="italic">n.</hi></p></note> But there does not seem to be anything
                    in Plato which one could say gave occasion directly and of itself to the
                    Aristotelian doctrine; and even when we take a more comprehensive view of the
                    Platonic system and inquire what in it corresponds to the widest definition of
                    categories, say as ultimate elements of thought and existence, we receive no
                    very definite answer. The Platonic dialectic never worked, out into system, and
                    only in two dialogues do we get anything like a list of ultimate or
                    root-notions. In the <hi rend="italic">Sophist,</hi> Being, Rest, and Motion (το
                    <hi rend="italic">ον</hi> αυτό <hi rend="italic">καί</hi> στάσιν <hi

                    of the consideration of all five some light is cast upon the obscure notion of
                    Non-Being <hi rend="smallcaps">(tò</hi><hi rend="italic">μη 5v).</hi> In the
                    same dialogue (262, sç.) is found the important distinction of <hi rend="italic"
                    >όνομα</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ρήμα,</hi> noun and verb. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Philebus</hi> presents us with a totally distinct classification
                    into four elements—the Infinite, the Finite, the Mixture or Unity of both, and
                    the Cause of this unity (το <hi rend="italic">άπειρον,</hi> το <hi rend="italic"
                    >πέρας, ή σύμμιξις, ή</hi> αίτια). It is at once apparent that, however these
                    classifications are related to one another and to the Platonic system, they lie
                    in a different field from that occupied by the Aristotelian categories, and can
                    hardly be said to have anything in common with them.</p>
                <p>The Aristotelian doctrine is most distinctly formulated in the short treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">Kaτηγopiaι,</hi> which generally occupies the first place among
                    the books of the <hi rend="italic">Organon.</hi> The authenticity of the
                    treatise was doubted in early times by some of the commentators,· and the doubts
                    have been revived by such scholars as Spengel and Prantl. On the other hand
                    Brandis, Bonitz, and Zeller are of opinion that the tract is substantially
                    Aristotle’s. The matter is hardly one that can be decided either <hi
                    rend="italic">pro</hi> or <hi rend="italic">con</hi> with anything like
                    certainty; but this is of little moment, for the doctrine of the categories,
                    even of the <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> categories, does not stand or fall with
                    only one portion of Aristotle’s works.</p>
                <p>It is surprising that there should yet be so much uncertainty as to the real
                    significance of the categories, and that we should be in nearly complete
                    ignorance as to the process of thought by which Aristotle was led to the
                    doctrine. On both points it is difficult to extract from the matter before us
                    anything approaching a satisfactory solution. The terms employed to denote the
                    categories have been scrutinized with the utmost care, but they give little
                    help. The most important— <hi rend="italic">κ∙ τoυ Svτoς or</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τής ουσίας, γένη</hi> τού <hi rend="smallcaps">Õvtoç</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">τών</hi><hi rend="italic">ovτωv,</hi><hi rend="italic">γένη</hi>
                    simply, τα <hi rend="italic">πρώτα</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τα κοινά πρώτα,</hi> αί τττώσιίί, or αί <hi rend="italic"
                    >διαιρέσεις—</hi> only indicate that the categories are general classes into
                    which Being as such may be divided, that they are <hi rend="italic"
                    >summa</hi><hi rend="italic">genera.</hi> The expressions <hi rend="italic">γένη
                    τών κατηγοριών</hi> and <hi rend="italic">σχήματα τών</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >κ.,</hi> which are used frequently, seem to lead to another and somewhat
                    different view. Κατηγορία being taken to mean that which is predicated, <hi
                    rend="italic">γένη τών</hi><hi rend="italic">κ.</hi> would signify the most
                    general classes of predicates, the framework into the divisions of which all
                    predicates must come. To this interpretation there are objections. The
                    categories must be carefully distinguished from predicables; in the scholastic
                    phraseology the former refer to <hi rend="italic">first intentions,</hi> the
                    latter to <hi rend="italic">second intentions, i.e.,</hi> the one denote real,
                    the other logical connection. Further, the categories cannot without careful
                    explanation be defined as predicates; they are this and something more. The most
                    important category, ουσία, in one of its aspects cannot be predicate at all.</p>
                <p>In the Kα-∏7γ0piαι Aristotle prefixes to his enumeration a grammatico-logical
                    disquisition on homonyms and synonyms, and on the elements of the proposition,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> subject<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n234/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0234-0223"/> and predicate. He draws attention to the fact
                    that things are spoken of either in the connection known as the proposition, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> “a man runs,” or apart from such connection, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> “man” and “runs.” He then proceeds, “Of things spoken
                    of apart from their connection in a proposition (των κατά <hi rend="italic"
                    >μηδeμiαv</hi><hi rend="italic">συμπλοκήν</hi><hi rend="italic">λtγoμivωv),</hi>
                    each signifies either Substance (ουσία), or Quantity (πoσo'v),or Quality
                    (ποιόν), or Relation (πρός τι), or Where (ι.e. Place, που), or When <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.</hi> Time, πoτε), or Position (κεiσ0αt), or Possession
                    (εχειv), or Action (πoιειv), or Passion <hi rend="italic">(πάσχαν). Ουσία,</hi>
                    the first category, is subdivided into <hi rend="italic">πρώτη ουσία</hi> or
                    primary substance, which is defined to be τόδε τι, the singular thing in which
                    properties inhere, and to which predicates are attached, and δευτεpαι oυσiaι,
                    genera or species which can be predicated of primary substances, and are
                    therefore ουσία only in a secondary sense. Nevertheless, they too, after a
                    certain fashion, signify the singular thing, τo'δε τι <hi rend="italic"
                    >(K.,</hi> p. 3b, 12, 13). It is this doctrine of <hi rend="italic">πρώτη
                    ουσία</hi> that has raised doubts with regard to the authenticity of the Kαττp
                    <hi rend="italic">γoplαι.</hi> But the tenfold classification, which has also
                    been captiously objected to, is given in an acknowledged writing of Aristotle’s
                    (see <hi rend="italic">Topicà,</hi> i. 9, p. 103b, 20).<note anchored="true"

                    the same time it is at least remarkable that in two places where the enumeration
                    seems intended to be complete <hi rend="italic">(Met.,</hi> p. 1017a, 25; <hi
                    rend="italic">An. Bos.,</hi> i. 22, p. 83a, 21), only eight are mentioned, <hi

                    are given, frequently with some addition, such as καi at aλλaι <hi rend="italic"
                    >κ.</hi> It is also to be observed that, despite of this wavering, distinct
                    intimations are given by Aristotle that he regarded his list as complete, and he
                    uses phrases which would seem to indicate that the division had been
                    exhaustively carried out. He admits certainly that some predicates which come
                    under one category might be referred to another, but he declines to deduce all
                    from one highest class, or to recognize any relation of subordination among the
                    several classes.</p>
                <p>The full import of the categories will never be adequately reached from the point
                    of view taken up in the Kατ7γ0piαι, which bears all the marks of an early and
                    preliminary study. For true understanding we must turn to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metaphysics,</hi> where the doctrine is handled at large. The discussion of
                    Being in that work starts with a distinction that at once gives us a clue. Tò
                    <hi rend="italic">õv</hi> is spoken of in many ways; of these four are
                    classified—το δv κατά <hi rend="italic">συμβeβηκoς,</hi> το δv ως <hi
                    rend="italic">αληθiς,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi> δv δυνάμει <hi
                    rend="italic">καi εvepγeiα,</hi> and το δv κατά <hi rend="italic">τα σχήματα των
                    κατηγοριών.</hi> It is evident from this that the categories can be regarded
                    neither as purely logical nor as purely metaphysical elements. They indicate the
                    general forms or ways in which Being can be predicated; they are determinations
                    of Being regarded as an object of thought, and consequently as matter of speech.
                    It becomes apparent also why the analysis of the categories starts from the
                    singular thing, for it is the primary form under which all that is becomes
                    object of knowledge, and the other categories modify or qualify this real
                    individual. Πάντα δε <hi rend="italic">τα</hi> γιγνόμενα <hi rend="italic"
                    >υπό</hi> τε τίνος γίγνεται καί <hi rend="italic">ίκ</hi> τίνος και τί. Tò δε τί
                    λέγω <hi rend="italic">καθ’ ίκάστην κατηγορίαν’ η γαρ</hi> τόδε <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> ποσον <hi rend="italic">η ποών η που</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Met.,</hi> ρ. 1032a, 13—15). . . . The categories, therefore, are not logical
                    forms but real predicates; they are the general modes in which Being may be
                    expressed. The definite thing, that which comes forward in the process from
                    potentiality to full actuality, can only appear and be spoken of under forms of
                    individuality, quality, quantity, and so on. The nine later categories all
                    denote entity in a certain imperfect fashion.</p>
                <p>The categories then are not to be regarded as heads of predicates, the framework
                    into which predicates can be thrown. They are real determinations of Being— <hi
                    rend="italic">allgemeine Bestimmtheiten,</hi> as Hegel calls them. They are not
                    <hi rend="italic">summa</hi><hi rend="italic">genera</hi> of existences, still
                    less are they to be explained as a classification of nameable things in general.
                    The objections Mill has taken to the list are entirely irrelevant, and would
                    only have significance if the categories were really—what they are not—an
                    exhaustive division of concrete existences. Grote’s view <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aristotle,</hi> i. 108) that Aristotle drew up his list by examining various
                    popular propositions, and throwing the different predicates into genera,
                    “according as they stood in different logical relation to the subject,” has no
                    foundation. The relation of the predicate category to the subject is not
                    entirely a logical one; it is a relation of real existence, and wants the
                    essential marks of the propositional form. The logical relations of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">tò</hi> õv are provided for otherwise than by the
                    categories.</p>
                <p>Aristotle has given no intimation of the course of thought by which he was led to
                    his tenfold arrangement, and it seems hopeless to discover it. Trendelenburg in
                    various essays has worked out the idea that the root of the matter is to be
                    found in grammatical considerations, that the categories originated from
                    investigations into grammatical functions, and that a correspondence will be
                    found to obtain between categories and parts of speech. Thus, Substance
                    corresponds to noun substantive, Quantity and Quality to the adjective, Relation
                    partly to the comparative degree and perhaps to the preposition, When and Where
                    to the adverbs of time and place, Action to the active, Passion to the passive
                    of the verb, Position (κεισ0αι) to the intransitive verb, εχειv to the peculiar
                    Greek perfect. That there should be a very close correspondence between the
                    categories and grammatical elements is by no means surprising; that the one were
                    deduced from the other is both philosophically and historically improbable.
                    Reference to the detailed criticisms of Trendelenburg by Ritter, Bonitz, and
                    Zeller will be sufficient.</p>
                <p>Aristotle has also left us in doubt on another point. Why should there be only
                    <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> categories î and why should these be the ten! Kant
                    and Hegel, it is well known, signalize as the great defect in the Aristotelian
                    categories the want of a principle, and yet some of Aristotle’s expressions
                    would warrant the inference that he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> a principle, and
                    that he thought his arrangement exhaustive. The leading idea of all later
                    attempts at reduction to unity of principle, the division into substance and
                    accident, was undoubtedly not overlooked by Aristotle, and Brentano<note

                    >Bedeutung des Seienden nach</hi><hi rend="italic">A.,</hi> pp.

                    how the complete list might have been deduced from this primary distinction. His
                    tabular arrangements (pp. 175, 177) are particularly deserving of attention. The
                    results, however, are hardly beyond the reach of doubt.</p>
                <p>There was no fundamental change in the doctrine of the categories from the time
                    of Aristotle to that of Kant, and only two proposed re-classifications are of
                    such importance as to require notice. The Stoics adopted a fivefold arrangement
                    of highest classes, γενικότατα. Tò õv or τi, Being, or somewhat in general, was
                    subdivided into υποκείμενα or subjects, ποια or qualities in general, which give
                    definiteness to the blank subject, πώς εχovτα, modes which further determine the
                    subject, and. πρός τι πώς εχovτα, definite relative modes. These categories are
                    so related that each involves the existence of one higher than itself, thus
                    there cannot be a πρός τι πώς εχov which does not rest upon or imply a πώς <hi
                    rend="italic">eχov,</hi> but πώς <hi rend="italic">εχov</hi> is impossible
                    without ποιόν, which only exists in υποκείμενον, a form or phase of τδ õv.<note

                <p>Plotinus, after a lengthy critique of Aristotle’s categories sets out a twofold
                    list. To ¢v, <hi rend="italic">ιdvησ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">s,</hi> στάσιν, <hi rend="italic">ταυτότης,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >iτepoτη&lt;i</hi> are the primitive categories (πρώτα <hi rend="italic"
                    >γivη)</hi> of the intelligible sphere. Oυσια, πpos τι, ποιά, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ττοσόν,</hi><hi rend="italic">κwησις</hi> are the categories of the sensible
                    world. The return to the Platonic classification will not escape notice.</p>
                <p>Modern philosophy, neglecting altogether the dry and tasteless treatment of the
                    Aristotelian doctrine by scholastic writers, gave a new, a wider, and. deeper
                    meaning to the categories. They now appear as ultimate or root notions, the
                    metaphysical or thought elements, which give coherence and consistency to the
                    material of knowledge, the necessary and universal relations which obtain among
                    the particulars of experience. There was thus to some extent a return to
                    Platonism, but in reality, as might easily be shown, the new interpretation was,
                    with due allowance for difference in point of view, in strict harmony with the
                    true doctrine of Aristotle. The modern theory dates in particular from the time
                    of Kant, who may be said to have re-introduced the term into philosophy.
                    Naturally there are some anticipations in earlier thinkers. The Substance,
                    Attribute, and Mode of Cartesianism can hardly be classed among the categories;
                    nor does Leibnitz’s chance suggestion of a fivefold arrangement into Substance,
                    Quantity, Quality, Action and Passion,and Relations,demand any particular
                    notice. Locke, too, has a classification into Substances, Modes, and Relations,
                    but in it he has manifestly no intention of drawing up a table of categories.
                    What in his system corresponds most nearly to the modern view of these elements
                    is the division of kinds of real predication. In all judgments of knowledge we
                    predicate either (1) Identity or Diversity, (2) Relation, (3) Co-existence, or
                    necessary connection, or (4) Real existence. From this the transition was easy
                    to Hume’s important classification of <hi rend="italic">philosophical
                    relations</hi> into those of Resemblance, Identity, Time and Place, Quantity or
                    Number, Quality, Contrariety, Cause and Effect.</p>
                <p>These attempts at an exhaustive distribution of the necessary relations of all
                    objects of knowledge indicate the direction taken by modern thought, before it
                    received its complete expression from Kant.</p>
                <p>The doctrine of the categories is the very kernel of the Kantian system, and,
                    through it, of later German philosophy. To explain it fully would be to write
                    the history of that philosophy. The categories are called by Kant Root-notions
                    of the Understanding <hi rend="italic">(Stammbegriffe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des</hi><hi rend="italic">Verstandes),</hi> and are briefly the specific forms
                    of the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> or formal element in rational cognition.
                    It is this distinction of matter and form in knowledge that marks off the
                    Kantian from the Aristotelian doctrine. To Kant knowledge was only possible as
                    the synthesis of the material or <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> with the
                    formal or <hi rend="italic">a priori.</hi> The material to which <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> forms of the understanding were applied was the
                    sensuous content of the pure intuitions, Time and Space. This content could not
                    be <hi rend="italic">known</hi> by sense, but only by intellectual function. But
                    the understanding in the process of knowledge makes use of the universal form of
                    synthesis, the judgment; intellectual function is essentially of the nature of
                    judgment or the reduction of a manifold to unity through a conception. The
                    specific or type forms of such function will, therefore, be expressed in
                    judgments; and a complete classification of the forms of judgments is the key by
                    which one may hope to discover the system of categories. Such a list of
                    judgments Kant thought he found in ordinary logic, and from it he drew up his
                    well-known scheme of the twelve categories. These forms are the determinations
                    of all objects of experience, for it is only through them that the manifold of
                    sense can be reduced to the unity of consciousness, and thereby constituted
                    experience. They are <hi rend="italic">α priori</hi> conditions, subjective in
                    one sense, but objective as being universal, necessary, and constitutive of
                    experience.</p>
                <p>The table of logical judgments with corresponding categories is as follows :—</p>

                <p>Kant, it is well-known, criticises Aristotle severely for having drawn up his
                    categories without a principle, and claims to have disclosed the only possible
                    method by which an exhaustive classification might be obtained. What he
                    criticized in Aristotle is brought against his own procedure by the later German
                    thinkers, particularly Fichte and Hegel. And in point of fact it cannot be
                    denied that Kant has allowed too much completeness to the ordinary logical
                    distribution of propositions; he has given no proof that in these forms are
                    contained all species of synthesis, and in consequence he has failed to show
                    that in the categories, or pure conceptions, are contained all the modes of <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> synthesis. Further, his principle has so far the
                    unity he claimed for it, the unity of a single function, but the specific forms
                    in which such unity manifests itself are not themselves accounted for by this
                    principle. Kant himself hints more than once at the possibility of a completely
                    rational system of the categories, at an evolution from one single movement of
                    thought, and in his <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Table of the
                    Categories</hi> gave a pregnant hint as to the method to be employed. From any
                    complete realization of this suggestion Kant, however, was precluded by one
                    portion of his theory. The categories, although the necessary conditions under
                    which alone an object of experience can be thrown, are merely forms of the
                    mind’s own activity; they apply only to sensuous and consequently subjective
                    material. Outside of and beyond them lies the thing-in-itself, the blankest and
                    emptiest of abstractions, which yet to Kant represented the ultimately real.
                    This subjectivism was a distinct hiatus in the Kantian system, and against it
                    principally Fichte and Hegel directed criticism. It was manifest that at the
                    root of the whole system of categories there lay the synthetizing unity of
                    self-consciousness, and it was upon this unity that Fichte fixed as giving the
                    possibility of a more complete and rigorous deduction of the pure notions of the
                    understanding. Without the act of the Ego, whereby it is self-conscious, there
                    could be no knowledge, and this primitive act or function must be, he saw, the
                    <hi rend="italic">position</hi> or affirmation of itself by the Ego. The first
                    principle then must be that the Ego posits itself as the Ego, that the Ego =
                    Ego, a principle which is unconditioned both in form and matter, and therefore
                    capable of standing absolutely first, of being the <hi rend="italic">prius</hi>
                    in a system. Metaphysically regarded this act of self-position yields the
                    categories of Reality. But, so far as matter is concerned, there cannot be
                    affirmation without negation, <hi rend="italic">omnis determinatio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">negatio.</hi> The determination of the
                    Ego presupposes or involves the Non-Ego. The form of the proposition in which
                    this second act takes to itself expression, the Ego is not = Not-Ego, is
                    unconditioned, not derivable from the first. It is the absolute antithesis to
                    the primitive thesis. The category of Negation is the result of this second act.
                    From these two propositions, involving absolutely opposed<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n236/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0236-0225"/> and mutually destructive elements,there results a
                    third which reconciles both in a higher synthesis. The notion in this third is
                    determination or limitation; the Ego and Non-Ego limit, and are opposed to one
                    another. From these three positions Fichte proceeds to evolve the categories by
                    a series of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.</p>
                <p>• In thus seizing upon the unity of self-consciousness as the origin for
                    systematic development, Fichte has clearly taken a step in advance of, and yet
                    in strict harmony with, the Kantian doctrine. For, after all that can be said as
                    to the demonstrated character of formal logic, Kant’s procedure was empirical,
                    and only after the list of categories had been drawn out, did he bring forward
                    into prominence what gave them coherence and reality. The peculiar method of
                    Fichte, also, was nothing but a consistent application of Kant’s own Remark on
                    the Tabte of the Categories. Fichte’s doctrine, however, is open to some of the
                    objections advanced against Kant. His method is too abstract and external, and
                    wants the unity of a single principle. The first two of his fundamental
                    propositions stand isolated from one another, not to be resolved into a
                    primitive unity. With him, too, the whole stands yet on the plane of
                    subjectivity. He speaks, indeed, of the universal Ego as distinct from the
                    empirical self-consciousness; but the universal does not rise with him to
                    concrete spirit. Nevertheless the <hi rend="italic">Wissenschaftslehre</hi>
                    contains the only real advance in the treatment of the categories from the time
                    of Kant to that of Hegel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It does not seem necessary to do more than refer to the slight alterations
                    made on Kant’s Table of Categories by Herder (in the <hi rend="italic"

                    der Vernunft),</hi> or by Schopenhauer, who desired to reduce all the categories
                    to one—that of Causality. We should require a new philosophical vocabulary even
                    to translate the extraordinary compounds in which Krause expounds his theory of
                    the categories. Notices of the changes introduced by Rosmini, and of Gioberti’s
                    remarkable theory, will be found in Ragnisco’s work referred to
                    below.</p></note> This, of course, does not imply that there were not certain
                    elements in Schelling, particularly in the <hi rend="italic">Transcendental
                    Idealism,</hi> that are of value in the transition to the later system; but on
                    the whole it is only in Hegel that the whole matter of the Kantian categories
                    has been assimilated and carried to a higher stage. The Hegelian philosophy, in
                    brief, is a system of the categories; and as it is not intended here to expound
                    that philosophy, it is impossible to give more than a few general and quite
                    external observations as to the Hegelian mode of viewing these elements of
                    thought. With Kant, as has been seen, the categories were still subjective, not
                    as being forms of the individual subject, but as having over against them the
                    world of <hi rend="italic">noumena</hi> to which they were inapplicable.
                    Selfconsciousness, which was, even with Kant, the <hi rend="italic">nodus</hi>
                    or kernel whence the categories sprang, was nothing but a logical centre,—the
                    reality was concealed. There was thus a dualism, to overcome which is the first
                    step in the Hegelian system. The principle, if there is to be one, must be
                    universally applicable, all-comprehensive. Selfconsciousness is precisely the
                    principle wanted; it is a unity, an identity, containing in itself a
                    multiplicity. The universal in absolute self-consciousness is just pure
                    thinking, which in systematic evolution is the catagories; the particular is the
                    natural or multiform, the external as such; the concrete of both is spirit, or
                    self-consciousness come to itself. The same law that obtains among the
                    categories is found adequate to an explanation of the external thing which had
                    so sadly troubled Kant. The categories themselves are moments of the universal
                    of thought, type forms, or definite aspects which thought assumes;
                    determinations, <hi rend="italic">Bestimmungen,</hi> as Hegel most frequently
                    calls them. They evolve by the same law that was found to be the essence of
                    ultimate reality— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of self-consciousness. The
                    complete system is pure thought, the Universal <hi rend="italic">par
                    excellence.</hi></p>
                <p>After the Hegelian there can hardly be said to have been a philosophical
                    treatment of the categories in Germany, which is not more or less a criticism of
                    that system. It does not seem necessary to mention the unimportant modifications
                    introduced by Kuno Fischer, Erdmann, or others belonging to the school. In the
                    strongly-opposed philosophy of Herbart, the categories can hardly be said to
                    hold a prominent place. They are, with him, the most general notions which are
                    psychologically formed, and he classifies them as follows:—(1) Thing, either as
                    product of thought, or as given in experience; (2) Property, either qualitative
                    or quantitative; (3) Relation; (4) The Negated. Along with these, he posits as
                    categories of inner process— (l)Sensation, (2) Cognition, (3)Will, (4) Action.

                    rend="italic">Lehrbuch der Metaphysik,</hi> 1844.</p></note> who in the main
                    follows Schleiermacher, draws out a table of categories which shows, in some
                    points, traces of Herbartian influence. His arrangement by enneads, or series of
                    nine, is fanciful, and wanting in inner principle.</p>
                <p>The most imposing recent attempt at a reconstruction of the catagories is that of
                    Trendelenburg. To him the first principle, or primitive reality, is Motion,
                    which is both real as external movement, and ideal as inner construction. The
                    necessary conditions of Motion are Time and Space, which are both subjective and
                    objective. From this point onwards are developed the mathematical (point, line,
                    &lt;fcc.) and real (causality, substance, quantity, quality, &amp;c.) categories
                    vzhich appear as involved in the notion of motion. Matter cannot be regarded as
                    a product of motion; it is the condition of motion, we must think something
                    moved. All these categories, “under the presupposition of motion as the first
                    energy of thought, are ideal and subjective relations; as also, under the
                    presupposition of motion as the first energy of Being, real and objective
                    relations.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Logische Untersuchungen,</hi> i. 376-7.</p></note> A serious
                    difficulty presents itself in the next category, that of End <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Zweck),</hi> which can easily be thought for inner activity, but can hardly be
                    reconciled with real motion. Trendelenburg solves the difficulty only
                    empirically, by pointing to the insufficiency of the merely mechanical to
                    account for the organic. The consideration of Modality effects the transition to
                    the forms of logical thought. On the whole, Trendelenburg’s unique fact of
                    motion seems rather a blunder. There is much more involved than he is willing to
                    allow, and motion <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> is by no means adequate to
                    self-consciousness. His theory has found little favour.</p>
                <p>Ulrici works out a system of the categories from a psychological or logical point
                    of view. To him the fundamental fact of philosophy is the distinguishing
                    activity <hi rend="italic">{unterscheidende</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Thätigkeit)</hi> of thought. Thought is only possible by distinction,
                    difference. The fixed points in the relations of objects upon which this
                    activity turns are the categories, which may be called the forms or laws of
                    thought. They are the aspects of things, notions under which things must be
                    brought, in order to become objects of thought. They are thus the most general
                    predicates or heads of predicates. The categories cannot be completely gathered
                    from experience, nor can they be evolved <hi rend="italic">α priori;</hi> but,
                    by attending to the general relations of thought and its purely indefinite
                    matter, and examining what we must predicate in order to know Being, we may
                    attain to a satisfactory list. Such list is given in great detail in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sys tern</hi><hi rend="italic">der Logik</hi> (1852), and in

                    of Ulrici. To him the primitive fact is Relation, of which all the categories
                    are but forms. “The categories,” he says, “are the primary and irreducible laws
                    of knowledge, the fundamental relations which determine its form and regulate
                    its movements.” His table and his criticism of the Kantian theory are both of

                    manner. They are never brought into connection with thought itself, nor could
                    they be shown to spring from its nature and relations.</p>
                <p>J. S. Mill has presented, “as a substitute for the abortive classification of
                    Existences, termed the categories of Aristotle,” the following as an enumeration
                    of all nameable things :—(1) Feelings, or states of consciousness; (2) The minds
                    which experience these feelings; (3) Bodies, or external objects which excite
                    certain of those feelings; (4) Successions and co-existences, likenesses and
