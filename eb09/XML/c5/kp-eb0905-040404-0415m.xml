                    Dunfermline on the 19th November 1600, was the second and favourite son of James
                    I. By the death of his brother Henry, he became Prince of Wales in 1612, but the
                    first public matter of importance in which he was concerned was the Spanish
                    marriage. At first he was quite indifferent to the affair, and in 1622 he was
                    full of a dream that he would lead an army into the Palatinate, and set his dear
                    sister upon her throne. But, by the beginning of the next year, Buckingham had
                    filled him with the romantic notion of setting off, in defiance of all policy,
                    on a private visit to Spain. His conduct while at Madrid displays the weakest
                    side of his character. He took a violent fancy for the Infanta, whom he
                    seriously alarmed by leaping over the wall of the garden in which she was
                    walking, in order that he might enjoy the private conversation which Spanish
                    etiquette refused to permit. With a mixture of infatuation and duplicity, he
                    bore with repeated insults; he allowed his chaplains tð be excluded from the
                    palace, and his retinue to be sent back to England, and gave way to each of the
                    ever-growing demands of the Spanish favourite Olivarez. He promised what he knew
                    he had no power to fulfil, the abrogation of the penal laws against the
                    Catholics within three years; he listened respectfully to the arguments of the
                    Spanish theologians, and promised to listen whenever the princess should require
                    it; he addressed to the Pope a disgraceful letter, which, while binding him to
                    nothing, gave rise to the greatest expectations; and thus he held out hopes of a
                    conversion which, according to his own subsequent declaration, he believed would
                    never take place. At last the Spaniards made up their minds to the match; but,
                    though immediately before leaving Spain Charles swore to carry out the marriage,
                    his ardour had cooled, and Buckingham was throwing cold water on the dying
                    embers. James was persuaded to demand the restoration of the Palatinate to the
                    elector Frederick as an essential preliminary; the match was broken off; and in
                    1624 Buckingham had arranged a marriage with Henrietta Maria of France. Not the
                    least dishonourable part of Charles’s conduct in connection with this affair was
                    his treatment of the earl of Bristol, the English ambassador to Spain. This only
                    too faithful servant of the Crown he was mean enough to subject, at the
                    instigation of his favourite, to a persistent and illegal persecution. On the
                    summons of the second parliament of his reign he commanded that Bristol’s writ
                    should be withheld; he sought to punish him in an underhand way by forbidding
                    his attendance; and when the earl continued to insist on his rights, and, after
                    two years of confinement to his house, laid the king’s letter before the Lords
                    with a request for leave to impeach the duke, he even accused him of high
                    treason, and employed his personal influence against him. The reason of all this
                    was that Bristol had offended Buckingham; and the faults which were laid against
                    him were really chargeable to his accusers. In the first place, he had been too
                    well deceived by Charles’s acting, had imagined that he was really inclined to
                    Catholicism, and had offered, if this were so, to keep the matter secret; and,
                    secondly, he had sought to preserve his country’s honour by striving to prevent
                    the capricious rupture of the treaty which had been completed with Spain.</p>
                <p>In March 1625 Charles came to the throne. The excited joy with which he had been
                    welcomed home from Spain had given way to suspicion as fuller reports of his
                    conduct spread abroad, and there was now prevalent an anxious dread of the
                    growth of Catholicism. The first Parliament sent Montagu to the Tower for
                    preaching the doctrines of divine right and the real presence; and, as
                    difficulties arose concerning the old method of levying tonnage and poundage, it
                    refused to grant the impost for more than a year. From a paper of Sir Juhn
                    Eliot’s,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Forster’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Sir John Eliot,</hi> vol. i. p. 214.</p></note> it would seem
                    that this was intended merely as a temporary measure; but to please the duke of
                    Buckingham, Charles dissolved the Parliament, and took a pitiful revenge by
                    making Montagu royal chaplain.</p>
                <p>The king was now at the disposal of his favourite, who was full of great and
                    warlike schemes. All were, however, doomed to failure. The English sailors
                    refused to fight against the Huguenots of Rochelle; the expedition against Cadiz
                    was mismanaged from first to last; and, worst of all, the pawning of the crown
                    jewels brought in but a very small sum. It was necessary to summon another
                    Parliament.</p>
                <p>But this Parliament was not less determined than the first. The House of Lords
                    vindicated its independence by acquitting the earl of Bristol. The Commons, led
                    by the ardent and eloquent Sir John Eliot, ventured on the bold step of
                    exhibiting eight articles of impeachment <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n416/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0416-0405"/> against the duke of Buckingham. His majesty
                    replied with a haughty message that the duke had acted only at his direction,
                    threw Eliot and Sir Dudley Digges into prison, and finally dissolved the
                    Parliament again, without any improvement of his finances. Forced loans were
                    resorted to; the common people who refused to pay were pressed for the navy; the
                    gentlemen were summoned before the council, or committed to prison <hi
                    rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">speciale mandatum regis.</hi> At this
                    inopportune moment Buckingham provoked a war with France, and led an expedition
                    against Rhé, which proved an utter failure. In 1628 Charles was compelled to
                    call a third Parliament.</p>
                <p>The House of Commons which now assembled was remarkable alike for the social
                    standing of its members and for their wealth, which was three times that of the
                    House of Lords. But equally with the other two which had met in this reign, it
                    was determined to obtain redress of grievances. Its first act was to draw up the
                    Petition of Right, which declares the illegality of forced loans, of martial law
                    in time of peace, and of the billeting of soldiers on private houses.
                    Characteristically, Charles at first attempted an evasive reply—“The king
                    willeth that right be done according to the laws and customs of the realm.”
                    When, however, the Commons proceeded to censure Buckingham, he gave the regular
                    formal assent. Yet such was his insincerity that he caused 1500 copies of the
                    Petition to be distributed with the first answer attached. The Commons now made
                    known their readiness to vote tonnage and poundage, provided that the king would
                    admit that his arbitrary levy had been illegal; and Hollis and Valentine held
                    the speaker in the chair while Eliot read a protest against Arminians and
                    Papists, and against the irregular levy of tonnage and poundage. A few weeks
                    before, Buckingham had fallen by the dagger of a disappointed officer. But the
                    king’s policy was unchanged. The usual plan of dissolution was resorted to; and
                    Eliot, Hollis, and Valentine were heavily fined, and so strictly imprisoned
                    that, though Eliot’s health gave way, his petitions for a temporary release were
                    repeatedly refused by Charles, and he was allowed to die in the Tower.</p>
                <p>From this time there was no Parliament for eleven years (March 1629 to April
                    1640). Every year made the people better acquainted with the character of their
                    king, who showed an unhappy ignorance both of the history and the temper of the
                    nation; and taught them to feel more and more deeply that stronger safeguards
                    were needed to withstand the arbitrary power of the sovereign. The London
                    merchant who compared the rule of Charles to that of the sultan of Turkey was
                    not altogether unjust. A paternal government was his <hi rend="italic"
                    >beau-ideal</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Parliament was to be summoned only
                    to give advice to the king, and to acquaint him with the needs of the people.
                    The Petition of Right, to which he had recently given his assent, he utterly
                    disregarded. He descended to a puerile exercise of authority. His proclamations
                    forbade the country people to come up to the metropolis, commanded all the shops
                    in Cheapside, except those of the goldsmiths, to be shut, and prohibited the
                    building of more houses in London, unless special leave (to be well paid for)
                    were first obtained. But the great necessity was to procure money. The Council
                    of the North was directed to compound with recusants. Monopolies were granted to
                    companies in defiance of the spirit of the law. Neglect of the knighthood which
                    was no longer an honour was punished by a fine, which was often extremely
                    severe. Pretensions to forest-lands, which prescription had long made unjust,
                    were revived. And, lastly, the famous ship-money was levied. Besides, Charles
                    must also be held personally responsible for other tyranny than that which was
                    executed at his direct command. During these years Strafford was maturing his
                    policy of “Thorough,” by which England was to be made subject to a standing
                    army; and if Charles did not carry out this scheme as far as might have been
                    possible, it was not because it was too bad, but only because it was too great
                    for him. Though he had no love for its inventor he showed his respect for his
                    absolute policy by making him president of the Council of the North, and sending
                    him to govern Ireland with an iron sternness, which, though it certainly added
                    to the prosperity of some parts of the island, as certainly helped to arouse in
                    others the feeling which resulted in the horrors of the Irish massacre. He
                    allowed the Star Chamber to sentence a clergyman to perpetual imprisonment,
                    mutilation, and whipping for a libel against the bishops, and to reduce a
                    gentleman to poverty for merely sneering at the badge of a nobleman. He
                    sanctioned the inquisitorial Court of High Commission. He supported Laud’s
                    oppression of the Puritans, his inculcation of celibacy among the clergy, of
                    auricular confession, of prayers for the dead, and of the doctrine of purgatory,
                    and he advanced men like Montagu, whom he knew to be desirous of a reunion of
                    the English Church with Rome, confirming by all this the suspicions which the
                    disclosures of Bristol had awakened.</p>
                <p>At length, on his own sole authority, he commanded Scotland to receive a liturgy
                    and a book of canons. The fatal results of this act belong to the history of
                    Scotland. Unable to meet the Scottish army with a sufficient force, Charles
                    summoned the Short Parliament; but as it refused to vote supplies till it made
                    inquiry into the causes of the imprisonment of Eliot and his two companions,
                    into ship-money, and other matters of that kind, it was speedily dissolved. A
                    great council of the peers would not act alone; and in November 1640 he was
                    compelled to summon the Long Parliament. The Commons were now happy in a leader
                    magnificently fitted for the times. His fiery energy was repressed, not
                    quenched, by the ripeness of his age; his courage and determination were too
                    firm to be shaken; his respect for law and order was deep and strong; but deeper
                    still and stronger were his love of liberty, and his resolve that nothing should
                    serve as a bulwark against despotism. With the sagacity of the true statesman,
                    Pym struck the first blow at the strongest pillar of the hateful structure. He
                    exhibited articles of impeachment against the earl of Strafford. The impeachment
                    was allowed to drop (against his wish), but it was only in favour of a bill of
                    attainder. The preachers preached and the mob yelled against the great
                    delinquent. The king went in person to the House of Lords, and tried to buy him
                    off by promising never to employ him again; and then listened to a scheme,
                    hatched by certain hot-headed officers and some of the fierier of the courtiers,
                    to bring up the army of the north and overawe the Parliament. But his entreaty
                    was voted irregular; the plot was discovered, and the earl was condemned to
                    death. Charles’s weakness was now fatal to himself. A few months later the
                    splendid ability of Strafford would have been invaluable to him. But he had no
                    affection for the stern, haughty “dark earl,” and, when the Lords refused his
                    humiliating request thjt they would suggest to the Commons some milder
                    punishment, he sacrificed his greatest servant. At the same time, Charles, who
                    never knew the true place for firmness, yielded on another fatal point by
                    confirming a bill, according to which the Parliament then sitting was not to be
                    dissolved without its own consent. Before the triumphant course of the Commons
                    everything had now to give way. The Triennial Bill was passed, ship-money, the
                    Star Chamber, the High Commission, the Council of the North, the Council of
                    Wales, the Council of Lancaster and Cheshire, the whole system of illegal
                    exaction and injustice, were swept away. The religious passion of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n417/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0417-0406"/> Houses manifested itself in an impeachment of
                    Laud, and a proposal to abolish Episcopacy.</p>
                <p>Charles once more resorted to the crooked policy which he usually employed in
                    extremity. He visited Edinburgh, attended the Presbyterian worship, and loaded
                    Argyll, Hamilton, and the other Presbyterian leaders with marks of favour, while
                    all the time he was intriguing with the earl of Montrose, Argyll’s open enemy.
                    There was a darker suspicion at the time that an attempt, known as the
                    “Incident,” had been made by Montrose, with the king’s knowledge, to assassinate
                    Argyll; but this worse treachery is by no means proved. At this moment, while
                    men’s minds were full of excitement and apprehension, a massacre of thousands of
                    Protestants took place in Ireland. It was known that O’Neale, the leader of the
                    butchery, professed to have the king’s written warrant and the ardent support of
                    the queen; and many believed the hideous charge. They would have been more
                    strongly convinced had they seen the letter in which his majesty coldly remarked
                    that he trusted this trouble in Ireland would help to cure the folly at home.
                    Other plots were also being discovered, of which men more naturally ascribed
                    some knowledge to the king. Pym’s life was in constant danger. An attempt was
                    made to convey plague infection to him in a letter, and a gentleman was stabbed
                    by mistake for him in Westminster Hall.</p>
                <p>But Pym and the Parliament yielded not one step. On the 1st December 1641 the
                    Grand Remonstrance was presented to the king, who received the committee which
                    presented it in the highest spirits. He had returned from Scotland but a few
                    days before, had been entertained at a great banquet by the Lord Mayor, and had
                    made up his mind to show the Parliament that he was not to be trifled with. He
                    had already appointed Colonel Lunsford, a disreputable scapegrace, to the
                    command of the Tower. He now replaced the guard, which had protected Parliament
                    since the news of the Army Plot, by a company under the earl of Dorset, who did
                    not pass his first day of duty without firing on the people. Mobs far from
                    orderly began to assemble round Westminster Hall, and a petition against the
                    bishops was presented to the Commons. The bishops themselves were mobbed on
                    their way to the House, and when they protested against the legality of what
                    should be done in their absence, were summarily silenced by an impeachment. The
                    excitement in the city grew dangerously intense, and Charles fanned the flame by
                    accepting a company of armed soldier-adventurers as guard, and allowing them to
                    quarrel with the unarmed crowd.</p>
                <p>It was on the 3d of January 1642 that the final breach was made. Pym was not to
                    be gained over, for only a few days before he had refused office. The king now
                    practically declared war against the Parliament. How far he acted alone is
                    disputed; but Clarendon is very likely right in saying that he was goaded on by
                    the queen, who had retained from the political theory in which she had been
                    educated some very lofty notions about the rights of kings and the duties of
                    parliaments. On the morning of the 3d, he commanded Attorney-General Herbert to
                    impeach Lord Kimbolton (against whom, however, the matter was not pressed), Pym,
                    Hampden, Haslerig, Hollis, and Strode on a charge of high treason, founded upon
                    their parliamentary conduct. The rooms, drawers, and trunks of the five members
                    were illegally sealed at the king’s command, and the king’s sergeant-at-arms was
                    illegally sent to demand their persons. The Commons behaved with the greatest
                    dignity. The sergeant was commanded to show his respect for the House by laying
                    aside bis mace, and four members, of whom two were privy-councillors, were sent
                    with a message to the king that the House would give him an answer as speedily
                    as the greatness of the business would allow, and that the members should meet
                    any legal charge against them. But Charles had determined to crush the
                    Parliament by force, and to make it for ever subservient to the Crown. He sent
                    orders to the lord mayor that the guard sought by the Parliament should be
                    employed to disperse all crowds, and to “shoot with bullets” all who resisted.
                    On the morning of the 4th, at the head of his attendants, his pensioners, and
                    the Whitehall guard, armed with partisans, swords, and pistols, to the number of
                    three or four hundred men, he entered the House of Commons, and demanded the
                    persons of the five members, declaring that treason has no privilege. But, with
                    the formal consent of the House, they had taken refuge in the city; to the
                    king’s demands the sole reply was that given by the speaker, bravely, though
                    tremblingly, and on his knees, that he could speak only as he was commanded by
                    the House; and Charles was obliged to retire with undignified threats upon his
                    lips. The consequence of this act was the most terrible excitement. Some members
                    of the Commons cried “Privilege” in the very presence of his majesty. In London
                    the shops were shut; there was a report that the cavaliers, with the king at
                    their head, were about to fire the city, and it became known that a seizure of
                    the arms of the citizens was contemplated. When the king visited the city next
                    day, in the streets and in the court-room of the common council, he was met by
                    cries of “Privilege of Parliament !” The panic still grew; the streets were
                    thronged with almost frenzied crowds; the train bands were collected. Other
                    crowds poured in from the country, one with a petition signed by thousands for
                    the protection of Pym, another, from Buckinghamshire, eager to live and die with
                    Hampden, to serve the Commons, respectfully to petition the king. The very
                    sailors in the river caught the enthusiasm, and offered their assistance. And
                    the House of Commons, declaring itself no longer safe at Westminster, adjourned
                    first to Guildhall and then to Grocers’ Hall. On the 10th Charles, βeeing that
                    the true magnitude of his attempt had been understood, and that he was met with
                    his own weapons, retired in alarm to Hampton Court. On the following morning the
                    five members returned to their seats in triumph, amid salutes from the river,
                    the shouts of the crowd, and a parade of the train bands.</p>
                <p>The Parliament retaliated the king’s attack by passing a bill assuming the
                    command of the militia, and appointing the lieutenants of counties. But the king
                    on his journey from Dover, where the queen had embarked with the crown jewels,
                    had met with so many expressions of loyalty that he refused his consent. He
                    requested, however, that all requirements should be drawn up in one document,
                    and submitted to him. Accordingly, in June 1642, Parliament presented “The
                    Nineteen Propositions.” They were such as would have entirely altered the
                    constitution. Constitutional concessions could no longer avail the king; fifteen
                    years of unconstitutional rule had made that impossible. He had striven to
                    obtain the tyranny; he had appealed to force; and the Civil War had already
                    begun with the Westminster tumults. On the 22d August 1642, it was formally
                    commenced by the erection of the royal standard at Nottingham. At first success
                    was on the side of the king, and the Parliament suffered so severely in the west
                    that they began to discuss terms of peace, while several defections to the
                    royalist party took place. But Charles was too highly elated; having summoned a
                    parliament of his own at Oxford, he declared that which met at Westminster to be
                    none; and when the earls of Holland, Bristol, and Clare came over to his party,
                    he treated them with so much neglect and insult that after three months they
                    turned back, and no others risked the treatment they had received. But as the
                    troops of the Parliament became accustomed to the use of arms, and its officers
                    to the tactics of war, the inferiority of the royalists <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0418-0407"/> became apparent. In the beginning of 1645 the
                    Parliament was in a position to demand, in the treaty of Uxbridge, that
                    Presbyterianism should be established, and that it should have the command of
                    the army and navy and the direction of the war with Ireland.</p>
                <p>In the same year, after the decisive victory at Naseby, the king’s cabinet,
                    containing a number of letters which proved that he was promising toleration to
                    the Catholics and seeking aid from several foreign powers, fell into the hands
                    of the Parliament, and the letters were published. Soon after a still more
                    important discovery was made,— that of a treaty entered into, by means of the
                    earl of Glamorgan, with the Irish Catholics, whose aid was to be bought at the
                    price of great religious concessions. Charles denied all knowledge of the
                    affair, and Glamorgan was imprisoned for a short time; but subsequent evidence
                    gives strong reason for believing that he was deeply implicated in the matter.
                    Owing to the anti-popish bigotry which they offended, and the insincerity which
                    they manifested, these disclosures were extremely damaging to the king.</p>
                <p>In May of the next year Charles had fled to the Scots at Newark; and in January
                    1647 he was delivered by them into the hands of the English Parliament, who
                    placed him in Holmby House, six miles from Northampton Terms similar to those
                    offered at Uxbridge were agaiu tendered at Newcastle; but Charles, being
                    sincerely attached tc Episcopacy, was most unwilling to yield concerning church
                    affairs, and, holding himself necessary to any settlement, believed that he had
                    only to insist upon more favourable offers. In June the army took possession of
                    his person, and finally brought him to his palace at Hampton Court. He was
                    treated with respect and kindness; Cromwell and Ireton sought to bring about a
                    secure peace; and the latter, on behalf of the Agitators or Adjutators, who
                    formed the parliament of the army, drew up most favourable terms. But unable to
                    see that the army was now supreme, and hoping, contrary to his whole experience,
                    to obtain something more from the Parliament or the Scots, with whom he was
                    treating, Charles haughtily broke with the officers, and scornfully refused
                    their offers. To many it was now apparent that it was vain to hope for a
                    settlement by means of compromise.</p>
                <p>From this moment the ascendency was taken by a party of enthusiasts, who held
                    that a crown should not excuse the crime of treason against the country, and
                    sternly called for justice on the grand delinquent. Fearing assassination,
                    Charles fled to the Isle of Wight, where, however, he was captured. But trusting
                    in the Scots, who now prepared to protect him by force, he still rejected the
                    offers of the Parliament, which were again tendered to him at Carisbrook and at
                    Newport. At length the army impatiently seized him once more, removed him to
                    Hurst Castle, and thence to Windsor and St James’s, purged the Parliament by
                    excluding some hundred and forty members, and resolved to bring him to trial. On
                    the 1st of January 1649, though the Peers adjourned refusing to consider the
                    question, the Commons voted the appointment of a High Court of Justice “to the
                    end no chief officer or magistrate might presume for the future to contrive the
                    enslaving and destruction of the nation with impunity.” One hundred and
                    thirty-two commissioners were elected, of whom about half took part in the
                    trial. Bradshaw was elected Lord President, and Cook solicitor against the king.
                    On the 2Oth, the 2 2d, and the 23d, Charles was brought before this court; but
                    with a calm and admirable dignity, due to a sincere belief in his own
                    pretension, he proudly refused to acknowledge the court, declaring that
                    obedience to kings is commanded by Scripture, that by the law the king can do no
                    wrong, that the Commons have no authority of themselves to erect a court of
                    judicature, and that they had not received such authority from the people, whose
                    power to confer it he, besides, declined to admit. On the 26th the court went
                    through the form of listening to evidence that he had appeared in arms against
                    the Parhament, which was declared to represent the nation. On the 27th Bradshaw
                    pronounced sentence of death against Charles Stuart, as a tyrant, a murderer,
                    and a traitor to his country; and on the afternoon of the 30th of January 1649,
                    Charles was beheaded in front of the Banqueting House at Whitehall. His body was
                    conveyed to Windsor, and on the 8th of February was buried in St George’s Chapel
                    without any service.</p>
                <p>In person and in demeanour Charles presented a most favourable contrast to his
                    ungainly, babbling father. A somewhat painful stammer was his only physical
                    defect. His manner, also, was grave and reserved; his scrupulous observance of
                    the ordinances of religion was accompanied by strict decorum of conduct; and he
                    possessed considerable taste for literature and art. Yet of almost all the
                    essential kingly qualities he was utterly destitute. He had, indeed, a strong
                    sense of personal and royal dignity, but this very feeling was fatal to him. It
                    rendered intolerable the least limitation of the prerogative which he believed
                    to be his divinely-appointed birthright; and thus it placed him in obstinate
                    opposition to the strongest tendency of his time,—that tendency which had
                    already resulted in the Reformation, and which now manifested itself in the
                    development of Puritanism and the growth of the English constitution. Nor did he
                    possess the qualities fthich might have given him a chance of success in the
                    contest. Affectionate toward his intimate friends to a degree of weakness which
                    often arouses contempt, he had no magnanimity for an enemy, nor even fidelity to
                    a servant, however great, who did not awaken his fondness. In political sagacity
                    he was utterly wanting; and so completely did he identify political skill with
                    duplicity that, in public matters, he could never be trusted, and compromise
                    with him was impossible.</p>
                <p>About the time of Charles’s death several works appeared purporting to be by his
                    hand. Of these the chief is the <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">The Portraiture of his Sacred Majesty in

                    himself its author, and his claim was not disputed either by Clarendon or by
                    Charles II., who, on the contrary, gave him ecclesiastical preferments. The
                    controversy as to its authorship has left little doubt that it is a forgery. A
                    collection of the works was published at the Hague in 1651, under the. title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Reliquioe Sacroe Carolines: The works of that Great Monarch
