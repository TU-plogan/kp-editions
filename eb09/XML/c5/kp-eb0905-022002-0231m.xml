                    is caused to hear something. In ecclesiastical language,—and the word is no
                    otherwise used,—a catechumen is one who is being instructed in the doctrines of
                    Christianity in preparation for baptism.</p>
                <p>Catechumens were usually divided into four classes. The first class appears to
                    have been those who were still in the condition of inquirers,—those who had been
                    sufficiently impressed by that they had heard of Christianity to wish for more
                    complete instruction. It would seem that this first instruction was, from
                    motives of prudence, given privately and not in the churches. The second class
                    consisted of those who, having been thus instructed, were found worthy of being
                    admitted to the churches, not, however, to take any part in the holy mysteries,
                    or even, as it would seem, in the prayers of the faithful, but for the hearing
                    of sermons and exhortations, and the reading of the Gospel. These were
                    accordingly called <hi rend="italic">audientes,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    hearers. They left the church when the reading of the sacred Scriptures and the
                    sermon had been concluded. The third class consisted of those who had formally
                    demanded baptism, and placed their names in the list of catechumens. These were
                    called <hi rend="italic">prostrati</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >genuflectentes,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> those who shared in the prayers of
                    the congregation. The fourth class was the <hi rend="italic">electi</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">competentes,</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi> those who had completed
                    the period of their probation, and were deemed ready to receive baptism, and
                    only waited to do so on the first occasion, that is'to say, at the following
                    Easter or Pentecost. The most important body of catechumens was obviously those
                    of the third class, the <hi rend="italic">genu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >flectentes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it is of these that most of what we
                    read in the early writers of the catechumens generally must be understood.</p>
                <p>Of course the number of those who were in a state of preparation for baptism
                    increased is proportion to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n232/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0232-0221"/> spread of the church. But it must not be supposed
                    that there were no more catechumens when the totality of the population had
                    become Christian, or that the catechumenate, as it was called, denoted solely
                    the period of conversion from heathendom to Christianity. The children of
                    Christian parents, who were not old enough, or not yet sufficiently instructed,
                    to be admitted to the mystery of the Eucharist were catechumens, and subjected
                    to the instruction of the church by a catechist appointed for the purpose. But
                    throughout all the long period, during which proselytism from either Roman or
                    barbarian heathenism was going on, the numbers of the catechumens were largely
                    increased by a practice very curiously illustrative of the special superstition
                    of the time. Large numbers of persons, who had become persuaded of the truth of
                    Christianity, and who were fully minded to be baptized, put off the receiving of
                    that sacrament, for a longer or shorter period, often until they found
                    themselves in the presence of death. The object of this was to avoid
                    responsibility before God for that greater heinousness of guilt, which would
                    have resulted from sin committed after baptism. They argued that since baptism
                    washed out all previous sin, and could be had only once, it was clearly
                    expedient that it should be received as late in life as possible. And thus many
                    remained as catechumens during the greater part of their lives. And this
                    practice prevailed not only among those who were quitting paganism for
                    Christianity; it was also common among those born of Christian parents.
                    Tenderness of conscience, too, seems often to have produced the same result in
                    prolonging the catechumenate as the superstitious notion mentioned above. St
                    Ambrose, St Gregory Nazianzen, and St Augustine all remained catechumens till
                    far on in life. The emperors Theodoric, Valentinian, and Constantine the Great
                    did the same. And the abuse became so great that towards the end of the 4th
                    century (see Baronius, <hi rend="italic">ad an,</hi> 877) the church tried to
                    provide a remedy for it, and among other fathers of the church, Saints Ambrose
                    and Gregory exerted themselves to prevent others from following (though probably
                    from very different motives) their own example.</p>
                <p>The idea of the probable numbers of the members of a congregation likely to be in
                    the condition of catechumens, which may be obtained from a consideration of the
                    above circumstances, may serve to explain in some degree the architectural
                    arrangements still to be seen in some churches of the early centuries. The
                    complete plan of a church of that time seems to have comprised a court in front
                    of the principal western entrance, surrounded with colonnades, as may still be
                    seen in the cases of the church of St Ambrose at Milan, and that of St Clement
                    at Rome, and some others. Now, when the catechumens were dismissed previously to
                    the commencement of that portion of the service which we should call the
                    “Communion Service,” it was not understood that they should depart entirely, but
                    they remained in these courts. It would seem, however, that those thus dismissed
                    must have been the catechumens of the second class only—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >audientes.</hi> And in the churches that have been mentioned, especially in
                    that of St Clement at Rome, the body of the building is divided by permanent
                    stone constructions into the presbytery or * <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    hancel for the clergy at the eastern end, an intermediate portion for the lay
                    members of the congregation of the male sex (the females being in the
                    galleries), and a much larger part of the nave at the western extremity of the
                    church, destined for the catechumens.</p>
                <p>In the more important churches, persons called catechists were especially
                    appointed for the instruction of the catechumens. In the epistle attributed to
                    St Clement, catechists are spoken of as distinguished from either bishops,
                    priests, or deacons. But there is not sufficient evidence that they were ever
                    considered, a separate order in the hierarchy. In the church of Alexandria there
                    was a celebrated school of catechumens, under the superintendence of some of the
                    foremost men of their time, among whom St Clement of Alexandria and Origen may
                    be mentioned. See Origen, <hi rend="italic">Cont. Cel.,</hi> lib. iii. It would
                    seem that Origen was thus employed at eighteen years of age, when he was still a
                    layman. There was also a celebrated school of catechumens in the church of
                    Carthage. It is somewhat remarkable, however, that no traces are found of any
                    such catechists having existed at Rome. There can be no doubt, however, that the
                    catechumens were there as elsewhere required to pass through a period of
                    instruction and novitiate, the task of preparing them being doubtless entrusted
                    to the priests and deacons—more probably the latter—of each church.</p>
                <p>Catechumens of the third category might be present, in the more distant and
                    inferior part of the church assigned to them, during all that part of the
                    service of the mass which precedes the offertory. It was then that the <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ii</hi><hi rend="italic">Ite,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Catechumeni, missa</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">! '</hi> was
                    pronounced; and that portion of the service was called a “Catechumens’ mass. ’
                    It was not permitted to them so much as to see the eucharist. But in order that
                    there might be the bond of some kind of special com. munion between them and the
                    body of the faithful, bread was blessed and given to them, and this bread was
                    called <hi rend="italic">Panis Catechumenorum.</hi></p>
                <p>On the demand of any person to become a catechumen, a strict and searching
                    examination was made into the previous conduct of the aspirant, and the general
                    tenor of his life. Great caution was used also in ascertaining the nature and
                    earnestness of his desire to become a Christian. If these inquiries and
                    examinations were satisfactory, the person’s name was formally entered on the
                    roll of catechumens. From a very ancient extant ritual, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Ordo ad faciendum</hi><hi rend="italic">Christianum,</hi> it
                    appears that the catechumens were, by anticipation, as Moroni says, called
                    Christians, while the title of “the Faithful” was reserved forthose who had
                    received baptism. The duration of the catechumenate was originally fixed at
                    three months (see the third epistle of St Clement), but was subsequently
                    shortened to forty days. The ceremonial with which the catechumen was at the
                    termination of his novitiate admitted to baptism varied in some unimportant
                    respects in different churches. But the following brief statement of the
                    practice of the Roman church will suffice to indicate the nature of the
                    function. In the first place a searching scrutiny into the mind and heart ol the
                    candidate for baptism was made on seven different occasions during Lent or in
                    the weeks preceding Pentecost. Previously to beginnmg the first scrutiny, which
                    took place on the Wednesday of the third week in Lent, the priest blessed ashes,
                    which he sprinkled on the head of the catechumen. He also touched his ears and
                    his nostrils with saliva, saying “Ephphatha, which is, be opened to the odour of
                    sanctity. But thou, devil, flee hence, for the judgment of God is approaching.
                    ’’ The days appointed for the other six scrutinies were the Saturday of the
                    third ιveek, the Wednesday and Saturday of the fourth week, the Wednesday of the
                    fifth week, and the Wednesday and Saturday of the last week. The first scrutiny
                    was closed by asking of the neophyte if he renounced the devil and believed all
                    the doctrines of the faith. Then the priest blew on his face, saying, “Go out
                    from him, thou unclean spiπt, and give place to the Holy Spirit of the
                    Paraclete;’’ and concluded by making the sign of the cross on his forehead,
                    accompanying the action by the words, “In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus
                    Sancti.” At the third scrutiny the Creed and the Lord’s Prayer were given to the
                    catechumen that he might leam them by heart, for the discipline of the “Arcanum”
                    expressly forbade that he should be allowed any cognizance of these at an
                    earlier period of his novitiate. This consigning of the Creed was not done
                    without certain formalities. The catechumens were assembled in the church, the
                    bells were rung, and the church doors closed. Then the bishop preached a sermon,
                    and then recited the Creed twice, once in Latin, once in Greek, prefacing his
                    reading by the words “Signate vos; et audite Symbolum !” He then explained it
                    passage by passage, and then gave to each Catechumen a written copy of it. Then
                    a day was fixed for the ceremony of baptism, and the catechumens were dismissed
                    by the archdeacon with the “words <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Catechumeni recedant; omnes Catechumeni exeant foris I</hi> ”—“Let the
                    catechumens retire! Let all the catechumens go out from the church !” And the
                    deacon added “<hi rend="italic">Filii carissimi, revertimini</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">loca vostra,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >expectantes</hi><hi rend="italic">horam qua possit circa vos Dei gratia
                    Baptismum operari,”—</hi> “Well-beloved sons, return to your own home, and there
                    await the hour when, by the grace of God, baptism may be performed on you.” And
                    so ended the catechumens' novitiate.</p>
                <p>The number of writers who have specially treated of the institution of
                    catechumens, and of the practice of the Church, and in some respects of the
                    different churches, in regard to them, is far too large for it to be possible to
                    give a list of them here. But such a list may be found in the treatise of
                    Cancellieri on the Holy Week.</p>
