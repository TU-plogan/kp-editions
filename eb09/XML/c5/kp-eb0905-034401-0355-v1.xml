                <p><label type="entry">CERAM, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sirang</hi></label>, an island
                    of the East Indian Archipelago, situated to the west of New Guinea, and
                    belonging to the Dutch Government of the Moluccas. It lies between 2° 45' 30"
                    and 3° 30' 30" S. lat., and extends from 128° to 131° 10' E. long.; its greatest
                    length is about 200 miles, its greatest breadth about 50, and its area upwards
                    of 6000 square miles. It is divided into two parts, Great Ceram and Little Ceram
                    or Huvamohel, united by the isthmus of Taruno; and, for administrative purposes,
                    the eastern portion is assigned to the residency of Banda, while the western
                    belongs to that of Amboyna. A chain of mountains traverses the island from east
                    to west, and attains in various parts a height of upwards of 8000 feet. The
                    loftiest summit—Nusa Keli—has an elevation of 9500 feet; and others of mark are
                    Salagor, Trier, and Tomaehe. The coast is for the most part rocky and
                    precipitous; but it is broken in several places by considerable bays, of which
                    the most important are Hatuvi and Savaai on the north, and Huvamohel, Amahay,
                    Nusa Laut, and Selan on the south. The country is well watered with streams,
                    which are of very little use, however, for navigation or systematic irrigation.
                    Several hot springs have been discovered, and earthquakes are not unfrequent. A
                    largo part of the interior is covered with dense and gloomy forests, and except
                    along the coasts the population is very scant. For the naturalist Ceram is a
                    comparatively uninteresting island, without any characteristic species or
                    abundance of specimens. The Bandanese pay occasional visits to shoot bears and
                    deer; there are numbers of wild goats and cattle; and among the .birds are
                    mentioned cassowaries, cockatoos, birds of paradise, and the swallows that
                    furnish the edible nests. A large number of fish are to be found in the various
                    rivers; and as early as 1860 no fewer than 213 species were described by Dr

                    Ceram itself, but to other islands to the east. The Dutch settlers at Amboyna
                    have recently established cocoa plantations at various points, and the
                    Government encourages their formation. The inhabitants are mostly gathered in
                    villages along the coast; they are partly native Alfuroes and partly immigrant
                    Malays, with a considerable intermixture of Buginese, Macassars, Balinese, and
                    other races of the archipelago. Christianity has been introduced in various
                    districts, especially along the southern coast, but as yet with but little
                    practical benefit. A baneful influence has been exerted by a secret society
                    called the Kakian Union, to which pagans, Mahometans, and Christians
                    indiscriminately attached themselves; and it has several times cost the Dutch
                    authorities considerable efforts to frustrate their machinations. A full account
                    of the union will be found in the fifth year of the <hi rend="italic"

                    195,000, of whom the lands on the south coast contain 65,000, the lands on the
                    north coast 40,000, and the south-western peninsula a large portion of the
                    remainder. There was a Dutch fort at Kambello, on the west side of Little Ceram,
                    as early as 1646. See Wallace’s <hi rend="italic">Malay Archipelago,</hi> and
