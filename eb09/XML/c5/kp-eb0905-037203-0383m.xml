                    shells of Foraminifera. In addition to calcium carbonate, chalk usually contains
                    about 5 per cent, of water, with some free silica and ferric oxide, besides
                    minor impurities. The red varieties of chalk may contain as much as 9 ’ 28 per
                    cent, of silica, 9 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 per cent, of ferric oxide,
                    and 1 ’ 42 per cent, of alumina (Clapham, <hi rend="italic">Chsm. News,</hi>
                    1862, vol. vi. p. 313.) Some of the red chalk of Norfolk gives, when treated
                    with acids, an argillaceous residue, which when air-dried has a weight equal to
                    9 ’ 3 per cent, that of the chalk taken, and has been found on analysis to
                    consist of water, ferric oxide, and alumina, with a small proportion of magnesia
                    and potash (Church, <hi rend="italic">Chem. News,</hi> 1875, vol. xxxi. p.
                    199.)</p>
                <p>The flooding of streams that flow through chalky ground is almost unknown, since
                    chalk is very porous, and will when dry take up nearly one-third of its bulk of
                    water (Ansted and Miller); and in some districts where chalk is the
                    surface-rock, the heaviest showers are absorbed as soon as they fall. During the
                    summer months, however, most of the rainfall penetrates only a few feet
                    downwards, and is consequently imbibed by vegetation or evaporated; for though
                    chalk is highly absorbent, its fine and close texture does not allow of the free
                    permeation of water. Occasionally, lower-lying beds of chalk have been drained,
                    whilst higher levels have remained charged with moisture. The circulation of
                    water in chalk strata is due, in fact, not so much to general percolation in the
                    mass, as to its flow either through fissures or, as in the case of deep-seated
                    and but little disturbed and creviced beds, along planes of stratification. As a
                    storehouse of water the chalk formation is of great importance, the artesian
                    wells of London and many other places being supplied directly or indirectly from
                    it. Where chalk forms the surface of the land, the yield of water may be very
                    large, as at the Tring cutting of the North-Western Railway, where it amounted
                    to upwards of a million gallons a day. Chalk is much used as a dressing for land
                    deficient in lime, and is of special value where the soil consists of a stiff
                    wet clay. The effect of the addition of chalk is to render the soil better able
                    to retain moisture, and to improve its texture. It is generally most efficacious
                    when used in moderate quantity every six or seven years. The renewal of the
                    supply of chalk is necessary owing to its removal from the surface by solution
                    and by the undermining action of earthworms. The chalk is not ploughed into the
                    land till it has been exposed to frost, which breaks it up into small squarish
                    fragments. In the Lincolnshire wolds, the process of chalking, in conjunction
                    with boning and manuring, has brought about a great improvement in the soil. In
                    Dorsetshire the land is usually chalked once in twenty years. The chalk is
                    spread on the ground in large lumps, which crumble down under the influence of
                    the weather; or it may be burnt and applied as lime. For sandy soils, oh'which
                    it acts as a cement, chalk is best adapted when marly in character. On poor
                    chalky ground, the sainfoin <hi rend="italic">(Onobrychis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sativa),</hi> a plant which flourishes in calcareous soils and is an excellent
                    fodder for cattle, has been cultivated with great success; and the herbage of
                    the chalk downs of Sussex, Wilts, and other counties of England, affords good
                    pasture for sheep.</p>
                <p>Chalk is employed medicinally as an antacid and mild astringent, either alone, or
                    together with other astringents, or combined with mercury as <hi rend="italic"
                    >hydrargyrum cum</hi><hi rend="italic">creta,</hi> but never in the crude state.
                    As none of the salts it forms is purgative, it is a valuable remedy in
                    diarrhoea. Externally, prepared chalk is used as a dessicant, and as a
                    protective application for ulcers and burns, and in intertrigo and other
                    affections of the skin. When taken for a prolonged period, chalk is apt to form
                    concretions in the stomach, for want of acid sufficient to dissolve it.</p>
                <p>Chalk is rarely hard enough to be used in any kind of building. When burnt to
                    lime it serves the same purposes as stone lime, but on account of its more rapid
                    absorption of carbonic acid gas, it is not so fit for general use as the latter,
                    except when fresh from the kiln. Chalk is employed in the manufacture of cements
                    and of carbonate of soda, in the preparation of carbonic acid gas, and in many
                    other chemical processes; also for making paints, crayons, and tooth-powder. <hi
