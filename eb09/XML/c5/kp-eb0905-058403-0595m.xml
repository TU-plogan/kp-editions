                    Cape Levi on the E. and Cape La Hogue on the W.,and is distant 75 miles from the
                    Isle of Wight, 41 miles W. by N. from St Lo, and 212 in the same direction from
                    Paris. The town in itself is small and unimportant. Its houses are built of
                    stone and roofed with slate; but the streets are narrow, and the only public
                    buildings of any interest are the tower (a remnant of the old fortifications),
                    the church of La Trinité, in front of which is the colossal statue of Napoleon
                    I. by Level; the Chapelle de Nôtre Dame du Voeu, formerly part of the abbey
                    founded by the Empress Maude in the 12th century; the Hôtel de Ville, which
                    contains the Henry Museum and the library; the bathing establishments, opened in
                    1827; and the theatre. The town is supplied with water <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0596-0585"/> from a reservoir completed in 1874 at Château
                    d’Eau, about three quarters of a mile distant, and capable of containing upwards
                    of 500,000 gallons. Cherbourg derives its chief importance from its naval and
                    commercial harbours, which are distant from each other about half a mile. The
                    former is cut out of the rock, and is capable of accommodating fifty men-of-war
                    of the largest size. The depth of water at full tide is 50 feet, at low tide 25
                    feet. Connected with the harbour are the dry docks, the yards where the largest
                    ships in the French navy are constructed, the magazines, the rope walks, and the
                    various workshops requisite for a naval arsenal of the first class. The works
                    are carefully guarded on every side by redoubts and fortifications, and are
                    commanded by batteries on the surrounding hills <hi rend="smallcaps">sq</hi>
                    completely that the harbour of Cherbourg may be pronounced one of the strongest
                    in the world. The commercial harbour at the mouth of the Divette communicates
                    with the sea by a canal 650 feet in length and 54 in width. It consists of two
                    parts, an outer harbour 262 yards long by 218 wide, and a basin 446 yards long
                    and 138 wide, in which the depth of water is 19 feet at low tide, and will be
                    increased by the dredging operations commenced in 1874. Outside these harbours
                    is the triangular bay, which forms the roads of Cherbourg. This bay is admirably
                    sheltered by the land on every side but the north. To protect the shipping from
                    the violence of the north winds the great <hi rend="italic">digue,</hi> or
                    breakwater, has been constructed. This immense work is 2½ miles in length; its
                    breadth at the base is 262 feet, and at the summit 101 feet. Its foundation was
                    formed by massy wooden frames, which were sunk and filled with stones; and it is
                    now protected from the waves by a parallel line of large blocks weighing each 44
                    tons. The industrial activity of Cherbourg is considerable, its principal
                    products being cotton yarn, refined sugar, soda, leather, and chemicals. A lace
                    factory gives employment to nearly 400 women. The chief articles of export are
                    farm and dairy produce, more especially potatoes, butter, and pigs; and the
                    imports consist mainly of coal, iron, timber, and cotton. The population in 1846
                    was 22,460; in 1872 it amounted to 34,785.</p>
                <p>Cherbourg is supposed by some investigators to occupy the site of the Roman
                    station of <hi rend="italic">Coriallum,</hi> but nothing definite is known about
                    its origin. The name was long regarded as a corruption of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caesaris</hi><hi rend="italic">Burgus,</hi> or Caesar’s Borough, but there is
                    at least as much probability that it is the same as the English Scarborough. The
                    castle is mentioned in the 11th century, and the town certainly existed in the
                    10th. William the Conqueror supplied it with a hospital and a church; and Henry
                    II. on several occasions chose it as his residence. In 1295, it was pillaged by
                    an English fleet from Yarmouth; and in the 14th century it frequently suffered
                    during the invasions of Normandy. Captured by the English in 1418 after a four
                    months’ siege, it was recovered by Charles VII. of France in 1450. An attempt
                    was made under Louis XIV. to construct a military port; but the fortifications
                    were dismantled in 1689, and further damage was inflicted by the English in 1758
                    Louis XVI. commenced the construction of the breakwater, and his plans were
                    afterwards carried out and extended by Napoleon I., who is said to have declared
                    that he would renew at Cherbourg the wonders of Egypt, and raise his pyramid in
                    the sea. It was left, however, to Louis Philippe, and particularly to Napoleon
                    III., to complete his designs; and their successful realization was celebrated
                    in 1858, in the presence of the Queen of England, against whose dominions they
                    had at one time been mainly directed. Between 1783 and the close of 1857,
                    66,862,000 francs had been expended on the works.</p>
