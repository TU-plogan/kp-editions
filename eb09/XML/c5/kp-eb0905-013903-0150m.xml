                    (1649-1715), a Scottish clergyman, born at Cathcart, near Glasgow, on the 11th
                    February 1649, was the son of the Rev. John Carstares, a member of the extreme
                    Covenanting party of Protestors. He was educated at the university of Edinburgh,
                    and then passed over to Utrecht, where he commenced his life-long friendship
                    with the prince of Orange, and began to take an active part in the politics of
                    his country. At this time the state of Scotland was restless and unhappy in the
                    extreme; and it was natural, therefore, that the Government should desire to
                    silence Carstares, whom it had several reasons to dislike. He was the intimate
                    of William; he had been the bearer of messages between the disaffected in
                    Scotland and Holland; and he was believed to be concerned with the learned James
                    Steuart in the authorship of a severe pamphlet— <hi rend="italic">An Account of

                    Accordingly, on his return to England, at the close of 1674, he was committed to
                    the Tower; the following year he was transferred to Edinburgh Castle, and it was
                    not till August 1679 that he was released. After this he visited Ireland, and
                    then became <pb break="no"

                    atCheshunt. During 1682 he was in Holland, but in the following year he was
                    again in London, and was implicated in the Rye House Plot. On its discovery he
                    was examined before the Scottish Council; but, though the torture of the
                    thumb-screw was applied, he refused to utter a word till he was assured that his
                    admissions would not be used in evidence, and in the disclosures he then made he
                    displayed great discretion. On his return to Holland he was rewarded by
                    William’s still warmer friendship, and the post of court chaplain; and after the
                    Revolution he continued to hold this office, under the title of royal chaplain
                    for Scotland. He was the confidential adviser of the king, especially with
                    regard to the affairs of his native country, and rendered important service to
                    Presbyterianism, in promoting the Revolution Settlement.</p>
                <p>At the accession of Anne, Carstares retained his post as royal chaplain, but
                    resided in Edinburgh, having been elected principal of the University. He was
                    also minister of Greyfriars, and afterwards of St Giles, and was four times
                    chosen moderator of the General Assembly. He took an important part, too, in
                    promoting the Union, and was consulted by Harley and other leading Englishmen
                    concerning it. During Anne’s reign, the chief object of his policy was to
                    frustrate the measures which were planned by Lord Oxford to strengthen the
                    Episcopalian Jacobites,— especially a Bill for extending the privileges of the
                    Episcopalians, and the Bill for replacing in the hands of the old patrons the
                    right of patronage, which by the Revolution Settlement had been vested in the
                    elders and the Protestant heritors.</p>
                <p>On the accession of George I. Carstares was appointed, with five others, to
                    welcome the new dynasty in the name of the Scottish Church. He was received
                    graciously and with hearty thanks for his services, and the office of royal
                    chaplain was again conferred upon him. A few months after he was struck with
                    apoplexy, and died on the 28th of December 1715.</p>
