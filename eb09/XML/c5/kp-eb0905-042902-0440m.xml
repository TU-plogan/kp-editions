                    a designer and painter, more especially of military subjects, was born in Paris
                    on 20th December 1792, and died there on 30th October 1845. He was the son of a
                    dragoon in the Republican army, whose death in the ranks left the widow and
                    orphan in very poor circumstances. Madame Charlet, however, a woman of
                    determined spirit and an extreme Napoleonist, managed to give her boy a moderate
                    education at the Lycée Napoléon, and was repaid by his lifelong affection. His
                    first employment was in a Parisian mairie, where he had to register recruits: he
                    served in the National Guard in 1814, fought bravely at the Barrière de Clichy,
                    and, being thus unacceptable to the Bourbon party, was dismissed from the mairie
                    in 1816. He then, having from a very early age had a propensity for drawing,
                    entered the atelier of the distinguished painter Baron Gros, and soon began
                    issuing the first of those lithographed designs which eventually brought him
                    renown. His Grenadier de</p>
                <p>Waterloo, with the motto “La Garde meurt et ne se rend pas” (a famous phrase
                    which has got attributed to Cambronne, but which he never uttered, and which
                    cannot, perhaps, be traced farther than to this lithograph by Charlet), was
                    particularly popular. It was only towards 1822, however, that he began to be
                    successful in a professional sense. Lithographs (about 2000 altogether),
                    water-colours, sepia-drawings, numerous oil sketches, and a few etchings
                    followed one another rapidly; there were also three exhibited oil pictures, the
                    first of which was especially admired—Episode in the Campaign of Russia (1836),
                    the Passage of the Rhine by Moreau (1837), Wounded Soldiers Halting in a Ravine
                    (1843). Besides the military subjects in which he peculiarly delighted, and
                    which found an energetic response in the popular heart, and kept alive a feeling
                    of regret for the recent past of the French nation and discontent with the
                    present— a feeling which increased upon the artist himself towards the close of
                    his career,—Charlet designed many subjects of town life and peasant life, the
                    ways of children, &amp;c., with much wit and whim in the descriptive mottoes.
                    One of the most famous sets is the Vie Civile, Politique, et Militaire du
                    Caporal Valentin, 50 lithographs, dating from 1838 to 1842. In 1838 his health
                    began to fail, owing to an affection of the chest. Charlet was an uncommonly
                    tall man, with an expressive face, bantering and good natured; his character
                    corresponded, full of boyish fun and high spirits, with manly independence, and
                    a vein of religious feeling, and he was a hearty favourite among his intimates,
                    one of whom was the celebrated painter Géricault. Charlet married in 1824, and
                    two sons survived him. A life of him was published in 1856 by a military friend,
                    De la Combe.</p>
