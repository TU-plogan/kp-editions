                    apprenticed to a gardener, from which employment he ran away. Among the
                    neighbours his manners and habits made an unfavourable impression. He enlisted
                    in the militia, tried camp life with gipsies, and wrought as a lime burner in
                    1817, but the following year he was obliged to accept parish relief. In 1820
                    appeared his <hi rend="italic">Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery,</hi>
                    which were very indulgently received, and the year following his <hi
                    rend="italic">Village Minstrel and other Poems</hi> were published. He was
                    greatly patronized; fame, with many curious visitors, broke the tenor of his
                    life, and dangerous habits were formed. From subscriptions he became possessed
                    of £45 annually, a sum far beyond what he had ever earned, but new wants made
                    his income insufficient, and in 1823 he was nearly penniless. His next volume,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd's Calendar,</hi> 1827, met with little success,
                    which was not increased by his hawking it himself. As he wrought again on the
                    fields his health improved; but farm operations being unsuccessful he was “as
                    dull as a fog in November,” and became seriously unwell. Although a noble patron
                    presented him with a new cottage and a piece of ground, Clare was full of
                    anguish to leave the “old home of homes.” The removal to Northborough was his
                    culminating period, and gradually his mind gave way. His last and best work, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rural Muse,</hi> published in 1835, was noticed by
                    “Christopher North” alone. Bursts of insanity followed, of which he had for some
                    time shown symptoms; and in July 1837 he was kept in confinement, and was
                    subsequently lodged in Northampton General Lunatic Asylum, where he died May 20,
                    1864. The neglect of friends and relatives to visit him, together with the
                    non-success of his later poems, preyed heavily upon his mind. In the asylum he
                    penned his most thrilling poem, beginning—“I am! yet what I am who cares or
                    knows î” In its exceeding sadness of thought there is sublime feeling, —a strain
                    of divine music in the wail of woe,—and the poet longed to</p>
                <p>“Sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept Full of high thoughts, unborn. So let me
                    lie, The grass below, above the vaulted sky.”</p>
                <p>Clare was one of our most uneducated poets, and sung from the fulness of his
                    heart; he is one of England’s sweetest singers of nature, whose thoughts “gild
                    life’s brambles with a flower,” and whose songs were gathered from the fields.
                    Many of his sonnets, which display great power of word-painting, are sweet as
                    “sunshine in summer dream.” His ballads and love-songs are wild flowers strewn
                    at will, which “art and fashion fling as weeds away,” and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eternity of Nature,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">First Love's Recollections</hi>
                    display deftness of touch, pastoral beauty, and genuine poetic ability. All his
                    love and genius were showered on beautifying the rural scenes and humble
                    incidents of his surroundings. His poems, drawn with a delicate hand, are those
                    of a keen observer, but they greatly want that vigour which is essential to
                    popularity; in his own words, “the tide of fashion is a stream too strong for
                    pastoral brooks that gently flow and sing.”</p>
