                    Association,” the result being the appearance of the People’s Charter, which
                    embodied in the six following points the programme of their party:—(1) annual
                    parliaments; (2) universal suffrage; (3) vote by ballot; (4) abolition of the
                    property qualification for membership of the House of Commons; (5) payment of
                    members; (6) equal electoral districts. The most influential of the six members
                    of the House who took part in the drawing up of the charter was O’Connell, and
                    the methods adopted for the propagation of their views were those practised by
                    the great agitator with such success. Monster meetings were held, at which
                    seditious language was occasionally spoken, and slight collisions with the
                    military took place. Petitions of enormous size, signed in great part with
                    fictitious names, were presented to Parliament; and a great many newspapers were
                    started, of which the <hi rend="italic">Northern Star,</hi> conducted by Feargus
                    O’Connor, the active leader of the movement, had a circulation of 50,000. In
                    1840 the Chartist movement was still further organized by the inauguration at
                    Manchester of the National Charter Association, which rapidly became powerful,
                    being the head of about 400 sister societies, which are said to have numbered
                    40,000 members. Some time after, efforts were made towards a coalition with the
                    more moderate radicals, but these failed; and a land scheme was started by
                    O’Connor, which prospered for a few years. In 1844 the fanatical spirit of some
                    of the leaders was only too well illustrated by their attitude towards the
                    Anti-Corn-Law League. O’Connor, especially, entered into a public controversy
                    with Cobden and Bright, in which he was worsted; and he even endeavoured to
                    defeat the purpose of the League. But it was not till 1848, during a season of
                    great suffering among the working classes, and under the influence of the
                    revolution at Paris, that the real strength of the Chartist movement was
                    discovered, and the prevalent discontent became known. Early in March
                    disturbances occurred in Glasgow which required the intervention of the
                    military, while in the manufacturing districts all over the West of Scotland the
                    operatives were ready to rise, in the event of the main movement succeeding.
                    Some agitation, too, took place in Edinburgh and in Manchester, but of a milder
                    nature; in fact, while there was a real and wide-spread discontent, men were
                    indisposed to resort to decided measures. The principal scene of intended
                    Chartist demonstration was London. An enormous gathering of half a million was
                    announced for the 10th April on Kennington Common, from which they were to march
                    on the Houses of Parliament to present a petition signed by nearly six million
                    names, in order by this imposing display of numbers to secure the enactment of
                    the six points. Probably some of the more violent members of the party thought
                    to imitate the Parisian mob by taking power entirely into their own hands. The
                    announcement of the procession excited great alarm, and the most decided
                    measures were taken by the authorities to prevent a rising. The procession was
                    forbidden. The military was called out under the command of the Duke of
                    Wellington, and by him concealed near the bridges and other points where the
                    procession might attempt to force its way. Even the Bank and other public
                    buildings were put in a state of defence, and special constables, to the number,
                    it is said, of 170,000, were enrolled, one of whom was destined shortly after to
                    be the emperor of the French. After all these gigantic preparations on both
                    sides the Chartist demonstration proved to be a very insignificant affair.
                    Instead of half a million, only about 50,000 assembled on Kennington Common, and
                    their leaders, Feargus O’Connor and Ernest Jones, shrank from the responsibility
                    of braving the authorities by conducting the procession to the Houses of
                    Parliament. The monster petition was duly presented, and scrutinized, with the
                    result that the number of signatures was found to have been grossly exaggerated,
                    and that the most unheard of falsification of names had been resorted to.
                    Thereafter the movement specially called Chartism soon died out. The return of
                    national prosperity relieved the working classes of their most pressing
                    grievances; and subseqent legislative changes have in great measure removed the
                    causes that existed for discontent among the classes which mainly supported the
                    charter.</p>
