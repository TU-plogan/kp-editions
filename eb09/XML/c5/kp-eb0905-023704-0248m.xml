                    to that of John Baptist to the early Christian church, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ι.e.,</hi> he w as the forerunner and prophet of the coming dispensation, not
                    the founder of a new sect; and indeed the only connection which Irving seems to
                    have had with the existing organization of the Catholic Apostolic body was in
                    “fostering spiritual persons who had been driven out of other congregations for
                    the exercise of their spiritual gifts.” Shortly after Irving’s trial and
                    deposition, certain persons were at some meetings held for prayer designated as
                    “called to be apostles of the Lord” by certain others claiming prophetic gifts.
                    In the year 1835, six months after Irving’s death, six others were similarly
                    designated as “called” to complete the number of the “twelve,” who were then
                    formally “separated” by the pastors of the local congregations to which they
                    belonged to their higher office in the universal church on the 14th July 1835.
                    This separation is understood by the community not as “in any sense being a
                    schism or separation from the one Catholic Church, but a separation to a special
                    work of blessing and intercession on behalf of it.” The twelve were afterwards
                    guided to ordain others,—twelve prophets, twelve evangelists, and twelve
                    pastors, “sharing equally with them the one Catholic Episcopate,” and also seven
                    deacons for administering the temporal affairs of the Church Catholic. The
                    central episcopacy of eight-and-forty was regarded as “indicated by prophecy,”
                    being foreshown in the forty-eight boards of the Mosaic Tabernacle. For
                    ecclesiastical purposes the church universal is under their charge in twelve
                    tribes; for Christendom is considered <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n249/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0249-0238"/> to be divided into twelve portions or tribes,
                    each tribe being under the special charge of an apostle and his coministers, and
                    the seat of the Apostolic College being at Albury in England.</p>
                <p>For the service of the church a comprehensive book of liturgies and offices was
                    provided by the “apostles;” and lights, incense, vestments, holy oil, water,
                    chrism, and other adjuncts of worship have been appointed by their authority.
                    The ceremonial in its completeness may be seen in the church in Gordon Square,
                    London, and elsewhere. The daily worship consists of “matins” with <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> proposition” (or exposition) of the sacrament at 6
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.,</hi> prayers at 9 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> and
                    3 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.,</hi> and “vespers” with “proposition” at 5 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> On all Sundays and holy days there is a “solemn
                    celebration of the Eucharist” at the high altar; on Sundays this is at 10 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> On other days “low celebrations” are held in the
                    side-chapels, which with the chancel in all churches correctly built after
                    apostolic directions are separated or marked off from the nave by open screens
                    with gates.</p>
                <p>Each congregation is presided over by its “angel” or bishop (who ranks as pastor
                    in the Universal Church); under him are four-and-twenty priests, divided into
                    the four ministries of “elders, prophets, evangelists, and pastors,” and with
                    these are the deacons, seven of whom regulate the temporal affairs of the
                    church—besides whom there are also “sub-deacons, acolytes, singers, and
                    doorkeepers.” The understanding is that each elder, with his co-presbyters and
                    deacons, shall have charge of 500 adult communicants in his district; but this
                    has been but partially carried into practice. This is the full constitution of
                    each particular church or congregation as founded by the “restored apostles,”
                    each local church thus “reflecting in its government the government of the
                    Church Catholic by the angel or high priest Jesus Christ, and His forty-eight
                    presbyters in their fourfold ministry (in which apostles and elders always rank
                    first), and under these the deacons of the Church Catholic.” The priesthood is
                    supported by tithes; it being deemed a duty on the part of all members of the
                    church who receive yearly incomes to offer a tithe of their increase every week,
                    besides the free-will offering for the support of the place of worship, and for
                    the relief of distress. Each local church sends “a tithe of its tithes” to the
                    “Temple,” by which the ministers of the Universal Church are supported; by these
                    offerings, too, the needs of poorer churches are supplied, and other expenses
                    connected with the administration of the Church Catholic. From recent statements
                    made by members of this community it appears to be making steady progress. It
                    claims to have among its clergy many of the Roman, Anglican, and other churches,
                    the orders of those ordained by Greek, Roman, and Anglican bishops being
                    recognized by it with the simple confirmation of an “apostolic act.'*</p>
