                    annelid worms, with crustaceans, and with spiders, by which they are marked as a
                    transition group, intermediate between the lower and higher Articulata.
                    Myriapods (∕x,υpιαs, ten thousand, and που?, a foot) are elongated worm-like
                    creatures, cylindrical or flattened, and composed of numerous segments, each
                    bearing one or two pairs of jointed legs,—those on the anterior segments being
                    modified, as in the Crustacea, so as to form the organs of the mouth. The
                    fang-like, prehensile jaws of the centipede, perforated at their extremities to
                    allow of the passage of the liquid venom into the wound they have inflicted, are
                    thus simply modifications of a pair of legs. The eyes consist of a number of <hi
                    rend="italic">ocelli,</hi> congregated together on the head, aud, with a single
                    exception, are never compound, as in insects. Like the latter, they breathe by
                    means of tracheal tubes, opening by stigmata placed on both sides, behind the
                    insertion of the legs, and kept permanently open by a spiral chitinous fibre.
                    They are unisexual, the organs of generation being, however, differently placed
                    in the two groups, occurring anteriorly in millepedes, and posteriorly in
                    centipedes. The young of many species closely resemble their parents from the
                    time they leave the egg, only with fewer limbs and segments; these, however,
                    increase with each successive moulting until the normal number of the adult is
                    reached. Other species, as those of the family <hi rend="italic">Julidoe,</hi>
                    undergo, during their period of growth, modifications closely resembling the
                    metamorphoses of insects. Their larvae at first either are destitute of legs, or
                    have only three pairs situated anteriorly; and it is only after a long series of
                    moultings, extending in some cases over two years, that their maturity is
                    signalized by the appearance of sexual organs.</p>
                <p>Myriapods have been usually divided into the two orders <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ckilognatfιa</hi> or Millepedes and <hi rend="italic">Chiloρoda</hi> or
                    Centipedes; but recently a small myriapod, ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ⅛th of
                    an inch in length, was discovered by Sir J. Lubbock, among decomposing vegetable
                    matter, differing from the other members of the class in the absence of
                    tracheae, apparently absorbing air through its semi-transparent skin, in the
                    smaller number of its legs (nine pairs), and in the bifid character of its
                    antennae; and this has been made the type of a third order— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pauropidae. Pauropus Huxleyi</hi> Lubbock describes as an active, cleanly
                    little creature, with a look of cheerful intelligence, in marked contrast to the
                    dull stupidity of the <hi rend="italic">Julidoe,</hi> or the melancholy ferocity
                    of the centipede. Millepedes, or “Thousand-Legs,” are readily distinguished from
                    the other group by their antennae, which are always six or seven jointed, by the
                    generally cylindrical shape of the body, and by the possession of two pairs of
                    legs on each segment—the last posterior segments and a few anterior excepted.
                    Each segment also bears a pair of stigmata or tracheal openings, instead of
                    every alternate one, as in centipedes; and this fact, taken in connection with
                    the double quantity of legs, has led to the belief that each segment in the
                    millepede has been formed by the union of two, a view further strengthened by
                    the presence of a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n352/mode/1up"

                    each. The legs of millepedes though numerous are exceedingly weak, and in moving
                    they appear to glide along like footless worms. They are most frequently found
                    among damp moss, and beneath masses of decaying vegetable matter on which they
                    feed; and when in danger they roll themselves into a ball. The British species
                    are few, and the largest of these does not exceed 2 inches in length; but there
                    is an American form which attains a length of 8 inches, All are equally
                    harmless, the prehensile jaws being rudimentary, while the other parts of the
                    mouth are modified to suit their purely vegetable diet.</p>
                <p>Centipedes, or “Hundred-Legs,” have their segments flattened, and covered with a
                    leathery skin, and have one pair of legs on each segment, the posterior pair
                    being directed backwards and elongated so as to resemble a couple of jointed
                    tails. Their antennae have not less than fourteen and rarely more than forty
                    joints, while the body segments do not usually exceed twenty. The organs of the
                    mouth are masticatory, and are admirably adapted to the carnivorous habits of
                    the centipede. It feeds principally on insects, seizing them with its powerful
                    prehensile organs, and injecting at the same time its venom into the wound. The
                    bite of the larger forms, as <hi rend="italic">Scolopendra morsitαns,</hi>
                    occurring in tropical countries, is exceedingly painful, and is described by
                    those who have suffered from it “as similar to what might be produced by contact
                    with a red-hot iron,” giving rise to swelling, throbbing pains, and febrile
                    symptoms (Dr Collingwood’s <hi rend="italic">Naturalist’s Rambles in the China
                    Seas).</hi> These, however, yield readily to an application of ammonia.
                    Centipedes seldom exceed a foot in length. They are exceedingly active in
                    pursuit of their prey, insinuating their many-jointed and flattened bodies under
                    stones, beneath the bark of trees, and wherever insects usually lurk. <hi
                    rend="italic">Lithobius forcipatus,</hi> the commonest British species, is 2
                    inches long, and quite harmless, although when seized it attempts to fix its
                    jaws into the skin of its captor. The species belonging to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Geophilus</hi> are said to be luminous in the dark. Upwards of
                    twenty species of fossil Myriapoda are known,— the oldest from the Coal Measures
                    of North America, and belonging to the millepede or vegetable-eating division.
                    One of these, <hi rend="italic">Xylobius</hi><hi rend="italic">sigillaria,</hi>
                    was found in the hollow trunks of the fossil <hi rend="italic"
