                    eminent men of learning. Among his intimate associates were Jonson, Suckling,
                    and Cowley; and at his country seat, Great Tew in Oxfordshire, he subsequently
                    gathered around him a small group of theologians whose liberal opinions were not
                    without influence in the religious rivalries of the day. In 1633 he succeeded to
                    his father’s title, and was appointed gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles
                    I. In 1640 he entered the House of Commons as member for Newport, Isle of Wight,
                    and quickly assumed there a prominent part upon the side of the king, while at
                    the same time he supported Pym in his schemes of moderate reform in church and
                    state, and himself introduced the Bill for the exclusion of bishops from the
                    House of Peers. But having been chosen by Charles to be one of his secretaries
                    of state, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n182/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0182-0171"/> Falkland found himself irretrievably committed to
                    a cause which he could not wholly approve, and to the service of a king whom in
                    his heart he distrusted, though his chivalry forbad him to abandon his cause. On
                    the eve of the Civil War he joined his royal master at York, and having raised a
                    troop of horse, did good service at Edgehill, Oxford, and the siege of
                    Gloucester. In the indecisive battle of Newbury (20th September 1643) he fell
                    fighting in the front rank of Lord Byron’s regiment, with the words “Peace,
                    Peace” upon his lips. Had his life been spared it is possible that he might at
                    least have succeeded in mitigating the rancour of the contending parties. His
                    poems and political writings, published after his death, do not increase a
                    reputation which is based rather upon single-mindedness and patriotic
                    self-devotion than upon his contributions to literature.</p>
