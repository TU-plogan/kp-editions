                    the ancient <hi rend="italic">Cephallenia,</hi> an island belonging to the
                    kingdom of Greece, and the largest of those known as the Ionian Islands, is
                    situated on the west side of the mainland, almost directly opposite the Gulf of
                    Corinth. Its extreme length is 31 miles, and its breadth varies from about 20
                    miles in the southern portion to three or less in the projecting part, which
                    runs parallel with the island of Ithaca, at a distance of about four miles
                    across the strait of Guiscardo or Viscaro. The whole island, with its area of
                    348 English square miles, is. covered with rocky hills of varying elevation, the
                    main range running from north-west to south-east. The ancient <pb break="no"

                    Mountain, has a height of 5300 feet, and frequently retains the snow for several
                    months. It is not only the loftiest part of the sierra, but also the highest
                    land in the whole Ionian group. The name “Black” was given from the darkness of
                    the pine woods which still constitute the most striking feature in Cephalonian
                    scenery, although their extent has been greatly curtailed by fire. On the summit
                    there is still to be seen an ancient altar, surrounded by the bones of former
                    sacrifice. The island is ill supplied with fresh water; there are few permanent
                    streams except the Rakli, and springs are apt to fail in dry summers. In the
                    western part of the island a gulf runs up from the south a distance of about
                    seven miles; on its east side stands the chief town Argostoli, with about 9000
                    inhabitants, and on its west side the rival city of Lixuri, with 6000. About
                    five miles from Argostoli is the Castle of St George, a building of Venetian
                    origin, and the strongest fortification in the island; and between St George and
                    the village of Mataxata, where Byron at one time resided, are several large
                    catacombs. On an eminence east-south-east of Argostoli are the ruins of the
                    ancient Cranii, and Lixuri is close to or upon those of Pale; while on the other
                    side of the island are the remains of Samos on the bay of the same name, of
                    Proni or Pronni, further south above the vale of Rakli and its blossoming
                    oleanders, and of an unknown city near the village of Scala. The ruins of this
                    city include Roman baths, a brick-built temple, rock-cut tombs, and tesselated
                    pavements; and Cranii, Proni, and Samos are remarkable for stretches of
                    Cyclopean and Hellenic walls, partly of the most irregular construction, and
                    partly preserving almost unimpaired the results of the most perfect skill. The
                    inhabitants of Cephalonia have all along been extremely active; and no slight
                    amount of toil has been expended in the construction of terraces on the steep
                    sides of the hills. Owing to the thinness of the population, however, but a
                    small proportion of the soil is under cultivation, and the quantity of grain
                    grown in the island is comparatively meagre. The staple is the currant, in the
                    production of which the island surpasses Zante. The fruit is smaller than that
                    of the Morea, and has a peculiar flavour; it finds a market mainly in Holland,
                    Belgium, and Germany. The grape vine is also grown, and the manufacture of wine
                    is a rising industry. The olive crop is of considerable importance, and within
                    recent years the culture of cotton in the low grounds has been successfully
                    attempted. Manufactures are few and undeveloped, but lace from the aloe fibre,
                    Turkey carpets, and basket-work are produced by the villagers, and boats are
                    built at both the principal towns. Among recent improvements may be mentioned
                    the erection of two steam-mills and the introduction of steam-boat communication
                    between Argostoli and Lixuri. In 1873 there were exported from the island
                    19,603,933 lb of native currants, of the value of £123,176; and in the same year
                    the re-exportation of Morea currants was 4,567,192 ft&gt;, valued at £25,728.
                    The total imports, which consist mainly of wheat, maize, barley, and rye,
                    amounted to £287,493. Of all the seven islands Cephalonia and Zante are most
                    purely Greek; and the inhabitants display great mental activity. Of several
                    contributors to the national literature may be mentioned Bishop Maniati, author
                    of a treatise on the schism of the Eastern and Western churches, and Andrea
                    Lascarato, a vigorous political writer and keen defender of the British
                    protectorate, who brought himself into great trouble by the freedom of his
                    attacks in his <hi rend="italic">Mysteries of Cephalonia.</hi></p>
                <p>In the Homeric poems, Cephalonia is mentioned under the name of Same, and its
                    inhabitants, among the subjects of Ulysses, are designated Cephallenes. In the
                    Persian war they took but little part; in the Peloponnesian they sided with the
                    Athenians. The town of Pale was vainly besieged by Philip of Macedon in 218 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> because it had supported the Aetolian cause. In 189
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> all the cities surrendered to the Romans, but
                    Same afterwards revolted, and was only reduced after a siege of four months. The
                    island was presented by Hadrian to Athens, but it appears again at a later date
                    as “free and autonomous.” After the division of the Roman empire, it continued
                    attached to Byzantium till 1082, when it was captured by Robert Guiscard, who
                    died, however, before he could repress the revolt of 1085. In 1204 it was
                    assigned to Gaius, prince of Tarentum, who accepted the protection of Venice in
                    1215; and after 1225 it was held along with Santa Maria and Zante by a
                    succession of five counts of the Tocco family at Naples. Formally made over to
                    Venice in 1350 by the prince of Tarentum, it was afterwards captured by the
                    Turks in 1479; but the Hispanico-Venetian fleet under Benedetto Pessaro and
                    Gonsalvo of Cordova effected their expulsion in 1500, and the island continued
                    in Venetian possession till the fall of the republic. For sometime it was
                    administered for the French Government, but in 1809 it was taken by the English
                    under Collingwood. Till 1813 it was in the hands of Major de Bosset, a Swiss in
                    the British service, who displayed an industry and energy in the repression of
                    injustice and development of civilization only outdone by the despotic vigour of
                    Sir Charles Napier, who held the same office for the nine years from 1818-1827.
                    During the British protectorate the island made undoubted advances in material
                    prosperity, but was several times the scene of political disturbances. It
                    retained longer than the sister islands traces of feudal influence exerted by
                    the landed proprietors, but has been gradually becoming more democratic. Under
                    the Venetians it was divided into eight districts, and an elaborate system of
                    police was in force; since its annexation to Greece it has been broken up into
                    twenty demarchias, each with its separate jurisdiction and revenues, and the
                    police system has been abolished.</p>
                <p>A special treatise on the antiquities of Cephalonia was written by Petrus
                    Maurocenus. See also Holland’s <hi rend="italic">Travels,</hi> 1815; Ansted’s
