                <p><label type="entry">CINCINNATI</label>, an important city of the United States,
                    situated in the S.W. part of Ohio, on the N. bank of the Ohio River, in 39° 6'
                    N. lat and 84° 26' W. long. It is the capital of Hamilton county, and in size is
                    the first city in the State, while, according to the Federal census of 1870, it
                    is the eighth in the United States. It was first settled in 1788 by persons from
                    New Jersey, and is said to have been named in honour of the Cincinnati Society
                    of officers of the Revolutionary war. It was incorporated as a city in 1814, and
                    soon acquired a commercial importance which has steadily increased. In 1800
                    Cincinnati contained but 750 inhabitants. The population amounted to 9602 in
                    1820, 46,338 in 1840, 115,436 in 1850, 161,044 in 1860, and 216,239 in 1870. Of
                    the total population in 1870, 79,612 were foreigners, including 49,448 born in
                    Germany, 18,624 in Ireland, 3526 in England, and 2093 in France. The city is
                    chiefly built upon two terraces or plateaus, the first 60 and the second 112
                    feet above the river. Beyond these rises an amphitheatre of hills from 400 to
                    450 feet high, from which may be obtained a magnificent view of the valley of
                    the Ohio and the surrounding country. On the opposite bank of the river, in the
                    State of Kentucky, are Covington, which had 24,505 inhabitants in 1870, and
                    Newport, which had 15,087. Communication between these cities and Cincinnati is
                    afforded by two bridges and three steam ferries. The wire suspension bridge,
                    which is 1057 feet long between the towers (or, including the approaches, 2252
                    feet), with a height of 100 feet above low water, was completed in 1867 at a
                    cost of nearly $2,000,000. It has a double waggon road, and two ways for
                    pedestrians. Further up the river is a wrought iron railroad bridge built upon
                    piers; besides a railway track, it has waggon and foot ways. Cincinnati covers
                    an area of 24 square miles, extending along the river about 10 miles, with an
                    average width of 3 miles. The most important part of the city, however, is
                    comprised within a distance of 2½ miles along the river. The corporate limits
                    have been much extended in recent years by the annexation of numerous villages,
                    the most important being Columbia, Walnut Hills, Mount Auburn, and Cumminsville.
                    In these, which still retain their former names, are seen the most costly
                    residences and villas, with ornamental grounds embracing from 5 to 80 acres
                    each. The city is also noted for the beauty of its suburbs and its surrounding
                    scenery. The streets, which generally cross one another at right angles, are
                    usually from 1½ to 2½ miles long, and from 50 to 100 feet wide. Many of them are
                    lined with trees. Brick is chiefly used for buildings, with a greyish buff
                    freestone for fronts. Business buildings are usually five and often six stories
                    high. Cincinnati is well supplied with public parks, the largest of which, Eden,
                    is situated on a hill in the eastern part of the city, and contains 216 acres.
                    In Burnet Woods, recently purchased, there are 170 acres, mostly forest, on the
                    hill north of the city. Centrally situated in the city are Washington, Lincoln,
                    Hopkins, and the City parks, which together contain about 25 acres. One of the
                    most attractive objects in the city is the Tyler Davidson bronze fountain which
                    was unveiled in 1871. It was presented to the city by Mr Henry Probasco, a
                    wealthy citizen, who named it after the late Mr Tyler Davidson, the originator
                    of the proposal. Its cost was nearly $200,000. The design embraces fifteen
                    bronze figures, all cast at Munich, the chief one representing a female with
                    outstretched arms, from whose fingers the water falls in fine spray This is the
                    surmounting figure, and reaches a height of 40 feet above the ground. Among the
                    most notable buildings is that of the Federal Government, built of sawed
                    freestone in the Roman Corinthian style, with a porch of six columns; it is
                    three stories high, with a length of 150 feet and a width of 80 feet. The county
                    court-house, in the same style of architecture, is 175 feet square and three
                    stories high, and has a porch with six Corinthian stone columns. The brick
                    buildings for the city offices are 205 feet long and 52 feet wide. The city
                    workhouse, 3½ miles from the heart of the city, is a brick structure, 515 feet
                    long and 55 feet wide, erected at a cost, including 26 acres of land, of
                    $650,000. It <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n796/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0796-0783"/> has room for 700 prisoners. The Cincinnati
                    hospital, comprising eight buildings arranged around a central court and
                    connected by corridors, occupies a square of 4 acres. It cost more than
                    $1,000,000, and will accommodate 700 patients. The Masonic Temple, built in the
                    Byzantine style, 195 feet long and 100 feet wide, is four stories high, and has
                    two towers 140 feet, and a spire 1δ0 feet high. Other noticeable structures are
                    Pike’s Opera House, 170 by 134 feet, and five stories high, the Public Library,
                    St Xavier’s College, the Wesleyan Female College, and the Hughes High School.
                    The most imposing church edifices are St Peter’s Roman Catholic Cathedral, built
                    in pure Grecian style, 200 by 80 feet, with a stone spire rising to a height of
                    224 feet; St Paul’s Church (Methodist), with a spire 200 feet high; the First
                    Presbyterian Church, with an immense tower surmounted by a spire 270 feet high;
                    St John’s Episcopal Church; and two large and attractive Hebrew temples.</p>
                <p>Cincinnati is one of the most important commercial aud manufacturing centres of
                    the West. The six railroads entering the city are used by twelve companies, and
                    besides these two lines terminate at Covington on the opposite side of the
                    river. About 300 passenger and freight trains arrive and leave daily on these
                    roads. For their use are four depots near the river in different parts of the
                    city. Communication with different parts of the city and with the suburbs is
                    afforded by fourteen lines of street railroad, with about 50 miles of track, and
                    by numerous lines of omnibuses and stages. The top of the adjacent hills is
                    reached by an inclined steam passenger-railway. The position of the city on the
                    Ohio River gives it water communication with the extensive river system of the
                    Mississippi valley; while it is connected with Lake Erie by the Miami Canal,
                    whose northern terminus is at Toledo, Ohio. The Miami is connected by a branch
                    with the Wabash and Erie Canal, the largest in the United States (467 miles),
                    which extends from Toledo to Evansville, Indiana, on the Ohio river. The average
                    yearly number of steamers and barges running between Cincinnati and other ports
                    during the ten years ending with August 1875 was 338; the yearly number of
                    arrivals of steamers during this period was 2713, and of departures 2680. The
                    large steamers of the Mississippi river are enabled to reach Cincinnati by means
                    of the canal around the falls of the Ohio at Louisville, Kentucky, which was
                    opened in 1872. About three-fourths of the commerce of the city is by railroad
                    and canal, and the remainder by river transportation. The extent of the entire
                    commerce is indicated by the value of imports, which during the ten years ending
                    in 1875 averaged $314,528,009 a year, and of exports, which averaged
                    $201,236,066.</p>
                <p>Cincinnati is one of those interior ports to which, under the Act of Congress
                    passed in 1870, foreign merchandize may be transported without appraisement and
                    payment of duties at the port of first arrival. The value of such imports to
                    this city during the year ending June 30, 1875, was $566,989. The total value of
                    the products of manufacturing industry has increased from $46,995,062 in 1860 to
                    $127,459,021 in 1870 and $144,207,371 in 1874. The details for the
                    last-mentioned years are as follows :—</p>

                <p>Boat building was formerly a prominent industry, but it has recently declined.
                    Prior to 1863 Cincinnati was the chief centre in the United States for the
                    slaughtering of swine and the packing of pork. Since that year this supremacy
                    has been held by Chicago, Cincinnati taking the second rank. There are more than
                    seventy establishments in the latter city employed in this industry. The United
                    Railroads Stock-yards for the reception of live pigs occupy about 60 acres.
                    During the winter season of 1874-75 there were slaughtered 560,164 hogs,
                    weighing in the aggregate 155,864,126 B⅛, and valued at $10,897,584. The
                    production included 44,232 barrels of pork, and 23,400,157 lb of lard. During
                    the year ending August 31, 1875, pork and bacon valued at $12,645,538 were
                    exported from the city; the imports amounted to $2,580,493. The excess of
                    exports of lard over imports was $2,781,091. After this important industry the
                    brewingof lager beer ranks next, the brewers here turning out about 15,000,000
                    gallons annually. Distillation is also carried on to a very considerable extent.
                    The city contains five national banks with a capital of $4,000,000, and
                    seventeen private banks with a capital of $2,740,000. The leading commercial
                    organization is the Chamber of Commerce and Merchants’ Exchange, which has about
                    1200 members and holds daily sessions. The Board of Trade has about 900 members,
                    chiefly manufacturers. There are also a mechanics’ institute, cotton exchange,
                    and pork packers’ association. An industrial exhibition has been held in the
                    autumn of each year since 1871, and has attracted large numbers of visitors to
                    the city. The buildings are centrally situated, and occupy 3½ acres of
                    ground.</p>
                <p>The city is divided into 25 wards, and is governed by a mayor, who is elected by
                    the people for two years, and receives an annual salary of $4000, a board of 25
                    aidermen, and a board of 50 councilmen, who are also elected by the people. It
                    has a paid fire department under the control of five commissioners appointed by
                    the mayor, and a pohce force under the control of the mayor and four
                    commissioners. The efficiency of these departments is promoted by extensive
                    fire-alarm and police telegraphic lines. The city is supplied with water
                    obtained by pumping from the Ohio river by means of three immense reservoirs,
                    two of which, with a capacity of 100,000,000 gallons each, are in Eden Park.
                    Beside the usual municipal and county courts, the United States circuit and
                    district courts for the southern district of Ohio are held in the city.</p>
                <p>Cincinnati has a large number and variety of well-organized charitable
                    institutions. The Cincinnati hospital is supported by taxation, and affords free
                    treatment to all unable to pay for it; the city infirmary, besides supporting
                    pauper inmates, affords relief to outdoor poor; the Good Samaritan and St Mary’s
                    hospitals are private institutions, under the supervision of Roman Catholic
                    sisters; the Jewish hospital is maintained by persons of that faith. The
                    Longview asylum for the insane, built at Carthage, 10 miles from the city, at a
                    cost, including 110 acres of land, of $1,000,000, ranks among the first
                    institutions of the kind in the United States. It belongs to Hamilton county,
                    whose population consists chiefly of the inhabitants of Cincinnati; patients
                    are, however, sent here by the State, which contributes to its support. The
                    average daily number of inmates in 1874 was 582, nearly all of whom were
                    maintained free of charge. Besides the city orphan asylum, which has
                    accommodation for 300 children, and is supported by private charity, and the
                    German Protestant asylum, with a capacity for about 100, two large asylums are
                    maintained by the Roman Catholics and by the coloured people. There are also
                    several institutions for indigent and friendless women. The house of refuge and
                    the city workhouse are maintained by the city for the confinement of persons
                    convicted of minor offences; children are sent to the former, and adults to the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>The public schools are under the control of a superintendent and a board of 50
                    elected members, and comprise 3 high, 5 intermediate, and 30 district schools,
                    including those for coloured pupils. There are also a normal school for females
                    and evening schools. In 1874 there were 529 teachers and 28,949 pupils enrolled,
                    with an average daily attendance of 21,486. German is a prominent study in the
                    public schools, and music and drawing are taught. The Woodword and the Hughes
                    high schools have long been known for their excellence. Besides the above, there
                    are a large number of Roman Catholic parochial schools. The university of
                    Cincinnati, recently founded by means of a bequest made by Charles M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> Micken, is designed to afford advanced and technical
                    instruction free of charge. A school of design has been in operation since 1869.
                    Besides the Cincinnati Wesleyan College for females (Methodist-Episcopal), St
                    Xavier College (Roman Catholic), and Mount St Mary’s of the West, the city has 1
                    law, 6 medical, and 2 theological schools, 4 commercial colleges, and 2 schools
                    of music. One of the theological schools is connected with Mount St Mary’s of
                    the West, the other is the widely-known Lane Theological Seminary
                    (Presbyterian), founded in 1829. It occupies a site of 7 acres on Walnut Hills,
                    and has 5 professors and a library of 12,000 volumes. Three of the medical
                    schools are classified as regular, one as pharmaceutic, one as homoeopathic, and
                    one as dental. The oldest is the medical college of Ohio, which was opened in
                    1819, and now has 10 instructors; the Cincinnati college of medicine and surgery
                    was opened in 1821, and has 14 instructors; the Miami medical college, opened in
                    1852, has 12 instructors; and the Pulte medical college, opened in 1872, has 14.
                    There are 11 public libraries in the city, the largest being the free public
                    library, which has 81,000 bound volumes and 5500 pamphlets, and the young men’s
                    mercantile with nearly 40,000 volumes. The public library occupies one of the
                    best library buildings in the country. The most important literary associations
                    are the natural history and the historical and philosophical societies. There
                    are published in the city 70 newspapers and periodicals,—9 appearing daily, 1
                    twice a-week, 33 weekly, 3 fortnightly, 21 monthly, and 3 quarterly. Of these 3
                    daily, 9 weekly, 1 fortnightly, and 2 monthly are published in German. The city
                    contains 160 churches, the largest denominations being the Roman Catholic, which
                    has 32 churches and 12 chapels, the Methodist with 26 churches, the Presbyterian
                    with 22, the Baptist with 14. and the Protestant Episcopal with 11. <hi
