                <p><label type="entry">CHARTIER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Alain</hi></label>, the most
                    distinguished French man of letters during the 15th centnrv, was born at
                    Baveux.</p>
                <p>The date of his birth is not known, but Μ. Vallet de Viriville places it between
                    1380 and 1390. After a complete course of study at the university of Paris, he
                    is supposed to have entered the service of Charles VI., who is said to have
                    charged him with important missions. After this, however, he is known to have
                    followed the fortunes of Charles the Dauphin, afterwards Charles VII., and to
                    have been employed by that prince, about 1420, in the triple capacity of clerk,
                    notary, and financial secretary. He is also said to have held a prebend in the
                    cathedral church of Nôtre-Dame de Paris, of which he was likewise arch-deacon,
                    and to have been sent as envoy to the Scottish court. A Latin epitaph,
                    discovered in the 18th century, and pronounced authentic by the biographer
                    already cited, credits him with the enjoyment of other dignities than those
                    referred to, and declares that he “<hi rend="italic">s'endormit enfin dans le
                        Seigneur,’'</hi> in the city of Avignon, <hi rend="italic">“Van</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de l’incarnation,</hi> 1449.”</p>
                <p>There is some analogy between the fate of Alain Chartier and that of Ronsard.
                    Both enjoyed an extraordinary reputation during their lives, and after death
                    both were neglected and forgotten. Alain Chartier’s lot was cast in troublous
                    times—he felt the agony of Agincourt, and witnessed the rise of the Maid—but
                    this would seem to have increased his renown. The story of the famous kiss
                    bestowed by Margaret of Scotland, wife of that Louis the Dauphin who was
                    afterwards to be known as Louis XL, on <hi rend="italic">“la</hi><hi

                    is interesting, if only as a proof of the high degree of estimation in which the
                    ugliest man of his day was held. Jean de Masles, who annotated a portion of his
                    verse, has recorded how the pages and young gentlemen of that epoch were
                    required daily to learn by heart passages of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bréviaire</hi><hi rend="italic">des Nobles</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    Lydgate, the English rhymester, studied him ardently and affectionately; and
                    Clément Marot and Octavien de Saint-Gélais, writing fifty years after his death,
                    find many fair words for the old poet, their master and predecessor. For the
                    last three centuries, however, Alain Chartier has been remembered rather on
                    account of the kiss aforesaid than for the sake of any of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ions mots</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vertueuses</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >sentences</hi> that induced it. The Renaissance of 1830, even, that has
                    made so many glories to blossom anew, has not justified again his old renown in
                    the eyes of men. As a poet his fame has yielded to that of his contemporary,
                    Charles of Orleans; and even his eloquent prose, which is said to be the best
                    part of his work, has awakened no interest whatever. In spite of this, however,
                    Alain Chartier deserves notice as one of the most remarkable and influential men
                    of his time. His writings, both in prose and verse, breathe an ardent spirit of
                    patriotism, and are notable, in some instances, for a boldness of thought and
                    freedom of idea that seem to foreshadow the great utterances of the 16 th
                    century.</p>
