                    >Ciamberi),</hi> a city of France, capital of the department of Savoy,
                    pleasantly situated in a fertile district, between two hills, on the rivers
                    Laisse and Albana, 46 miles S.S.W. of Geneva. The town, however, is irregularly
                    and ill built, and has only two good streets—the Place Saint-Léger and the Rue
                    de Boigne, of which the latter is named after a General Boigne who left a
                    fortune of 3,400,000 francs to the town. The principal edifices are the
                    cathedral, dating from the 14th and 15th centuries; the Hotel-Dieu, founded in
                    1647; the castle, a modern building serving as a prefecture, and preserving only
                    a great square tower belonging to the original structure; the palace of justice,
                    the theatre, the barracks, and the covered market, which dates from 1863.

                <p>The origin of Chambery is unknown, but its lords are mentioned for the first time
                    in 1029. In 1232 it was sold to the count of Savoy, Thomas I., who bestowed
                    several important privileges on the inhabitants. As capital of the duchy of
                    Savoy, it has passed through numerous political vicissitudes. From the middle of
                    the 16th century to 1713 it was in the hands of the French; in 1742 it was
                    captured by a Franco-Spanish army; and in 1792 it was occupied by the Republican
                    forces. Restored to the house of Savoy by the treaties of Vienna and Paris, it
                    was again surrendered to France in 1860. Among the famous men whom it has given
                    to France, the most important are Vaugelas, Saint-Réal, and the brothers Joseph
                    and Xavier de Maistre. Population of the town in 1872, 17,331, and of the
                    commune, 19,144.</p>
