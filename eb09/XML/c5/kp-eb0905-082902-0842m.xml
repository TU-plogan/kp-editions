                    Schwanenburg (formerly the residence of the dukes of Cleves, and the birthplace
                    of Anne of Cleves, one of the wives of Henry VIII.) has a massive tower 180 feet
                    high, which was built in 1439 on the traditional site of Caesar’s Tower and
                    commands an extensive view. Cleves has two Roman Catholic and three Protestant
                    churches, a synagogue, a gymnasium, a house of correction, and a zoological
                    garden. The collegiate church dates from 1345, and contains a number of fine
                    ducal monuments, among which the first place is held by that of Adolf VI. of the
                    14th century. The chief manufactures are linens, cottons, silks, woollens, and
                    tobacco. To the south and west of the city a large district is laid out as a
                    park; in the southern part, known as the Old Park, there is a statue to the
                    memory of the founder, John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, who governed the town from
                    1650 to 1679, and in the western part there are mineral welffi with a pump-room
                    and bathing establishment,, which date from about 1848. The town was the seat of
                    the counts of Cleves as early as the 11th century, but it did not receive its
                    incorporation till 1242. It was raised, with the surrounding district on both
                    sides of the Rhine, to the rank of a duchy by the Emperor Sigismund in 1417. On
                    the death of Duke William in 1609, without issue, his inheritance, which also
                    included Jülich and Berg, became the object of a violent contest between no
                    fewer than six competitors; and it was not till 1614 that the dispute was
                    settled by the treaty of Xanten, which assigned the duchy of Cleves to
                    Sigismund, elector of Brandenburg, who had married a niece of the late duke. In
                    1805 it was ceded by Prussia to France; and in 1806 it was made a grand-duchy by
                    Napoleon and bestowed on Murat. In 1815 it was restored to Prussia. The
                    population of the town in 1871 was 9038.</p>
