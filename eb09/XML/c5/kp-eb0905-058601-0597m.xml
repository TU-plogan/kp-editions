                    to identify the parent stock of the numerous cultivated varieties of cherry; but
                    they are generally referred to two species, <hi rend="italic">Cerasus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sylvestris,</hi> the wild or corone cherry or gean-tree (the <hi
                    rend="italic">merisier</hi> of the French) and <hi rend="italic">C.
                    vulgaris,</hi> the common cherry-tree (French <hi rend="italic">cerisier).</hi>
                    The former species appears to be indigenous on the Mediterranean coasts, and in
                    Central Europe, including the British Islands; and it is probable that it is the
                    latter species or some of its valuable cultivated varieties which was introduced
                    by Lucullus.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Cerasus</hi> includes trees of moderate size and
                    shrubs, having smooth serrate leaves, white flowers, and a drupaceous fruit.
                    They are natives of the temperate regions of both hemispheres; and the
                    cultivated varieties ripen their fruit in Norway as far as 63° N. The geans are
                    generally distinguished from the common cherry by the greater size of the trees,
                    and the deeper colour and comparative insipidity of the flesh in the ripe fruit,
                    which adheres firmly to the “nut” or kernel; but among the very numerous
                    cultivated varieties specific distinctions shade away so that the fruit cannot
                    be ranged under these two heads. In the <hi rend="italic">Fruit Catalogue</hi>
                    published by the Horticultural Society in 1842, eighty varieties are enumerated,
                    and to these considerable additions have since been made by cultivation both in
                    Europe and America. The leading varieties are recognized as Bigarreaux, Dukes,
                    Morellos, and Geans. Several varieties are cultivated as ornamental trees and on
                    account of their flowers.</p>
                <p>The cherry is a well flavoured sub-acid fruit, and is much esteemed for dessert;
                    but it should be used cautiously, as, especially if not quite ripe, it has a
                    tendency to disorder the bowels. Some of the varieties are particularly selected
                    for pies, tarts, &lt;fcc., and others for the preparation of preserves, and for
                    making cherry brandy. The fruit is also very extensively employed in the
                    preparation of the liqueurs known as kirschwasser, ratafia, and maraschino.
                    Kirschwasser is made chiefly on the upper Rhine from the wild black gean, and in
                    the manufacture the entire fruit-flesh and kernels are pulped up and allowed to
                    ferment. By distillation of the fermented pulp the liqueur is obtained in a pure
                    colourless condition. Ratafia is similarly manufactured, also by preference from
                    a gean. Maraschino, a highly valued liqueur, the best of which is produced at
                    Zara in Dalmatia, differs from these in being distilled from a cherry called
                    marasca, the pulp of which is mixed with honey, honey or sugar being added to
                    the distillate for sweetening. It is also said that the flavour is heightened by
                    the use of the leaves of the perfumed cherry, <hi rend="italic">Cerasus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mahaleb.</hi></p>
                <p>The wood of the cherry tree is valued by cabinetmakers, and that of the gean tree
                    is largely used in the manufacture of tobacco pipes. The American red cherry,
                    <hi rend="italic">Cerasus serotina,</hi> is much sought after, it being compact,
                    finegrained, not liable to warp, and susceptible of receiving a brilliant
                    polish. The bark of this species is very highly esteemed in America as a mild
                    tonic and sedative medicine, and is coming into use for the same purpose in
                    Great Britain. The kernels of the perfumed cherry, <hi rend="italic">C.
                    Mahaleb,</hi> are used in confectionery, and for scenting toilet soap. A gum
                    exudes from the stem of cherry-trees similar in its properties to gum
                    arabic.</p>
