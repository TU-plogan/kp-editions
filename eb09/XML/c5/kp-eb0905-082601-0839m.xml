                    royal authority. She withdrew into Syria, and there made preparation to recover
                    her rights by force of arms. It was at this juncture that Julius Caesar followed
                    Pompey into Egypt, resolved to settle there, if possible, the existing dispute
                    as to the throne. The personal fascinations of Cleopatra, which she was not slow
                    in bringing to bear upon him, soon won him entirely to her side; and as Ptolemy
                    and his advisers still refused to admit her to a share in the kingdom, Caesar
                    undertook a war on her behalf, in which Ptolemy lost his life, and she was
                    replaced on the throne in conjunction with a younger brother, to whom she was
                    also contracted in marriage. Her relations with Caesar were matter of public
                    notoriety, and soon after his return to Rome she joined him there, in company
                    with her boy-husband (of whom, however, she soon rid herself by poison), but
                    living openly with her Roman lover, somewhat to the scandal of his
                    fellow·citizens. After Caesar’s assassination, aware of her unpopularity, she
                    returned at once to her native country. But subsequently, during the civil
                    troubles at Rome, she took the part of Antony, on whom she is said to have
                    already made some impression in her earlier years, when he was campaigning in
                    Egypt. When he was in Cilicia, she made a purpose journey to visit him, sailing
                    up the Cydnus in a gorgeously-decked galley, arrayed in all the attractive
                    splendour which Eastern magnificence could bring in aid of her personal charms.
                    Antonybecame from that time forth her infatuated slave, followed her to Egypt,
                    and lived with her there for some time in the most profuse and wanton luxury.
                    They called themselves “Osiris” and “Isis,” and claimed to be regarded as
                    divinities. His marriage with Octavia broke this connection for a while, but it
                    was soon renewed, and Cleopatra assisted him in his future campaigns both with
                    money and supplies. This infatuation of his rival with a personage already so
                    unpopular at Rome as Cleopatra, was taken advantage of by Octavianus Caesar
                    (Augustus), who declared war against her personally. In the famous sea-fight at
                    Actium, between the fleets of Octavianus and Antony, Cleopatra, who had
                    accompanied him into action with an Egyptian squadron, took to flight while the
                    issue was yet doubtful, and though hotly pursued by the enemy succeeded in
                    escaping to Alexandria, where she was soon joined by her devoted lover. When the
                    cause of Antony was irretrievably ruined, and all her attempts to strengthen
                    herself against the Roman conqueror by means of foreign alliances had failed,
                    she made overtures of submission. Octavianus suggested to her, as a way to his
                    favour, the assassination of his enemy Antony. She seems to have entertained the
                    base proposal,—enticing him to join her in a mausoleum which she had built, in
                    order that “they might die together,” and where he fulfilled his part of the
                    compact by committing suicide, in the belief that she had already done so. The
                    charms which had succeeded so easily with Julius and with Antony failed to move
                    the younger Caesar, though he at once granted her an interview; and rather than
                    submit to be carried by him as a prisoner to Rome, she put an end to her life—by
                    applying an asp to her bosom, according to the common version of the story— in
                    the thirty-ninth year of her age. With her ended the dynasty of the Ptolemies in
                    Egypt. Besides her remarkable charms of person, she had very considerable
                    abilities, and unusual literary tastes. She is said to have been able to
                    converse in seven languages. She had three children by Antony, and, as some say,
                    a son, called Caesarion, by Julius Caesar. (w. L. c.)</p>
