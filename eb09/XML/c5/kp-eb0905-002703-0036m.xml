                    emperor of the East, celebrated as a statesman, general, and historian, was born
                    at Constantinople, of an ancient and opulent family, and under the reign of the
                    elder Andronicus held the high office of Great Domestic. In the disputes that
                    ensued between that emperor and his grandson, Cantacuzenus espoused the cause of
                    the latter; and when Andronicus IL, on the abdication of his grandfather,
                    ascended the throne (1328) he was entrusted with the supreme administration of
                    affairs, in which capacity he displayed considerable vigour and ability. On the
                    death of the emperor in 1341, Cantacuzenus was left regent, and guardian of his
                    son John Palaeologus, who was but nine years of age "Whether he would have
                    continued faithful to his trust is uncertain; but being suspected by the
                    empress, and the object of the hostility of a powerful party at court, he
                    rebelled, and got himself crowned emperor in one of the provincial towns, while
                    his opponents, with the young emperor John, maintained themselves at
                    Constantinople. The civil war which ensued lasted six years; and as the rival
                    parties were obliged to call in the aid of the Servians and Turks, and to engage
                    mercenaries of every description, the empire was reduced to a state of
                    incredible confusion, and nearly ruined. At the outset Cantacuzenus was so hard
                    pressed that he was obliged to flee into Servia. An alliance with Servia enabled
                    him to make head against his enemies for some time; but his inconstant allies
                    soon left him to join the other side, or to pursue their own private ends. It
                    was with the help of the Turks that he brought the war to a termination. He
                    formed an alliance with Orchan, the Ottoman Sultan of Broussa, on the
                    disgraceful conditions of sending his daughter to the harem of the Turk, and of
                    allowing his army to make slaves of the Greek subjects. In 1346 he entered
                    Constantinople in triumph, and forced his opponents to an arrangement by which
                    he became joint emperor with John Palaeologus, retaining the administrative
                    power in his own hands during the minority of his colleague. It is impossible to
                    give a connected view of the government of Cantacuzenus. The empire, already
                    broken up into disconnected fragments, and reduced to the narrowest limits, was
                    assailed on every side by open enemies or treacherous friends. There were wars
                    with the Genoese, who had a colony at Galata and had money transactions with the
                    court, and with the Servians, who were at that time establishing an extensive
                    empire on the north-western frontiers,—carried on in every case without energy
                    and without happy result; and there was a hazardous alliance with the Turks, who
                    made their first permanent settlement in Europe, at Callipolis, in Thrace,
                    towards the end of the reign of Cantacuzenus (1354). It would be wrong to blame
                    him, however, for introducing those enemies of Christendom into Europe, as they
                    had been in the habit of interposing in the unhappy struggles of the Greek
                    empire. No individual energy could have saved a moribund state from destruction
                    at the hands of its more vigorous neighbours. Yet Cantacuzenus was far too ready
                    to employ them in his European quarrels; and as he had not money to pay them,
                    this gave them a ready pretext for seizing upon a European town. The financial
                    burdens imposed by Cantacuzenus had long been displeasing to his subjects, and
                    there had always been a strong faction in favour of John Palaeologus. Hence,
                    when the latter entered Constantinople in the end of 1354, his success was easy.
                    Cantacuzenus retired to a monastery, where he occupied himself in literary
                    labours. He wrote a history of his own life and times, which has been
                    incorporated in the series of Byzantine historians. Cantacuzenus was not without
                    ability, and had some literary merit and even eloquence, but with a considerable
                    share of the Byzantine vices,—timidity, duplicity, and falsity.</p>
