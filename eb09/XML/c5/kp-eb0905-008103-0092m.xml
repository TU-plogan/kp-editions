                    Agostino</hi></label>, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Annibale,</hi> three celebrated
                    Italian painters, were born at Bologna in 1555, 1558, and 1560 respectively.
                    Lodovico, the eldest, son of a butcher, was cousin to the two younger, Agostino
                    and Annibale, sons of a tailor, and had nearly finished his professional studies
                    before the others had begun their education. From being a reputed dunce while
                    studying under Tintoretto in Venice, he gradually rose, by an attentive
                    observation of nature and a careful examination of the works of the great
                    masters preserved at Bologna, Venice, Florence, and Parma, to measure himself
                    with the teachers of his day, and ultimately projected the opening of a rival
                    school in his native place. Finding himself unable to accomplish his design
                    without assistance, he sent for his two cousins, and induced them to abandon
                    their handicrafts (Agostino being a goldsmith, and Annibale a tailor) for the
                    profession of painting. Agostino he first placed under the care of Fontana,
                    retaining Annibale in his own studio; but he afterwards sent both to Venice and
                    Parma, to copy the works of Titian, Tintoretto, and Correggio, on which his own
                    taste had been formed. On their return, the three relatives, assisted by an
                    eminent anatomist, Anthony de la Tour, opened, in 1589, an academy of painting
                    under the name of the Incamminati (or, as we might paraphrase it, the Right
                    Road), provided with numerous casts, books, and bassi-rilievi,which Lodovico had
                    collected in his travels. From the affability and kindness of the Caracci, and
                    their zeal for the scientific education of the students, their academy rose
                    rapidly in popular estimation, and soon every other school of art in Bologna was
                    deserted and closed. They continued together till, at the invitation of Cardinal
                    Farnese, Annibale and Agostino went to Rome in 1600 to paint the gallery of the
                    cardinal’s palace. The superior praises awarded to Agostino inflamed the
                    jealousy of Annibale, already kindled by the brilliant reception given by the
                    pupils of the Incamminati to Agostino’s still highly celebrated picture of the
                    Communion of St Jerome, and the latter was dismissed to Parma to paint the great
                    saloon of the Casino. Here he died in 1601, when on the eve of finishing his
                    renowned painting of Celestial, Terrestrial, and Venal Love. Annibale continued
                    to work alone at the Farnese gallery till the designs were completed; but,
                    disappointed at the miserable remuneration offered by the cardinal, he retired
                    to Naples, where an unsuccessful contest for a great work in the church of the J
                    esuits threw him into a fever, of which he died in 1609. Lodovico always
                    remained at his academy in Bologna (excepting for a short visit to his <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0093-0082"/> cousin at Rome), though invited to execute
                    paintings in all parts of the country. He died in 1619, and was interred in the
                    church of St Mary Magdalene. The works of Lodovico are numerous in the chapels
                    of Bologna. The most famous are—The Madonna standing on the moon, with St
                    Francis and St Jerome beside her, attended by a retinue of angels; John the
                    Baptist, St Jerome, St Benedict, and St Cecilia; and the Limbo of the Fathers.
                    He was by far the most amiable of the three cousins, rising superior to all
                    feelings of jealousy towards his rivals, and though he received large sums for
                    his productions, yet, from his almost unparalleled liberality to the students of
                    the academy, he died poor. With skill in painting Agostino combined the greatest
                    proficiency in engraving (which he had studied under Cornelius de Cort) and high
                    accomplishments as a scholar. He died not untroubled by remorse for the
                    indecencies which, in accordance with the corruption of the time, he had
                    introduced into some of his engravings. The works of Annibale are more
                    diversified in style than those of the others, and comprise specimens of
                    painting after the manner of Correggio, Titian, Paolo Veronese, Raphael, and
                    Michelangelo. The most distinguished are the Dead Christ in the lap of the
                    Madonna; the Infant and St John; St Catherine; St Roch distributing alms (now in
                    the Dresden Gallery); and the Saviour wailed over by the Maries, at present in
                    possession of the earl of Carlisle. He frequently gave great importance to the
                    landscape in his compositions. The reputation of Annibale is tarnished by his
                    jealousy and vindictiveness towards his brother, and the licentiousness of his
                    disposition, which contributed to bring him to a comparatively early grave.</p>
                <p>The three Caracci were the founders of the so-called Eclectic School of
                    painting,—the principle of which was to study in the works of the great masters
                    the several excellencies for which they had been respectively pre-eminent, and
                    to combine these in the productions of the school itself; for instance, there
                    was to be the design of Raphael, the power of Michelangelo, the colour of
                    Titian, and so on. The dullest or müdest connoisseur will at once perceive that
                    a picture uniting these various kinds of greatness would be a glorious and
                    indeed an unparagoned work of art; but it does not follow that the attempt to
                    transfer the several qualities, by study and practice, from the works of various
                    men to those of one man, is fruitful of good. It is, in fact, far the reverse;
                    and at the present day perhaps few axioms in art have won a wider acceptance
                    than that which pronounces eclecticism to be at once a result and a symptom of
                    decadence. Eclecticism indicates that the creative impulse, the vital energy and
                    fertility, of art have departed; that the practitioners of the day can no longer
                    do what their forerunners did—produce admirable works, because in themselves
                    spontaneously capable of doing so. They have on the contrary to investigate what
                    has been achieved, and labour not for a new achievement resembling those which
                    preceded in so far as all are the product of some personal gift, special and
                    unforestalled, but rather for an achievement recombining and re-applying old
                    successes, and qualifying, or indeed neutralizing, the strength of one quality
                    by that of another. This is, in effect, an attempt to produce works of art upon
                    the principles which govern the criticism of those works,—an attempt predestined
                    to sterility, for no two things are more antagonistic than the producing power
                    and the criticizing power. They may, no doubt, be united in the same person, but
                    cannot work out their results the one through the medium of the other.</p>
