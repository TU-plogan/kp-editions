                <p><label type="entry">CHUSAN</label>, the principal island of a group situated off
                    the eastern coast of China, in 30° N. lat. and 122° E. long., and belonging to
                    the province of Che-keang. It lies N.W. and S.E., and has a circumference of 51
                    miles, the extreme length being 20, the extreme breadth 10, and the minimum
                    breadth 6 miles. The island is beautifully diversified with hill and dale, and
                    well watered with numerous small streams, of which the most considerable is the
                    Tungkeang, falling into the harbour of Tinghae. Most of the surface is capable
                    of cultivation, and nineteen-twentieths of the inhabitants are engaged in
                    agriculture. Wherever it is possible to rear rice every other product is
                    neglected; yet the quantity produced is not sufficient for the wants of the
                    inhabitants. Millet, wheat, sweet potatoes, yams, and tares are also grown. The
                    tea plant is found almost everywhere, and the cotton plant is largely cultivated
                    near the sea. The capital, Tinghae, stands about half a mile from the southern
                    shore, and is surrounded by a wall nearly three miles in circuit. The ditch
                    outside the wall is interrupted on the N.W. side by a spur from a neighbouring
                    hill, which projects into the town, and forms an easy access to an attacking
                    force. The town is traversed by canals, and the harbour, which has from 4 to 8
                    fathoms water, is land-locked by several islands. Temple (or Joss-house) Hill,
                    which commands the town and harbour, is 122 feet high close to the beach. The
                    population of the town and suburbs of Tinghae, which at the commencement of 1843
                    was about 27,500, had increased in 1846 to above 35,000. The population of the
                    entire island is estimated at 250,000, of which the capital contains about
                    40,000. Chusan has but few manufactures; the chief are coarse cotton stuffs and
                    agricultural implements. There are salt works on the coast; and the fisheries
                    employ a number of the inhabitants. In Tinghae a considerable business is
                    carried on in carving and varnishing, and its silver wares are in high repute.
                    The principal exports are fish, coarse black tea, cotton, vegetable tallow,
                    sweet potatoes, aud some wheat. Chusan was occupied by the Japanese during the
                    Ming dynasty, and served as an important commercial entrepôt. It was taken by
                    the British forces in 1840 and 1841, and retained till 1846 as a guarantee for
                    the fulfilment of the stipulations of the treaty. It was also occupied by the
                    English in 1860. See plan in <hi rend="italic">Jour, of Royal Geogr. Soc.,</hi>
