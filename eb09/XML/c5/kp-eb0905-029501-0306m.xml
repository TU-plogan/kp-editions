                    whose objections we have any record. His history is involved in complete
                    uncertainty. Our knowledge of his treatise is derived from Origen’s work written

                    regard to the writer whose book he refutes. But when we examine Origen’s
                    statements carefully, we are led to the conclusion that Origen knew nothing
                    about him. Celsus’s treatise had been sent to him by Ambrosius with the request
                    that he should grapple with its arguments. Origen had not heard before of the
                    work or of the author. He thought that Christianity did not require a defence,
                    but to please his friend, and with the hope of benefiting those who were not
                    Christians, he set about the task assigned. In the performance of this task he
                    could not help making conjectures in regard to the author. He speaks of him in
                    the preface “as long ago dead ’’ (c. iv.). “We have heard,” he says in another
                    passage (i. 8), “that there were two Epicurean Celsi, one in the time of Nero
                    and this one [the author] in the time of Hadrian and afterwards.” But he could
                    not make up his mind definitely that the Celsus, the author of the treatise, was
                    an Epicurean. He says that he is proved to be an Epicurean from other writings
                    (I 8). He again and again calls him an Epicurean (i. 10, 21; ii. 60). He allows
                    that Celsus did not state in the treatise that he was an Epicurean (v. 3). He
                    lays before his readers three suppositions in regard to him, either that he
                    concealed his Epicurean opinions, or that he had changed to a better state of.
                    mind, or that he had merely the same name as the Epicurean (iv. 54). And he
                    expresses his doubt quite distinctly,—“The Epicurean Celsus, if indeed he is the
                    person that composed the other two books against the Christians” (iv. 36). The
                    “other two books” here mentioned are in all probability, as Neander and Baur
                    have shown, two parts of the book which Origen tries to refute, or that book and
                    another which is mentioned as having been promised by Celsus. Origen expresses a
                    similar doubt as to the authorship of a work ascribed to the Epicurean Celsus,
                    <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ' You see how in these expressions he as it were
                    accepts the reality of magic. I do not know if he is the same as the person who
                    wrote several books against magic” (i. 68).</p>
                <p>From these passages the inference may be drawn that Origen was very much in the
                    dark as to who Celsus was and when he lived. The indications in the work itself
                    are not much more satisfactory. But there is at least a clear indication of a
                    period before which it could not have been written. Celsus makes mention of
                    Marcellina (v. 62), who, according to īreuaeus (i. 20, 4), came to Rome in the
                    time of Anicetus (154 or 155 to 166 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> In the same
                    passage he mentions Marcion and his followers, and whatever may be the date of
                    Marcion’s first arrival in Rome, we may again accept the statement of Ireuaeus
                    (iii. 4, 3) that he flourished in the time of Anicetus. As the followers of
                    Marcellina and Marcion are spoken of, we may infer that both Marcellina and
                    Marcion had had considerable success in propagating their opinions at the time
                    Celsus wrote. A third clue to the date might be found in the mention of
                    Dionysius, an Egyptian musician with whom Celsus had associated (vi. 41). In all
                    probability this Dionysius was the younger Dionysius of Halicarnassus who was
                    termed μουσικός, and who discussed in his books just such points as those to
                    which Celsus alludes. If this were the case, Celsus must have lived la the time
                    of Hadrian, the period in which Suidas says that Dionysius flourished. But there
                    is no conclusive evidence that this Dionysius lived in Egypt, though the epithet
                    “of Halicarnassus” proves nothing to the contrary, as it merely denotes that he
                    was descended from the rhetorician and historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus.
                    Some have fourni an indication of a date in the circumstance that ofteneι than
                    once Celsus speaks of “the king” (viii. 68, 73), while in one passage (viii. 71)
                    he speaks of “those who now rule.” They infer from this that there were two
                    emperors associated together in the government, but that one of them was far
                    more prominent than the other, in fact that they were Marcus Aurelius and his
                    son Commodus (Keim, p. 265). But the inference is not warranted. The last
                    expression is a general expression, not applicable to the emperors only but to
                    all rulers of the period, and if the other statements were to be pressed they
                    would ratheι point to a time when only one emperor was on the throne.</p>
                <p>In this deficiency of evidence it is not wonderful that critics have varied
                    widely as to the date of Celsus, but mcst have assigned a date somewhere between
                    150 and 180. Peter Faidit maintained that he flourished in the time of Nero, and
                    in recent times Volkmar has argued for the opinion that Celsus was a
                    contemporary of Origen (see <hi rend="italic">Supernatural Religion,</hi> vol
                    ii. p. 228, ff.).</p>
                <p>Outside of Origen’s work we find no clue to the history of Celsus. The name was
                    very common. Upwards of twenty persons of the name are mentioned within the
                    first three centuries of the Christian era (see Keim for the list, j&gt;. 276).
                    But there is only one for whom any one has claimed identity with the Celsus of
                    Origen. This is the Celsus to whom Lucian sent his treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pseudomantis,</hi> giving an account of the imposture of Alexander of
                    Abonoteichos. We think that this identification is a mistake. The Celsus of
                    Origen is unquestionably not an Epicurean. The Celsus of Lucian could scarcely
                    be anything else. The tractate of the satirist is full of extravagant praises of
                    Epicurus. The defence of Epicurus as “a man truly holy and divine in his nature,
                    and who alone with truth ascertained what was beautiful,” is said to be
                    specially agreeable to Celsus. The followers of Plato and Chrysippus and
                    Pythagoras are alluded to contemptuously,—an allusion which would have applied
                    pointedly to the Celsus of Origen. If an identity could have been proved, the
                    date of Celsus would have been asceι tained; for Lucian mentions the war of
                    Marcus Aun,∙lius with the Quadi and Marcomanni as a con temporaneous event. It
                    is very hkely that the Epicurean Cel <hi rend="smallcaps">jus</hi> mentioned by
                    Origen as living in the time of Hadrian is the same as the Celsus of Lucian.</p>
                <p>Happily we are not left in the same doubt in regard to the treatise of Celsus as
                    we are in regard to his life. In refuting it Origen adopted the plan of going
                    through it in regular sequence, taking one passage after another in the order in
                    which he found them in the book. He has not adhered to this rule with absolute
                    fidelity, but his deviations from it are few, and as he generally quotes the
                    exact words, a large portion of the treatise has thus come down to us. The
                    remains of it are so numerous that we <hi rend="smallcaps">csm</hi> form an
                    accurate notion of the whole work. The treatise was called a “true discourse”
                    (λόγος <hi rend="italic">aληθης).</hi> Origen states at the end of his work
                    against it (viii. 76) that Celsus intended to write a sequel to it, in which he
                    was to supply rules of practical life for those who wished to embrace his
                    opinions. Whether he ever carried out his intention history does not state.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">True Discourse,</hi> Celsus shows great philosophical
                    and critical powers. He takes note of almost every objection which has been
                    brought against Christianity, and his position is substantially that which is
                    assumed by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n307/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0307-0296"/> scientific opponents of Christianity in the
                    present day. The <hi rend="italic">True Discourse</hi> is divided into two
                    parts. In the first he does not speak in his own person, but introduces a Jew
                    who discusses from the Jewish point of view the credibility of the statements
                    made by Christians in reference to the life of Jesus. There was considerable
                    advantage in this mode of procedure. Celsus himself did not believe in the
                    supernatural. The only possibility of the existence of such a person as the
                    Christian Jesus that he could conceive depended upon his being daemonic, but
                    Jesus showed nothing of that majesty, that grandeur, that energy of will in
                    worldly affairs which he deemed essential to the daemon. He therefore rejected
                    his pretensions entirely as inconsistent with his philosophy; but he believed
                    that even on the basis of a philosophy which permitted the supernatural the
                    claims of Jesus must be rejected. And so his arguments are made to come from a
                    Jew. The Jew rejects the miraculous birth of Jesus. Mary was divorced from her
                    husband, and wandering about fell in with a Roman soldier, Panthera, who was the
                    father of Jesus. Jesus being needy went down to Egypt and there learned all the
                    tricks by which he could work apparent miracles, and on the strength of this
                    knowledge he claimed to be God when he returned to Judea. But who could believe
                    the statements made in regard to him,—who heard the voice at his baptism? None
                    but himself and a companion who shared his dream or rather his imposture. The
                    miracles ascribed to him are absurd. Any one could see such miracles by paying a
                    few obols to an Egyptian juggler. If Jesus was God, would he have chosen such
                    wicked aqd worthless men as his apostles? If he knew that Judas would betray
                    him, why did he make* him his companion? But the story of the resurrection
                    especially seemed absurd. He was condemned publicly before the eyes of all. No
                    one could doubt this. If he rose again, why did he not make his justification as
                    public? Would he not have confronted his judge, his accusers, the general
                    public, and given indubitable evidence that he was not a malefactor î And who
                    saw him after he rose again? A half insane woman and one or two followers who
                    were in the very humour to trust to dreams or to an excited fancy. In this way
                    the Jew discusses many of the statements made in the gospels, and comes to the
                    conclusion that Jesus was an ordinary man.</p>
                <p>In the second part Celsus tests the beliefs of the Christians by his philosphical
                    principles. He then shows that the Greeks had all that was true in Christianity,
                    but in a nobler and better form, and he ends with a practical application,
                    urging Christians to give up their separatist tendency, to worship the daemons,
                    and to join in all civil and military duties imposed on citizens by the state.
                    Before dealing with the principles of the Christians he draws attention to the
                    false position which they occupy. They are, he thinks, essentially rebellious.
                    They wish to separate themselves from the rest of mankind. The Jews show this
                    tendency, but they are so far to be excused in that they adhere to their
                    national beliefs. These beliefs indeed are often silly and puerile, and
                    perversions of what is wiser and better in Greek poets and philosophers. But the
                    Christians belong to no nationality, and separate themselves from the ordinary
                    beliefs without any good cause. They object to the divinity of the Dioscuri,
                    Hercules, and others, in regard to whom the Greeks believe that they became gods
                    from being men. And yet they worship a man who was a prisoner and died. This
                    worship is on a level with that of Zamolxis by the Getae, of Mopsus by the
                    Cilicians, and of others whom he names. It is unreasonable. Accordingly the
                    Christians do not invite the wise or the good. It is ignorant slaves, women, and
                    children whom they try to influence, not publicly but in corners and private
                    places. And their divisive tendencies are shown in the number of the sects which
                    exist among them.</p>
                <p>After this introduction Celsus proceeds with his philosophical argument. God is
                    good and beautiful and blessed. He therefore cannot change. For if he were to
                    change, it could only be for the worse. Therefore God cannot come down to men.
                    He cannot assume a mortal body. He cannot do it in reality, for that would be
                    contrary to his nature; he cannot do it in appearance, for that would be to
                    deceive, and God cannot deceive. Indeed the idea is absurd. What advantage could
                    be gained by his coming? Does he not know all things? Has he not power to do all
                    things without assuming a body? Is he not able as God to do everything that he
                    could do as incarnated God? And no real advantage is got for men; for they do
                    not know God better by seeing him in bodily form. God must be seen by the soul,
                    and men are deceived if they imagine they know Him better by seeing Him in a
                    corruptible body than when they see Him with the pure eye of the soul. Indeed
                    Christianity is in this respect marked by a gross anthropomorphism. Nor can the
                    purpose w hich Christians assign for this incarnation be regarded as true. The
                    nature of the whole is always one and the same. There is always the same amount
                    of evil in the world. There is nothing evil in God. The evil is in matter. But
                    God is continually making the evil serve for the good of the whole. If this is
                    the case, then, it is absurd to suppose that God would be especially interested
                    in a few of the human race. He works always for the whole. And the Christian
                    notion is peculiarly absurd. Did God at that particular time waken from sleep
                    and resolve to rescue a few from sin? Was He indifferent to all mankind before,
                    to all the nations of the earth? And is He to continue to show the same special
                    favour only for a select number? Not only are the Christians wrong in this, but
                    they are wrong in supposing that the world was made for man. Again it is the
                    whole that is cared for. And we can see signs in nature that animals are equal
                    if not superior to man in many points. If he hunts the deer, the Ron hunts him
                    and feeds on him. Bees have cities and rulers. Some animals speak to each other.
                    Some can foretell the future. Some are religious. In fact neither for animals
                    nor man was the universe made, but that the world as God’s work might be perfect
                    in every part In these arguments we have a remarkable anticipation of many of
                    the points which come out in our present Darwinian discussions (see <hi

                <p>In exhibiting the superiority of the Greek doctrines over the Christian, Celsus
                    points to the circumstance that the Greeks appeal to reason, the Christians cry
                    out, “Believe, believe.” The doctrine of the Son of God, he thinks, was borrowed
                    from Plato. The Devil owed his origin to a distortion of a Greek opinion. He
                    compares the prophecies of the Greeks with those of the Christians, and he
                    contrasts Greek and Christian doctrines of a future state, and speaks of the
                    resurrection as a ridiculous belief.</p>
                <p>In the practical application he maintains that the daemons are subordinate
                    ministers of God, and that therefore any worship paid to them is worship also of
                    the Supreme God himself. Especially the Christians have no good reason for
                    objecting to such worship since they already worship a dead man.</p>
                <p>Our abstract of this work is necessarily very imperfect, and many important
                    points we have been compelled to omit entirely. From what has been given, it
                    will be seen that Celsus was a Platonist. He believed in a Supreme God, the
                    Supreme Good, higher than all existence. This <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n308/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0308-0297"/> God was everywhere and in everything. Alongside
                    of this God was original uncreated matter, the source of all evil. These two
                    made up the universe, which remained a constant quantity. There could,
                    therefore, be no real redemption from sin. There could be nothing supernatural.
                    There was merely the apparent evolution and involution of the same reason and
                    matter. This mode of thought is fatal to final causes, fatal to a special aim on
                    God’s part, fatal to a special interest in man, and therefore fatal to
