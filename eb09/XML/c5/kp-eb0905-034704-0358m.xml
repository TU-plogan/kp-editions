                    de</hi></label> (1547-1616), the author of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi>
                    was born at Alcalá de Henares, the ancient <hi rend="italic">Complutum,</hi> a
                    small town in the province of New Castile, in 1547. The day of his birth is not
                    known, but as he was baptized on the 9th of October it is conjectured from his
                    Christian name that he was born on St Michaelmas day preceding. The placé of his
                    nativity also remained in doubt until the year 1748, when Don Juan de Yriarte
                    found in the Royal Library of Madrid a manuscript entitled <hi rend="italic">La
                    Verdadera</hi><hi rend="italic">Patria</hi><hi rend="italic">de Miguel</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Cervantes,</hi> written by the learned Benedictine Martin
                    Sarmiento. Till then seven cities, Madrid, Seville, Lucena, Toledo, Esquivias,
                    Alcazar de San Juan, and Consuegra, had contended for the honour of being his
                    birthplace, although in the <hi rend="italic">Topography of Algiers,</hi> by
                    Father Haedo, published in 1612, mention was made of Cervantes as a native of
                    Alcalá de Henares, and the genealogist Mendez de Silva, in his tract on Nuño
                    Alfonso, published in 1648, had also spoken of him as a noble Castilian
                    gentleman of the same town. All doubts on the subject, their long ignorance as
                    to which is one of the many proofs of the carelessness with which the Spaniards
                    have treasured what belongs to the memory of their illustrious countryman, were
                    finally resolved by the discovery of the petition for an inquiry into his
                    conduct at Algiers addressed by Cervantes to the Government in 1580. The family
                    of Cervantes, which had for some generations attached to their patronymic the
                    name of Saavedra, was of respectable if not noble origin. The patriotic zeal of
                    some later biographers has even claimed for it affinity to the royal blood of
                    Castile. The cradle of the race was Galicia, from which province the ancestors
                    of Cervantes emigrated at an early date. Members of the family accompanied
                    Ferdinand III. on his expedition against the Moorish kingdom of Seville and
                    obtained a share of the conquered territory. The grand <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0359-0348"/> father of Miguel was Juan de Cervantes, a knight
                    of some distinction, who held the office of <hi rend="italic">corregidor</hi> of
                    Ossuna at the beginning of the 16th century. His son Rodrigo married in 1540
                    Leonora de Cortinas, a lady of Esquivias, of birth equal to his own but, it is
                    presumed, of no greater fortune. There were four children of the marriage, two
                    sons, Rodrigo and Miguel, and two daughters. Although ranking themselves with
                    the <hi rend="italic">hidalgos,</hi> the parents must have been, at the birth of
                    their younger son, in humble circumstances. The biographers have been able to
                    glean but few details of the early life of our hero, and for these they are
                    indebted almost entirely to the chance allusions in Cervantes’s own writings. He
                    studied grammar and the humanities under a master of some repute, Lopez de
                    Hoyos, aud, according to a doubtful tradition, spent two years at the university
                    of Salamanca, residing in the Calle de Moros. That he received a fair education
                    according to the standard of the age, and had an extensive though not exact
                    knowledge of classical and general literature, his works bear witness. When a
                    boy he describes himself as having attended the representations of the first
                    regular company of Spanish actors under Lope de Rueda, the founder of the
                    dramatic art in Spain. Upon the occasion of the magnificent obsequies held in
                    honour of Isabel de Valois, the wife of Philip IL, in 1568, the most advanced
                    scholars of Lopez de Hoyos competed in the literary exercises, in Latin and in
                    Spanish, which formed part of the funeral ceremony; and chief among the victors
                    was Miguel de Cervantes, who is mentioned by his master in the most affectionate
                    and laudatory terms as his “dear and beloved pupil.” These compositions, among
                    which were sonnets, <hi rend="italic">letrillas,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >redondιllas,</hi> have perished, together with many of the early poetical
                    essays of their author, probably with no loss to the world or to his reputation.
                    In his <hi rend="italic">Journey to Parnassus</hi> Cervantes speaks of these
                    effusions of his youthful muse with characteristic modesty and candour, averring
                    that “from his tenderest years he had loved the sweet art of poesy,” and had
                    composed endless ballads and sonnets, good and bad, but confessing with a
                    touching humility that Heaven had not granted him the poet’s grace. Among the
                    last works belonging to this period, of which their author speaks with more
                    complacency, was <hi rend="italic">Filena,</hi> a pastoral poem, esteemed
                    sufficiently good by his contemporaries to earn for the author a place among the
                    multitude of those who wrote themselves poets in that fruitful harvest-time of
                    Spanish literature</p>
                <p>In 1568 there came to Madrid—charged with a message of condolence from the Pope
                    to Philip IL, on the death of his son Don Carlos, and with sundry complaints
                    respecting default of allegiance to Rome—the Cardinal Aequavi va, who, though
                    only in his twenty-fifth year, had already earned a name for culture and a good
                    disposition to letters. With him Cervantes took service as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >camarero</hi> or page,— an employment held to be no humiliation in that age
                    even to young men of noble birth,—returning in the suite of his patron to Rome
                    by way of Valencia, Barcelona, and the south of France. Apparently the post was
                    not to the taste of one in whom the sight of Italy—then for the greater part a
                    fief of Spain—awakened more of warlike than of poetic ambition. In the beginning
                    of 1570 the cardinal’s page exchanged his livery for the soldier’s uniform,
                    enlisting in the company of the famous Captain Don Diego de Urbina of the
                    regiment of Don Miguel de Moncada. It was the period when the military glory of
                    Spain was at the highest, and the profession of arms the surest road to
                    advancement. The first campaign of Cervantes was made at sea, his regiment being
                    engaged in the expedition which, in the summer of 1570, under the orders of the
                    Papal general, Marco Antonio Colonna, made an ineffectual attempt to relieve the
                    Island of Cyprus, then hotly besieged by the Turks. The capture of Nicosia by
                    the Mahometans, and the fall of the island, which spread consternation
                    throughout Christendom, gave rise to the memorable Holy League against Selim II.
                    Through the exhortations of the Pope, Pius V., Spain and Venice were induced to
                    lay aside for a time their old dissensions and to unite with Rome in an attempt
                    to bridle the Ottomans, then in the flush and vigour of théir genius. The pact
                    between these Christian powers was formally ratified on the 25th of May 1571,
                    the confederates binding themselves to “make perpetual war” not only against the
                    Turks but against the Moors of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli.</p>
                <p>The armament provided—the expenses of which were distributed among the three
                    states in the proportion of three-sixths to Spain, two-sixths to Venice, and
                    one-sixth to Rome—was to consist of 200 galleys of war, with 100 store-ships,
                    50,000 infantry, 4500 light horse, and a sufficient supply of artillery and
                    ammunition. The generalissimo whom the unanimous voice of the allies called to
                    the command of this fleet—the most formidable which had ever been assembled in
                    the Mediterranean—was Don John of Austria, the natural son of Charles V., then
                    in his twenty-fourth year,—a youth not more recommended by his near connection
                    with the Spanish king than by his brilliant talents, amiable character, and
                    great popularity. The mutual jealousies and fears of the allied princes, and the
                    hesitation of Philip II. to entrust so important a command to his half-brother,
                    the object of his secret envy and distrust, caused many delays in the assembling
                    of the Christian forces, and gave the Turks ample time for preparation. The
                    armada, after rendezvousing at Messina, put to sea finally in quest of the enemy
                    on the 15th of September. The company in which Cervantes still served as a
                    private soldier was embarked in the galley “La Marquesa,” commanded by Francisco
                    San Pietro. After relieving and provisioning Corfu, Don John came up with the
                    Turkish fleet on the 7th of October, drawn up in order of battle in the Gulf of
                    Lepanto. The Christians advanced in three divisions, their right commanded by
                    the Genoese admiral, Juan Andrea Doria, the centre under Don John himself, and
                    the left under Agostino Barbarigo, the Venetian Proveditore; the Marques de
                    Santa Cruz, with his squadron, being in reserve. The “Marquesa” was on the left
                    wing, having on board Miguel de Cervantes, who lay in his cabin ill of a fever.
                    On coming into action, his ship being in the van of the squadron, Cervantes’s
                    captain and comrades besought him to remain quietly in his bed, but he,
                    according to the sworn testimony of ear-witnesses, asked them what would they
                    think of him if he did not do his duty, and declared his resolve to die fighting
                    for God and his king, rather than remain under shelter and take care of his
                    health. His entreaties to be allowed to share in the fighting having been
                    granted, Cervantes was stationed with twelve soldiers under his command in what
                    was reckoned the post of greatest danger, namely, in the boat which hung by the
                    galley side, most exposed to the enemy’s fire. Here he performed his part in
                    that glorious day’s work so valiantly as to attract the notice of his
                    commanders, even of Don John himself. The vessel immediately opposed to the
                    “Marquesa” was the galley of the Capitan Pasha of Alexandria, who commanded on
                    the Turkish right, bearing the royal standard of Egypt. After a stubborn
                    resistance, and the slaughter of 500 of her crew, she was compelled to
                    surrender, her fate involving the flight or capture of the entire squadron, and
                    contributing materially to the final defeat of the Turks. On their right wing
                    the Christians were less successful,—"Marco Antonio Colonna having to encounter
                    the celebrated renegade, Uluch Ali, a sea-captain of great skill and experience,
                    to whose good conduct and abilities Cervantes himself, with characteristic
                    generosity, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n360/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0360-0349"/> bears witness. The issue was highly honourable to
                    the allied arms The victory at Lepanto, though barren of results, and spoilt by
                    the contentions among the Christian leaders, broke the spell of Turkish
                    invincibility at sea, and is to be reckoned among the most glorious feats of
                    arms ever performed by Spain when at the zenith of her greatness. In this
                    battle, to the remembrance of which he ever fondly clung, which he loved to
                    speak of as the proudest event of his life, Cervantes was severely
                    wounded—receiving two gun-shot wounds in the chest and one in the ιert hand,
                    which was maimed and rendered useless “for the greater glory of the right,” as
                    its owner said, holding this defect ever after to be his greatest ornament.
                    Lepanto was to Spain what Salamis was to Athens. All Europe rang with the fame
                    of “the man sent from God whose name was John,” according to the fervent
                    exclamation of the grateful Pope when he heard the news of the victory; and the
                    exploits of Doria, Colonna, and Santa Cruz were on all men’s tongues. But while
                    generals and admirals are now forgotten, it is a striking evidence of the power
                    of genius to override even the traditions of patriotism and of warlike glory
                    that of all the memories which survive of this once renowned day, that which
                    remains green and flourishing is of the private soldier who fought in the
                    “Marquesa,” of him whom his countrymen love to designate as <hi rend="italic"
                    >El</hi><hi rend="italic">Manco</hi><hi rend="italic">de Lepanto.</hi> It would
                    be absurd to attribute to the single arm of Miguel de Cervantes any appreciable
                    share in the event of that day, but making all allowances for the partiality of
                    his biographers, there can be no reason to doubt that Cervantes did earn a very
                    extraordinary amount of renown for his behaviour in the battle. As a private
                    soldier he was not debarred, according to the fashion of the times, from
                    receiving from his superiors those marks of consideration due to men of good
                    birth and breeding; yet the extraordinary favours bestowed on him by Don John
                    and the other leaders, the letters of credit which they gave him on his return
                    to Spain, the numerous references to him by his contemporaries, and the
                    influence he afterwards exercised among his fellow-captives at Algiers, are
                    sufficient to prove that at this early period of his life Cervantes had attained
                    to much distinction over and above what he had won as a man of letters.</p>
                <p>After the battle of Lepanto the lateness of the season compelled Don John to
                    return to Sicily, leaving the Turks leisure to recover from their losses and to
                    recruit their strength. The wounded were tended at Messina, among whom Cervantes
                    was visited in the hospital by Don John in person, receiving upon his recovery a
                    special increase of pay to the amount of three crowns a month. From the company
                    of Moncada our soldier was now transferred to that of Don Ponce de Leon, in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tercio de Figueroa,</hi> the most distinguished of all the
                    Spanish regiments of that period—of that famous infantry which sustained the
                    Spanish dominion over half Europe, making, in the words of the chronicler, “the
                    earth tremble with their muskets.” The further enterprizes of the League at sea
                    were checked by the growing dissensions between Spain and Venice, and also by
                    the quarrel now on foot between the former nation and its old rival France. The
                    jealousies between the -confederate princes extended to their commanders, and it
                    was in vain that Don John urged upon his allies the necessity of striking
                    another blow at the Turk before he had time to repair his shattered forces. It
                    was <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> not until the 9th of August 1572, that the
                    Christian fleet again set sail for the scene of its great exploit of the year
                    previous. In this second campaign, through the supineness of the leaders,
                    perhaps from some incapacity of the generalissimo, scarcely fitted by age or
                    force of character to control so vast and incongruous a host, but chiefly from
                    the superior skill and vigilance of the Turkish commanderin-chief, a post now
                    held by Uluch Ali, the armada did nothing more than make a feeble demonstration
                    against the enemy’s fleet, which was found at anchor in Navarino Bay. Cervantes,
                    who has given a minute account of this inglorious affair in his story of the
                    captive in <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> served in this expedition in the
                    squadron commanded by Antonio Colonna. Returning to Messina to winter, thearmada
                    was next year dispersed in consequence of the dissolution of the Holy League,
                    the Venetians having concluded a separate peace with the Turks. In 1573
                    Cervantes took part in the expedition of Don John against Tunis and in the
                    capture of the Goleta—his wounds being still unhealed, as we learn from his
                    letter to Mateo Vasquez. That winter he was in garrison in Sardinia, and in the
                    next spring in Lombardy, being ordered to Messina in August 1574, and thence to
                    Naples. On the 15th of June 1575 he obtained leave of the viceroy, the Duke de
                    Sesa, to visit Spain, and thus ended the first portion of his military career,
                    with small profit but with much honour. During his five years’ active service by
                    land and sea, however, Cervantes had acquired that knowledge of men and life
                    which was so useful to him in after years. He had visited the most famous cities
                    of Italy, and had stored his mind with impressions of her art and literary
                    culture, traces of which are to be found in all his writings, even to the extent
                    of making him liable to the charge of introducing Italian idioms into his style.
                    Of his intercourse with Italian men of letters there is no evidence, though his
                    works furnish abundant testimony of his familiarity with the best models of
                    Italian literature. That he had won the respect and esteem of his commanders as
                    a good soldier is proved by the highly flattering letters which he received from
                    Don John, recommending him to the king for promotion as a man of singular merit
                    and of great services; also from the viceroy of Naples, speaking of him as a
                    worthy but unfortunate soldier who, “by his noble virtue and temper, had secured
                    the good will of his comrades and officers.” Furnished with these letters, which
                    in the event were to prove to him so fatal a possession, Cervantes, with his
                    brother Rodrigo, embarked at Naples in the galley “El SoL” On the 26th of
                    September, when off the coast of Minorca, his vessel fell in with a squadron of
                    Algerine cruizers under the command of the dreaded pirate captain, Arnaut Mami.
                    Attacked by three of the enemy’s ships, the Spanish galley, after an obstinate
                    resistance, in which Cervantes bore a conspicuous part, was forced to surrender
                    to overwhelming odds, and was brought in a prize to Algiers. On the division of
                    the prisoners Cervantes fell to the lot of Déli Mami, a Greek renegade, noted
                    for his ferocity and greed among the Algerines. The letters of Don John and the
                    viceroy of Naples found on this Spanish soldier served but to mislead his
                    captors as to his true rank, and therefore to stimulate their cupidity and to
                    aggravate his sufferings. Being supposed to be able to purchase his liberty at a
                    high price, Cervantes was guarded with special care, and that he might be
                    induced the more quickly to ransom himself, he was loaded with chains and
                    treated with extraordinary rigour. According to the testimony of Father Haedo,
                    in whose curious and important work on the <hi rend="italic">Topography of
                    Algiers,</hi> published in 1612, we have the most valuable authority for this
                    period of Cervantes’s life, and who was an eye-witness of the cruelties
                    practised in this pirates’ den upon the Christian slaves, the captivity of
                    Cervantes was one of the hardest ever known in Algiers. It was borne with a
                    courage and constancy which, had there been nothing else to make his name
                    memorable, must have sufficed to rank Cervantes among the heroes of his age and
                    country. No episode more romantic is contained in the books of chivalry. No
                    adventures more strange were encountered by any knight-errant<pb break="no"

                    whose fabled deeds had kindled his youthful imagination displayed a loftier

                    >devoir</hi> than did Miguel de Cervantes when in duresse at Algiers. A slave in
                    the power of the bitter enemy of his creed and nation, cut off in the hey-day of
                    his fame from the path of ambition which fortune seemed to have opened to him,
                    no lot could be more cruel than that which in the prime of his manhood and
                    genius fell to our hero. Nor is there any chapter of his life more honourable
                    than the record of the singular daring, fortitude, patience, and cheerfulness
                    with which he bore his fate during this miserable period of five years. With no
                    other support than his own indomitable spirit, forgotten by those whom he had
                    served, unable to receive any help from his friends, subjected to every kind of
                    hardship which the tyranny or caprice of his masters might order, pursued by an
                    unrelenting evil destiny which seemed in this, as in every other passage of his
                    career, to mock at his efforts to live that high heroic life which he had
                    conceived to himself, this poor maimed soldier was looked up to by that wretched
                    colony of Christian captives, including among them many men of higher birth and
                    rank, as their chief counsellor, comforter, and guide. In the formal information
                    laid before the commissary of the Spanish Government at Algiers, Father Juan
                    Gil, of the order of the Redemptorists, very particular testimony is borne by
                    Cervantes’s fellow-captives to his character and conduct, as one who bore
                    himself always as a faithful Christian, who cheered those who were despondent,
                    who shared with the poor the little which he possessed, who helped the sick in
                    their necessities, who risked every danger in the cause of the faith, behaving
                    himself always like a true soldier of the king and a noble gentleman,—all which
                    good record is confirmed by the honest father himself of his own personal
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>The captivity of Cervantes in Algiers lasted five years, during which period he
                    never ceased to plot schemes of deliverance, which, however daringly conceived
                    and skilfully planned, were doomed to be always foiled by accident or by
                    treachery. On such occasions he was invariably the first to come forward to
                    shield his associates and to take the whole blame upon himself, rendering
                    himself liable to the barbarous punishments then inflicted by the Algerines upon
                    such of their slaves as sought to escape from their chains. Twice was Cervantes
                    brought into the king’s presence, with a rope round his neck, to be hanged. Once
                    he was ordered two thousand blows with a stick, the penalty being remitted at
                    the last moment only through the prayers of the other captives. The king or
                    viceroy of Algiers at this time was Hassan Pasha, a Venetian renegade, whose
                    name was a terror throughout Christendom. Cervantes himself in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Don Quixote</hi> calls him “the worst of the apostate race,” and “the homicide
                    of human kind.” Haedo pronounces him “the most cruel tyrant of all those who
                    have been kings in Algiers.” Over this monster, who had purchased Cervantes from
                    Déli Mami for 1500 crowns, our hero seems to have exercised an extraordinary
                    influence. Though repeatedly menaced with death in the most horrible forms, and
                    condemned to witness the torture and mutilation of his companions, Cervantes
                    never actually suffered any ill-treatment in person, beyond being fettered, nor
                    was ever abused by an ill-word, as he himself has borne testimony in <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote.</hi> For this exceptional immunity it is not easy to
                    account, even on the theory that his master took him for a person of greater
                    consequence than he really was, and we must attribute it to the extraordinary
                    influence acquired by Cervantes over the other captives, and to the respect
                    engendered by his magnanimity and daring. Hassan Pasha, according to Haedo, was
                    wont to say that “could he keep hold of that maimed Spaniard he would regard as
                    secure his Christians, his ships, and his whole city.” Hassan Pasha’s fears were
                    not wholly unwarranted, although the object of them was but a simple soldier,
                    for Cervantes had conceived the design of a general rising of the captives in
                    Algiers and the seizure of the city. “And assuredly,” says Haedo, “the plan
                    would have succeeded, and Algiers would have been Christian, if his fortune had
                    corresponded to his courage, his zeal, or the greatness of the undertaking.”
                    From the dungeons of Hassan Pasha Cervantes wrote to Mateo Vasquez, the
                    secretary of Philip IL, suggesting the enterprise as one befitting the arms of
                    his royal master; nor was it so desperate as might appear, seeing that the
                    number of Christian captives in that day was nearly 25,000. Philip, however, was
                    then too much occupied in the conquest of the Christian kingdom of Portugal to
                    bestow any attention on the daring project of Cervantes.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, while the captive was wasting his heart away in chains and in
                    fruitless struggles for liberty, his friends in Spain were not neglectful of his
                    condition. His family were too poor to be able of their own resources to raise
                    the sum demanded by Hassan Pasha for his ransom. At the prayer of his brother
                    Rodrigo an official investigation was held upon the conduct of Cervantes and the
                    circumstances of his captivity, and at the solicitation of the father and
                    mother, the Duke de Sesa wrote a strong letter to King Philip on behalf of the
                    soldier of Lepanto, recounting his services and entreating his majesty’s
                    assistance. No other response, however, was vouchsafed to this and other
                    petitions which were addressed to the Court by Cervantes’s mother (his father
                    being now dead), save a gracious permission to Doña Leonora, dated the 17th of
                    January 1581, to export licensed goods from Valencia to Algiers, to the value of
                    2000 ducats. The profit in this venture was only 60 ducats. The widow and her
                    daughters having raised 300 more, a sum of 500 ducats was made up with the
                    assistance of friends, and entrusted to the hands of Father Juan Gil, the
                    Redemptorist, who embarked for Algiers in May 1580. Hassan Pasha, however, would
                    abate nothing of his demand, which was 1000 ducats, and threatened to take
                    Cervantes with him to Constantinople, whither he was now recalled on the
                    expiration of his term of government. Cervantes was actually embarked and
                    chained to his place at the oar, when, finally, through the pious zeal of the
                    good friar Juan Gil, aided by the liberality of some Christian merchants of
                    Algiers, the sum required was made up. After a little delay in Algiers rendered
                    neces-1 sary to clear himself of some false accusations made against ’ him by
                    his old enemy, Blanco de Paz, Cervantes had at last the joy of arriving, after a
                    long captivity, safe and sound in his native country, landing in Spain towards
                    the close of the year 1580.</p>
                <p>The captivity in Algiers is worthy of more study than it has received from
                    Cervantes’s biographers. Not only did it turn the whole current of his life and
                    influence all his subsequent career, but in it, as the period of his darkest
                    adversity, may be discovered no little of the material on which his character,
                    and even his literary work, was founded. In the hard school of an Algerine <hi
                    rend="italic">bagnio,</hi> amidst chains and misery and the constant sight of
                    death in its most appalling forms, were learnt those lessons of humanity which,
                    controlling his heroic spirit and tempering his romantic fancy, were turned to
                    so memorable a use in <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote.</hi> Like him of La Mancha
                    our knight had started in his life’s adventure with a mind nursed in the glowing
                    visions of chivalry, impatient of wrong-doing, eager for the good, full of faith
                    in manhood, and quick to believe in the ideals of honour which his imagination
                    had <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n362/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0362-0351"/> conceived. He found himself amidst a generation
                    which cared for none of these things, confronted by the stern realities of a
                    commonplace age, tossed about and buffeted in a world in which chivalry had
                    become already an anachronism. There is no need for us to search for the key to
                    the parable of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> knowing the life of the
                    author The experience was a bitter one, such as no man of letters ever had to
                    endure; but from the long ordeal, which ended only with his life, Cervantes
                    emerged sweetened and strengthened. The gay courage which was the essential
                    attribute of his nature, the dauntless good humour—</p>
                <p>“That ever with a frolic welcome took The thunder and the sunshine,”</p>
                <p>had to survive even greater trials than the five years’ slavery in Algiers. On
                    his return to Spain Cervantes was destined to taste of miseries compared to
                    which even the cruelty of Hassan Pasha was kindness. His services, his works,
                    his sufferings, were all forgotten. His absence of five years from the scene had
                    been long enough to erase from the memories of the king and the Court the
                    gallant soldier who had fought and bled at Lepanto. In 1580 Philip II. was
                    marching his army into Portugal, and Cervantes rejoined his old regiment of
                    Figueroa, in which his brother Rodrigo was also serving. The next year we find
                    him engaged in the expedition against the Azores, where the partizans of Dorn
                    Antonio, known to history as the Prior of Ocrato, the rival claimant to the
                    Portuguese throne, were holding out with the assistance of England and France.
                    On the miscarriage of this enterprize through the dissensions between the
                    military and naval commanders, the fleet returned to Lisbon. The next year it
                    took the sea again under the command of Don Alvaro de Bazan, Marqués de Santa
                    Cruz, celebrated by Cervantes in <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> as “that
                    thunderbolt of war, that father of his soldiers, that fortunate and invincible
                    captain.” In the victory gained by Santa Cruz over the allied squadrons off
                    Terceira, on the 25th of July 1582—one of the most brilliant achievements in the
                    annals of the Spanish navy— Cervantes took a part, being on board the admiral’s
                    galleon, the “San Mateo,” which bore the brunt of the fighting. It was not until
                    the year following, however, that the Azores were finally reduced, Rodrigo
                    Cervantes distinguishing himself greatly in the storm of Terceira. During his
                    service and residence in Portugal, of which country and its people he ever spoke
                    with a kindliness rare among Spaniards, Cervantes had some passages of love with
                    a noble Portuguese lady, who bore him a daughter, Isabel, his only child, the
                    object of her father’s tenderest affection and a sharer in all his troubles till
                    his death.</p>
                <p>Of the next few years the record is a brief one. Towards the last months of 1583
                    we hear of Cervantes being at Mostagan, a Spanish post on the Algerine coast,
                    probably still with his regiment, whence he was sent with despatches to the
                    king, by whom he was ordered to return to Oran. He does not seem to have been
                    employed again in any official capacity, and perhaps from this time he began to
                    despair of that military preferment to which his services had given him so just
                    a claim. Even if it were possible for one in his station to attract the personal
                    notice of the king, we could not expect that such a man as Philip should
                    recognize the merit of the future author of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi>
                    nor could the morose tyrant who grudged the glory of Lepanto to his brother be
                    particularly well disposed to one whose chief title to remembrance was his share
                    in that victory. By the end of 1583 Cervantes appears to have quitted the
                    profession of arms and returned to literature, being now in his thirty-sixth
                    year. About this time he wrote <hi rend="italic">Galatea,</hi> a prose pastoral
                    interspersed with lyrics, inspired, according to the tradition, by love of the
                    lady he was then courting, and wüo became his wife. Dedicated to Ascanio
                    Colonna, son of Marco Antonio of that name, Cervantes’s old commander, it
                    appears to have been favourably received, and is not more unreadable than the
                    books of that class so happily ridiculed by Cervantes himself in the 73d chapter
                    of the second part of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote.</hi> As the author himself
                    frankly informs his readers, his “shepherds and shepherdesses are many of them
                    only such in their dress.” Their names of Lauso, Tirsi, and Damon are but the
                    grotesque disguises of celebrated poets of the time and friends of Cervantes—in
                    Galatea being pictured his future wife and in Elisio himself. They talk
                    high-flown sentiment and make stilted love after the manner of the school of Gil
                    Polo in his <hi rend="italic">Diana Enamorada,</hi> nor is their talk more
                    insipid than is usual to the pastoral profession in fable. There is no better
                    criticism of the book than that which Cervantes himself has given through the
                    mouth of the priest in the scrutiny of Don Quixote’s library. “What book is that
                    î” “The <hi rend="italic">Galatea</hi> of Miguel de Cer vantes,” said the
                    barber. “’ Tis many years since he has been a great friend of mine that
                    Cervantes, and I know that he is rather versed in sorrow than in poetry. This
                    book has some invention; it proposes something, and it concludes nothing; it
                    behoves us to wait for the second part which he promises. Perhaps with his
                    amendment he will obtain that entire pardon which is now denied to him; in the
                    meantime, gossip, keep him a recluse in your chamber.” This second part never
                    appeared, perhaps with no loss to the author’s reputation. Poor as the verse is
                    in <hi rend="italic">Galatea,</hi> it secured for Cervantes a place among the
                    chief poets of the age, and there is evidence to show that it was held in
                    esteem, even out of Spain, before and after the appearance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Don Quixote.</hi></p>
                <p>On the 12th of December 1584 Cervantes added to his happiness if not to his
                    fortune by a marriage with Doña Catalina de Palacios Salazar y Vozmediano, a
                    lady of good family of Esquivias. The settlement on his wife of a hundred
                    ducats, supposed to be one-tenth of his estate, and the inventory of his effects
                    taken at this time, among which are included “45 hens, some chickens, and a
                    cock,” prove that the bridegroom was in but indifferent circumstances, even for
                    a poor <hi rend="italic">hidalgo</hi> of the time. Of the lady the records give
                    us scarcely a glimpse, and indeed for some years after his marriage the life of
                    Cervantes is wrapt in obscurity. All that is known is that he wrote poetry, and
                    won many friends among the poets by his good nature and genial humour. He wrote
                    for the stage also for a living, producing between twenty and thirty plays,
                    chiefly comedies, of which only two survive, <hi rend="italic">La Numancia</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">El Trato de Årgel.</hi> There seems to be no reason to
                    doubt Cervantes’s own statement that as a playwright he gained considerable
                    applause, and it has been proved that the payment he received was quite as high
                    as that given to Lope de Vega. August Schlegel has assigned high rank to <hi
                    rend="italic">La Numancia</hi> as one of the most striking and original of
                    modern tragedies, and <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Confusa,</hi> a
                    comedy now lost, is spoken of with much complacency by its author. The gifts of
                    Cervantes, however, were not those of the dramatist, and such fame as he had
                    begun to win paled before the rising star of that “monster of nature,” Lope de
                    Vega. Once more disappointed in his hopes of a livelihood, and having now to
                    support his wife, his widowed sister, and his natural daughter, Cervantes was
                    forced to seek for bread by other means than literature. For twenty years— the
                    darkest period of his life—he ceased to write, or at least to publish. The poor
                    crippled soldier had to drink of a cup even more bitter than loss of liberty
                    among the Moors. A veil hangs over this portion of his career, which his
                    countrymen, for their own sake no less than for his, are not too eager to lift,
                    hiding, as it is only too certain <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0363-0352"/> that it does, penury, rags, almost beggary,
                    misery of every kind except shame. Throughout all these trials what is known of
                    Cervantes proves him at least to have retained undimmed his cheerfulness of
                    spirit, his rare sweetness of disposition and faith in humanity, “as. one in
                    suffering all that suffers nothing.” In 1588 he is found at Seville filling the
                    humble place of a commissary under Don Antonio de Guevara, the Proveédor-General
                    of the Indian fleets. In this capacity he had to assist in the victualling of
                    the Invincible Armada, and documents preserved in the archives of Seville prove
                    his activity in the purchase of grain, oil, and wine among the villages of
                    Andalusia,—gleaning, besides naval stores, much of that knowledge of life and
                    character of which he afterwards made such admirable use. In 1590 he petitioned
                    the king for employment in the Indies, minutely recapitulating his past
                    services, aud naming four offices then vacant as those he was qualified to
                    fill—the accountantship of New Granada, that of the galleys of Carthagena, the
                    government of the province of Socomusco, in Guatemala, and the cofre-gidorship
                    of the city of La Paz. The petition was coldly received and bore no fruit, for
                    which perhaps the ingratitude of the Government was not wholly to blame. The
                    habits of unthrift and restlessness which he had acquired as a soldier, together
                    with such weaknesses as were the natural defects of his virtues of extreme good
                    nature and easiness of disposition, must have unfitted him to some extent for
                    the sober pursuits of civil life ∙ and Cervantes himself seems to hint, in a
                    passage in <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> as well as in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Journey to Parnassus,</hi> at some imprudence which contributed to
                    spoil his advancement. He continued for some years to hold his poor place of
                    commissary, residing chiefly at Seville. At a poetical competition held at
                    Saragossa in honour of the canonization of San Jacinto, in 1595, he was adjudged
                    the first prize—three silver spoons. The next year, on the occasion of the
                    sacking of Seville by the English under Essex, he wrote a sonnet, ridiculing
                    with fine irony the behaviour of the Duke of Medina-Celi, who, having a large
                    force at his command for the defence of the city, only appeared on the scene
                    when the English had departed. Owing to the treachery and failure of an agent,
                    through whom he had remitted to Madrid a sum of money, collected on account of
                    the Government, Cervantes about this time became involved in a pecuniary
                    difficulty, which continued to be a source of annoyance to him for some years,
                    in addition to his other troubles. Being unable to repay the money at the king’s
                    mandate, he was cast into prison, but having succeeded in scraping together
                    enough to reduce his debt to a few hundred reals, he was released after a few
                    days’ detention. Neither on this occasion, nor on two subsequent ones when he
                    fell under the cognizance of the law, was there left any stain.upon his honour,
                    nor any fault alleged beyond that of carelessness or undue trustfulness. On the
                    death of Philip II., in 1598, his obsequies were celebrated at Seville with such
                    extravagant pomp and grandeur of decoration as to awake the ridicule of
                    Cervantes, who, never a lover of the defunct monarch, gave vent to his feelings
                    in a sonnet which is one of the happiest of his lighter effusions in this which
                    was his true vein in poetry. At this period the author, in spite of his poverty
                    and mean condition, seems to have enjoyed the society and friendship of his
                    countrymen most famous in literature and art, among others of the celebrated
                    poet Fernando de Herrera and the artists Pacheco and Jaureguy, by both of whom
                    his portrait was painted. He wrote and circulated in manuscript some of those
                    novels which many years later he completed and published; but like the poor poet
                    whom he has described, half of his divine thoughts and imaginations were taken
                    up in the study of the means of daily bread for himself and his family.</p>
                <p>The four years succeeding 1598 are wholly a blank in the life of Cervantes.
                    Tradition assigns to this period the visit to La Mancha where occurred that new
                    trouble of which <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> is supposed to be the
                    vengeance. The story is, that Cervantes had a commission from the prior of St
                    John to collect his tithes in the district of Argamasilla, and that while he was
                    employed in this ungrateful function the villagers set upon him, and after
                    maltreating him threw him into prison, his place of imprisonment being a house
                    still standing called <hi rend="italic">La Casa de Medrano.</hi> Here, according
                    to a general consensus of opinion, was conceived, if not written, the first part
                    of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> conformably to what the author says in
                    the prologue of this “child of his wit” being “born in a gaol.”</p>
                <p>In 1603 Cervantes is found living at Valladolid, among the herd of starving
                    soldiers and needy writers expectant of preferment which then filled the Court.
                    The favours of Philip III., good natured and well-disposed to literature, were
                    dispensed by the Duke de Lerma, then at the height of his power, whose haughty,
                    cold, and selfish nature was little likely to see merit in Cervantes. Once more
                    disappointed in his hopes of preferment, Cervantes was reduced to the utmost
                    straits of poverty, eking out a living by business agencies and humble literary
                    employment, such as writing petitions and correcting manuscripts, aided by such
                    small gains as the ladies of his household were able to earn by the labours of
                    the needle. By the beginning of 1604 he had completed the work which was
                    destined to give him, if not bread, immortality. The First Part of <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> begun, according to internal evidence, before
                    the death of Philip II., was now ready for the press. The date is the same which
                    the majority of Shakespearian critics have assigned to the first appearance of
                    the second and perfect <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> nor
                    is this the only coincidence between the lives of these two great
                    contemporaries. A patron being in that age as necessary to an author as a
                    publisher, Cervantes with some difficulty found one in the Duke de Bejar, a
                    nobleman of high rank and honour, ambitious of the name of a Maecenas. The
                    tradition which tells how the duke’s scruples at connecting his name with a book
                    of so novel a character and equivocal a purpose were surmounted is probably well
                    founded. Instigated, it is said, by his confessor, who scented heresy, or at
                    least a dangerous humour, in this book with a strange name, the Duke de Bejar
                    withdrew the promise of patronage he had given and would not accept Cervantes’s
                    dedication. The author, however, begged hard for permission to read a chapter of
                    his story before the duke, and pleased him so well that his objections were
                    overcome. The licence for publication was obtained on the 26th September 1604,
                    and in the beginning of the next year the first part of <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Quixote</hi> was printed at Madrid by Juan de la Cuesta, and published by
                    Francisco de Robles, to whom Cervantes had sold the copyright for ten years. The
                    theory that the book was received coldly at first, so that Cervantes was induced
                    to write a tract called <hi rend="italic">El Buscapie,</hi> in order to attract
                    the attention of the public to <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> and to
                    stimulate their curiosity by hinting that the characters and incidents were not
                    wholly imaginary, must be rejected as unsupported by a tittle of evidence and
                    wholly opposed to the facts. There is no proof that any such tract as <hi
                    rend="italic">El Buscapie</hi> ever existed until Don Adolfo de Castro published
                    in 1848 what all competent Spanish critics have pronounced to be a clumsy and
                    impudent forgery. There could be no reason for such a publication by Cervantes,
                    seeing that <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> was received by the great mass of
                    the public with marked and singular applause. Although certain great literary
                    personages, and some of Cervantes’s own friends, from suspicion that they were
                    included in the satire or from jealousy of his success, professed to sneer at
                    the book because of its vulgar <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n364/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0364-0353"/> style, its unbecoming subject, and its bizarre
                    title, there can be no doubt of the extraordinary popularity achieved by <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote on</hi> its fiι∙st appearance. No fewer than six
                    impressions of the first edition of 1605 are extant, of which two were issued at
                    Madrid, two at Valencia, and two at Lisbon. There had appeared up to that date
                    no book since the invention of printing which had so many readers. To that
                    artificial age, reared in the insipid extravagances of the successors of Amadis,
                    <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> was as the dawn of a new revelation. The
                    humour, equally simple and deep, the easy, careless grace of the narrative, the
                    fine wisdom and tenderness, the true charity, of this book which professed to be
                    a burlesque of the romances of chivalry, were qualities as rare as they were
                    delightful in Spanish literature. Even those who missed the allegory and were
                    insensible to the satire could not but enjoy the story with its fresh and lively
                    pictures of national life and character. That which has become, to use the
                    phrase of Sainte-Beuve, “the book of humanity,” was no less successful in its
                    age as a book of popular recreation. The author himself was probably amazed at
                    his own success. Like his great contemporary Shakespeare, while careful of his
                    lesser works he seems to have abandoned his masterpiece to the printers with
                    scarcely a thought of his literary reputation. All the first editions of <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> swarm with blunders of the most extraordinary
                    kind, proving that Cervantes could never have revised the printing, even if he
                    had looked through his manuscript before committing it to the press. He is made
                    to forget in one chapter what he had written in another. He confounds even the
                    names of his characters, calling Sancho’s wife Theresa in one p!ace and Maria in
                    another—the very blunders of which he afterwards accused his enemy Avellaneda.
                    He makes Sancho ride his ass immediately after it had been stolen by Gines de
                    Passamonte, and bewail its loss when it had been recovered. He confounds time,
                    place, and persons, and abounds in inaccuracies and anachronisms, to the
                    distraction of his readers, the perturbation of his critics, and the serious
                    grief of his admirers. The style of this first part of <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Quixote,</hi> in spite of occasional passages of beauty which are among the
                    models of the Castilian tongue, is loose, slovenly, and inartistic. Even in the
                    second edition, published in 1608 and revised by the author, a great many patent
                    blunders were suffered to stand, over which Cervantes himself makes merry in the
                    second part. All this is unfavourable to the theory which some critics have
                    formed that there was a purpose in the book other than what appears on the
                    surface. There is no reason to doubt Cervantes’s own declaration, several times
                    repeated, that in writing <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> he had no other
                    design than to destroy the credit of those romances of chivalry whose reading
                    was so pernicious to the taste and morals of the age, and to furnish “a pastime
                    for melancholy and gloomy spirits.” The idea of Byron that Cervantes “laughed
                    Spain’s chivalry away” is not more absurd than some recent conjectures that <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> was intended as a satire upon certain leading
                    personages of the Spanish court, especially upon the Duke de Lerma. The chivalry
                    of Spain was already gone before Cervantes wrote. Had it not been gone <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> would not have been written, nor would it have
                    fallen to Cervantes, the most chivalrous of men, to deliver its death stroke.
                    Not chivalry, but the foolish and extravagant romances of chivalry it was which
                    Cervantes undertook to destroy; and so completely was his work done that none of
                    them appeared after 1604. There was no man of that age more deeply imbued, as
                    his life bears witness, with the true chivalrous spirit, nor was there any
                    better affected, as his book shows, to all the literature of chivalry. <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> itself is a romance of chivalry, certainly not
                    less inspired with the purest sentiment of honour, or furnishing a less exalted
                    model of knighthood than Amadis of Gaul or Palmerin of England. Every passage of
                    it proves how carefully and sympathetically Cervantes had studied his originals.
                    For the romance of Amadis itself, as contained in the four first books of
                    Garci-Ordoñez, Cervantes always professed a high respect. What he intended to
                    ridicule was the continuation of Amadis in all the endless series of his
                    descendants, each surpassing its predecessor in extravagance and folly.. The
                    theory that Cervantes wrote <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> in order to
                    revenge himself on the Duke de Lerma and his satellites, which has been revived
                    in these latter days, scarcely deserves serious refutation. To those who are
                    able to believe that in the character of the knight of La Mancha the author
                    intended to portray his mortal enemy the more material improbabilities which
                    surround this hypothesis will present no difficulty. In one sense <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> is indeed a satire; but the follies it ridicules
                    are those common to all humanity and to every age, and the satire is of that
                    rare kind which moves not to depreciation but to love and pity of the object—to
                    sympathy ratheY than to contempt, and to tears as well as laughter. Don Quixote
                    and Sancho Panza are permanent types individualized. They are as true for all
                    time as for the sixteenth century—for all the world as for Spain. The antithesis
                    of the pure imagination without understanding and the commonplace good sense
                    without imagination which these two represent is the eternal conflict which
                    possesses the world. The secret of the marvellous success of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Don Quixote,</hi> of the extraordinary popularity which makes it not only the
                    great book of Spain but a book for all mankind, has been aptly described by
                    Coleridge to lie in the rare combination of the permanent with the individual
                    which the genius of the author has been enabled to achieve. Don Quixote is not
                    only the perfect man of imagination, less the understanding, but he is a living
                    picture of the Spanish <hi rend="italic">hidalgo</hi> of the time of Philip II.
                    Sancho is the ideal commonplace man of sense, less the imagination, and also the
                    pure Manchegan peasant. In the carrying out of his happy conception Cervantes
                    was doubtless careless of his own main purpose, so that this burlesque of
                    romance has become a real picture of life—this caricature of chivalry the truest
                    chivalric model—this life of a fool the wisest of books.</p>
                <p>The fame acquired by the publication of the first part of <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Quixote</hi> does not appear to have contributed materially to the improvement
                    of the author’s fortunes. In 1605 he was still living at Valladolid, where, with
                    his usual ill-luck, he was involved in a painful incident which brought him once
                    more, though perfectly innocent, into collision with the authorities. A young
                    nobleman of the court, being wounded in a street brawl, was carried into the
                    house where Cervantes lodged to be tended, and died there of his hurts.
                    Cervantes and his family, with the other inmates of the house, were cast into
                    prison, according to the rough process of Spanish law, until they could be
                    examined before the alcalde. From the depositions of the witnesses, which are
                    extant, we learn that at this time Cervantes’s household consisted of his wife,
                    his natural daughter Isabel, over 20 years old, his widowed sister Andrea, with
                    her daughter Constanza, and another sister, Magdalena, with one female servant;
                    and that he made his living by writing and general agency. In May of this year
                    there arrived at Madrid the earl of Huntingdon with a retinue of 600 persons
                    from England, bearing a message of congratulation to the king on the birth of
                    his heir, afterwards Philip IV., on which occasion were given a series of
                    magnificent entertainments. On the strength of an allusion in a satirical sonnet
                    by Gongara, a narrative of the festivities, published in 1605 and still extant,
                    has been attributed to Cervantes, but it bears no marks of his style, and it <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n365/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0365-0354"/> is not probable that he would be employed on such
                    a purpose. There is better evidence of his hand in a letter to Don Diego de
                    Astudillo Carillo, discovered in the Bibliotheca Colombina at Seville in 1845,
                    giving an account of a burlesque tourney or poetical joust held in the suburb of
                    San Juan de Alfaracheon the feast of St Laurence. From this it would appear that
                    Cervantes was on a visit to Seville in 1606, and on terms of familiar
                    intercourse with many distinguished poets; also that allusions to <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> and quotations from the book were familiar in the
                    .mouths of the wits of the time. Thenceforward to his death, Cervantes seems to
                    have resided at Madrid, whither he had followed the court from Valladolid, with
                    but little improvement in his worldly circumstances, supported chiefly by a
                    pension from the archbishop of Toledo, and casual gratuities from his other
                    patron the Count de Lemos. In 1608 was published the second edition of the first
                    part of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> with some corrections and additions
                    by the author. The next year, following the fashion of the times, he entered as
                    a lay brother into the Oratory of Cañizares, together with Lope de Vega,
                    Quevedo, Espinel, and many other of his contemporaries and friends. In 1610, the
                    Count de Lemos was appointed viceroy of Naples, and Cervantes seems to have been
                    indulged with some promises of being made his secretary, but his advanced age
                    and his dependent family were made the pretext for his being passed over in
                    favour of his rival and pretended friend, Leonardo Argensoia. In 1613, he gave
                    to the world his <hi rend="italic">Novelas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Exemplares,</hi> some of which had been .written many years before—a collection
                    of tales of very various character, in a style till then unknown in Spain, owing
                    little beyond their form to the Italian models. These stories, undeservedly
                    neglected out of their native country, must be reckoned as second in merit among
                    Cervantes’s writings, and even superior to <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> in
                    elegance of style. They are indeed the true originals in the modern literature
                    of Europe of the novel, or story of real life, with plot, character, and
                    scenery, and display in a very remarkable degree not only the versatility of
                    their author’s genius but his extreme familiarity with every type of Spanish
                    society, especially of the lower orders of the people. In the charming story of
                    <hi rend="italic">La Gitanella,</hi> among some of the best of Cervantes’s
                    lyrics, is to be found the germ of all the gipsy romances, poems, and operas,
                    which have since delighted the world, and in <hi rend="italic">Rinconete</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Gortadillo</hi> we have a picture of a
                    Spanish Alsatia as vivid and real as anything by Defoe or Dickens. Indeed, these
                    stories, rich in incident, character, and invention, have been a mine in which
                    the novelists and dramatists of all countries have delved,—Scott himself,
                    according to Lockhart, confessing that he first drew from them his idea of
                    writing the <hi rend="italic">Waverley Novels.</hi> In his dedication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Novelas</hi> to the Count de Lemos, Cervantes speaks of being
                    engaged on several other works, among them the second part of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Don Quixote</hi>; and in the prologue, which contains some interesting details
                    of his biography, he gives this portrait of himself in his 65th year:—“Of
                    aquiline features, chesnut hair, a smooth and open forehead, with cheerful eyes,
                    a nose curved though well proportioned, long mustaches, the beard of silver
                    (which twenty years ago was of gold), the mouth small, the teeth not much, for
                    he has but six, and those in bad condition and worse placed for they have no
                    concert one with another; the body between two extremes, neither large nor
                    small, the complexion lively, rather white than brown, somewhat crooked in the
                    shoulders, and not very light of feet—this, I say, is the effigy of the author
                    of <hi rend="italic">Galatea</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote de la
                    Mancha.”</hi> Upon this description of his person—to which it may be added that
                    he stammered in his speech and had lost the use of his left hand by the wound
                    received at</p>
                <p>Lepanto—has been founded that ideal portrait, first designed by the English
                    engraver Kent for Lord Carteret’s edition of 1753, and since then ignorantly
                    copied and repeated in Spain and everywhere as the true image of Miguel de
                    Cervantes.</p>
                <p>In 1614 was published the <hi rend="italic">Viage al</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Parnaso,</hi> which with all its faults may be said to be the most successful
                    of our author’s essays in verse. It is a burlesque poem, professedly in
                    imitation of one with the same title by the Italian, Cesare Caporali, but having
                    little but the name in common with its predecessor. The half serious half
                    jesting vein in which Cervantes here indulges was unquestionably that which was
                    most natural to his genius, and in spite of the cumbrousness of the allegorical
                    machinery, and the excessive laudation which, as usual, he heaps on the small
                    writers his contemporaries, the poem abounds in fancy, humour, and invention.
                    The seventh book, in which is described the encounter between the armies of the
                    good and bad poets, may compare with the <hi rend="italic">Battle of the
                    Books</hi> and the fifth canto of the <hi rend="italic">Lutrin</hi> Cervantes’s
                    fancy of making the combatants wound one another with odes and sonnets is surely
                    happier than either Swift’s, where the authors use the ordinary weapons of
                    Homeric war, or Boileau’s, where the monks discharge material volumes. Not the
                    least interesting portion of this poem is the fourth book, wherein the author
                    speaks of himself, his labours, and his misfortunes, with a characteristic
                    mixture of modesty, gaiety, and simple self-confidence. In the prose appendix is
                    a spirited and humorous dialogue with a messenger from Apollo concerning
                    Cervantes’s relations to the theatre, and the reason of his ill-success as a
                    dramatist. After thirty years’ retirement from the stage, during which interval
                    the great Lope de Vega had arisen in all his glory, and he and his imitators
                    had, by their fertility and their submissive devotion to the vulgar taste no
                    less than by their genius, obtained the complete mastery of the national drama,
                    Cervantes could hardly hope to recover fpr himself that position as a playwright
                    to the memory of which he seems to have always clung with tenacity. Encouraged,
                    however, by the renewal of his popularity as a writer, or stimulated perhaps by
                    his necessities, he made in his old age another experiment in the drama, in
                    which it is sad to find that he abandoned all those admirable principles which
                    he had advocated through the mouth of the Canon in <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Quixote,</hi> surrendering himself to the vicious models he had himself so
                    eloquently condemned. The result was unfortunate for his reputation. A
                    collection of eight comedies and as many interludes was published in 1614, with
                    a preface in which the author reports naively of his ill-success in the
                    negotiation for a sale of their copyright. He would buy them, the bookseller
                    said, were it not that he had been told by a certain person of distinction that
                    “of the prose of Miguel de Cervantes much could be expected, but of his poetry
                    nothing.” This opinion was probably confirmed by these plays, which are so
                    unworthy of their author that when reproduced in 1749 by Blas de Nasarre, that
                    editor maintained the ingenious paradox that Cervantes had made them purposely
                    bad in order to ridicule the plays of the day, just as he had written <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> to ridicule the books of chivalry. There is no
                    need of any such theory to account for the failure of Cervantes in the drama.
                    His genius was unsuited to the stage. The qualities in which he most excelled
                    were essentially undra∏ιatic, nor can his persistent efforts to recover his
                    position as a playwright, even after the success of <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Quixote</hi> had been assured, be explained otherwise than by the fact that the
                    stage was then almost the only road to ħterary fortune. The first part of <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> had brought him fame, but nothing more. Before
                    the appearance of the second part, the plan <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0366-0355"/> of which had been freely announced to his friends
                    for some time previously, Cervantes was destined to encounter perhaps the
                    strangest of the many crosses with which his pitiless evil star teased him to
                    the end of his troubled and painful life. He had seen, while in the flush of
                    manhood, his dream of soldiership dispelled by a cruel captivity. He had
                    experienced the overthrow of all his hopes of civil preferment. He had been
                    subject to every kind of mortification in his literary ambition. He had been
                    jostled out of the arena by his rivals in poetry and in the drama. When old,
                    infirm, and destitute, his genius had at last found in <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Quixote</hi> its proper field of employment and something like a fitting
                    recognition. But even here he was not to be left undisturbed. The ill-fortune
                    which never ceased to make him its mark was able to send a shaft through this
                    his strongest side, which poisoned all his hardly-earned triumph and vexed him
                    to the grave. The story of the false second part of <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Quixote,</hi> published under the name of Avellañeda, is one of the strangest in
                    literary history, the mystery of which, though it has occupied many volumes, is
                    not yet wholly unravelled. It is sufficient here to say that after it was well
                    known that Cervantes was employed upon and had nearly completed his second part
                    of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> there appeared at Tarragona in 1614: a
                    book pretending to be a continuation of the knight’s adventures, by Alonso
                    Fernandez de Avellañeda, a native of Tordesillas. The manifest object of this
                    impudent fabrication was to malign the character of Cervantes, to destroy the
                    credit of his book, and to deprive him of the fame and profit which he expected
                    to derive from its completion. In a preface, full of a curious malignity,
                    evidently arising from some cause deeper than literary envy, Cervantes was
                    reproached in the grossest terms with his infirmities and misfortunes, even with
                    his wounds,—sneered at as one “with more tongue than hands,”—reviled as old,
                    poor, and without friends,—branded as envious and discontented, a calumniator of
                    great men, and an evil-speaker even of the Church and the Holy Office. In the
                    body of the book, under pretence of carrying on the story, every opportunity is
                    taken to spoil it, by degrading the characters and giving a coarse turn to the
                    incidents. Don Quixote is debased into a wild lunatic, who ends his days in a
                    mad-house; Sancho is turned into a dull buffoon and his humour into brutal
                    gluttony. In place of the witty and beautiful Dorothea we have the gross wench
                    Barbara; and the graceful episodes of the original are represented by a string
                    of dreary and vulgar adventures, without life, colour, or probability. Apart
                    from the spirit of malice, the book, in the words of Ticknor, is “so completely
                    without dignity or consistency that it is clear the writer did not possess the
                    power of comprehending the genius he at once basely libelled and meanly
                    attempted to supplant.” Nothing in viler taste has ever disfigured the
                    literature of any nation, and it is greatly to the scandal of Cervantes’s
                    countrymen, noï the least of the injuries they have done him, alive and dead,
                    that they have suffered such a book to be reprinted and to retain a place in
                    their national collections. The false <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> in
                    which Le Sage, and even some later critics, both French and Spanish, have
                    pretended to see merits equal if not superior to those of the true, is now
                    remembered only by Cervantes’s perhaps too frequent references to it in the
                    later chapters of his own book, and has little interest except in connection
                    with the mystery of his life. The identity of Avellañeda is a problem which has
                    greatly exercised the Spanish critics. The weight of opinion is in favour of its
                    being the disguise of the notorious Fray Luis de Aliaga, the low-born confessor
                    and minion of the Duke de Lerma, who was high in power during the reign of Phihp
                    HI. Of all whose names have been suggested as the probable author of the
                    spurious <hi rend="italic">Quixote</hi> Aliaga is the only one who fulfils the
                    required conditions. He was a Dominican, a preacher, and an Aragonese. He was an
                    intimate friend of Lope de Vega, whose cause he openly espoused. He was in the
                    confidence of the Holy Office, and may be suspected of not being well-disposed
                    to Cervantes’s patron the archbishop of Toledo, whom he succeeded as
                    Inquisitor-General. He was known to be of a rancorous and envious spirit, who
                    had written more than one pseudonymous libel, and was himself the mark of
                    frequent caricatures and lampoons. Lastly, it has been proved that, before the
                    appearance of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> Aliaga’s well-known nickname
                    was Sancho. There was much in the book of Cervantes to give such a man offence,
                    even whether such offence was intended or not,—in his person, his character, his
                    office, and his religion. That as Avellañeda he found assistance among some of
                    the writers of the period, rivals of Cervantes and jealous of his fame, is very
                    probable; and there is only too much reason for suspecting that the great Lope
                    de Vega himself was one of Aliaga’s allies. Although Spanish writers are slow to
                    admit that the relations between the two illustrious contemporaries were
                    otherwise than friendly, and although on the side of Cervantes there never was
                    any other than the spirit of perfect courtesy, loyalty, and magnanimity which
                    became his own noble nature, recent researches have proved that by Lope de Vega
                    these feelings were not honestly reciprocated. He who was called by his own
                    familiar friend Alarcon “the universal envier of other men’s meeds” is known to
                    have regarded with jealous eyes the sudden popularity achieved by his despised
                    competitor in <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote.</hi> In addition to other-proofs of
                    an indirect kind tending to show that about the time of the appearance of <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> Lope de Vega was ill-disposed towards his once
                    intimate friend, we have the direct evidence of the letter discovered by Schack
                    among the manuscripts of Count Altamira, dated August 4, 1604, wherein occurs
                    this passage:—“Of poets I speak not; many are budding for the year to come; but
                    none is so bad as Cervantes, or so stupid as to praise <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Quixote.”</hi> With <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> it could scarcely be
                    expected that Lope would be pleased; and there was much in the book, especially
                    in the Canon’s strictures on the popular drama, to give him offence. If he
                    stooped so low for his revenge as to inspire or to aid his friend Aliaga to
                    write the false <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> his triumph was but brief.
                    At the close of 1615 Cervantes published his own second part, and from that
                    moment the other was for ever blotted from the world’s memory. This second part,
                    though bearing marks of haste in the concluding chapters, belies, according to
                    the judgment of the best critics, the opinion of the author himself as expressed
                    through the mouth of the Priest, that second parts are never good. Although
                    written in old age it contains at least as much of the glow and warmth of
                    imagination as the first, while it is even superior in invention. There is more
                    harmony-in the construction, more correctness if not more vigour in the style,
                    with fewer distractions and digressions. The author has more confidence in
                    himself and more love of his work. His hero is more consistent in his madness,
                    Sancho more pleasant in his sanity. Both master and man, especially the latter,
                    while still true to their character, have developed into an ampler and richer
                    nature. They have evidently advanced in their creator’s favour, and have more
                    pains taken with their behaviour. The knight is more lovable, the squire more
                    humorous; and the whole treatment of the story, with its vivacity and variety,
                    its easy flow of narrative, and its masterly and pathetic close, is worthy of
                    the happy genius of which it is the crown and full development.</p>
                <p>By this time the fame of Cervantes had spread through many lands. Numerous
                    editions of his <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n367/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0367-0356"/> been printed, either in the original or in
                    translation, thus realizing the author’s prediction that there would be no
                    nation or language to which his book would not be carried. According to the
                    interesting story told by the archbishop of Toledo’s secretary, in his
                    approbation appended to the second part, dated February 1615, foreigners of
                    distinction, when they visited Madrid, made it their first business to enquire
                    after the author of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote.</hi> To a party <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">oí</hi> French gentlemen, members of the suite of the
                    ambassador, the Duc de Mayenne, who were anxious to learn of the condition and
                    mode of life of the celebrated writer, the secretary of the archbishop was
                    obliged to respond that “he who had made all the world rich was poor and infirm,
                    though a soldier and a gentleman.” The man who was the delight of his age and
                    destined to be the chief glory of his country was indeed still in great misery,
                    depending on alms for his subsistence, and now in his sixty-ninth year stricken
                    by a mortal disease. In the dedication of his second part of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Don Quixote</hi> to the Count de Lemos, Cervantes speaks of his broken health
                    and approaching end, still with unabated courage and cheerfulness. His last
                    work, not published till after his death, was <hi rend="italic">Derides and
                    Sigismunda,</hi> a romance of love and adventure after the model of Heliodorus,
                    on which he bestowed great pains and singular affection, declaring that it would
                    be either the best or the worst of his books. The dedication to the Count de
                    Lemos is written with an astonishing gaiety and spirit, though it announces that
                    the author had yesterday received extreme unction, and had “one foot in the
                    stirrups,” waiting for a summons. About this time must have occurred that
                    adventure, which is so pleasantly told in the prologue, of the meeting with the
                    student near Toledo, when our author, in a grievous state from dropsy, was
                    returning from a visit to his wife’s family at Esquivias, at the close of which
                    he wrote:—“And so farewell, humours; farewell, my gay friends, for I feel myself
                    dying, and have no desire but soon to see you happy in the other world.” On the
                    4th of April he entered the order of the Franciscan Friars, whose habit,
                    following the fashion of the period, he had assumed three years before, and on
                    the 23d of that month he ended, in all serenity and cheerfulness, his life of
                    many troubles. In the same year, and nominally on the same day, though really
                    ten days later, allowance being made for the difference of calendars, died
                    William Shakespeare in England. Cervantes’s body was buried humbly at the
                    expense of his religious order in the convent of the Trinitarian Nuns in the
                    Calle de Humilladero, of which community his daughter Isabel was a professed
                    member. In 1633 the nuns moved to a new site in the Calle de Cantarrenas, and
                    having exhumed and brought away their dead with them, the bones of Cervantes
                    were mingled with others in a common ossuary, so that Spain, who had shown
                    herself so careless of him in life, has lost all trace of him in death. So
                    closes a record as glorious and as calamitous as any in literary history, of one
                    of the world’s greatest benefactors, whom the world knew not— of the best of ail
                    Spaniards, the very type and perfect embodiment of the highest Castilian nature,
                    whom his country starved and who has made her immortal.</p>
                <p>The language of eulogy has been exhausted over that work of Miguel de Cervantes
                    which for two hundred and fifty years has been the delight of mankind in a
                    degree such as no other book has ever approached. There is nothing to add to the
                    tribute which the critics of all countries have joined in paying to the wisest,
                    tenderest, and deepest of humourists.</p>
                <p>The popularity of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> ia best attested by the
                    extraordinary number of editions and translations which have appeared in all
                    languages. According to a computation made by Don Lope de Fabra, in his appendix
                    to the Barcelona fac-similé of the first edition, there were published, up to
                    1874, 278 editions of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> of which 87 appeared
                    in Spain, and 191 in other countries. Of these, 136 are in the original.
                    Translations have appeared in English, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Danish,
                    and indeed in every European tongue, including Turkish. England, who of all
                    foreign nations has ever been foremost in recognizing the genius of Cervantes,
                    is entitled to the honour of having produced the first critical edition of the
                    Spanish text, which is that of Dr John Bowie, published at Salisbury in 1781.
                    This has served as the basis of all the subsequent Spanish editions; for
                    although the Royal Academy anticipated Bowie by a year in its magnificent
                    edition printed by Ibarra, it was a knowledge of the Englishman’s design, and to
                    some extent of his labours, which prompted that undertaking. The other most
                    important critical editions in Spanish are that of Pellicer, published in 1797,
                    who has borrowed largely, and not with due acknowledgment, from Bowie; that of
                    Clemencin, in 1833-39, with a very elaborate commentary, displaying much
                    industry and learning but little taste or sympathy, and sadly lacking in
                    reverence for the author; and that in the complete edition of Cervantes’s works
                    printed at Argamasilla in 1864, under the editorship of Don Eugenio de
                    Hartzenbusch and Don Cayetano Alberto de Rosell,—superb in type and paper, but
                    otherwise of little value, with a text disfigured by wanton emendations. The
                    principal English translations are— the first, by Thomas Shelton, which is also
                    the earliest version of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> in any foreign
                    language, published in 1612-20, vigorous, and of a spirit akin to the original,
                    but Hide and incorrect; that of Motteux, absurdly over-praised by Lockhart,
                    which is nothing more than a loose paraphrase of Cervantes’s text, in a style
                    consciously comic and therefore of all the most unhappy for <hi rend="italic"
                    >Don Quixote;</hi> that of Jarvis, which, with some trifling revisions, is the
                    current accepted version—correct and careful, but dull, commonplace, and
                    destitute of humour; and that of Smollett, which is the worst of all, being a
                    piece of hack-work done for the booksellers, without knowledge of Spanish, or
                    even such an insight into his author’s meaning as his kindred genius should have
                    suggested. By far the best life of Cervantes is that by Don Martin Fernandez de
                    Navarrete, published in Madrid in 1819. (H. E. W.)</p>
