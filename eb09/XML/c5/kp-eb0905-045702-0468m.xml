                    miles N.N.E. of London, with which it is connected by the Great Eastern Railway.
                    It is situated in a valley on the Chelmer, near the confluence of the Cann, and
                    has communication by the river with Maldon and the sea, 11 miles to the east.
                    The Cann is crossed by two bridges, one ef stone and the other of cast-iron; and
                    there is also a bridge over each of the two branches into which the Chelmer is
                    divided at this part of its course. In the neighbourhood of the island enclosed
                    by this bifurcation are the works of the gas company, and the wharves for the
                    barges on the river. Besides the parish church of St Mary, an ancient and
                    elegant edifice, rebuilt in 1428 and again in 1800, the town has seven churches
                    and chapels belonging to different denominations, a grammar school founded by
                    Edward VI., an endowed charity school, a mechanics’ institute, a museum, and a
                    library. It is the seat of the county assizes and quarter sessions, and has an
                    elegant and commodious shire hall. Its corn and cattle markets are among the
                    largest in the county; for the former a fine exchange was provided in 1856 at a
                    cost of £10,000, and a similar sum is being expended on an enclosure for the
                    latter. In the centre of the square in which the corn-exchange is situated there
                    stands a bronze statue, by Bailey, of Lord Chief-Justice Tindal, who was a
                    native of the parish. There are corn mills, tanneries, and a brewery in the
                    town; but most of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture or the trades
                    immediately connected with it. About a mile to the north is situated the county
                    jail at Springfield Hill, and at a distance of two miles to the south is the
                    racecourse, with a grand stand erected in 1863. The town, not being a
                    corporation, is under the government of a local board, and within the limits of
                    that jurisdiction it had 9318 inhabitants in 1872.</p>
                <p>Chelmsford lies but a short distance from the site of the Roman colony of
                    Caesaromagus, usually identified with Writtie. At the time of the Conquest the
                    manor was held by the bishops of London; and in the reign of Henry I. the town
                    was indebted for its bridge over the Cann to Bishop Maurice. After this
                    improvement it rapidly increased in prosperity, and in the reign of Edward HI.
                    it sent four representatives to the council at Westminster. Of the Dominican
                    convent founded in the town at an early period there are no remains; but a
                    chronicle composed by friar Langford is still extant.</p>
