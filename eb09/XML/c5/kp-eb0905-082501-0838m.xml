                    to great temporary influence at Athens during the Peloponnesian War, and
                    especially after the death of Pericles. He was emphatically a man of the people,
                    sprung from their own ranks, his father Cleaenetus having been a tanner or
                    leather-dresser. He possessed considerable ability and was a powerful public
                    speaker, though coarse and violent in manner and language. At first he seems to
                    have formed one of the large party at Athens who protested against the policy of
                    the war, and on that ground became a bitter opponent of Pericles. But his views
                    must afterwards have changed, since we find him repeatedly urging active warlike
                    measures in opposition to the peace party of which Nicias and others were the
                    representatives. He was at the height of his political influence when in 427 <hi

                    siege, submitted to the Athenian forces, and the question of their punishment
                    was discussed in a public assembly. Cleon proposed and carried, though against
                    strong opposition, the terrible decree that all the males who were able to bear
                    arms (Grote estimates them at as many as 6000) should be put to death, and the
                    women and cldldren sold for slaves. However, in a second assembly held next day,
                    the decree was rescinded in spite of Cleon’s remonstrances. A vessel hastily
                    despatched was barely in time to stay its execution. Even as it was, a thousand
                    of those who were considered the ringleaders of the revolt were put to death.
                    But it was perhaps fortunate for Cleon’s future influence with the Athenian
                    commons that he had not to bear the odium of a cruelty which they might have
                    bitterly repented. He was hated at all times by the aristocracy of Athens, and
                    on one occasion they succeeded in convicting him of something like extortion of
                    money from certain of the islanders who were subject to the Athenian rule. In
                    425, the seventh year of the war, he achieved his greatest military and
                    political triumph. The Athenians had succeeded in cutting off from their ships
                    and supplies a strong detachment of Lacedaemonian infantry, and blockading them
                    in the small island of Sphacteria, off Pylos (the modern Navarino). At first it
                    seemed that they must speedily surrender; Cleon persuaded the Athenians to
                    dictate, as the price of their release, hard conditions of peace, which the
                    Lacedaemonians rejected. Time wore on, and the Lacedaemonians still held out,
                    while the blockade was maintained with great difficulty and hardship. Then Cleon
                    came forward, and publicly declared that if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> were
                    general, he would undertake to bring the men who were on the island prisoners to
                    Athens, dead or alive, within twenty days. Nicias, who at that time held the
                    command-in-chief, anxious probably to discredit a political opponent, offered to
                    take him at his word, and make over to him the command at Pylos. Cleon’s own
                    party were loud in their encouragements; and willingly or unwillingly, after
                    obtaining a strong reinforcement of troops, and getting Demosthenes, an able
                    general then employed on the station, joined with him in the command, he set out
                    for the scene of operations. The historian Thucydides calls his boast “insane,”
                    but admits that he fulfilled it. Within the days named he landed on the island
                    of Sphacteria, compelled the Lacedaemonian force there, after great loss, to
                    surrender at discretion, and brought 300 prisoners to Athens. It is very
                    probable that much of the credit was due to the skilful dispositions of
                    Demosthenes, his colleague in command of the forces; but nevertheless, the man
                    who dared and succeeded where others had so long failed must have had a
                    well-grounded confidence in his own energy and resources. He did not long enjoy
                    his new glories. Two years afterwards he was sent to act against Brasidas, the
                    Lacedaemonian commander in Thrace, and to attempt the reconquest of Amphipolis.
                    At first he was successful; he took Torone, and made an advance upon Amphipolis;
                    but a sudden sally of Brasidas from the town utterly routed the Athenian forces,
                    and Cleon fell there with half his men. Brasidas was at the same time mortally
                    wounded.</p>
                <p>We have to judge of the character and conduct of Cleon almost entirely from the
                    history of Thucydides and the satiric comedies of Aristophanes. But the
                    historian, even if his judgment were not warped by the fact asserted by some
                    writers, that Cleon had been instrumental in procuring his disgrace and
                    banishment whilst holding a military command, had at any rate strong
                    oligarchical prejudices, and regarded him as a restless and dangerous agitator.
                    If we might trust the picture given of him by Aristophanes <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0839-0826"/> in his comedy of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Knights,</hi> he is the unscrupulous and shifty demagogue, always by lies and
                    cajolery pandering to the worst passions of his master, the populace, filching
                    from other men their glory, and resisting all the efforts of the peace party for
                    his own selfish ends. But, besides the general mark which all public characters
                    presented to the licence of the satirist, he had in this case his own private
                    grudge against Cleon, who had laid a complaint before the Athenian senate that
                    in his comedy called <hi rend="italic">The Babylonians</hi> he had held up to
                    ridicule the policy and institutions of his country before the eyes of
                    foreigners, and this in the midst of a great national war. With all his real
                    faults, it is likely that Cleon has had less than justice done to him in such
                    portraits of him as have come down to us. (w.L,c.)</p>
