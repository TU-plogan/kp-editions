                <p><label type="entry">CHINA</label></p>
                <p>THE account of this great empire of Eastern Asia may fitly commence with a brief
                    notice, l<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, of China as known to the ancients (the land
                    of <hi rend="italic">Since</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Seres),</hi> and, 2<hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>, of China as known to mediaeval Europe <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cathay).</hi><hi rend="italic">China as known to the Ancients.</hi></p>
                <p>The spacious seat of ancient civilization which we call China has loomed always
                    so large to Western eyes, and has, in spite of the distance, subtended so large
                    an angle of vision, that, at eras far apart, we find it to have been
                    distinguished by different appellations, according as it was reached by the
                    southern sea-route, or by the northern landroute traversing the longitude of
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>In the former aspect the name has nearly always been some form of the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Sin, Chin, Since, China.</hi> In the latter point of view the
                    region in question was known to the ancients as the land of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Seres,</hi> to the Middle Ages as the empire of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cathay.</hi></p>
                <p>The name of <hi rend="italic">Chin</hi> has been supposed (doubtfully) to be
                    derived from the dynasty of <hi rend="italic">Thsin,</hi> which a little more
                    than two centuries before our era enjoyed a brief but very vigorous existence,
                    uniting all the Chinese provinces under its authority, and extending its
                    conquests far beyond those limits to the south and the west.</p>
                <p>The mention of the <hi rend="italic">Chinas</hi> in ancient Sanskrit literature,
                    both in the laws of Manu and in the Mahâbhârat, has often been supposed to prove
                    the application of the name long before the predominance of the Thsin dynasty.
                    But the coupling of that name with the <hi rend="italic">Daradas,</hi> still
                    surviving as the people of Dardistan, on the Indus, suggests it as more probable
                    that those <hi rend="italic">Chinas</hi> were a kindred race of mountaineers,
                    whose name as <hi rend="italic">Shinas</hi> in fact likewise remains applied to
                    a branch of the Dard races. Whether the <hi rend="italic">Sinim</hi> of the
                    prophet Isaiah should be interpreted of the Chinese is probably not at present
                    susceptible of any decision; by the context it appears certainly to indicate a
                    people of the extreme east or south.</p>
                <p>The name probably came to Europe through the Arabs, who made the <hi
                    rend="italic">China</hi> of the further east into <hi rend="italic">Sin,</hi>
                    and perhaps sometimes into <hi rend="italic">Thin.</hi> Hence the <hi
                    rend="italic">Thin</hi> of the author of the <hi rend="italic">Periplus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of the Erythraean Sea,</hi> who appears to be the first extant
                    writer to employ the name in this form (i.e., assuming Müller’s view that he
                    belongs to the 1st century); hence also the <hi rend="italic">Since</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Thince</hi> of Claudius Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>It has often indeed been denied that the Sinae of Ptolemy really represented the
                    Chinese. But if we compare the statement of Marcianus of Heraclea (a mere
                    condenser of Ptolemy), when he tells us that the “nations of the Sinae lie at
                    the extremity of the habitable world, and adjoin the eastern Terra Incognita,”
                    with that of Cosmas, who says, in speaking of <hi rend="italic">Tzinista,</hi> a
                    name of which no one can question the application to China, that “beyond this
                    there is neither habitation nor navigation,”—we cannot doubt the same region to
                    be meant by both. The fundamental<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n640/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0640-0627"/> error of Ptolemy’s conception of the Indian Sea
                    as a closed basin rendered it <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> but that he
                    should misplace the Chinese coast. But considering that the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sin</hi> has come down among the Arabs from time immemorial as
                    applied to the Chinese, considering that in the work of Ptolemy this name
                    certainly represented the furthest known East, and considering how inaccurate
                    are Ptolemy’s configurations and longitudes much nearer home, it seems almost as
                    reasonable to deny the identity of his India with ours as to deny that his Sinae
                    were Chinese.</p>
                <p>If we now turn to the <hi rend="italic">Seres</hi> we find this name mentioned by
                    classic authors much more frequently and at an earlier date, for the passages of
                    Eratosthenes (in Strabo), formerly supposed to speak of a parallel passing
                    through <hi rend="italic">Thinoe</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >διά</hi> Θιrωv, are now known to read correctly διΑΛ/νών. The name <hi
                    rend="italic">Seres</hi> indeed is familiar to the Latin poets of the Augustan
                    age, but always in a vague way, and usually with a general reference to Central
                    Asia and the further East. We find, however, that the first endeavours to assign
                    more accurately the position of this people, which are those of Mela and Pliny,
                    gravitate distinctly towards China in its northern aspect as the true idea
                    involved. Thus Mela describes the remotest east of Asia as occupied by the three
                    races (proceeding from south to north), Indians, Seres, and Scyths; just as in a
                    general way we might say still that Eastern Asia is occupied by the Indies,
                    China, and Tartary.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy first uses the names of <hi rend="italic">Sera</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Serιce,</hi> the former for the chief city, the latter for the country of the
                    Seres, and as usual defines their position with a precision far beyond what his
                    knowledge justified,—the necessary result of his system. Yet even his definition
                    of Serice is most consistent with the view that this name indicated the Chinese
                    empire in its northern aspect, for he carries it eastward to the 180th degree of
                    longitude, which is also, according to his calculation, in a lower latitude the
                    eastern boundary of the Sinae.</p>
                <p>Ammianus Marcellinus devotes some paragraphs to a description of the Seres and
                    their country, one passage of which is startling at first sight in its seeming
                    allusion to the Great Wall, and in this sense it has been rashly interpreted by
                    Lassen and by Reinaud. But Ammianus is merely converting Ptolemy’s dry tables
                    into fine writing, and speaks only of an encircling rampart of mountains within
                    which the spacious and happy valley of the Seres lies. It is true that Ptolemy
                    makes h;s Serice extend westward to Imaus, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to
                    Pamir. But the Chinese empire <hi rend="italic">did</hi> so extend at that
                    epoch, as it did twenty years ago, and we find Lieut. John Wood in 1838 speaking
                    of <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">China”</hi> as lying immediately
                    beyond Pamir, just as the Arabs of the 8th century spoke of the country beyond
                    the Jaxartes as “<hi rend="italic">Sin,”</hi> and as Ptolemy spoke of “<hi
                    rend="italic">Series</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi> as immediately beyond
                    Imaus.</p>
                <p>If we fuse into one the ancient notices of the Seres and their country, omitting
                    anomalous statements and manifest fables, the result will be something like the
                    following :— “The region of the Seres is a vast and populous country, touching
                    on the east the Ocean and the limits of the habitable world, and extending west
                    to Imaus and the confines of Bactria. The people are civilized, mild, just, and
                    frugal, eschewing collisions with their neighbours, and even shy of close
                    intercourse, but not averse to dispose of their own products, of which raw silk
                    is the staple, but which include also silk-stuffs, fine furs, and iron of
                    remarkable quality.” That is manifestly a definition of the Chinese.</p>
                <p>That Greek and Roman knowledge of the true position of so remote a nation should
                    at best have been somewhat hazy is nothing wonderful. And it is worthy of note
                    that the view entertained by the ancient Chinese of the Roman empire and its
                    inhabitants, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Τadhsin</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> t</hi> had some striking points of analogy to those views of the
                    Chinese which are indicated in the classical descriptions of the Seres. There
                    can be no mistaking the fact that in this case also the great object was within
                    the horizon of vision, yet the details ascribed to it are often far from being
                    true characteristics, being only the accidents of its outer borders.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">China as known to Mediaeval Europe.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cathay</hi> is the name by which the Chinese empire was known to mediaeva]
                    Europe, and is in its original form <hi rend="italic">{Kitai)</hi> that by which
                    China is still known in Russia, and to most of the nations of Central Asia. West
                    of Russia the name has long ceased to be a geographical expression, but it is
                    associated with a remarkable phase in the history of geography and commerce, of
                    which we purpose under this head to give some account.</p>
                <p>The name first became known to Europe in the 13th century, when the vast
                    conquests of Jenghiz and his house drew a new and vivid attention to Asia. For
                    some three centuries previously the northern provinces of China had been
                    detached from indigenous rule, and subject to northern conquerors. The first of
                    these foreign dynasties was of a race called <hi rend="italic">Khitán,</hi>
                    issuing from the basin of the Sungari River, and supposed (but doubtfully) to
                    have been of the blood of the modern Tunguses. The rule of this race endured for
                    two centuries, and originated the application of the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khitat</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Khitdi</hi> to Northern China. The dynasty
                    itself, known in Chinese history as <hi rend="italic">Liao,</hi> or “Iron,”
                    disappeared from China 1123, but the name remained attached to the territory
                    which they had ruled.</p>
                <p>The Khitán were displaced by the <hi rend="italic">Nyûchá</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Chdrclιe</hi> race, akin to the modern Manchus who now rule China.
                    These reigned, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Kin,</hi> or “Golden,” till
                    Jenghiz and his Mongols invaded them in turn. In 1234 the conquest of the Kin
                    empire was completed, and the dynasty extinguished under Okkodai, the son and
                    successor of Jenghiz Khán. Forty years later, in the reign of Kublaï, grandson
                    and ablest successor of Jenghiz, the Mongol rule was extended over Southern
                    China (1276), which till then had remained under a native dynasty, the Sung,
                    holding its royal residence in a vast and splendid city, now known as Hang-chow,
                    but then as Ling-ngan, or more commonly as <hi rend="italic">Kingsze, i.e.,</hi>
                    the Court. The southern empire was usually called by the conquerors <hi
                    rend="italic">Mantzi</hi> (or as some of the old travellers write, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mangï),</hi> a name which Western Asiatics seem to have identified
                    with <hi rend="italic">Mðxhvn</hi> (from the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mahaxhin),</hi> one of the names by which China was known to the traders from
                    Persian and Arabian ports.</p>
                <p>The conquests of Jenghiz and his successors had spread not only over China and
                    the adjoining East, but westward also over all Northern Asia, Persia, Armenia,
                    part of Asia Minor, and Russia, threatening to deluge Christendom. Though the
                    Mongol wave retired, as it seemed almost by an immediate act of Providence, when
                    Europe lay at its feet, it had levelled or covered all political barriers from
                    the frontier of Poland to the Yellow Sea, and when Western Europe recovered from
                    its alarm, Asia lay open, as never before or since, to the inspection of
                    Christendom. Princes, envoys, priests,—half-missionary half-envoy—visited the
                    court of the great Khán in Mongolia; and besides these, the accidents of war,
                    commerce, or opportunity carried a variety of persons from various classes of
                    human life into the depths of Asia. “ ’Tis worthy of the grateful remembrance of
                    all Christian people,” says an able missionary friar of the next age (Ricold of
                    Monte Croce), “that just at the time when God sent forth into the Eastern parts
                    of the world the Tartars to slay and to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n641/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0641-0628"/> be slain, He also sent into the West his faithful
                    and blessed servants, Dominie and Francis, to enlighten, instruct, and build up
                    in the faith.” Whatever on the whole may be thought of the world’s debt to
                    Dominic, it is to the two mendicant orders, but especially to the Franciscans,
                    that we owe a vast amount of information about mediaeval Asia, and, among other
                    things, the first mention of <hi rend="italic">Cathay.</hi> Among the many
                    strangers who reached Mongolia were (1245-47) John de Plano Carpini (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carpini)</hi> and (1253) William of Rubruk (Rubruquis) in
                    French Flanders, both Franciscan friars of high intelligence, who happily have
                    left behind them reports of their observations.</p>
                <p>Carpini, after mentioning the wars of Jenghiz against the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kitai, goes</hi> on to speak of that people as follows :— “Now these <hi
                    rend="italic">Kitai</hi> are heathen men, and have a written character of their
                    own. . . . They seem, indeed, to be kindly and polished folks enough. They have
                    no beard, and in character of countenance have a considerable resemblance to the
                    Mongols” [are <hi rend="italic">Mongoloid,</hi> as our ethnologists would say],
                    “but are not so broad in the face. They have a peculiar language. Their betters
                    as craftsmen in every art practised by man are not to be found in the whole
                    world. Their country is very rich in com, in wine, in gold and silver, in silk,
                    and in every kind of produce tending to the support of mankind.” The notice of
                    Rubruk, shrewder and more graphic, runs thus :—“Further on is Great Cathay,
                    which I take to be the country which was anciently called the Land of the Seres.
                    For the best silk stuffs are still got from them. . . . The sea lies between it
                    and India. Those Cathayans are little fellows, speaking much through the nose,
                    and, as is general with all those Eastern people, their eyes are very narrow.
                    They are first-rate artists in every kind, and their physicians have a thorough
                    knowledge of the virtues of herbs, and an admirable skill in diagnosis by the
                    pulse. . . . The common money of Cathay consists of pieces of cotton-paper,
                    about a palm in length and breadth, upon which certain lines are printed,
                    resembling the seal of Mangu Khán. They do their writing with a pencil, such as
                    painters paint with, and a single character of theirs comprehends several
                    letters, so as to form a whole word.” Here we have not only what is probably the
                    first European notice of papermoney, but a <hi rend="italic">partial</hi>
                    recognition of the peculiarity of Chinese writing, and a perception that puts to
                    shame the perverse boggling of later critics over the identity of these
                    Cathayans with the Seres of classic fame.</p>
                <p>But though these travellers saw Cathayans in the bazaars of the Great Khan’s
                    camps, the first actual visitors of Cathay itself were the Polo family (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Polo, Marco),</hi> and it is to the book of Marco’s
                    recollections mainly that Cathay owed the growing familiarity of its name in
                    Europe during the 14th and 15 th centuries. It is, however, a great mistake to
                    suppose, as has often been assumed, that the residence of the Polos in that
                    country remained an isolated fact. They were but the pioneers of a very
                    considerable intercourse, which endured till the decay of the Mongol dynasty in
                    Cathay, τ.e., for about half a century.</p>
                <p>We have no evidence that either in the 13th or 14th century Cathayans, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Chinese, ever reached Europe, but it is possible that
                    some did, at least, in the former century. For, during the campaigns of Hulaku
                    in Persia (1256-1265), and the reigns of his successors, Chinese engineers were
                    employed on the banks of the Tigris, and Chinese astrologers and physicians
                    could be consulted at Tabriz. Many diplomatic communications passed between the
                    Hulakuid Ilkhans and the princes of Christendom. The former, as the great Khan’s
                    liegemen, still received from him their seals of state; and two of their letters
                    which survive in the archives of France exhibit the vermilion impressions of
                    those seals in Chinese characters,—perhaps affording the earliest specimen of
                    that character which reached Western Europe.</p>
                <p>Just as the Polos were reaching their native city (1295), after an absence of
                    quarter of a century, the forerunner of a new series of travellers was entering
                    Southern China by way of the Indian seas. This was John of Monte Corvino,
                    another Franciscan who, already some fifty years of age, was plunging
                    single-handed into that great ocean of Paganism to preach the gospel according
                    to his lights. After years of uphill and solitary toil converts began to
                    multiply; coadjutors joined him. The Papal See became cognizant of the harvest
                    that was being reaped in the far East. It made Friar John Archbishop in Cambaluc
                    (or Peking), with patriarchal authority, and sent him batches of suffragan
                    bishops and preachers of his own order. The Roman Church spread; churches and
                    Minorite houses were established at Cambaluc, at Zayton or Tswan-chow in
                    Fuh-keen, at Yang-chow, and elsewhere; and the missions flourished under the
                    smile of the Great Khan, as the Jesuit missions did for a time under the Manchu
                    emperors three centuries and a half later. Archbishop John was followed to the
                    grave, about 1328, by mourning multitudes of Pagans and Christians alike.
                    Several of the bishops and friars who served under him have left letters or
                    other memoranda of their experience, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Andrew, bishop
                    of Zayton, John of Cora, afterwards archbishop of Sultania in Persia, and Odoric
                    of Pordenone, whose fame as a pious traveller won from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vox</hi><hi rend="italic">populi</hi> at his funeral a beatification which the
                    church was fain to seal. The only ecclesiastical narrative regarding Cathay, of
                    which we are aware, subsequent to the time of Archbishop John, is that which has
                    been gathered from the recollections of John de’ Marignolli, a Florentine
                    Franciscan, who was sent by Pope Benedict XII. with a mission to the Great Khan,
                    in return for one from that potentate which arrived at Avignon from Cathay in
                    1338, and who spent four years (1342-46) at the court of Cambaluc as legate of
                    the Holy See. These recollections are found in a singular position, dispersed
                    incoherently over a chronicle of Bohemia which the traveller wrote by order of
                    the emperor Charles IV., whose chaplain he was after his return.</p>
                <p>But intercourse during the period in question was not confined to ecclesiastical
                    channels. Commerce also grew up, and flourished for a time even along the vast
                    line that stretches from Genoa and Florence to the marts of Chĕ-keang and
                    ¢uh-keen. The record is very fragmentary and imperfect, but many circumstances
                    and incidental notices show how frequently the remote East was reached by
                    European traders in the first half of the 14th century,— a state of things which
                    it is very difficult to realize when we see how all those regions, when reopened
                    to knowledge two centuries later, seemed to be discoveries as new as the empires
                    which, about the same time, Cortes and Pizarro were conquering in the West.</p>
                <p>This commercial intercourse probably commenced about 1310-1320. Monte Corvino,
                    writing in 1305, says it was twelve years since he had heard any news from
                    Europe; the only Western stranger who had arrived in all that time being a
                    certain Lombard chirurgeon (probably one of the <hi rend="italic">Patarini</hi>
                    who got hard measure at home in those days), who had spread the most incredible
                    blasphemies about the Roman Curia and the order of St Francis. Yet even on his
                    first entrance to Cathay Friar John had been accom panied by one Master Peter of
                    Lucolongo, whom he describes as a faithful Christian man and a great merchant,
                    and who seems to have remained many years at Peking. The letter of Andrew,
                    bishop of Zayton (1326), quotes the opinion of Genoese merchants at that port
                    regarding a question of exchanges. Odoric, who was in Cathay about 1323-1327,
                    refers for confirmation of the wonders which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n642/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0642-0629"/> he related of the great city of Cansay (z.e.,
                    King-sze, <hi rend="italic">hod.</hi> Hang-chow), to the many persons whom he
                    had met at Venice since his return, who had themselves been witnesses of those
                    marvels. And John Marignolli, some twenty years later, found attached to one of
                    the convents at Zayton, in Fuh-keen, a <hi rend="italic">fondaco</hi> or factory
                    for the accommodation of the Christian merchants.</p>
                <p>But by far the most distinct and notable evidence of the importance and frequency
                    of European trade with Cathay, of which silk and silk goods formed the staple,
                    is to be found in the commercial hand-book <hi rend="italic">(circa</hi> 1340)
                    of Francesco Balducci Pegolotti, a clerk and factor of the great Florentine
                    house of the Bardi, which was brought to the ground about that time by its
                    dealings with Edward III. of England. This book, called by its author <hi
                    rend="italic">Libro</hi><hi rend="italic">di diυisamenti di Paesi,</hi> is a
                    sort of trade-guide, devoting successive chapters to the various ports and
                    markets of his time, detailing the nature of imports and exports at each, the
                    duties and exactions, the local customs of business, weights, measures, and
                    money. The first two chapters of this work contain instructions for the merchant
                    proceeding to Cathay; and it is evident, from the terms used, that the road
                    thither was not unfrequently travelled by European merchants, from whom
                    Pegolotti had derived his information. The route which he describes lay by
                    Azoff, Astrakhan, Khiva, Otrar (on the Jaxartes), Almálik (Gulja in Hi),
                    Kan∙chow (in Kansuh), and so to Hang-chow and Peking. Particulars are given as
                    to the silver ingots which formed the currency of Tartary, and the paper-money
                    of Cathay. That the ventures on this trade were not insignificant is plain from
                    the example taken by the author to illustrate the question of expenses on the
                    journey, which is that of a merchant investing in goods there to the amount of
                    some &lt;£12,000 (⅛.e., in actual gold value, not as calculated by any fanciful
                    and fallacious equation of values).</p>
                <p>Of the same remarkable phase of history that we are here considering we have also
                    a number of notices by Mahometan writers. The establishment of the Mongol
                    dynasty in Persia, by which the Great Khan was acknowledged as lord paramount,
                    led (as we have already noticed in part) to a good deal of intercourse. And some
                    of the Persian historians, writing at Tabriz, under the patronage of the Mongol
                    princes, have told us much about Cathay, especially Rashiduddin, the great
                    minister and historian of the dynasty (died 1318). We have also in the book of
                    the Moorish traveller Ibn Batuta, who visited China about 1347-48, very mιny
                    curious and in great part true notices, though it is not possible to give
                    credence to the whole of this episode in his extensive travels.</p>
                <p>About the time of the traveller first named the throne of the degenerate
                    descendants of Jenghiz began to totter to its fall, and we have no knowledge of
                    any Frank visitor to Cathay in that age later than Marignolli; missions and
                    merchants alike disappear from the field. We hear, indeed, once and again of
                    ecclesiastics despatched from Avignon, but they go forth into the darkness, and
                    are heard of no more. Islam, with all its jealousy and exclusiveness, had
                    recovered its grasp over Central Asia; the Nestorian Christianity which once had
                    prevailed so widely was vanishing, and the new rulers of China reverted to the
                    old national policy, and held the foreigner at arm’s length. Night descended
                    upon the further East, covering Cathay with those cities of which the old
                    travellers had told such marvels, Cambaluc and Cansay, Zayton and Chinkalan. And
                    when the veil rose before the Portuguese and Spanish explorers of the 16th
                    century, those names are heard no more. In their stead we have <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">China,</hi><hi rend="italic">Peking, Hangchow, Chincheo,
                    Canton.</hi> Not only were the old names forgotten, but the fact that those
                    places had ever been known before was forgotten also. Gradually new missionaries
                    went forth from Rome—Jesuits and Dominicans now; new converts were made, and new
                    vicariats constituted; but the old Franciscan churches, and the Nestorianism
                    with which they had battled, had alike been swallowed up in the ocean of Pagan
                    indifference. In time a wreck or two floated to the surface,—-a MS. Latin Bible
                    or a piece of Catholic sculpture; and when the intelligent missionaries called
                    Marco Polo to mind, and studied his story, one and another became convinced that
                    Cathay and China were one.</p>
                <p>But for a long time all but a sagacious few continued to regard Cathay as a
                    region distinct from any of the new-found Indies; whilst mapmakers, well on into
                    the 17th century, continued to represent it as a great country lying entirely to
                    the north of China, and stretching to the Arctic Sea.</p>
                <p>It was Cathay, with its outlying island of Zipangu (Japan), that Columbus sought
                    to reach by sailing westward, penetrated as he was by his intense conviction of
                    the smallness of the earth, and of the vast extension of Asia eastward; and to
                    the day of his death he was full of the imagination of the proximity of the
                    domain of the Great Khan to the islands and coasts which he had discovered. And
                    such imaginations are curiously embodied in some of the maps of the early 16th
                    century, which intermingle on the same coast-line the new discoveries from
                    Labrador to Brazil with the provinces and rivers of Marco Polo’s Cathay.</p>
                <p>Cathay had been the aim of the first voyage of the Cabots in 1496, and it
                    continued to be the object of many adventurous voyages by English and Hollanders
                    to the N.W. and N.E. till far on in the 16th century. At least one memorable
                    land-journey also was made by Englishmen, of which the exploration of a
                    trade-route to Cathay was a chief object,—that in which Anthony Jenkinson and
                    the two Johnsons reached Bokhara by way of Russia in 1558- 1559. The country of
                    which they collected notices at that city was still known to them only as <hi
                    rend="italic">Cathay,</hi> and its great capital only as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carnbaluc.</hi></p>
                <p>Cathay as a supposed separate entity may be considered to come to an end with the
                    journey of Benedict Goes, the lay-Jesuit. This admirable person was, in 1603,
                    despatched through Central Asia by his superiors in India with the specific
                    object of determining whether the Cathay of old European writers, and of modern
                    Mahometans, was or was not a distinct region from that China of which parallel
                    marvels had now for some time been recounted. Benedict, as one of his brethern
                    pronounced his epitaph, “seeking Cathay found Heaven.” He died at Suhchow, the
                    frontier city of China, but not before he had ascertained that China and Cathay
                    were the same. After the publication of the narrative of his journey (in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Expeditio</hi><hi rend="italic">Christiania</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >apud Sinas</hi> of Trigault, 1615) inexcusable ignorance alone could continue
                    to distinguish between them, and though such ignorance lingered many years
                    longer, the result of his exploration fitly brings this prefatory notice to a
                    close. (H. Y. )</p>

                <p>The area of China Proper is not more than half that of the whole empire; it
                    extends as far north only as 41° lat., and as far west as 98° long. It is about
                    1474 miles in length, and its breadth is about 1355 miles. Its coast line
                    measures about 2500 miles; its land frontier is described as being 4400 miles in
                    length, and its area is said to contain 1,399,609 square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> One of the most
                    noticeable features in the surface of China is the immense delta plain in the
                    northeastern portion of the empire, which, curving round the mountainous
                    districts of <hi rend="italic">Shan-tung,</hi> extends for about 700 miles in a
                    southerly direction from the neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic">Peking,</hi> and
                    varies from 150 to 500 miles in breadth. Commencing in the prefecture of <hi
                    rend="italic">Yung-ping Foo,</hi> in the province of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ckih-U,</hi> its outer limit passes in a westerly direction as far as <hi
                    rend="italic">Ckang-ping Chow,</hi> north-west of <hi rend="italic">Peking.</hi>
                    Thence running a south-south-westerly course it passes westward of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ching-ting Fοο</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kwang-ping Foo</hi> till
                    it reaches the upper waters of the <hi rend="italic">JFei River</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Ho-nan.</hi> From this point it turns westward and crosses the <hi
                    rend="italic">Uwang-ho,</hi> or Yellow River, in the prefecture of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hwαi-king.</hi> Leaving this river it takes a course a little to
                    the east of south, and passing west of <hi rend="italic">Joo-ning Foo,</hi> in
                    the province of <hi rend="italic">lío-nan,</hi> it turns in a more easterly
                    direction as far as <hi rend="italic">Leuchow Foo.</hi> From this prefecture an
                    arm of the plain, in which lies the <hi rend="italic">Tsaοu Lake,</hi> stretches
                    southward from the <hi rend="italic">Hwαi River</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yang-tsze Keang,</hi> and trending eastward occupies the region between the
                    river and <hi rend="italic">Hang-chow Bay.</hi> To the north of this arm rises a
                    hilly district, in the centre of which stands <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nanking.</hi></p>
                <p>The boundary of the plain round the mountainous region of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shan-tung</hi> begins at <hi rend="italic">Lai-chow Foo,</hi> and describes a
                    huge bow to the west and south, reaching westward to the prefecture of <hi
                    rend="italic">Tse-nan,</hi> and southward to the frontier of the province of <hi
                    rend="italic">Keang-sοο,</hi> which boundary it follows to the sea. The greater
                    part of this vast plain descends very gently towards the sea, and is generally
                    below the level of the Yellow River,—hence the disastrous inundations which so
                    often accompany the rise of the <hi rend="italic">Hwang-ho.</hi> It is the delta
                    of the Yellow River, and also to some extent of the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze
                    Keang,</hi> and it is chiefly remarkable for its semiannular shape, within which
                    it encloses the mountain districts of the province of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Slιan-tung.</hi> Owing to the great quantity of soil which is brought down by
                    the waters of the Yellow River, and to the absence of oceanic currents, this
                    delta is rapidly increasing and the adjoining seas are as rapidly becoming
                    shallower. As an instance, it is said that the town of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pootai</hi> was 1 le west of the sea-shore, in the year 220 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and in 1730 it was 140 le inland, thus giving a
                    yearly encroachment on the sea of about 100 feet. Again, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seen-shwuy Kow</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">Peïho</hi> was on the sea-shore in
                    500 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and it is now about 18 miles inland.</p>
                <p>The rest of the empire may be described as being either mountainous or hilly.
                    Several ranges of high mountains, in connection with the mountain system of
                    Central Asia, enter the western provinces of the empire, and after traversing
                    the western and southern provinces in various directions dwindle down to low
                    hills as they approach the sea-coast. In the eastern portion of Tibet the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kwan-lun</hi> range throws off a number of branches, which spread
                    first of all in a south-easterly direction, and eventually take a north and
                    south course, partly in the provinces of <hi rend="italic">Sze-chuen</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Yun-nan,</hi> where they divide the beds of the rivers which
                    flow into Siam and Cochin-China, as well as the principal northern tributaries
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang.</hi> Another range, known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tung-nan,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Foo-new Shan,</hi> which
                    appears to be the eastern termination of the great <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kwan-lun</hi> range of Central Asia, and which is said to have several
                    snow-clad peaks, enters China in the soutem portion of the province vf <hi
                    rend="italic">Kan-suh,</hi> and stretches in an easterly direction across the
                    province of <hi rend="italic">Sken-se</hi> into that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Uo-nan,</hi> where it finally disappears. This range separates the waters which
                    enter the <hi rend="italic">Hwαng-ho,</hi> or Yellow River, through the <hi
                    rend="italic">ĬFei</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Lo</hi> from those which flow
                    into the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tzse Keang,</hi> through the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kia-ling</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Han.</hi> Forming the northern frontier
                    of the province of <hi rend="italic">Sze-chuen</hi> runs the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kew-lung</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Po-mung</hi> range, which entering China in
                    102° long, takes a general course of east as far as 112° long., at about which
                    point it is lost sight of in the province of <hi rend="italic">Hoo-pih.</hi> In
                    the south the <hi rend="italic">Nan-shan</hi> ranges, some peaks of which are
                    said to reach above the snow-level, take their rise in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yun-nan,</hi> and after spreading in a series of ranges over the south and east
                    portions of <hi rend="italic">Kwang-se</hi> trend in an easterly direction,
                    covering the entire province of <hi rend="italic">Kwang-tung.</hi> Then turning
                    north-eastward, they occupy the whole area of the provinces of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fuh-keen, Keang-se, Che-keαng, Hooman,</hi> and southern <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gαn-hwug,</hi> until they reach the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> which river, from the <hi rend="italic">Tung-ting Lake</hi>
                    to <hi rend="italic">Chin-keang Foo,</hi> forms their northern boundary. It is
                    reckoned that this mountain region occupies an area of about 300,000 square
                    miles. Besides these more important ranges there are the <hi rend="italic">Lung
                    Mountains</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Kan-suh,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Τα</hi><hi rend="italic">-hang Mountains</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shan-se,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Tae Mountains</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shan-tung,</hi> and many others, among which may be mentioned the ranges which
                    form the northern frontier of <hi rend="italic">Chih-li.</hi> It will thus be
                    seen that there is a general subsidence from the mountain districts in the
                    western portions of the empire to the central and south-eastern provinces, where
                    the mountains dwindle down to hills, and where the snowy peaks and rugged sides
                    of the ranges in <hi rend="italic">Ywn-nan</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sze-chuen</hi> are exchanged for tho wooded tops and carefully-cultivated
                    terraces of the littoral provinces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The rivers of China are
                    very numerous, and, with the canals, form some of the most frequented highways
                    in the empire. The two largest are the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Hwang-ho,</hi> or Yellow River, the latter of which is
                    less known to fame for its value in a commercial sense, than by reason of the
                    vast and destructive floods which have from time to time caused it to inundate
                    the low-lying country on either side of its banks. According to Chinese
                    geographers the <hi rend="italic">Hwang-hο</hi> takes its rise in the “Sea of
                    Stars,” on the eastern side of the Bayen-kára Mountains, in the Mongolian
                    province of Kokonor, where it has gained for itself the name of <hi

                    For some miles it runs in two streams, and when united takes at first a
                    south-easterly course. Next trending in a north-easterly direction it traverses
                    the province of <hi rend="italic">Kan-suh</hi> and passes northwards through the
                    Great Wall until it reaches the rising ground in the neighbourhood of the <hi
                    rend="italic">In-shan.</hi> Thence curving to the south-east and south it
                    re-enters China through the Great Wall and continues its southerly course,
                    forming the boundary between the provinces of <hi rend="italic">Shen-se</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Shαn-se</hi> as far as <hi rend="italic">Tung-kwan.</hi> Here
                    it makes a sharp bend and runs nearly due east to <hi rend="italic">Kai-fung
                    Foo.</hi> In the neighbourhood of this city it enters on the great eastern plain
                    of China, and the alterations which have taken place in its bed between this
                    district and the sea has earned for it the well-deserved title of “the Sorrow of
                    Han.” According to the Chinese records this portion of the river has changed its
                    course nine times during the last 2500 years, and has emptied itself into the
                    sea at as many different mouths, the most northerly of which is represented as
                    having been in about 39° lat., or in the neighbourhood of the present mouth of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Peihο,</hi> and the most southerly being that which
                    existed before the last change in 1851-53, in 34° lat. The breaches that were
                    made in the northern bank of the river east of <hi rend="italic">Kaifung
                    Foo</hi> during the floods of 1851, 1852, and 1853 caused its waters gradually
                    to overflow the low-lvin&lt;r conntrv to the northwards: and these, after

                    struck the bed of the <hi rend="italic">Ta-tsing River,</hi> and having forced
                    their way into that narrow, clean cut channel, followed it to the sea. The
                    result of this change has been that the old course of the river is dry, and that
                    the muddy dun-coloured waters—hence the name <hi rend="italic">Hwang-ho,</hi> or
                    Yellow River—after permanently flooding a large tract of country, are now
                    leading up to another grand catastrophe by destroying the banks of the new
                    channel which they have found for themselves. Already the increased volume of
                    water has added another obstruction to those before existing to the navigation
                    of the river by destroying a large stone bridge of seven arches at <hi
                    rend="italic">Tse-hoheen,</hi> a town situated 210 miles from the mouth, the
                    ruins of which have seriously impeded the course of the stream. But the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hwang-ko</hi> is of little value for navigating purposes. At its
                    mouth lies a bar having at its deepest part about from 7 to 9 feet of water
                    only; further up, about 3 miles below <hi rend="italic">Tse-hoheen,</hi> there
                    is a shoal extending right across its bed, at the deepest point of which there
                    is about 11 feet of water, while in the passage at the extremity of the sunken
                    bridge at <hi rend="italic">Tse-hoheen</hi> there is a depth of only about 5
                    feet.</p>
                <p>A far more valuable river in every way is the <hi rend="italic">Yaηg-tsze
                    Keang,</hi> which takes its rise in the Min Mountains of Tibet, and after a
                    course of 2900 miles empties itself into the Yellow Sea in about 31° lat. Tn
                    common with most of the large rivers of China, the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze
                    Keang</hi> is known by various names in different parts of its course. From its
                    source in Tibet to <hi rend="italic">Seu-chow Foo</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sze-chuen,</hi> it bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Kin-ska Keang,</hi> or
                    River of the Golden Sands. From <hi rend="italic">Seu-chow Foo</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">Yang-dhow Foo</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Keang-soo,</hi> its volume
                    has gained for it the title of <hi rend="italic">Ta Keang,</hi> or the Great
                    River; and from the ancient name of the district through which it thence passes,
                    it is known for the remainder of its course as the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tze
                    Keang,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Yangtze River.</hi> Chinese geographers
                    state that it has two sources, the more northerly of which gives birth to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Kangchuh ah-lin</hi> at a point about 1600 le to the southeast
                    of the source of the Yellow River; and to the more southerly one of the two the
                    <hi rend="italic">Na-ko-to-moo-tsing ah-lin,</hi> which rises on the south of
                    the range, owes its existence. Both these streams twist and turn eastward for
                    upwards of 200 le, when they unite and form one stream, which flows in an
                    easterly and afterwards southerly course until it enters the Chinese province of
                    <hi rend="italic">Yun-nan</hi> at the <hi rend="italic">Hwang-dhing Pass,</hi>
                    or Pass of Imperial Victory. It then turns northward into the province of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sze-chuen,</hi> and thence after receiving several important
                    tributaries it takes an east-northeasterly course, until passing into <hi
                    rend="italic">Hoo-pih</hi> it dips southwards to the boundary of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hoo-nan</hi> in the neighbourhood of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tung-ting Lake,</hi> the waters of which contribute largely to swell its
                    volume. From this point it makes a curve northwards as far as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Han-kow,</hi> receiving on the way the waters of the <hi rend="italic">Han
                    River.</hi> From <hi rend="italic">Han-kow</hi> it bends its course again
                    southwards to the <hi rend="italic">Ρο</hi><hi rend="italic">-yang Lake.</hi>
                    Thence through the province of <hi rend="italic">Gan-hwuy</hi> it proceeds in a
                    north-easterly direction until it reaches <hi rend="italic">Nanking,</hi> 200
                    miles from the sea. Here the influence of the tide begins to be felt, and beyond
                    this point it gradually widens into the great estuary by which it is connected
                    with the ocean. The basin area of the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang</hi> is
                    reckoned to be about 548,000 square miles, and it is navigable for steamers as
                    far as <hi rend="italic">Ι</hi><hi rend="italic">-chang,</hi> upwards of 1200
                    miles from its mouth. Unlike the Yellow River, along the navigable portion of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang</hi> are dotted many rich and populous
                    cities, among which the chief are <hi rend="italic">Nanking, Can-king,
                    Kew-keang, Han-kow,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">I-dhang.</hi> Beyond this
                    last-named city the navigation becomes impossible for any but light native
                    craft, by reason of the rapids which occur at frequent intervals in the deep
                    mountain gorges through which the river runs beteen <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kwai-chow</hi> and <hi rend="italic">I-chang.</hi></p>
                <p>Next in importance to the Yang-tsze Keang as a water highway is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Yun-ho,</hi> or, as it is generally known in Europe, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Grand Canal.</hi> This magnificent artificial river reaches from
                    <hi rend="italic">Hang-chow Foo</hi> in the province of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chc-keang</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Tientsin</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Chih
                    li,</hi> where it unites with the <hi rend="italic">Peiho,</hi> and thus may be
                    said to extend to <hi rend="italic">Tung-chow</hi> in the neighbourhood of <hi
                    rend="italic">Peking.</hi> After leaving <hi rend="italic">Hang-chow</hi> it
                    passes round the eastern border of the <hi rend="italic">Tai-hoo,</hi> or Great
                    Lake, surrounding in its course the beautiful city of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Soo-chow,</hi> and then trends in a generally north-westerly direction through
                    the fertile districts of <hi rend="italic">Keang-soo</hi> as far as <hi
                    rend="italic">Chin keang</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang.</hi> Mr
                    Ney Elias, who in 1868 travelled along the Grand Canal from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chin-keang</hi> to the new course of the Yellow River, thus describes the
                    characteristics of this portion of its course :—</p>
                <p>The Grand. Canal between <hi rend="italic">Chin-keang</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tsín-keang-pu,</hi> or in other words, between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yang-tsze</hi> and the old bed of the Yellow River, . . . is everywhere in good
                    repair, and the adjacent country well irrigated, and apparently in a thriving
                    state, both as regards cultivation, and, to judge by the aspect of the towns on
                    and near its banks, as regards trade also. After crossing the old Yellow River,
                    however, a part of the canal somewhat less known is reached, and the flourishing
                    condition of the country is no longer noticeable; on the contrary, for a
                    distance of about 150 miles, though the canal itself is in tolerably good
                    working order, the country in its vicinity has an arid, sterile appearance, and
                    is but thinly populated. There are few towns or villages, and some there are
                    seem neither populous nor busy, though they are not in ruins, and bear but few
                    traces of the rebellion. . . . The canal, which at one time was so deep tl tat
                    at many places the level of the water was above that of the adjacent country, is
                    now everywhere considerably below it, rendering irrigation at even a short
                    distance from its banks, without mechanical appliances, almost an impossibility;
                    even the dry bed of the <hi rend="italic">Loma Lake</hi> is scarcely cultivated
                    on account of its elevation above the level of the canal, though it is only
                    separated from it in some parts by a bank of a few yards in width. It is true
                    that this lake appears never to have been more than a shallow flood lagoon,
                    nevertheless it was some feet below the general level of the country, and was
                    connected with the canal by means of water-courses and sluice gates; andif this
                    is difficult to irrigate how much more so must be the country above and beyond
                    it! This 150 miles being passed over, the <hi rend="italic">Wai Shan</hi>
                    (sometimes called <hi rend="italic">Yiì Shan)</hi> Lake is reached at a small
                    village, called <hi rend="italic">Han-chuang-cha.</hi> This is the most southern
                    of a chain of lakes or rather lagoons, which stretch from far to the south of
                    <hi rend="italic">Han-chuang-cha</hi> (I believe from near <hi rend="italic"
                    >Su-chan-fu</hi> on the old Yellow River) to within a few miles of <hi
                    rend="italic">Tse-ning-ehow,</hi> and which constitute the only important feeder
                    of the Grand Canal to the southward. In the summer they merge one into the
                    other, and form a continuous sheet of water, though very shallow in parts. In
                    winter, when the water is low, these shallow parts are mere morasses, which
                    divide the sheet into three or four separate lagoons. In former days the canal
                    ran in some places by the side of these lagoons, and in others through portions
                    of them, but being everywhere embanked on both sides, it was only dependent upon
                    them for its supply of water, the canal itself forming an unobstructed means of
                    communication through the year. Of late years, however, this section of the
                    canal has been allowed to go to ruin, and those portions only are used which run
                    through the morasses existing in the dry season, the lagoons themselves forming
                    elsewhere the only channel for navigation. Near the northern lunit of these
                    lagoons stands the city of <hi rend="italic">Tse-ning-chow,</hi> the first place
                    of any importance on the canal north of <hi rend="italic">Tsin-kiang-pu</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> it is said to be a place of considerable trade in ordinary
                    times. . . . Still proceeding northward, a distance from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tse-ning-ehow</hi> of about 25 miles, the summit level of the canal is reached
                    near a small town called A <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> αn <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wang.</hi> It is here that the River <hi rend="italic">Wen</hi> falls into the
                    canal, a portion of its waters flowing to the south, and the rest to the north,
                    precisely as described by Staunton and other writers. . . . About 30 miles
                    beyond <hi rend="italic">Nan Wang</hi> we come to the new Yellow River, the
                    canal for that distance being extremely narrow and shallow—a mere ditch in fact,
                    running between embankments large enough to confine a stream of infinitely
                    greater volume. The banks along nearly the whole of the Grand Canal between the
                    old and the new bed of the Yellow River, excepting those portions bordering on
                    or traversing the lagoons, are surrounded by earthen walls crenellated after the
                    fashion of city walls, behind which are stockades at intervals of every few
                    miles. All this work has the appearance of being recently constructed, though in
                    many places it is already being broken up by the country people to make room for
                    cultivation, for they can ill afford to lose that strip of land immediately
                    adjacent to and irrigated by the canal. The villages <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n645/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0645-0632"/> also make an attempt at fortifications, some of
                    them being surrounded by earthen or mud walls or moats; and, indeed, many
                    solitary farms have some species of defensive works round them, and in most
                    cases a small, square brick tower within. These towers are rarely met with to
                    the south of the province of <hi rend="italic">Shan-tung</hi> —they are probably
                    the “water castles” mentioned by the historian of the Dutch Embassy.</p>
                <p>On the west side of the canal, at the point where the Yellow River now cuts
                    across it, there is laid down in Chinese maps of the last century a dry channel
                    which is described as being that of the old Yellow River. Leaving this point the
                    canal passes through a well-wooded and hilly country west of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tung-ping Chow,</hi> through the city of <hi rend="italic">Chang-kew Chin</hi>
                    and to the east of <hi rend="italic">Tung-chang Foo.</hi> At <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lin-tsing-Chow</hi> it is joined at right angles by the <hi rend="italic">Wei
                    Fiver</hi> in the midst of the city, and from thence crosses the frontier into
                    <hi rend="italic">Chih-li,</hi> and passing to the west of <hi rend="italic">Tïh
                    Chow</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tsang ChoioyovoA</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peiho</hi> at <hi rend="italic">Tien-tsin,</hi> after having received the
                    waters of the <hi rend="italic">Ke-to River</hi> in the neighbourhood of <hi
                    rend="italic">Tsing Heen.</hi> At <hi rend="italic">Tien-tsin</hi> the canal
                    ends, and the <hi rend="italic">Peiho</hi> completes the communication to the
                    vicinity of <hi rend="italic">Peking.</hi></p>
                <p>Another of the large rivers of China is the <hi rend="italic">Han Keang,</hi>
                    which rises in the <hi rend="italic">Ρο</hi><hi rend="italic">-mung</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Kev)-lung</hi> mountains to the north of the city of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ning-keang Chow</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Skxn-se.</hi> Taking a
                    generally easterly course from its source as far as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fan-ching,</hi> it from that point takes a more southerly direction and empties
                    itself into the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang</hi> at <hi rend="italic"
                    >Han-kow,</hi> “the mouth of the Han.” This river has some noticeable
                    peculiarities. Not the least of these is that it is very narrow at its mouth
                    (200 feet) and grows in width as the distance from its mouth increases. Another
                    marked feature is that the summer high-water line is for a great part of its
                    course, from <hi rend="italic">E-ching Heen</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Han-kow,</hi> above the level of its banks, the result being that were it not
                    for artificial barriers the whole of the surrounding country would be under
                    water for a great part of the year. In the neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seen-taou Chin</hi> the elevation of the plain above low-water is no more than
                    1 foot, and in summer the river rises about 26 feet above its lowest level. To
                    protect themselves against this inevitably recurring danger of inundations the
                    natives have here, as elsewhere, thrown up high embankments on both sides of the
                    river, but at a distance from the natural banks of about 50 to 100 feet. This
                    intervening space is flooded every year, and by the action of the water new
                    layers of sand and soil are deposited every summer, thus strengthening the
                    embankments from season to season. In summer the river would be navigable for
                    steamers of moderate size as far as <hi rend="italic">Laou-ho Kow,</hi> which is
                    situated 180 le above <hi rend="italic">Fan-chiιιg,</hi> but in winter it would
                    be quite impossible to reach the latter place. The chief trading places on the

                <p>In the southern provinces the <hi rend="italic">Se-keang,</hi> or Western River,
                    is the most considerable. This river takes its rise in the prefecture of <hi
                    rend="italic">Kwang-nan Foo</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Yun-nan,</hi> whence it
                    reaches the frontier of <hi rend="italic">Kwang-se</hi> at a distance of about
                    90 le from its source. Then trending in a north-easterly direction it forms the
                    boundary between the two provinces for about 150 le. From this point it takes a
                    generally south-easterly course, passing the cities of <hi rend="italic">Teen
                    Chow, Fung-e Chow, Shang-lin Heen, Lung-gan Heen, Yung-kang Chow,</hi> and <hi

                    it makes a bend to the north-east, and continues this general direction as far
                    as <hi rend="italic">Sin-chow Foo,</hi> a distance of 800 le, where it meets and
                    joins the waters of the <hi rend="italic">Keen Keang</hi> from the north. Its
                    course is then easterly, and after passing <hi rend="italic">Woo-chow Foo</hi>
                    it crosses the frontier into <hi rend="italic">Kwang-tung,</hi> and finally
                    empties itself into the China Sea in the neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Macao.</hi> Like the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang</hi> this river is known
                    by various names in different parts of its course. From its source to <hi
                    rend="italic">Nan-ning Foo</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Kwang-se</hi> it is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Se-yang Keang,</hi> or River of the Western Ocean; from
                    <hi rend="italic">Nan-ning Foo</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Sin-chow Foo</hi> it is
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">Yuh-keαng,</hi> or the Bending River; and over
                    the remainder of its course it is recognized by the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Se-kxang</hi> or Western River. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Se-keang</hi> is navigable as far as <hi rend="italic">Shαou-king,</hi> 130
                    miles, for vessels not drawing more than 15 feet of water, and steamers of a
                    light draught might easily reach <hi rend="italic">Woo-chow Foo,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Kwang-se,</hi> which is situated 75 miles further up. In winter
                    the navigation for junks is difficult above <hi rend="italic">Woo-chow Foo,</hi>
                    and it is said that rapids are met with about 100 miles beyond that city.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Peiho</hi> is a river of importance as being the high
                    water-way to <hi rend="italic">Peking.</hi> Taking its rise in the <hi

                    >Peking,</hi> it passes the city of <hi rend="italic">Tung-chow,</hi> the port
                    of <hi rend="italic">Peking,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tien-tsin,</hi> where it

                    part of the year, but throughout the winter months, that is to say, from the end
                    of November to the beginning of March, it is frozen up.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lakes.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> There are numerous lakes in
                    the central provinces of China. The largest of these is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tung-ting Lake</hi> in <hi rend="italic">H∞-nan,</hi> which, according to
                    Chinese geographers, is upwards of 800 le, or 266 miles, in circumference. In
                    native gazetteers its various portions are known under distinct names; thus it
                    is said to include the <hi rend="italic">Tsing-tsaou,</hi> or Green Grass Lake;
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ung,</hi> or Venerable Lake; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ChïEsha,</hi> or Red Sand Lake; the <hi rend="italic">Hwang-yιh,</hi> or
                    Imperial Post-house Lake; the <hi rend="italic">Gan-nan,</hi> or Peaceful
                    Southern Lake; and the <hi rend="italic">Ta-tung,</hi> or Great Deep Lake. In
                    ancient times it went by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Kew-keang Hoo,</hi>
                    or Lake of the Nine Rivers, from the fact that nine rivers flowed into it.
                    During the winter and spring the water is so low that the shallow portions
                    become islands, separated by rivers such as the <hi rend="italic">Seang</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Yuen,</hi> and numberless streams; but in summer, owing to the
                    rise in the waters of the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang,</hi> the whole
                    basin of the lake is filled. The <hi rend="italic">Poyang Lake</hi> is also
                    subject to a wide difference between high and low water, but not quite to the
                    same extent as the <hi rend="italic">Tung-ting Lake,</hi> and its landmarks are
                    more distinctly defined. The <hi rend="italic">Tai Lake,</hi> in the
                    neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic">Soo-chow Foo,</hi> is also celebrated for its
                    size and the beauty of its surroundings. It is about 150 miles in circumference,
                    and is dotted over with islands, on which are built temples for the devotees of
                    religion, and summer-houses for the votaries of pleasure from the rich and
                    voluptuous cities of <hi rend="italic">Hang-chow</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Soochow.</hi> The boundary line between the provinces of <hi rend="italic"

                    crosses its blue waters, and its shores are divided among thirteen prefectures.
                    Besides these lakes there are, among others, two in <hi rend="italic"

                    One of the most remarkable features in the physical geography of China is the
                    existence of a vast region of loess in the northern portion of the empire. This
                    peculiar formation covers the province of <hi rend="italic">Chih-li</hi> (with
                    the exception of the alluvial plain), <hi rend="italic">Shan-se,</hi> northern
                    <hi rend="italic">Slaen-se, Kan-suh,</hi> and northern <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ho-nan,</hi> constituting altogether an area of about 250,000 square miles.
                    Loess is a solid but friable earth of a brownish-yellow colour. It spreads alike
                    over high and low grounds, smoothing off the irregularities of the surface, and
                    is often to be found covering the sub-soil to a depth of more than 1000 feet. It
                    has a tendency to vertical cleavage, and wherever a river cuts into it, the
                    loess encloses it between perpendicular cliffs, in many places 500 feet in
                    height. These when washed by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n646/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0646-0633"/> water are speedily undermined, and the loess
                    breaks off in vertical sheets, which fall into the river and are carried down by
                    the stream. In this way have been deposited the sediments which to a great
                    extent constitute the great plain, and render the Gulf of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pih-chih-li</hi> and the Yellow Sea so shallow. From an economical point of
                    view the loess is invaluable to the natives of the north of China. In its
                    perpendicular cliffs which are removed from the action of running water are dug
                    out innumerable caves, in which a large majority of the people inhabiting the
                    loess region dwell, while its surface yields abundant crops, requiring no
                    application of manure and but slight expenditure of labour in preparation.
                    Wherever it is found, therefore, whether on the plain or at an elevation of 7000
                    or 8000 feet, it is available for agricultural purposes. The Chinese call it <hi
                    rend="italic">Hwawg-too,</hi> or “Yellow Earth,” and it has been suggested that
                    the imperial title <hi rend="italic">Hwang-te,</hi> “Yellow Emperor,” or “Ruler
                    of the Yellow,” has had its origin in the fact that the emperor was lord of the
                    loess or the “Yellow Earth.”</p>

                <p>During the months of December, January, and February the rivers are frozen up,
                    and even the Gulf of <hi rend="italic">Pih-chih-li</hi> is fringed with a broad
                    border of ice. There are four rivers of some importance in the province, namely,

                    which lies in 37° 40' lat. and 115° 20' E. long.; the second in importance is

                    the province abound with coal, notably at <hi rend="italic">Chai-tang,
                    Tai-gan-shan, Miaou-gan-ling,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Foo-taou</hi> in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Se-shan</hi> or Western Hills. “At <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chai-tang</hi> ·,” Baron von Richthofen says, “I was surprised to walk over a
                    regular succession of coal-bearing strata, the thickness of which, estimating it
                    step by step as I proceeded graduaUy from the lowest to the highest strata,
                    exceeds 7000 feet.” The coal here is anthracite, as is also that at <hi
                    rend="italic">Tai-gan-shan,</hi> where are found beds of greater value than any
                    in the neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic">Peking.</hi> In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seuen-hwa Foo</hi> coal is also found, but not in such quantities as in the
                    places above named. Iron and silver also exist in small quantities in different
                    parts of the province, and hot and warm springs are very common at the foot of
                    the hills along the northern and western edges of the province. The principal
                    agricultural products are wheat, kaou-leang, oats, millet, maize, pulse, and
                    potatoes. Fruits and vegetables are also grown in large quantities. Of the
                    former the chief kinds are pears, apples, plums, apricots, peaches, parsimmons,
                    and melons. <hi rend="italic">Tien-tsin</hi> is the Treaty Port of the province,
                    and by the <hi rend="italic">Consular Trade Report</hi> for 1874 we find that
                    the total value of the merchandize exported from that city during the year
                    amounted to 1,144,893 taels, and that of the goods imported to 17,682,684 taels.
                    The articles which figure most conspicuously in the lists of exports are dates,
                    dried lily flowers, wool, tobacco, and rhubarb; and the most valuable of the
                    imports are shirtings, drills, T-cloths, jeans and twills, opium, woollens,
                    steel, lead, needles, Japanese seaweeds, and sugar.</p>
                <p>The province of <hi rend="italic">Shan-tung,</hi> “or East of the Mountains,” is
                    bounded on the N. by the province of <hi rend="italic">Chih-li</hi> and the Gulf
                    of <hi rend="italic">Pih-chih-li,</hi> on the E. by the Yellow Sea, on the S. by
                    <hi rend="italic">Keang-soo</hi> and the Yellow Sea, and on the W. by <hi
                    rend="italic">Chih-U.</hi> It contains an area of 65,104 square miles, and the
                    population is estimated to be 30,000,000. It is divided into ten prefectures,
                    with as many prefectural cities, of which <hi rend="italic">Tse-nan Foo,</hi>
                    the provincial capital, is the chief. The physical features of the province are
                    very plainly marked. The centre and eastern portions are occupied by a series of
                    mountain ranges running north-east and southwest, between which lie fertile
                    valleys, while the northwestern, southern, and western portions form part of the
                    great delta plain of the north of China. The most considerable range of
                    mountains is that which lies to the north of the city of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tav-gan Foo,</hi> of which the highest peak is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tai-shan,</hi> a mountain which has been famous in Chinese history for more
                    than 4000 years, and to which at the present day hundreds of pilgrims annually
                    resort. Another important range is the <hi rend="italic">Laou-shan,</hi> which
                    fringe« the south-eastern coast for about 18 miles. With the exception of the
                    Yellow River, which in its new course <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n647/mode/1up"

                    direction to the sea, there are no large rivers in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shantung.</hi> The most considerable are the <hi rend="italic">Wei,</hi> which
                    flows into the Gulf of <hi rend="italic">Pih-chih-ii;</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yïh,</hi> which empties itself into a lake lying to the east of the Grand
                    Canal; and the <hi rend="italic">Ta-zoan,</hi> which rises at the southern foot
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Yih Mountains</hi> and terminates its course in the
                    Grand Canal. There are several lakes in the province, notably the <hi
                    rend="italic">He-shang Hoo</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Nan-thang Hoo,</hi>
                    both of which border on the Grand Canal in the south-west. Large quantities of
                    foreign and southern goods are consumed in the populous districts surrounding
                    these lakes, the waters of which afford means of export for the cotton, silk,
                    coal, grain, &amp;c., which are produced in the fertile tracts lying in their
                    neighbourhood. Speaking generally the province is not a fertile one. Not being a
                    loess region, the mountains are unproductive, and yield only brushwood and
                    grass, while the plain to the north is so impregnated with salt that it is
                    almost valueless, especially near the sea, for agricultural purposes. The
                    valleys between the mountains and the plain to the southwest are, however,
                    extremely rich and fertile. The chief wealth of <hi rend="italic">Shantung</hi>
                    consists in its minerals, the principal of which is coal. There are four large
                    coal-fields and several smaller ones now being worked in the province, the most
                    considerable of which lies in the valley of the <hi rend="italic">Laou-foo
                    River</hi> in the centre of the province. The coal and coke from this district
                    are conveyed by road to the city of <hi rend="italic">Letsing</hi> on the Yellow
                    River, a distance of about 75 miles, from whence they are exported in all
                    directions. Another large field lies on the plain a little to the south of <hi
                    rend="italic">Yïh-chow Foo</hi> in the south. A third field is in the district
                    of <hi rend="italic">Wei Heen</hi> to the north; and a fourth in the
                    neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic">Yïh Heen</hi> in the south-west. Iron ore,
                    ironstone, gold, galena, lead, and copper are also found in considerable
                    quantities in many parts of the province. The principal agricultural products
                    are wheat, millet, Indian com, pulse, rice, arrowroot, and many varieties of
                    fruits and vegetables. The castor-oil plant is common, and the wax tree grows
                    plentifully in the neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic">Lai-yang</hi> in the east,
                    giving rise to a considerable trade in the wax produced by means of the wax
                    insects. Unlike those of their kind in <hi rend="italic">Sze-chuen,</hi> the wax
                    insects of <hi rend="italic">Shantung</hi> breed and become productive in the
                    same districts. They are placed upon the trees in the spring, and at the close
                    of the summer they void a peculiar substance which when melted forms wax. In the
                    autumn they are taken off the trees, and are preserved within doors until the
                    following spring. <hi rend="italic">Shantung</hi> abounds in good harbours, the
                    most noteworthy of which are <hi rend="italic">Chefoo</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wei-hai-wei</hi> on the north, and <hi rend="italic">Slvihtaou,
                    Kin-kea-kow,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chingtaou</hi> on the south of the
                    promontory. As being the native province of both Confucius and Mencius, <hi
                    rend="italic">Shantung</hi> has acquired an undying fame in the Chinese world of
                    literature. <hi rend="italic">Chefoo,</hi> the Treaty Port of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shantung,</hi> is situated on the northeastern coast of the province. The value
                    of the foreign trade from this port amounted in 1874 to £2,597,060, £1,882,144
                    of which represented the imports, and £714,916 the exports.</p>
                <p>The province of <hi rend="italic">Shan-se</hi> is bounded on the N. by Mongob’a,
                    on the E. by <hi rend="italic">Chih-li,</hi> on the S. by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ho-nan,</hi> and on the W. by <hi rend="italic">Shen-se.</hi> It occupies an
                    area of 53,268 square miles, and contains besides its capital, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Toe-yuen Foo,</hi> eight prefectural cities. The population is returned as
                    being 14,004,210. The configuration of <hi rend="italic">Shan-se</hi> is
                    noteworthy, forming, from its southern frontier to as far north as <hi
                    rend="italic">Ning-woo Foo</hi> —an area of about 30,000 square miles —a plateau
                    elevated from 5000 to 6000 feet above the level of the sea, the whole of which
                    is one vast coal-field. The northern and western limits of the plateau are
                    bounded by high mountain ranges trending south-west and northeast. Down the
                    central line of the province from north to south lies a curious series of deep
                    depressions, all of which are ancient lake basins. But though forming a series
                    it is plain that these lakes were not formerly connected with each other, some
                    being separated from those next adjoining by high ridges, and being drained by
                    different rivers and in different directions. <hi rend="italic">Shan-se</hi> is
                    one of the most remarkable coal and iron regions in the world, and Baron von
                    Richthofen gives it as his opinion that the world, at the present rate of
                    consumption of coal, could be supplied for thousands of years from <hi
                    rend="italic">Shan-se</hi> alone. The neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tse-chow Foo</hi> in the south of the province abounds in both coal and iron,
                    and has probably, partly by reason of its situation being within reach of the
                    populous plain of <hi rend="italic">Hwai-kimg Foo,</hi> of the Yellow River, of
                    <hi rend="italic">Taou-kaw Chin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sew-woo Heen</hi>
                    (the shipping places for <hi rend="italic">Tientsin</hi> and the Grand Canal),
                    and of <hi rend="italic">Homan Fοο,</hi> furnished more iron to the Chinese than
                    any other region of a similar extent in the empire. The iron is of great purity
                    and is easily fusible, while the necessary means for manufacturing it, such as
                    all sorts of clay and sand for crucibles, moulds, &amp;c., and a very superior
                    anthracite coal, he ready to hand. The coal is of two kinds, bituminous and
                    anthracite, and the hne of demarcation between the two is formed by the hills
                    which are the continuation of the <hi rend="italic">llο-shan</hi> range, the
                    fields of bituminous coal being on the west of these hills, and those of
                    anthracite on the east. In the neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic">Ping-ting
                    Chow</hi> the extent of the coal-field is incalculable; and speaking of the
                    whole plateau, Baron von Richthofen says, “These extraordinary conditions, for
                    which I know no parallel on the globe, will eventually give rise to some curious
                    features in mining. It may be predicted that, if a railway should ever be built
                    from the plain to this region— and there is no other means of ever bringing to
                    their due account its mineral resources—branches of it will be constructed
                    within the body of one or other of these beds of anthracite, which are among the
                    thickest and most valuable known anywhere, and continue for miles underneath the
                    hills west of the present coal-belt of <hi rend="italic">Ping-ting Chow.</hi>
                    Such a tunnel would allow of putting the produce of the various coal-beds
                    immediately on railroad carts destined for distant places.” Salt is produced in
                    the prefecture of <hi rend="italic">Ping-yang</hi> in the south of the province,
                    both from a salt lake and from the alluvial soil in the neighbourhood of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fun River.</hi> In agricultural products the province is poor, and
                    as the means of transport at present existing are rude and insufficient, all
                    kinds of food command unusually high prices. Meat is a rare luxury, and salt
                    fish, the usual substitute for meat, is consumed only by the wealthier classes.
                    As a rule the people are poor, and in the mountainous districts are subject to
                    famine and starvation. The only waggon road leading into and through <hi

                    with the gloomy groves of cypress.” All kinds of cereals grow luxuriantly, and
                    the general productiveness of the district is indicated by the extreme denseness
                    of the population. The most noticeable feature in that portion <pb break="no"

                    impassable barrier between Kokonor and Tibet, and in China it separates
                    completely the northern from the central provinces. Coal is found on the south

                    any other province of China, is estimated at 37,843,501. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Keang-sοο</hi> forms part of the great plain of Northern China. There are no
                    mountains within its limits, and but few hills. It is watered as no other
                    province in China is watered. The Grand Canal runs through it from south to
                    north; the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang</hi> crosses its southern portion
                    from west to east; it possesses several lakes, of which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tai-hοo</hi> is the most noteworthy, and numberless streams connect the canal
                    with the sea. Its coast is studded with low islands and sand-banks, the results
                    of the deposits brought down by the Yellow River during the different periods in
                    which in the course of its history it has flowed into the Yellow Sea. <hi
                    rend="italic">Keang-soo</hi> is rich in places of interest. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nanking,</hi> “the Southern Capital,” was the seat of the Chinese court until
                    the commencement of the 15th century, and in modern times it has been famous as
                    having been the headquarters of the Tai-ping rebels from the year 1853, when
                    they took the city by assault, to 1864, when its garrison yielded to Col.
                    Gordon’s “ever victorious army” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Nanking),</hi> and <hi

                    commerce produced in <hi rend="italic">Keang-sοo,</hi> and next in importance
                    are cotton, sugar, and medicines. The silk manufactured in the looms of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sοo-chow</hi> is famous all over the empire, as a proof of which
                    it may be mentioned that, on the occasion of the marriage of the late emperor
                    Tung-che, large orders were received by the manufacturers in that city for
                    silken goods to be bestowed as imperial presents and to be converted into
                    wedding garments. In the mountains near <hi rend="italic">Nanking,</hi> coal,

                <p>Ports in the province. According to the trade reports for 1874, the value of the
                    goods exported from Shanghai in that year amounted to 27,541,834 taels, and that
                    of those imported to 89,636,343 taels. From <hi rend="italic">Chin-keang</hi>
                    during the same period, £317,277 worth of merchandize was exported, while the
                    value of the imports amounted to £3,527,066. In explanation of this latter
                    figure the British vice-consul writes, “with the exception of opium, the sale of
                    which has steadily advanced since the opening of the port (in 1861), all the
                    principal articles of import exhibit a decline.”</p>
                <p>The province of <hi rend="italic">Gan-hwuy</hi> “Peace and Plenty,” is bounded on

                    contains a population of 34,108,059 souls. Its principal city is <hi
                    rend="italic">Can-king</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang,</hi>
                    besides which it numbers seven prefectural cities. The southern half of the
                    province, that portion south of the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang,</hi>
                    forms part of the <hi rend="italic">Nan-shan,</hi> or hilly belt of the
                    south-eastern provinces, and produces, besides cotton and iron ore, large
                    quantities of green tea. <hi rend="italic">Gan-hwuy</hi> is one of the most
                    productive provinces of China. Over the whole of its southern portion tea is
                    largely grown, notably in the districts of <hi rend="italic">Hwuy-chow Foο,
                    Tung-lew, Ta-tung,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wοo-hοο.</hi> Speaking of this
                    part Baron von Richthofen says, “The exuberant fertility of the soil in the
                    lower portions of the province is not excelled by anything I have seen in
                    temperate climates. No expense has, therefore, been spared in protecting the
                    lowlands by embankments, and introducing a perfect system of irrigation. Both
                    deserve the highest admiration. On the <hi rend="italic">King River</hi> I have
                    walked for miles through fields of hemp the stalks of which were from 11 to 13
                    feet high. Cotton, too is raised in large quantities.” The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shun-gan Keang</hi> is the principal river of the province, and is of great
                    importance for foreign commerce, supplying as it does direct water communication
                    between some of the principal tea-growing districts and the neighbourhood of <hi

                    square miles, and its population by the last census was returned as being
                    19,000,000. It is divided into fourteen prefectures, and the provincial capital
                    is <hi rend="italic">Nan-ehang Foo,</hi> a city situated on the <hi

                    Lake,</hi> into which the river empties itself. The whole province is
                    mountainous, being traversed in a south-westerly and north-easterly direction by
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nan-shan ranges.</hi> The largest river is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kea Keang,</hi> which rises in the mountains in the south of the
                    province and flows westward into the <hi rend="italic">Po-yang Lake</hi> as
                    mentioned above. During the summer time it has water of sufficient depth for

                    the most part of exquisite beauty. The hilly portion of the province furnishes
                    large supplies of tea, and in the plain which extends along the coast, north of
                    Ningpo, a great quantity of silk is raised. In minerals the province is poor.
                    Coal and iron are occasionally met with, and traces of copper ore are to be
                    found in places, but none of these minerals exist in sufficiently large deposits

                    largest figure, were imported to the value of £430,692. Opposite <hi
                    rend="italic">Ning-po,</hi> at a distance of about 50 miles, lies the <hi
                    rend="italic">Island of Chusan,</hi> the largest of a group bearing that general
                    name. This island is 21 miles long, and is about 50 miles in circumference. It
                    is very mountainous, and is surrounded by numerous islands and islets. On its
                    south side stands the walled town of <hi rend="italic">Tinghai,</hi> in front of
                    which is the principal harbour. The population is returned as being 50,000.</p>
                <p>The province of <hi rend="italic">Fuh-keen,</hi> or, as it used to be called, <hi
                    rend="italic">Min,</hi> is bounded on the N. by the province of <hi
                    rend="italic">ChA-keang,</hi> on the S. by that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kwang-tung,</hi> on the W. by that of <hi rend="italic">Keαng-se,</hi> and on
                    the E. by the sea. It occupies an area of 53,480 square miles, and its
                    population is estimated at 14,777,410. The provincial capital is <hi
                    rend="italic">Fuhrchow Foo,</hi> and it is divided into eleven prefectures,
                    besides that ruled over by the prefect of the capital city. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fuh-keen</hi> is generally mountainous, being overspread by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nan-shαn</hi> ranges, which run a general course of N.E. and S.W.
                    The principal river is the <hi rend="italic">Min,</hi> which is formed by the
                    junction, in the neighbourhood of the city of <hi rend="italic">Yen-ping
                    Foo,</hi> of three rivers,—namely, the <hi rend="italic">Keen-ke,</hi> which
                    takes its rise in the mountains on the western frontier in the prefecture of <hi
                    rend="italic">Keen-ning Foo,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Fuh-tun Ke,</hi> the
                    source of which is found in the district of <hi rend="italic">Kwang-tsih</hi> in
                    the north-west of the province, and the <hi rend="italic">Shαou Ke,</hi> which
                    rises in the mountains in the western district of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ning-kwα.</hi> From <hi rend="italic">Yen-ping</hi><hi rend="italic">F</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">oo</hi> the river takes a somewhat south-easterly course, and
                    after passing along the south face of the city of <hi rend="italic">Fuh-chow
                    Foo,</hi> empties itself into the sea about 30 miles below that town. Its upper
                    course is narrow and rocky and abounds in rapids, but as it approaches <hi
                    rend="italic">Fuh-chow Foo</hi> the channel widens, and the current becomes slow
                    and even. Its depth is very irregular, and it is navigable only by native boats
                    of a small class. Two other rivers flow into the sea near the island of <hi
                    rend="italic">Amoy,</hi> neither of which, however, is navigable for any
                    distance from their mouths owing to the shallows and rapids with which they
                    abound. The soil of the province is, as its name, “Happy Establishment,”
                    indicates, very productive, and the scenery is of a rich and varied character.
                    Most of the hills are covered with verdure, and the less rugged are laid out in
                    terraces. The principal products of the province are tea, of which the best kind
                    is that known as Bohea, which takes its name, by a mispronunciation, from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Woo-e Mountains,</hi> in the prefecture of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Keenning Foo,</hi> where it is grown; grains of various kinds, oranges,
                    plantains, lichis, bamboo, ginger, gold, silver, lead, tin, iron, salt (both
                    marine and rock), deers’ horns, beeswax, sugar, fish, birds’ nests, medicine,
                    paper, cloth, timber, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Fuh-keen</hi> boasts of two
                    Treaty Ports, <hi rend="italic">Fuhchow Foo</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amoy.</hi> The trade reports for 1874 show that the value of goods imported in
                    foreign vessels to <hi rend="italic">Fuh-chow Foo</hi> in that year amounted to
                    £1,332,387, Ils. 8d., and that that of goods similarly exported amounted to
                    £4,397,320, 19s. 4d. The chief articles of export from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amoy</hi> are tea, sugar, and sugar candy; of tea £1,129,090 worth was exported
                    during the year 1874.</p>
                <p>The Island of <hi rend="italic">Formosa,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taiwan,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the Great Bay,” as the Chinese call it,
                    forms part of the province of <hi rend="italic">Fuhkeen.</hi> Situated at a
                    distance of about 80 or 90 miles from the mainland, its highest mountains can be
                    easily recognized from the coast near Amoy. And so when Chinese historians
                    assert that its existence first became known to their ancestors in the year
                    1480, they probably mean that at that date emigrants from the mainland first
                    gained a footing in the island. At all events, when the Japanese two centuries
                    later attempted to establish a colony in the island, they found there a Chinese
                    population sufficiently numerous to be formidable. The island stretches from
                    lat. 21° 53' 30" to lat. 25° 33'. In shape it is long and narrow. Its greatest
                    width is about 70 miles, and it tapers off to a fine point at its southern
                    extremity. A backbone of mountains runs from north to south through almost its
                    entire length, leaving a plain on the western and northern portions. These level
                    districts are occupied by Chinese settlers, while the mountains and their
                    eastern slopes to the sea are inhabited by native tribes. The fertility of the
                    plains has gained for <hi rend="italic">Formosa</hi> the name of the Granary of
                    China. On every available piece of land fields of rice and sugar are carefully
                    cultivated, and recompense the farmer by yielding him constant and abundant
                    crops. These alone, in addition to such products as jute, grass cloth, fibre,
                    rice paper, and ratan, would make the island a valuable possession; but far more
                    precious are the sulphur and the camphor, which are obtained from the mines and
                    from the mountains of the island, and which are claimed by the Government as
                    Crown monopolies. When taken from the mine the sulphur is boiled in iron boilers
                    until the slate-like mineral assumes a treacle-like consistency. This is
                    constantly stirred until every impurity is separated from the sulphur, which is
                    then ladled out into wooden tubs shaped like sugar-loaves. In these it is left
                    to cool, and the conical cake is freed from the tub by the simple process of
                    knocking out the bottom of the latter. As the gigantic laurels from which the
                    camphor is obtained are found only in the mountains in the possession of the
                    natives, the acquisition of a constant supply is somewhat difficult. In 1874,
                    however, 14,380½ cwts. of this commodity were exported from the ports of <hi
                    rend="italic">Tam-suy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kelung.</hi> Petroleum also
                    adds to the riches of the island. The Treaty Ports in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Formosa</hi> are <hi rend="italic">Tai-wan Foo</hi> (including <pb break="no"

                    >Kelung)</hi> on the north-west and north coast. The foreign trade returns for
                    <hi rend="italic">Tai-wan Foo</hi> for 1874 show that goods to the value of
                    £1,678,858 were imported during the year, and that £1,840,016 was the value of
                    the exports during the same period. The <hi rend="italic">Tam-suy</hi> returns
                    present much smaller totals; £304,243 represents the value of the imports, and
                    £203,428 that of the exports in 1874.</p>
                <p>The province of <hi rend="italic">Hoo-pilι,</hi> “North of the Lakes,” is bounded

                    <hi rend="italic">Sheη-se</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Szechuen.</hi> It occupies
                    an area of 70,450 square miles, and contains a population of 27,370,098. The
                    most important city within its borders is the Treaty Port of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Haη-kοw,</hi> besides which it contains ten other prefectural cities. The
                    greater part of the province forms a plain, and its most noticeable feature is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Han River,</hi> which runs in a south-easterly direction
                    across the province from its northwesterly corner to its junction with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang</hi> at <hi rend="italic">Han-kοw.</hi> The
                    products of the <hi rend="italic">Han</hi> valley are exclusively agricultural,
                    consisting of cotton, wheat, rape seed, tobacco, and various kinds of beans.
                    Vegetable tallow is also exported in large quantities from this part of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hοο-pih.</hi> Gold is found in the <hi rend="italic">Han,</hi> but
                    not in sufficient quantities to make working it more than barely remunerative.
                    It is washed every winter from banks of coarse gravel, a little above <hi
                    rend="italic">E-ching Heen,</hi> on which it is deposited by the river. Every
                    winter the supply is exhausted by the washers, and every summer it is renewed by
                    the river. Baron von Richthofen reckoned that the digger earned from 50 to 150
                    cash a day. Only one waggon road leads northwards from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hοο-pilι,</hi> and that is to <hi rend="italic">Nan-yang Fοο</hi> in <hi

                    to the <hi rend="italic">Consular Trade Reports</hi> for 1874, the value of the
                    foreign trade at <hi rend="italic">Han-kοw</hi> during that year amounted to
                    £9,775,754, of which sum £4,388,113 represents the value of the imports, and
                    £5,387,641 that of the exports.</p>
                <p>The province of <hi rend="italic">Hoο-nan,</hi> “South of the Lakes,” is bounded
                    on the N. by <hi rend="italic">Hοο-pih,</hi> on the E. by <hi rend="italic"

                    miles, and its population is estimated at 18,652,507. The provincial capital is
                    <hi rend="italic">Chang sha Fοο,</hi> in addition to which it counts eight
                    prefectural cities within its boundaries. It is essentially a province of hills,
                    the only plain of any extent being that around the <hi rend="italic">Tung-ting
                    Lake,</hi> but this extends little beyond the area which in summer forms part of
                    the lake. To the north of <hi rend="italic">Hang-chοw Fοο</hi> detached groups
                    of higher mountains than are found in the southern portion of the province are
                    met with. Among these is the <hi rend="italic">Hang-shan,</hi> one of the <hi

                    its lowest portion. The principal places of commerce are—(1.) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seang-tang,</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">Seang-keang,</hi> which is said to

                    province is one vast coal-field, extending over an area of 21,700 square miles.
                    This area is divided into two nearly equal parts,—one, the <hi rend="italic">Luy

                    >Seang River</hi> coal-fields, yielding bituminous coal. The people are, as a
                    rule, more generally prosperous than are the inhabitants of the other provinces,
                    and Baron von Richthofen, in the course of his journey through the province,
                    noticed with surprise the number of fine country seats owned by rich men who had
                    retired from business, which were scattered over the rural districts. Almost all
                    the traffic is conveyed through <hi rend="italic">Hoo-nan</hi> by water-ways,
                    which lead northward to <hi rend="italic">Han-kow</hi> on the <hi rend="italic"

                    upwards of 10,000,000 before the outbreak of the late Mahometan rebellion. <hi
                    rend="italic">Se-gαn Foo</hi> is the provincial capital, and besides this there
                    are seven prefectural cities in the province. <hi rend="italic">Shen-se</hi> is
                    divided into two parts by a barrier of mountains, consisting of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Foo-new Shan</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tsing-ling Shan,</hi>
                    which runs across the southern portion of the province from east to west. To the
                    north of the mountains lie the basins of the <hi rend="italic">Wei River</hi>
                    and of several other tributaries to the <hi rend="italic">Hwang-ho.</hi> The
                    position of the <hi rend="italic">Wei</hi> basin is peculiar. Cut off from the
                    rest of China on the east by the Yellow River, and on the south by the
                    mountains, it yet forms the great channel of communication with Central Asia.
                    Its position, therefore, in a strategical point of view is at once apparent.
                    Were it in the hands of an enemy the Chinese colonies in Central Asia would be
                    completely severed from the mother country, and hence the eagerness which has
                    been evinced by the Government throughout all history to retain possession of
                    the region. For upwards of 2000 years, with the exception of intervals, from
                    1122 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 1127 A.D., the city of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Se-gan Foo,</hi> which Res in the basin, was the capital of the empire. « Its
                    walls enclose a square space of six geographical miles each way, and, unlike
                    most Chinese cities, its fortifications are kept in perfect repair. During the
                    late Mahometan rebellion it was closely invested for two years by the rebels,
                    who however failed to make themselves masters of it. From <hi rend="italic"
                    >Se-gαn Foo</hi> radiate a number of roads going east, south, and west. The east
                    road is the great <hi rend="italic">Tung-kwan</hi> road, which forms the
                    principal means of communication between <hi rend="italic">Peking</hi> and the
                    north-eastern provinces of the empire, and <hi rend="italic">Sze-dιuen,

                    an affluent of the <hi rend="italic">Han River,</hi> and is thus connected with

                    >Suh-chow</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Hamì,</hi> where it forks into two branches,
                    which follow respectively the northern and southern foot of the <hi

                    >Teen-shan pih loo</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Teen-shan nan loo.</hi> It was
                    along these roads that the fame of China first reached Europe, and it was by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Teen-shan nan loo</hi> that Marco Polo entered the empire. To
                    defend this line of communication the Great Wall was extended to beyond <hi
                    rend="italic">Suh Chow,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Kea-yu</hi> gate, which
                    is the door of the empire, was built. During the reign of Hea-woo Te of the Han
                    dynasty Chinese colonies and high roads lined with fortified cities were
                    established along this route, and though at times the Government have lost
                    possession of the line beyond the Great Wall, it has always succeeded in
                    re-establishing its supremacy over it, and the earlier emperors of the present
                    dynasty established a firmer hold over the <hi rend="italic">Teen-shan pih
                    loo</hi> and Hi than any of their predecessors had been able to acquire.
                    Occupying a position, then, at the confluence of the roads which connect
                    northeastern China with its western and south-western portions, <hi
                    rend="italic">Se-gan Foo</hi> is naturally a city of great commercial
                    importance. Producing no manufactures of its own, its trade consists principally
                    in the importation of silk from <hi rend="italic">Chë-keang</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Sze-chuen,</hi> tea from <hi rend="italic">Hoo-pih</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Hoo-nan,</hi> and sugar from <hi rend="italic">Sze-chuen,</hi> and
                    in the exportation of these and other articles of commerce to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kan-suh,</hi> Russia, and Central Asia. <hi rend="italic">Shen-se</hi> is
                    purely an agricultural province, and produces nothing for the foreign markets.
                    Its principal products are cotton, wheat, and opium, and these it exchanges with
                    the neighbouring provinces for coal, iron, salt, &amp;c. But besides these,
                    kaou-leang, pulse, millet, maize, groundnut, barley,beans, pease, lucerne, and
                    rape seed are grown. The <hi rend="italic">Wei</hi> basin is the greatest
                    agricultural country in the north-west. Being a loess region it is unfit for
                    rice, but for the same reason it produces fine crops of the kinds mentioned at a
                    minimum expenditure of labour. The <hi rend="italic">Shen-se</hi> opium is much
                    valued by smokers, and ranks next to the <hi rend="italic">Shan-se</hi> drug,
                    which is second only to that produced in <hi rend="italic">Kan-suh.</hi> Coal
                    abounds in the northern part of the province, but owing to difficulty of transit
                    it is not worked to any great extent. The winters are cold, but short, and
                    though fruit trees abound and are most productive, no evergreen trees or shrubs
                    are to be met with within the province.</p>
                <p>The province of <hi rend="italic">Kan-suh,</hi> which derives its name from the
                    first syllables of the names of the two cities <hi rend="italic">Kan-dιow
                    Foo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Suh-chow,</hi> is bounded on the N.E. by the Ordo
                    Mongol tribes and the Desert of Gobi, on the E. by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shen-se,</hi> on the S. by <hi rend="italic">Sze-chuen,</hi> on the S.W. by
                    Kokonor and the Desert of Gobi, and on the N.W. by Kobdo and Hi. The boundary on
                    the N. remains undefined, but the province may be said to occupy the territory
                    lying between lat. 32° 30' and 40°, and long. 108° to 98° 20', and to contain an
                    area of about 86,688 square miles. The population is estimated at 15,193,125.
                    <hi rend="italic">Kan-suh</hi> is for the most part a howling wilderness of sand
                    and snow, but to the east of the Yellow River the country is cultivated and to
                    some extent productive. The principal river is the Yellow River, the course of
                    which through the province has already been described, and in the mountains to
                    the south of <hi rend="italic">Lan-chow Foo</hi> rises the <hi rend="italic">Wei
                    River,</hi> which traverses <hi rend="italic">Shen-se,</hi> and flows into the
                    Yellow River at <hi rend="italic">Tung-kwan.</hi> The chief products of <hi
                    rend="italic">Kan-suh</hi> are cloth, horse hides, a kind of curd like butter
                    “which melts in the mouth,” and is known by the Mongols under the name of Wuta,
                    musk, plums, onions, dates sweet melons, and medicines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sze-chuen,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the Four Streams,” is
                    the largest province in China. It is bounded on the N. by Kokonor, <hi
                    rend="italic">Kan-suh,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Shan-se,</hi> on the E. by <hi

                    by Tibet. Its population is estimated at 35,000,000; it occupies an area of
                    220,000 square miles, and contains fifteen prefectural cities, inclusive of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ching-too Foo,</hi> the provincial capital. The western portion of
                    the province forms part of the mountain-lands of Central Asia, and the eastern
                    portion, comprising about 100,000 square miles, is. with the exception of the
                    plain on which the city of <hi rend="italic">Ching-too Foo</hi> is situated,
                    emphatically a hilly region. The boundaries of this hilly region may be
                    described by lines drawn from <hi rend="italic">Lung-gan Foo</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">Kwei-chow Foo</hi> on the N., from <hi rend="italic">Kwei-chow
                    Foo</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Yung-ning Heen</hi> on the S.E., and from this
                    latter place to <hi rend="italic">Lung gan Foo</hi> on the W. The ethnological
                    and commercial boundaries are clearly and sharply drawn by these physical
                    features. The mountain districts are poorly cultivated, and are inhabited by
                    “Ejin,” or Barbarians, who are distinguished under the tribal names of Se-fan,
                    Lo-lo, and Man-tsze, and whose allegiance to the Chinese Government sits but
                    lightly on them, while the eastern portion is exclusively Chinese, and is one of
                    the most thriving and populous regions in the empire. Through the southern
                    portion of it runs the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang,</hi> which is there
                    navigable throughout the year, while it is traversed by three large rivers, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Min-keang,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Το</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-keang,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Kea-ling Keang,</hi> all of which take
                    their rise in the mountains on its north-west border, and empty themselves into
                    the <hi rend="italic">Yang-tsze Keang</hi> at <hi rend="italic">Seu-chow Foo,
                    Loo Chow,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chungking Foo</hi> respectively. The whole
                    province is intersected by numerous but difficult roads. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ta-pih-loo,</hi> or great north road, leads from <hi rend="italic">Ching4oo
                    Foo</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Peking.</hi> From the same centre there branches
                    out one to <hi rend="italic">Chung king Foo,</hi> one to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paou-ning Foo,</hi> and one to <hi rend="italic">Ya-choτo Foo,</hi> while

                <p>The products of <hi rend="italic">Sze-chuen</hi> are varied and valuable, and,
                    unlike those of the northern provinces of China, are eminently suitable for
                    foreign export. First on the list stands silk, and of this article of commerce a
                    larger quantity is produced in eastern <hi rend="italic">Sze-chuen</hi> than in
                    any other province of the empire. There are few districts in this region in
                    which silk is not produced, and though it is somewhat inferior in quality to
                    that producedin <hi rend="italic">Chë-keaeng</hi> yet in strength and durability
                    it is so far superior to it that it is able to compete successfully with the
                    finer kind in the market. Large quantities are exported to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shen-se, Shan-se, Kan-suh, Peking, Yunman,</hi> Tibet, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kwei-chow, Kwaeng-se, Hooman,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hoo-pih,</hi> and
                    lately it has begun to figure in the <hi rend="italic">Shanghai</hi> returns as
                    an article of foreign export. The cultivation of the poppy is largely carried on
                    in the same portion of the province. The opium produced is, however, of an
                    inferior quality, and the exportation therefore is limited to those provinces
                    which from exceptional circumstances are unable to procure the better
                    description of drug from elsewhere. White wax is another of the most valuable
                    articles of the <hi rend="italic">Sze-chuen,</hi> trade. It is made exclusively
                    in the department of <hi rend="italic">Keating Foo,</hi> the climate of which
                    appears to favour the pro <pb break="no"

                    is said by the natives to be the cause of the plentiful secretion of wax. This
                    belief is borne out by the fact, that in the districts where the insects breed
                    only a small quantity of wax is produced, and experience has therefore taught
                    the natives the advantage of breeding the insects in one district and producing
                    the wax in another. The region of <hi rend="italic">Keen-chaeng</hi> in the
                    south of the province has been found most suitable for breeding purposes, and it
                    is there, therefore, on the insect trees, which are evergreens with large and
                    pointed ovate leaves, that the breeding processes are carried on. At the end of
                    April the producers start each with a load of the eggs of the insects for the
                    district of <hi rend="italic">Kea-ting Foo,</hi> a journey which on foot
                    occupies about a fortnight. The road between the two districts is very
                    mountainous, and as exposure to the heat of the sun would hatch the eggs too
                    rapidly, the travellers journey only during the night. At <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kea-ting Foo</hi> they are eagerly bought up, and are at once put upon the wax
                    tree. Baron von Richthofen thus describes the subsequent process :—“When the egg
                    balls are procured they are folded up, six or seven together, in a bag of palm
                    leaf. These bags are suspended on the twigs of the trees. This is all the human
                    labour required. After a few days the insects commence coming out. They spread
                    as a brownish film over the twigs, but do not touch the leaves. The Chinese
                    describe them as having neither shape, nor head, nor eyes, nor feet. It is known
                    that the insect is a species of coccus. Gradually, while the insect is growing,
                    the surface of the twigs becomes encrustated with a white substance; this is the
                    wax. No care whatever is required. The insect has no enemy, and is not even
                    touched by ants. In the latter half of August the twigs are cut off and boiled
                    in water, when the wax rises to the surface. It is then melted and poured into
                    deep pans. It cools down to a translucent and highly crystalline substance. Ten
                    taels weight of eggs produce from two to three catties of wax.” Tobacco is

                    the province, but the only coal which is worked is of an inferior quality, and
                    the iron is smelted with wood alone. Sugar, tung oil, wheat, barley, beans,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Ning-yuen Foo</hi> is the principal district from which the
                    copper is produced, as much as from 500 to 600 tons a year being exported from
                    this one prefecture. The mines are owned by private companies, who are bound by
                    the terms of their licence to sell the metal at a fixed price (8 taels per
                    picul) to certain holders of a Government concession, who on their part are

                <p>The province of <hi rend="italic">Kwang-tung</hi> is bounded on the N. by <hi
                    rend="italic">Hoo-nan, Keang-se,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fuh-keen,</hi> on
                    the S. and E. by the sea, and on the W. by <hi rend="italic">Kwang-se.</hi> It
                    contains an area of 79,456 square miles, and is divided into nine prefectures;
                    and the population is estimated at about 19,174,030. Its name, which signifies
                    “East of Kwang,” is derived, according to Chinese writers, from the fact of its
                    being to the east of the old province of <hi rend="italic">Hoo-kwang,</hi> in
                    the same way that <hi rend="italic">Kwang-se</hi> derives its name from its
                    position to the west of <hi rend="italic">Hoo-kwang. Kwang-tung</hi> extends for
                    more than 600 miles from E. to W., and for about 420 from N. to S. It may be
                    described as a hilly region, forming part as it does of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nan Shan</hi> ranges. These mountains, speaking generally, trend in a
                    north-east and south-westerly direction, and are divided by valleys of great
                    fertility. The principal rivers of the province are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Se-keang,</hi> which has been already described; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Píh-keang,</hi> or North River, which rises in the mountains to the north of
                    the province, and after a southerly course joins the <hi rend="italic"

                    the <hi rend="italic">Tung-keang,</hi> or East River, which after flowing in a
                    south-westerly direction from its source in the north-east of the province,
                    empties itself into the estuary which separates the city of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canton</hi> from the sea; and the <hi rend="italic">Han River,</hi> which runs
                    a north and south course across the eastern portion of the province, taking its
                    rise in the mountains on the western frontier of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fuh-keen,</hi> and emptying itself into the China Sea in the neighbourhood of
                    <hi rend="italic">Swatow. Kwang-tung</hi> is one of the most productive
                    provinces of the empire. Its mineral wealth is very considerable, and the soil
                    of the valleys and plains is extremely fertile. The principal article of export
                    is silk, which is produced in the district forming the river delta, extending
                    from <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Macao</hi> and having
                    its apex at <hi rend="italic">San-shwuy Heen.</hi> The value of the silk and of
                    silken manufactures, especially textures which are annually exported from <hi
                    rend="italic">Canton</hi> in foreign bottoms, is estimated at about 14,000,000
                    dollars. Tea is also grown in many districts, and is exported annually to the
                    amount of about 3,000,000 dollars; cassia lignea, together with cassia buds and
                    twigs (from the sub-prefecture of <hi rend="italic">Lo-ting,</hi> 150 miles east
                    of <hi rend="italic">Canton),</hi> matting, fire-crackers, sugar, and palm leaf
                    fans, which are annually exported to the number of 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 to New
                    York alone, are among the other prominent articles of merchandize. Sugar is
                    grown on the banks of almost all the rivers, and 40 per cent, of the ground
                    under cultivation in the districts of <hi rend="italic">Pwan-yu, Tung-kwan,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Tsang-ching,</hi> is occupied by sugar plantations. Out of
                    the total exports from <hi rend="italic">Swatow</hi> during the year 1874, which
                    amounted in value to £4,367,739, sugar was put down as representing £1,023,810.
                    Three large coal-fields exist in the province, namely, the <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">Kwang-tung</hi> coast abounds with islands, the largest of
                    which is <hi rend="italic">Hainan,</hi> which forms part of the prefecture of
                    <hi rend="italic">Keung-dhow Foo.</hi> This island extends for about 100 miles
                    from north to south, and the same distance from east to west. The southern and
                    eastern portions of <hi rend="italic">Hainan</hi> are mountainous, but on the
                    north there is a plain of some extent. Gold is found in the central part; and
                    sugar, cocoa nuts, betel nuts, birds’ nests, and agar agar, or sea vegetable,
                    are among the other products of the island. By the terms of the treaty <hi

                    and it is now about to be opened to trade. In the province of <hi rend="italic"

                    the value of the exports carried in foreign vessels during the year 1874
                    amounted to £4,672,128, and of imports to £1,985,701. The value of the imports
                    to <hi rend="italic">Swatow</hi> during the same period was £3,317,297, and of
                    the exports £1,310,321.</p>
                <p>The province of <hi rend="italic">Kwang-se</hi> is bounded on the N. by <hi

                    of 78,250 square miles, and its population is estimated at 7,313,895. The
                    provincial capital is <hi rend="italic">Kwei-ling Fοο,</hi> or City of the

                    finds its way to <hi rend="italic">Woο-chοw Foo,</hi> where it joins the waters
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Se-Keang.</hi> Another considerable river is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lew-Keang,</hi> or Willow River, which rises in the mountains
                    inhabited by the Meaou-tsze, in the district of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yung-tsung,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Kwei-cluow.</hi> Leaving its source it
                    takes a south-easterly direction, and enters <hi rend="italic">Kwang-se,</hi> in
                    the district of <hi rend="italic">Hwae-yuen.</hi> After encircling the city of
                    that name, it flows south as far as <hi rend="italic">Lexo-chvng Heen,</hi>
                    where it forms a junction with the <hi rend="italic">Lung-keang,</hi> or Dragon
                    River. Adopting the trend of this last-named stream, which has its head-waters
                    in <hi rend="italic">Yun-nan,</hi> the mingled flow passes eastward, and further
                    on in a south-easterly direction, by <hi rend="italic">Lew-chow Foo,</hi> IF <hi

                    it receives the waters of the <hi rend="italic">Se-keang,</hi> and thenceforth
                    changes its name for that of its affluent.</p>
                <p>The province of <hi rend="italic">Kwei-chow</hi> is bounded on the N. by <hi
                    rend="italic">Szechuen,</hi> on the E. by <hi rend="italic">Hoonan,</hi> on the
                    S. by <hi rend="italic">Kwang-se,</hi> and on the W. by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yun-nan.</hi> It contains 64,554 square miles, and has a population of about
                    5,288,219. <hi rend="italic">Kwei-yang Foo</hi> is the provincial capital, and
                    besides this there are eleven prefectural cities in the province. With the
                    exception of plains in the neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic">Kwei-yang
                    Foo,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ta-Ung</hi><hi rend="italic">Foo,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Tsun-e Foο,</hi> in the central and northern regions, the province
                    may be described as mountainous. But the very disturbed state in which it has
                    been for many years makes it difficult to gain much information about it. The
                    mountain ranges in the south are largely inhabited by Meaou-tsze, who are the
                    original owners of the soil, and who have been goaded into a state of rebellion·
                    by the oppression to which they have been subjected by the Chinese officials. To
                    this disturbing cause has been added also another by the spread of the Mahometan
                    rebellion of <hi rend="italic">Yuιwιan</hi> into some of the south-western
                    districts of the province. The devastating effects of these civil wars have been
                    most disastrous to the trade and the prosperity of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kwei-chow.</hi> The climate is by nature unhealthy, the supply of running water
                    being small, and that of stagnant water, from which arises a very fatal malaria,
                    being considerable; but it is at the present time rendered still more dangerous
                    by the number of corpses which are left to putrefy in the fields. The
                    agricultural products of the province are very limited, and its chief wealth
                    lies in its minerals. Copper, silver, lead, and zinc are· found in considerable
                    quantities, and as regards quicksilver, <hi rend="italic">Kwei-chow</hi> is
                    probably the richest country in the world. It has been from of old the chief
                    product of the province, and the belt in which it occurs extends through the
                    whole province from south-west to north-east. One of the principal mining
                    districts is <hi rend="italic">Kae Chow,</hi> in the prefecture of <hi
                    rend="italic">Kwei-yang Foo,</hi> and this district has the advantage of being
                    situated near <hi rend="italic">Wang-ping Chow,</hi> from which place it can be
                    conveniently and cheaply shipped to <hi rend="italic">Hankow.</hi> Cinnabar,
                    realgar, orpiment, and coal form the rest of the mineral products of <hi
                    rend="italic">Kwei-chow.</hi> Wild silk is another valuable article of export.
                    It is chiefly manufactured in the prefecture of <hi rend="italic">Tsun-e
                    Foo,</hi> where three kinds are produced. The first quality, the trade in which
                    is estimated at about 500,000 taels a year, is chiefly exported to <hi
                    rend="italic">Shen-se, Shan-se,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Peking,</hi> while
                    some finds its way to <hi rend="italic">Seang-tan</hi> and so into <hi
                    rend="italic">Kwang-se.</hi> The inferior kinds are locally consumed.</p>
                <p>The province of <hi rend="italic">Yun-nan,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> South of
                    the Clouds,” is bounded on the N. by <hi rend="italic">Sze-chuen,</hi> on the E.
                    by <hi rend="italic">Kwei-chow</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kwang-se,</hi> on the
                    S. by Burmah and the Lao tribes, and on the W. by Burmah and Tibet. It occupies
                    an area of 107,969 square miles, but though thus the second largest province of
                    the empire, its population is estimated at only 5,561,320, and probably this
                    number is at the present time, in consequence of the long continuance and
                    violent extinction of the Panthay rebellion, excessive. The greater part of the
                    province may be said to consist of an extensive plateau, containing numerous
                    valley plains, which is divided in the northern portion by mountain ranges that
                    enter at the north-west corner of the province and separate the waters of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Kin-sha-keang,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Meikοn,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Salwein.</hi> Besides <hi rend="italic">Yumnan Foo,</hi> the
                    capital, the province contains twenty prefectural cities, several of which— <hi
                    rend="italic">Tung-chuen Foo, Yun-nan Fοo, Ta-le Foο, Yung-dhang Foo, Tsoο-heung
                    Foo,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ling-gan Fοο,</hi> for example—are situated in
                    the valley plains just spoken of. The principal rivers are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meikοn,</hi> which traverses the province from north to south on its way to the
                    China Sea through Anam; the <hi rend="italic">Salwein,</hi> which runs a
                    parallel course through its western portion; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kin-sha-keang,</hi> which runs first in a south-east and then in an easterly
                    direction through the north of the province; and the headwaters of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Songka,</hi> which takes its rise in the southeastern part of the
                    province. This last-named river forms a navigable communication from <hi
                    rend="italic">Yun-nan</hi> to the Gulf of <hi rend="italic">Tσng-king</hi> where
                    it empties itself into the sea. The navigation commences at <hi rend="italic"
                    >Μan-haou,</hi> a town only ten days’ journey from <hi rend="italic">Yun-nan
                    Foο,</hi> and it thus affords an easy outlet for the mining districts of eastern
                    and southern <hi rend="italic">Yun-τιan.</hi> There are two large lakes in the
                    province, —one in the neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic">Τα</hi><hi

                    measures from 70 to 80 miles in circumference. Several important roads intersect
                    the province, the chief of which are—1. The road from <hi rend="italic">Yun-nan

                    >Kwang-se,</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi> west river, a land journey
                    which occupies about twenty days. From this point the river furnishes in quiet
                    times an easy communication with <hi rend="italic">Canton,</hi> but of late,
                    owing to the disturbed condition of <hi rend="italic">Kwang-se,</hi> this route
                    has been little used. The agricultural products of the province are fully
                    sufficient to supply the wants of the inhabitants, but its chief wealth lies in
                    the minerals with which it abounds. On this subject Baron von Richthofen says,
                    “We are now in an extremely remarkable region, which is highly worthy a detailed
                    examination, because a great variety and quality of metalliferous deposits are
                    distributed throughout its extent. The country so distinguished comprehends
                    nearly the whole of <hi rend="italic">Yun-nan,</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ta-kwanting</hi> in the north to <hi rend="italic">Po-urh Foo</hi> in the
                    south, and from the eastern boundary of the province to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tăng-yuë Chow</hi> (Momien) in the west. Besides, it extends across the <hi
                    rend="italic">Yang-tsze,</hi> and comprises the whole department of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ning-yuen Foo,</hi> till <hi rend="italic">Tsing-ke Heen,</hi> a
                    district of <hi rend="italic">Ya-chow Foo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in
                    the east, the district of <hi rend="italic">Wd-ning Chow</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Kwei-chow.</hi> There are no positive indications to show that the
                    metalliferous region extends beyond those limits to the south, west, and north,
                    but this is different as regards the direction to the east, or rather
                    north-east. I have had several statements given me concerning the occurrence of
                    ores of copper and silver through a large portion of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kwei-chow</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but as no mines are worked outside of
                    <hi rend="italic">Wedning Chow,</hi> the statement cannot be considered as
                    proved. It is, however, a remarkable fact, that immediately adjoining the
                    metalliferous region of <hi rend="italic">Yun-nan</hi> to the north-east,
                    commences a belt distinguished by the occurrence of quicksilver and its ores. It
                    extends through the whole width of the province of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kwevdhow.</hi> Quicksilver is found only in this belt, and not in <hi
                    rend="italic">Yunman.”</hi></p>
                <p>Silver and gold are among the metals produced in <hi rend="italic">Yun-nan,</hi>
                    but they are not known to exist in any large quantities. Lead is of frequent
                    occurrence in the province, and indeed the area through which copper, silver,
                    lead, tin, and zinc are distributed in sufficient quantities to make mining
                    answer, comprises at least 80,000 square miles. The ores are generally of good
                    quality, and are so deposited as to be easy of extraction. Tea from <hi
                    rend="italic">Po-urh Foo,</hi> in southern <hi rend="italic">Yun-nan,</hi> which
                    is well known and appreciated throughout the empire; opium of an inferior
                    quality; medicines in the shape not only of herbs and roots, but also of fossil
                    shells, bones, teeth, and various products of the animal kingdom; and precious
                    stones, principally jade and rubies, are among the other exports from <hi
                    rend="italic">Yun-nan.</hi></p>
                <p>The imperial province of <hi rend="italic">Shing-king,</hi> in southern
                    Manchuria, is bounded on the N. by Mongolia and <hi rend="italic">TsdtsL
                    har</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> on the E. by the newly-acquired Russian
                    province of Ámoor, the Sea of Japan, and Corea; on the S. by Corea, the Yellow
                    Sea, and the Gulf of Leaou-tung; and on the W. by Mongolia. It occupies an area
                    of 43,000 square miles, and contains a population of 6,000,000. Its capital city
                    is <hi rend="italic">Moukden</hi> (41° 40' N. lat., 130° 30' E. long.) or, as it
                    is otherwise known, <hi rend="italic">Shing-king,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi>
                    the Flourishing Capital,” or <hi rend="italic">Shin-yang</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and besides this it has one other prefectural city, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">Kim-chow Foo.</hi> The surface of the province is divided between
                    plain and mountain, the latter feature largely predominating. A line drawn from
                    <hi rend="italic">King-dhow Foo</hi> (41° 12' N. lat., 121° 10' E. long.)
                    north-east to <hi rend="italic">Moukden,</hi> and then south by west through <hi
                    rend="italic">Leaou-yang</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hai-dhing</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">Kai-chow</hi> and the sea, would define the level country, the
                    rest of the province consisting of mountains intersected with valleys. A large
                    portion of the plain being an alluvial deposit is extremely fertile, but in the
                    neighbourhood of the sea that saline exudation so common in the north of China
                    renders futile all attempts at cultivation. To the north and east of this
                    district run numerous mountain ranges, for the most part in a
                    north-and-southerly direction. The climate of <hi rend="italic">Shing-king</hi>
                    is marked by extremes of heat and cold. In summer the temperature varies from
                    70° to 90°, and in winter from 50° above to 10° below zero. The mountain scenery
                    is extremely picturesque, and the trees and shrubs are such as are common in
                    England, the mountain ash being the only common English tree which is there
                    conspicuous by its absence. The most important rivers are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leaou-ho</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ta-yang-ho.</hi> The former takes its
                    rise in Mongolia, and after running an easterly course for about 400 miles,
                    turns in a south-westerly direction, and empties itself into the Gulf of <hi
                    rend="italic">Leaou-tung,</hi> in the neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ying-tsze,</hi> up to which town, 20 miles from the bar, the river is navigable
                    for large junks. The <hi rend="italic">Ta-yang-ho</hi> rises in the mountains to
                    the south of the plain, and empties itself into the Yellow Sea. The principal
                    roads through the province are—1st, The imperial highway from <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi></p>
                <p>Far reaching as is the history of China, it yet fails to give us any account of
                    the origin of the Chinese race. Its first page begins by describing the nucleus
                    of the nation as a little horde of wanderers, roving among the forests of
                    Shan-se, without houses, without clothing, without fire to dress their victuals,
                    and subsisting on the spoils of the chase, eked out with roots and insects.
                    Investigation, however, has proved beyond doubt that these wanderers were no
                    indigenous sons of the soil, but were strangers and pilgrims from other lands.
                    Some believe that their point of departure was in the region to the south-east
                    of the Caspian Sea, and that, having crossed the head waters of the Oxus, they
                    made their way eastward along the southern slopes of the Teen-shan. But however
                    this may <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n655/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0655-0642"/> be, it is plain that as they journeyed they
                    struck on the northern course of the Yellow River, and that they followed its
                    stream, on the eastern bank, as it trended south as far as Tung-kwan, and that
                    then, turning with it due eastward, they established small colonies on the
                    fertile plains of the modern province of Shan-se. But though these immigrants
                    were for the moment wanderers they brought with them habits of settled labour.
                    Some traces are discernible which might possibly be accepted as evidences that
                    the Chinese had at one time a tendency to a nomadic rather than to an
                    agricultural state of existence. In the <hi rend="italic">Book of Historical
                    Documents</hi> the governors of the province are called “pastors” and
                    “herdsmen,” and Mencius speaks of princes generally as “pastors of men.” It is
                    impossible also to overlook the identity of outline between the Chinese house
                    and the sweeping roof supported by poles of the Tatar tent; and it is said that
                    when Jengiz Khan in his invasion of China took a city, his soldiers immediately
                    set about pulling down the four walls of the houses, leaving the overhanging
                    roofs supported by the wooden columns,—by which process they con verted them
                    into excellent tents for themselves and their horses. To some extent it may be
                    said, too, that the language countenances this belief, since many common words
                    find their expression in characters of which the hieroglyphics for sheep and
                    cattle form part. For instance, we find that the character ∣⅞, meaning
                    truthfulness, uprightness, is composed of the two parts, and , or “my sheep,”
                    thus apparently pointing to a time when the ownership of flocks was a common
                    cause of dispute; the same is the case also with the character <hi rend="italic"
                    >cho,</hi> “right,” which is made up of f}, <hi rend="italic">Tsze,</hi> “one’s
                    own,” and î£, <hi rend="italic">yang,</hi> “sheep,” and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tseang,</hi> “to examine and judge clearly,” which is composed of ^g, <hi
                    rend="italic">yen,</hi> “words,” or to talk, and “sheep,” which would indicate
                    that the first idea of a judicial examination arose out of wranglings about
                    sheep. But notwithstanding these apparent evidences in favour of the Chinese
                    having been originally a nomadic rather than an agricultural people, it becomes
                    abundantly evident from the earliest records they possess that at all events,
                    immediately on their arrival in China, they settled down as agriculturists. They
                    cultivated grain for their sustenance, and flax, which they wove into garments.
                    They knew the value of silk-worms and planted the mulberry tree; they developed
                    trade, and established fairs at certain centres in their districts. Neither were
                    they destitute of the elements of intellectual culture. They had some knowledge
                    of astromony, and in all probability they brought with them an acquaintanceship
                    with hieroglyphic writing; at all events, at a very early period, we hear of <hi
                    rend="italic">E Yin</hi> (1743-1710 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), presenting
                    a petition in writing to the king, and there is no surer ground for the belief
                    that knotted cords were in use among them before writing was invented than there
                    is for the legend, that the forms of the characters were first suggested to
                    Tsang-Këĕ by the marks on the back of a tortoise.</p>
                <p>The possession of these habits and acquirements gave the immigrants a great
                    advantage over the nations of the land. As they advanced they found the country
                    inhabited by “fiery dogs” on the north, “great bowmen” in the east, “the
                    ungovernable vermin” on the south, and the “mounted warriors” on the west.
                    Differing <hi rend="subscript"> fc</hi> in language, as also in every other
                    respect, from the invaders, these tribes became their natural enemies, but they
                    were unable to stand against the “black-haired race.” During the first centuries
                    after the establishment of a regular system of government we hear of them now as
                    common enemies of the Chinese, and now as temporary allies of one or another of
                    the states into which the growing kingdom was divided. But by degrees they drop
                    out of the history of the empire. Step by step they were driven back into the
                    less inhabited parts; whole tribes were transported, others were annihilated,
                    until but a small remnant was left. These wanderers sought and found refuge from
                    their enemies in the mountainous regions of Kwei-chow and Kwang-se, where their
                    descendants, the Meaou-tsze, still maintain themselves against the forces of
                    China.</p>
                <p>It was an ancient belief of Chinese writers that there had existed a period of
                    2,267,000 and odd years between the time when the powers of Heaven and Earth
                    first united to produce man as the possessor of the soil of China, and the time
                    of Confucius. This having been accepted as a fact, it became necessary for the
                    early historians to invent long lines of dynastic rulers to fill up the gap
                    between the creation and the period with which the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Historical Documents</hi> commences. Accordingly, we find a series of ten epochs
                    described as preceding the Chow dynasty. The events connected with most of these
                    are purely fabulous, and it is not until we come down to the eighth period that
                    we can trace any glimmer, however obscured, of history. This, we are told,
                    commenced with the reign of Yew-chaou She (the Nest-having), who, if such a man
                    ever existed, was probably one of the first of those who, as the immigrants
                    increased and multiplied, was chosen to direct their counsels and to lead their
                    armies. This chief induced them to settle within the bend of the Yellow River,
                    the site of the modern province of Shan-se, and taught them to make huts of the
                    boughs of trees. Under the next chief, Suy-jin She (the Fire-producer), the
                    grand discovery of fire was effected by the accidental friction of two pieces of
                    dry wood. He taught the people to look up to <hi rend="italic">Teen,</hi> the
                    great creating, preserving, and destroying power; and he invented a method of
                    registering time and events, by making certain knots on thongs or cords twisted
                    out of the bark of trees. Next to him followed Yung-ching She, and then Fuh-he,
                    who separated the people into classes or tribes, giving to each a particular
                    name, discovered iron, appointed certain days to show their gratitude to heaven,
                    by offering the first-fruits of the earth, and invented the eight diagrams which
                    serve as the foundation of the Yïh-king. Fuh-he reigned 115 years, and his tomb
                    is shown at Chin-choo, in the province of Shen-se, at this day. His successor,
                    Chin-nung, invented the plough; and from that moment the civilization of China
                    proceeded by rapid and progressive steps.</p>
                <p>As the early history of every ancient people is more or less vitiated by fable,
                    we ought not to be more fastidious or less indulgent towards the marvellous in
                    that of China, than we are towards Egyptian, Greek, or Roman history. The main
                    facts may be true, though the details are incorrect; and though the accidental
                    discovery of fire may not have happened under Suy-jin She, yet it probably was
                    first communicated by the friction of two sticks, which at this day is a common
                    method among almost all savages of producing fire. Nor is it perhaps strictly
                    correct that Fuh-he made the accidental discovery of iron, by having burnt a
                    quantity of wood on a brown earth, any more than that the Phoenicians discovered
                    the mode of making glass by burning green wood on sand; yet it is not improbable
                    that some such processes first led to these discoveries. And if it be objected
                    against the history, that the reign of 115 years exceeds the usual period of
                    human existence, this after all is as nothing, when compared with the
                    contemporaneous ones recorded in biblical history. Thus, also, considerable
                    allowances are to be deducted from the scientific discoveries of Chin-nung in
                    botany, when we read of his having in one day discovered no less than seventy
                    different species of plants that were of a poisonous nature, and seventy others
                    that were antidotes against their baneful effects.</p>

                <p>The next sovereign, Hwang-te, was a usurper; but during his reign the Chinese are
                    stated to have made a very rapid progress in the arts and conveniences of
                    civilized life; and to his lady, Se-ling-she, is ascribed the honour of having
                    first observed the silk produced by the worms, of having unravelled their
                    cocoons, and of having worked the fine filaments into a web of cloth. The tomb
                    of Hwang-te is also preserved to this day in the province of Shen-se.</p>
                <p>But with the reign of Yaou (2356 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> we emerge to
                    some extent from the mist which hangs over the earlier records of China. Here
                    Confucius takes up the strain, and though his narrative will not bear criticism
                    it yet furnishes us with some historical data. The character of Yaou and his
                    successor Shun have been the theme of every writer on history from the time of
                    Confucius downwards. So strong was the force of the examples they set that
                    virtue pervaded the land, crime was unknown, and the nation increased in size
                    and prosperity. During the reign of Yaou the empire extended from 23° to 40° N.
                    lat., and from the 6th degree of longitude west from Peking to the 10th degree
                    east. He established his capital at Ke-choo in Shan-tung, and established marts
                    and fairs throughout the land. After his death he was succeeded by Shun, who for
                    some years had shared with him the responsibilities of government. It was during
                    this period that the “Great” Yu was employed to drain off the waters of the
                    flood which had visited the north of China in consequence, probably, of one of
                    the numerous changes in the course of the YeŪow River. This work he accomplished
                    after having expended nine years’ labour upon it, and as a reward for this and
                    other services he was raised to the throne on the death of Shun. After him
                    succeeded a number of rulers, each one less qualified to govern than the last,
                    until one Këĕ (1818 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> ascended the throne. In this
                    man were combined all the worst vices of kings. He was licentious, cruel,
                    faithless, and dissolute. From such a one Heaven withdrew her protection. The
                    people rose against him, and having swept away all traces of him and his bloody
                    house, they proclaimed the commencement of a new dynasty, to be called the Shang
                    dynasty, and their leader, Tang, they named the first emperor of the new line
                    (1766 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). Aided by wise counsellors, this monarch
                    restored to the country some of its former prosperity. But the same fatality
                    which attended the descendants of Yu overtook also his successors. They became
                    self-indulgent and effeminate. They lost all hold on the affections of their
                    people, so that when Chow, aided and abetted by his consort Ta-ke, gave vent to
                    passions of a more than usually cruel and debased nature, they revolted, and
                    Woo-Wang ascended the throne as the first emperor of the Chow dynasty. Woo-Wang
                    was all that tradition represents the founders of dynasties to have been. He was
                    brave, talented, and virtuous, but he committed the mistake of dividing his
                    kingdom into seventy-two feudal states in order that he might bestow
                    principalities on his own relations and the descendants of former emperors. The
                    fatal result of this subdivision soon became obvious. Jealousies sprang up among
                    the princes, internecine wars raged unceasingly, and the allegiance of the
                    feudatories to the central authority became daily weakened. Nor were the enemies
                    of the empire confined to those within its borders, for, during the reign of Muh
                    Wang (936 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> we are told that the Tatars, of whom
                    we now hear for the first time, taking advantage of the confusion which reigned
                    within the limits of the empire, made predatory incursions into the states, and
                    though they were invariably driven off, yet from this time they remained a
                    constant source of danger and annoyance to the Chinese. Such was the state of
                    the empire, distracted by internal wars and harassed by the attacks of a foreign
                    foe, when Confucius was born (551 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), and though
                    the sage devoted his life to the promulgation of virtue and the right principles
                    of government, little or no heed was at the time paid to his remonstrances and
                    exhortations, and he died (475 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> in retirement, a
                    neglected and disappointed man. Neither did the efforts of Laou-tsze, who was a
                    few years senior to Confucius, or of Mencius, who succeeded him after an
                    interval of 107 years, meet with any better success. Disorder was rife
                    throughout the land, and the authority of the central Government was on the
                    wane.</p>
                <p>Signs now began to appear foreshadowing the fall of the dynasty. During the reign
                    of Wei-lëĕ Wang, the bra∕° <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi>. vessels upon which Yu
                    had engraved the different provinces of the empire were observed to shake
                    violently and shortly afterwards a mountain fell across the stream of the Yellow
                    River causing a wide-spread inundation. As the empire became weakened by
                    internal dissensions so much the more did the power of the neighbouring states
                    increase. Of these the most important was that of Thsin, on the north-west,
                    which, when it became evident that the kingdom of Chow must fall to pieces, took
                    a prominent part in the wars undertaken by Tsoo on the south and Tsin on the
                    north for the coveted prize. But the struggle was an unequal one. The
                    superiority of Thsin in point of size, and in the number of fighting-men at its
                    command, carried all before it, and in 255 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Chaou-seang Wang, having silenced his rivals, possessed himself of the imperial
                    states. Thus fell the Chow dynasty, during the existence of which the empire may
                    have said to have been extended from the 33d to the 38th parallels of latitude,
                    and from the 106th to the 119th degree of longitude, that is to say, it included
                    the southern portions of the province of Chih-li, Shan-se, and Shen-se, the
                    northern portions of Ho-nan and Keang-soo, and the western half of Shan-tung.
                    The capital was fixed at Chang-gan Heen in Shen-se. But though virtually
                    emperor, Chaou-seang Wang abstained from adopting the imperial title, and he
                    died in 251 B.c., leaving his son Heaou-wăn Wang to succeed him. Scarcely was
                    this sovereign seated on the throne when he was attacked with a fatal illness,
                    and after a reign of but three days he became “a guest in heaven,” and
                    Chang-seang Wang his son reigned in his stead. The only title to fame possessed
                    by this monarch was that he was the father of one of the greatest rulers China
                    has ever had. As he was himself a man of no mark, it was probably fortunate for
                    the country that he occupied the throne for only three years, and at the end of
                    that time (246 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> he yielded up his earthly
                    honours to Che Hwang-te, “the first universal emperor.” This sovereign was but
                    thirteen years of age when he ascended the throne, but young as he was he
                    speedily made his influence everywhere felt. He chose Heen-yang, the modern
                    Se-gan Foo, as his capital, and built there a magnificent palace, which was the
                    wonder and admiration of his contemporaries. He constructed roads through the
                    empire, he formed canals and erected numerous and handsome public buildings.
                    Having by these and other means settled the internal affairs of his kingdom, he
                    turned his attention to the enemies beyond his frontier. Chief among these were
                    the Heung-noo Tatars, whose attacks had for years kept the Chinese and
                    neighbouring principalities in a state of disquiet. Against these foes he
                    marched with an army of 300,000 men and completely routed them, exterminating
                    those in the neighbourhood of China, and driving the rest into the mountains of
                    Mongolia. He had no sooner returned from this campaign than he was called upon
                    to face a formidable rebellion in Ho-nan, which had been set on foot by the
                    adherents of the feudal princes, all of whom he had dispossessed when he
                    reconstructed the empire on the monarchical principle. Against these rebels he
                    was as successful as he had been against the Heung-noo, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n657/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0657-0644"/> and as soon as peace was restored he marched
                    southwards to subdue the tribes on the south of the Nan-shan ranges, that is to
                    say the inhabitants of the modern provinces of Fuh-keen, Kwang-tung, and
                    Kwang-se. Having accomplished this vast undertaking, he returned to his capital
                    to administer the empire he had won, the limits of which were as nearly as
                    possible those of modern China proper. One monument remains to the present day
                    to bear witness to his enterprising energy. Finding that the northern states of
                    Thsin, Chaou, and Yen were building lines of fortification along their northern
                    frontier for protection against the incursions of the Heung-noo, he conceived
                    the idea of building one gigantic wall, which was to stretch across the whole
                    northern limit of the huge empire from the sea to the furthest western corner of
                    the modern province of Kan-suh. This work was begun under his immediate
                    supervision in 214 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but though it was
                    energetically proceeded with, he died before it was completed. Notwithstanding
                    all that he had done for the country he was very unpopular with the upper
                    classes. He was a reformer, and reformers were as distasteful to the Chinamen of
                    that time as to those of to-day, and schoolmen and pedants were for ever holding
                    up to the admiration of the people the heroes of the feudal times and the
                    advantages of the system they administered. This doctrine was full of danger to
                    the state, and Che Hwang-te therefore determined to break once and for all with
                    the past. To this end he ordered the destruction of all books having reference
                    to the past history of the empire. This decree was almost universally carried
                    out, and many scholars were put to death for failing in obedience to it. The
                    measure, however, widened the breach between the emperor and the upper classes,
                    and when, on his death, in 210 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> his son Urh-she
                    Hwang-te ascended the throne, the wide-spread discontent broke out into tumults.
                    Taking advantage of the confusion which thus arose, the princes who had been
                    dispossessed by Che Hwang-te again attempted to regain the thrones they had
                    lost. Unlike his father, Urh-she Hwang-te was quite unable to grapple with
                    troublous times. He was a weak and debauched youth, and was murdered after
                    having offered a feeble resistance to his enemies. His son Tsze-yung thereupon
                    surrendered himself to Lew Pang, one of the two generals, who at that time were
                    the leaders of the rebellion. Unfortunately, however, he afterwards fell into
                    the hands of Heang Yu, the other chieftain, who was as blood-thirsty as Lew Pang
                    was merciful, and who instantly put him to death along with all his family and
                    associates. The rivalry between these two chieftains broke out into open warfare
                    almost immediately after this event, on Heang Yu usurping to himself imperial
                    honours. For five years war raged between the two combatants, and at the end of
                    that time Lew Pang was left master of the field after a decisive battle before
                    Woo-keang, in which Heang Yu was slain. Lew Pang was then proclaimed emperor
                    (206 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> under the title of Kaou-te, and the new
                    line was styled the Han -dynasty.</p>
                <p>On ascending the throne Kaou-te established his capital -at Lo-yang in Ho-nan,
                    and afterwards removed it to Chang-gan in Shen-se. Having founded his right to
                    rebel on the oppressive nature of the laws promulgated by Che Hwang-te, he
                    abolished the ordinances of Thsin, with the exception of that referring to the
                    destruction of the books—for, like his great predecessor, he dreaded the
                    influence exercised by the <hi rend="italic">Literati</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> and he exchanged the worship of the gods of the soil of Thsin for that
                    of those of Han, his native state. His successor, however, gave every
                    encouragement to literature, and appointed a commission to restore as far as
                    possible the texts which had been destroyed by Che Hwang-te. In this the
                    commission was very successful. It was discovered that in many cases the law had
                    been evaded, and numerous books which had ceased to have any corporeal being
                    were found to exist on the tablets of the memories of scholars. This new period
                    of literary activity added to the general prosperity of the empire. There was
                    peace within its borders, and its frontiers remained unchallenged, except
                    occasionally by the Heung-noo, who suffered many and severe defeats at the hands
                    of the Chinese generals. Thwarted, therefore, in their attacks on China, these
                    incorrigible marauders turned their attention to the kingdom of Yuë-che, which
                    had grown up in the western extremity of Shen-se, and after much fighting drove
                    their victims along the Teen-shan nan-loo to modern Western Tartary, that is to
                    say, the territory between Turkestan and the Caspian Sea. This position of
                    affairs suggested to the emperor the idea of forming an offensive and defensive
                    alliance with the Yuĕ-che against the Heung-noo. With this object an ambassador
                    was sent to Western Tartary, who, after having been twice imprisoned by the
                    Heung-noo, returned with no more beneficial result than that his embassy was the
                    means of introducing silk into Europe. However, in 121 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> the reigning emperor, Woo-te, sent an expedition against the
                    Heung-noo, and completely defeated them. The conquered people tendered their
                    submission to the victors, and the Chinese established colonies, built towns,
                    and appointed governors in the vanquished provinces. From this time the power of
                    the Heung-noo began to wane. Dissension broke out among their different
                    chieftains, and in 93 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> they were completely driven
                    out of Eastern Asia, and the 3d century witnessed their flight into the district
                    north-east of the Caspian Sea, now occupied by the Kirghese, a broken and
                    impotent remnant. Few Chinese dynasties have lasted much more than two
                    centuries, and the first Han dynasty was no exception to the rule. About the
                    beginning of the Christian era a notable rebel, one Wang Mang, rose in revolt
                    against the infant successor of Ping-te (1 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> and
                    in 9 A.D. proclaimed himself emperor. He, however, at best only gained the
                    suffrages of a portion of the nation, and before long his oppressive acts
                    estranged even these supporters from him. In 23 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    Lew Sew headed a formidable rising against him and completely defeated him. He
                    was destined, however, to die by the hands of his followers. In a revolt of his
                    remaining troops his head was struck from his shoulders, and his body was torn
                    in pieces by his own soldiery.</p>
                <p>His opponent, Lew Sew, was now proclaimed emperor under the title of
                    Kwang-woo-te, and in consequence of his fixing on Lo-yang in Ho-nan as his
                    capital, the line of which he was the first emperor became known as the Eastern
                    Han dynasty. Within this period are embraced some of the most remarkable events
                    in the history of China. During the reign of his successor Ming-te, 65 A.D.,
                    Buddhism was introduced from India into China, and about the same time the
                    celebrated General Pan Chaou was sent on an embassy to the king of Shen-shen, a
                    small state of Turkestan, near the modem Pidjan. So successful was he in his
                    mission, that before long he added the states of Shen-shen, Khoten, Kuché, and
                    Kashgar as apanages to the Chinese crown. But in accordance with precedent,
                    after a time the glory of the dynasty became dimmed. Disturbances occurred in
                    the provinces, and, in 173, a virulent pestilence broke out which held
                    possession of the country for eleven years. A magical cure for this plague was
                    said to have been discovered by a Taouist priest named Chang Keo, who made so
                    good a use of his discovery that in a single month he had gained a sufficiently
                    large following to enable him to gain possession of the northern provinces of
                    the empire. He was, however, opposed and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0658-0645"/> defeated by Tsaou Tsaou, another aspirant to
                    imperial honours, whose son, Tsaou Pei, on the death of Heen-te (220 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> proclaimed himself emperor, adopting the title of
                    Wei as the appellation of his dynasty. But at the same time there were two other
                    Richmonds in the field, Lew Pei and Sun Keuen, and the strength of these three
                    adventurers were so nearly equal that they agreed to divide the empire between
                    them. Tsaou Pei, under the title of Wăn-te, ruled over the kingdom of Wei (220),
                    which occupied the whole of the central and northern portion of China. Lew Pei
                    established the Shuh Han dynasty in the modern province of Sze-chuen (221), and
                    called himself Chaou-lëĕ-te; and to Sun Keuen Khan fell the southern provinces
                    of the empire, from the Yang-tsze Keang south-wards, including the modern
                    Tonquin, which he formed into the kingdom of Woo with Nan-king for his capital,
                    and adopted for himself the imperial style of Ta-te (222 A.D.)</p>
                <p>But China during the period of the “Three Kingdoms” was a house divided against
                    itself. Rivalries, the seeds of which had been sown at the time of the partition
                    of territory, broke out more fiercely as soon as the courts were established.
                    Lew Pei, as a descendant of the house of Han, looked upon himself as the
                    rightful sovereign of the whole empire, and he despatched an army under the
                    command of the celebrated general Choo-ko Leang to support his claims. This army
                    was met by an opposing force under the Wei commander Sze-ma E, of whom Chinese
                    historians say that “he led armies like a god,” and who, by adopting a Fabian
                    policy, completely discomfited his adversary. But the close of this campaign
                    brought no peace to the country. Wars became chronic, and by degrees the reins
                    of power slipped out of the hands of emperors into those of their generals.
                    Foremost among these were the members of the Sze-ma family of Wei. Sze-ma E left
                    a son, Sze-ma Chaou, scarcely less distinguished than he was himself, and when
                    Sze-ma Chaou was gathered to his fathers his honours descended to Sze-ma Yen,
                    who, finding the county ripe for a change, deposed the ruling sovereign of Wei,
                    and proclaimed himself emperor of China (265 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> His
                    dynasty he styled the Western Tsin dynasty, and he adopted for himself the title
                    of Woo-te. The most noticeable event in this reign was the advent of the
                    ambassadors of the Emperor Theodosius in 284:. For some years the neighbouring
                    states appear to have transferred their allegiance from the House of Wei to that
                    of Tsin. But the condition of China at this time was such that no government
                    could stand unless administered by an able and powerful chief. Woo-te’s
                    successors failing to fulfil these conditions, the country soon fell again into
                    disorder. The Heung-noo, encouraged by the decadence of the Chinese power,
                    renewed incursions into the empire at the beginning of the 4th century, and in
                    the confusion which followed on these attacks from without as well as those that
                    were distracting the country from within, am adventurer named Lew Yuen
                    established himself (in íll) as emperor, first at Ping-yang in Shan-se and
                    afterwards in Lo-yang and Chang-gan. The history of this period is very chaotic.
                    Numerous states sprung up into existence, some founded by the Heung-noo, and
                    others by the Seen-pe tribe, a Tungusic clan inhabiting a territory to the north
                    of China, and who afterwards established the Leaou dynasty in China. The hand of
                    every man was against his neighbour. Nothing was lasting; and in 419 the Eastern
                    Tsin dynasty, which had dragged on a chequered existence for nearly a century,
                    came to an end, and with it disappeared for close on two hundred years all
                    semblance of united authority. The country became divided into two parts, the
                    north and the south. In the north four familles reigned successively, two of
                    which were of Seen-pe origin, viz., the Wei and the How Chυw <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> the other two, the Pih Tse and the How Leang, being
                    Chinese. In the south five different houses supplied rulers, who were all of
                    Chinese descent.</p>
                <p>This period of disorder was brought to a close by the establishment of the Suy
                    dynasty (590). Among the officials of the ephemeral dynasty of Chow was one Yang
                    Keen, who on his daughter becoming empress (578) was created; duke of Suy.
                    Meanwhile, he waited for an opportunity to overturn the reigning house, and, as
                    has so often happened in the history of China, he had not long to wait. The last
                    of the house of Chin was as weak and profligate as any of his predecessors. Him
                    Yang Keen deposed and immediately ascended the throne (590). The country, weary
                    of contention, was only too glad to acknowledge his undivided authority; and
                    during the sixteen years of his reign the internal affairs of China were
                    comparatively peaceably and prosperously administered. The emperor instituted a
                    new and improved code of laws, and showed his respect for literature by adding
                    5000 volumes to the 10,000 which composed the imperial library. Abroad, his
                    policy was equally successful. He defeated the Tatars and chastised the Coreans,
                    who were disposed to throw aside his authority. The only scene of disorder was
                    in his own household. His sons were unruly and violent, and after his death, in
                    604, his second son forced the heir to the throne to strangle himself, and then
                    instantly assumed the imperial yellow. At first this usurper, Yang-te, gave
                    himself up to every species of debauchery, but wearying of sensual lusts, he was
                    seized with a desire for conquest. He sent expeditions against the Tatars, and
                    regained some of the influence which had formerly belonged to China in Central
                    Asia. He himself headed an expedition against the Ouigours at the same time that
                    one of his generals annexed the Lew Kew Island to the imperial crown. During his
                    reign the volumes in the imperial library were increased to 54,000, and he spent
                    vast sums in erecting a magnificent palace at Lo-yang, and in constructing
                    unprofitable canals. These and other extravagances laid so heavy a burden on.
                    the country that discontent began again to prevail, and on the emperor’s return
                    from a successful expedition against, the Coreans, he found the empire divided
                    into rebellious factions. In the turmoil which followed General Le Yuen rose to
                    the surface, and on the death of the emperor by assassination this man set
                    Kung-te, the rightful heir, on the throne (617) until such time as he should
                    have matured his schemes. In the following year a dose of poison vacated the
                    throne, and Le Yuen forthwith assumed the imperial sceptre, and proclaimed
                    himself as Tai-tsung the first emperor of the Tang dynasty. At this time the
                    Turks were at the height of their power in Asia, and Tai-tsung was glad to
                    purchase their alliance with money as the Emperor Justinian had been in 558. But
                    divisions weakened the power of this mighty horde, and Tai-tsung, taking
                    advantage of the opportunity, regained much of tho position in Central Asia
                    which had formerly been held by China. In 640, Hamil, Turfan, and the rest of
                    the Ouigour territory were again included within the Chinese frontier, and four
                    military governorships were appointed in Central Asia, viz., at Kuché, Khoten,
                    Kharastan, and Kashgar. At the same time the frontier was extended as far as
                    Eastern Persia and the Caspian Sea. So great was now the fame of China, that
                    ambassadors from Nepaul, Magadha, Persia, and Rome (643) came to pay their court
                    to the Great Khan. Before this time, in 635, a Nestorian priest, O-lo-peen by
                    name, arrived from Rome, who so ingratiated himself with the emperor that he
                    built for him a church, and appointed twenty priests to perform the services.
                    Subsequently, on the death of Tai-tsung (649), we find the strange phenomenon of

                    as little else than slaves. On the accession of Kaou-tsung (650) his wife, Woo
                    How, gained supreme influence in the management of affairs, and on the death of
                    her husband in 683 she set aside his lawful successor, Chung-tsung, and took
                    possession of the throne. Nor was she unequal to the office she had usurped. She
                    governed the empire with discretion, and her armies defeated the Tibetans, who
                    had latterly gained possession of Kuché, Khoten, and Kashgar. Thus she
                    re-established the imperial government in the west, and her generals proved
                    themselves victorious over the Khitan in the north-east. On her death, in 705,
                    Chung-tsung partially left the obscurity in which he had lived during his
                    mother’s reign. But his wife, desiring to play a similar <hi rend="italic"
                    >role</hi> to that enjoyed by her mother-in-law, poisonbd him and set his son,
                    Juy-tsung (710), on the throne. This monarch, who was weak and vicious, reigned
                    but three years, and was succeeded by Yuen-tsung (713), who was in some respects
                    an enlightened and able prince. He busied himself with introducing reform into
                    the administration of the empire, and encouraged literature and learning with
                    wisdom and discretion. During his reign the king of Khokand applied to him for
                    aid against the Tibetans and Arabs, who were advancing to attack him. Yuen-tsung
                    promptly sent an army to his succour, and the aggressors were completely
                    defeated. In a war with the Khitans in the north-east he was not so successful;
                    and in the disorder which arose in consequence of the invasion of the northern
                    provinces by these formidable neighbours, General Gan Luh-shan, an officer of
                    Turkish descent, placed himself at the head of a revolt, and having secured
                    Tung-kwan on the Yellow River, advanced on Chang-gan. In this emergency the
                    emperor fled, and placed his son, Suh-tsung, on the throne (756). This sovereign
                    summoned to his aid the forces of the kings of Khoten and Khokand, of the state
                    of Bokhara, of the Ouigours, and of the Arabs, and with these allies he
                    completely defeated Gan Luh-shan and suppressed the rebellion. The promise held
                    out by this energetic beginning of his reign was not fulfilled by his later
                    career. He fell under the influence of the women and eunuchs of his harem, and
                    died unregretted in 762. During the following reigns the Tibetans made constant
                    incursions into the western provinces of the empire, and Tai-tsung (763-780),
                    was compelled to purchase the assistance of the Ouigours against those intruders
                    by giving a Chinese princess as wife to the Khan. At this epoch the eunuchs of
                    the palace succeeded in gaining an unwonted degree of power, and several of the
                    subsequent emperors fell victims to their plots.</p>
                <p>The history of this and the following century is for the most part a monotonous
                    record of feeble Governments, low and vicious intrigues, oppressions, and
                    rebellions. Almost the only relief in the constant rounds of these scenes
                    towards the close of the Tang dynasty was the iconoclastic policy of Woo-tsung
                    (841-847). Viewing the increase of monasteries and ecclesiastical establishments
                    as an evil, he abolished all temples, closed the monasteries and nunneries, and
                    sent the inmates back to their families. Foreign priests were subjected to the
                    same repressive legislation, and Christians, Buddhists, and Magi were bidden to
                    turn their faces westward in the direction of the places from whence they came.
                    With his death terminated also this policy. Buddhism again revived during the
                    reign of the Emperor E-tsung (860-874), who, having had the honour to discover a
                    bone of Buddha, brought it to the capital in great state. By constant internal
                    dissensions and outbreaks the empire became so weakened that the prince of Leang
                    found no difficulty in gaining possession of the throne, and in 907 he assumed
                    the imperial yellow with the title of Tai-tsoo, the first emperor of the later
                    Leang dynasty. Thus ended the Tang dynasty, which is regarded as being the
                    Golden Age of literature.</p>
                <p>Five dynasties, viz., the Later Leang, the Later Tang, the Later Tsin, the Later
                    Han, and the Later Chow followed each other in quick succession between the
                    years 907 and 960. But though the monarchs of these lines nominally held sway
                    over the empire, their real power was confined to very narrow limits. The
                    disorders which were rife during the time when the Tang dynasty was tottering to
                    its fall fostered the development of independent states, and so arose Leang in
                    Ho-nan and Shan-tung, Ke in Shen-se, Hwai-nan in Keang-nan, Chow in Szechuen and
                    parts of Shen-se and Hoo-kwang, Woo-yuĕ in Chδ-keang, Tsoo and King-nan in
                    Hoo-kwang, Ling-nan in Kwang-tung, and the Ouigours in Tangout.</p>
                <p>A partial end was made to this recognized disorganization when, in 960, General
                    Chaou Kwang-yin was proclaimed by acclamation of the army emperor in succession
                    to the youthful Kung-te, who was compelled to vacate the throne to make way for
                    his quondam lieutenant. The circumstances of the time justified the exchange. It
                    required a strong hand to weld together again the different parts into which the
                    empire had been divided, and to resist the attacks of the Khitan Tatars, whose
                    rule at this period extended over the whole of Manchuria and Leaou-tung. Against
                    these aggressive neighbours Tai-tsoo né Chaou Kwang-yin directed his best
                    efforts with varying success, and he died in 976, while the war was still being
                    waged. His son Tai-tsung (976-997) entered on the campaign with energy, but in
                    the end was compelled to conclude a peace with the Khitans. His successor,
                    Chin∙tsung (997- 1022), descended a step lower in his dealings with them, and
                    agreed to pay them a tribute to induce them to abstain from their incursions.
                    Probably this tribute was not sent regularly; at all events, under Jin-tsung
                    (1023-1064), the Khitans again threatened to invade the empire, and were only
                    persuaded to forego their intention by the emperor promising to pay them an
                    annual tribute of 200,000 taels of silver, besides a great quantity of silken
                    piece goods. Neither was this arrangement long binding, and so formidable were
                    the advances made by the Tatars in the next and following reign, that Hwuy-tsung
                    (1101-1126) invited the Neu-che Tatars to expel the Khitans from Leaou-tung. The
                    call was readily responded to; the service was effectually performed, but having
                    once possessed themselves of the country they declined to yield it to the
                    Chinese, and the result was that a still more aggressive neighbour was
                    established on the north eastern frontier of China. Without delay the Neu-che or
                    Kins, as they now styled themselves, overran the provinces of Chih-li, Shen-se,
                    Shan-se, and Ho-nan, and during the reign of Kaou-tsung (1127-1163) they
                    advanced their conquests to the line of the Yang-tsze Keang.</p>
                <p>It was during this period that the Mongols began to acquire power in Eastern
                    Asia, and about the beginning of the 12th century they invaded the north-western
                    frontier of China and the principality of Hea, which at that time consisted of
                    the modern provinces of Shen-se and Kansuh. To purchase the good-will of these
                    subjects of Jenghiz Khan the king of Hea agreed to pay them a tribute, and gave
                    a princess in marriage to their ruler. Hitherto the Mongols had been vassals of
                    the Kin Tatars, but the rapid growth of their power indisposed them to remain
                    tributaries of any monarch, and in consequence of a dispute with the Emperor
                    Wei-chaou Wang, Jenghiz Khan determined to invade the Kin province of
                    Leaou-tung. In this expedition he was aided by the followers of the Khitan
                    leader Yay-lu Tsoo-tsai, and in alliance with this general he captured
                    Leaou-yang the capital city. After an unsuc <pb break="no"

                    renewed the attack in the following year and completely defeated the Kins. In
                    the confusion which followed the emperor was murdered by his generals, and
                    Seuen-tsung ascended the throne. But the change of ruler brought no better
                    fortune to the Kin cause. Jenghiz Khan divided his armies into four divisions,
                    and made a general advance southwards. With resistless force his soldiers swept
                    over the provinces of Ho-nan, Chih-li, and Shan-tung, destroying in their course
                    upwards of ninety cities, and spreading desolation everywhere. It was their
                    boast that a horseman might ride without stumbling over the sites where those
                    cities had stood. Panic-stricken by the danger which threatened him, the emperor
                    moved his court to Kai-fung Foo, much against the advice of his ministers, who
                    foresaw the disastrous effect this retreat would have on the fortunes of Kin.
                    And now, as foes advanced, friends fell off from the tottering house. The state
                    of Sung, which up to this time had paid tribute, now declined to recognize Kin
                    as its feudal chief, and a short time afterwards declared war against its
                    quondam ally. Mean while, in 1215, Yay-lu Tsoo-tsai advanced into China by the
                    Shan-hai Kwan, and made himself master of Peking, which until then was one of
                    the few cities in Chih-li which remained to Kin. After this victory his nobles
                    wished him to proclaim himself emperor, but he refused, being mindful of an oath
                    which he had sworn to Jenghiz Khan. In 1216 Tung-kwan, a pass in the mountains
                    between the frontier of Ho-nan and Shen-se, which in the history of China has
                    been the scene of numerous dynastic battles, forming as it does the only gateway
                    between Eastern and Western China, was taken by the invaders. Year after year
                    the war dragged on, the resistance offered by the Kins growing weaker and
                    weaker. In 1220 Tse-nan Foo the capital of Shan-tung was taken, and five years
                    later Jenghiz Khan marched an army westward into Hea and completely conquered
                    the forces of the king; but it was not until the year following the king’s death
                    that he took possession of the principality. In the succeeding year Jenghiz Khan
                    himself was gathered to his fathers, and Ogdai his son reigned in his stead.</p>
                <p>Thus died at the age of 66 this great general, whose armies had triumphed
                    victoriously over the whole of Central Asia, from the Caspian Sea and the Indus
                    to Corea and the Yang-tsze Keang. With his dying breath he adjured his son to
                    complete the conquest of China, and with a view to this, the crowning desire of
                    his life, he declined to nominate either of the two eldest sons who had been
                    born to his Chinese wives as his heir, but choose rather his third son Ogdai
                    whose mother was a Tatar. On hearing of the death of Jenghiz Khan the Kins sent
                    an embassy to his successor desiring peace, but Ogdai, remembering the last
                    injunctions of his father, told them there would be no peace for them until
                    their dynasty should be overthrown. Up to this time the Mongols had been without
                    any code of laws. The old rule</p>
                <p>“That they should take who have the power, And they should keep who can,”</p>
                <p>was the maxim on which they guided their mutual intercourse, and the punishments
                    due for offences were left entirely to the discretion of the officials before
                    whom the culprits were tried. The consistency, however, which had been given to
                    the nation by the conquests of Jenghiz Khan made it necessary to establish a
                    recognized code of laws, and one of the first acts of Ogdai was to form such a
                    code. With the help also of Yay-lu Tsoo-tsai, he established custom houses in
                    Chih-li, Shan-tung, Shan-se, and Leaou-tung; and for this purpose divided these
                    provinces into ten departments. Meanwhile the war with the Kins was carried on
                    with energy. In 1230 Se∙gan Foo was taken, and sixty important posts were
                    captured. Two years later Too-le, brother of Ogdai, took Fung-tseang Foo and
                    Handlung Foo, in the flight from which last-named place 100,000 persons are said
                    to have perished. Following the course of the River Han in his victorious career
                    this general destroyed 140 towns and fortresses, and defeated the army of Kin at
                    Mount San-fung.</p>
                <p>In the following year the Mongol cause suffered a great loss by the death of
                    Too-le. This famous warrior left behind him twelve sons, two of whom, Mangu, the
                    firstborn, and Kublai, the fourth son, were destined to sit in succession on the
                    throne of their uncle Ogdai. But then-time was not yet. First of all they had to
                    win their spurs, and well did they prove by their deeds their right to the name
                    of Mongol or “daring.” In China, in Central Asia, and on the banks of the
                    Caspian they led their victorious armies. But meanwhile, in 1232, the Mongols
                    made an alliance with the state of Sung, by which, on condition of Sung helping
                    to destroy Kin, Ho-nan was to be the property of Sung for ever. The effect of
                    this coalition soon became apparent. Barely had the Kin emperor retreated from
                    Kaifung Foo to Joo-ning Foo in Ξo-nan when the former place fell into the hands
                    of the allies. Next fell Loyang, and the victorious generals then marched on to
                    besiege Joo-ning Foo. The presence of the emperor gave energy to the defenders,
                    and they held out until every animal in the city had been killed for food, until
                    every old and useless person had suffered death to lessen the number of hungry
                    mouths, until so many able-bodied men had fallen by the hand of the enemy that
                    the women manned the ramparts, and then the allies stormed the walls. Once
                    inside the town the inhabitants, enfeebled by starvation, fell ready victims to
                    their swords. The emperor, like another Sardanapalus, despairing now of success,
                    burned himself to death in his palace, that his body might not fall into the
                    hands of his enemies. For a few days the shadow of the imperial crown rested on
                    the head of his heir Changlin, but in a tumult which broke out amongst his
                    followers he lost his life, and with him ended the “Golden” dynasty, which from
                    that time disappeared from the country’s annals until the Manchoo family now
                    reigning came, nearly four centuries later, to claim the throne as heirs of the
                    defender of Joo-ning Foo.</p>
                <p>Although China was still by no means conquered, yet the extinction of the Kin
                    dynasty enabled Ogdai to send an army of 300,000 men to ravage the country
                    bordering on the Caspian Sea. But so vast were the resources at his command,
                    that he was able to despatch at the same time a force 600,000 strong into
                    Sze-chuen to subdue the power of Sung in that province. For, notwithstanding the
                    treaty which had been made between Ogdai and Sung, no sooner were the spoils of
                    Kin to be divided than fierce war broke out again between them, in prosecuting
                    which the Mongol armies swept over the provinces of Hoo-kwang, Keang-nan, and
                    Ho-nan, and were checked only when they reached the walls of Loo-chow Foo in
                    Gan-hwuy. Ogdai was not destined to live to see his sway acknowledged over the
                    whole empire. In 1241, he died at the age of fifty-six, having reigned thirteen
                    years, and was nominally succeeded by his grandson Cheliemen. But among the
                    numerous ladies who called Ogdai lord, was one named Toliekona, who on the death
                    of the emperor took possession of the throne, and after exercising rule for four
                    years, established her son Kwei-yew, as Great Khan. But in 1248 his life was cut
                    short, and the nobles, disregarding the claims of Cheliemen, proclaimed as
                    emperor Mangu, the eldest son of Too-le. Under this monarch the war against Sung
                    was carried on with energy, and Kublai, outstripping the bounds of Sung
                    territory, made his way into the province of Yun-nan, which at that time was
                    divided into a <pb break="no"

                    them to his brother’s crown he passed on into Tibet, Tonquin, and Cochin-China,
                    and from thence striking northwards entered the province of Kwang-se. On the
                    death of Mangu in 1259 Kublai ascended the throne, and never in the history of
                    China was the nation more illustrious, nor its power more widely felt, than
                    under his sovereignty. During the first twenty years of his reign Sung kept up a
                    resistance, gradually growing weaker and weaker, against his authority; and it
                    was not, therefore, until 1280 that he assumed complete jurisdiction as emperor
                    of China. At this time his authority was acknowledged “from the Frozen Sea,
                    almost to the Straits of Malacca. With the exception of Hindustan, Arabia, and
                    the westernmost parts of Asia, all the Mongol princes as far as the Dnieper
                    declared themselves his vassals, and brought regularly their tribute.” It was
                    during this reign that Marco Polo visited China, and he describes in glowing
                    colours the virtues and glories of the “Great Khan.” But though his rule was
                    characterized by discretion and munificence, his Chinese subjects were uneasy
                    under his yoke. He undertook public works, he patronized literature, and
                    relieved the distress of the poor, but still they never forgot that he was an
                    alien and a barbarian, and he died unregretted in 1294. His son had died during
                    his lifetime, and after some contention his grandson Timur ascended the throne
                    under the title of Yuen-ching. After an uneventful reign this prince was
                    gathered to his fathers in 1307, and as he left no son, Woo-tsung, a Mongol
                    prince, reigned in his stead. To him, succeeded Jin-tsung in 1311, who made
                    himself conspicuous by the honour he showed to the memory of Confucius, and by
                    distributing offices more equally between Mongols and Chinese than had hitherto
                    been done. This act of justice gave great satisfaction to the Chinese, and his
                    death ended a peaceful and prosperous reign in 1320. Three years later,—three
                    years of disorder,— his successor, Ying-tsung, was murdered by a band of
                    conspirators. From this time the star of the Yuen dynasty was in the descendant.
                    Tai-ting-te, Ming-tsung, Wăn-te, and Shun-te followed one another on the throne
                    in quick succession. Each reign was more troublous than the last, and in the
                    person of Shun-te (1333-1368) were summed up all the vices and faults of his
                    predecessors. Outbreaks, which up to his time had been local in their character,
                    assumed large and threatening proportions; and finally this descendant of
                    Jenghiz Khan was compelled to fly from his capital before Choo Yuen-chang, the
                    son of a Chinese labouring man. Deserted by his followers he sought refuge in
                    Ying-chang Foo, and there the last of the Yuen dynasty died. So disunited had
                    the empire become by constant disturbances and rebellions, that Choo Yuen-chang
                    met with little opposition to his forces, more especially as his first care on
                    becoming possessed of a district was to suppress lawlessness and to establish a
                    settled government. In 1355 he crossed the Yang-tsze Keang and captured
                    Nan-king, in consequence of which success he proclaimed himself duke of Woo, but
                    as yet he carefully avoided adopting any of the insignia of royalty. Even when
                    he had taken the capital and was the master of the empire thirteen years later,
                    he still professed to dislike the idea of assuming the imperial title. His
                    scruples, however, on this point were overcome, and he solemnly declared himself
                    emperor in 1368. Once seated upon the throne, he ingratiated himself with his
                    subjects by his generous treatment of his enemies, and by the regard he showed
                    for the welfare of his people. He carried his arms into Tatary, where he subdued
                    the last semblance of Mongol power in that direction, and then bent his steps
                    towards Leaou-tung. Here the Mongols defended themselves with the bravery of
                    despair, but nothing could resist the onslaught of the victorious Chinese, and
                    the conquest of this province left Hung-woo, as the founder of the new or Ming,
                    “Bright,” dynasty styled himself, without a foe in the empire. Beyond the
                    frontier of China he cultivated friendly relations with the rulers of the
                    neighbouring states. The king of Corea sent an embassy to congratulate him on
                    his accession, and the sovereign of the Lew-chew Islands sent his brothers and
                    sons to his court to be educated. As a quondam Buddhist priest he naturally lent
                    his countenance to that religion to the exclusion of Taouism, whose priests had
                    for centuries earned the contempt of all but the most ignorant by their
                    pretended magical arts and their search after the philosopher’s stone. In 1398,
                    and in the thirtieth year of his reign, Hung-woo was gathered to his fathers,
                    and Keen-wăn his grandson reigned in his stead. Aware that the appointment of
                    this youth—his father was dead—would give offence to the young emperor’s uncles,
                    Hung-woo dismissed them to their respective governments before death closed his
                    eyes. This, however, only delayed the storm. The prince of Yen, his eldest
                    surviving son, raised the banner of rebellion in his principality as soon as the
                    news reached him of his nephew’s accession, and after gaining several victories
                    over the armies of Keen-wăn he presented himself before the gates of Nanking,
                    the capitah Treachery opened the gates to him, and the emperor having fled in
                    the disguise of a monk, the victorious prince clothed himself in imperial yellow
                    and took the title of Yung-lo (1403). At home Yung-lo devoted himself to the
                    encouragement of literature and the fine arts, and, possibly from a knowledge
                    that Keen-wăn was among the Buddhist priests, he renewed the law prohibiting
                    Buddhism. Abroad he swept Cochin-China and Tonquin within the folds of his
                    empire and carried his arms into Tatary, where he made new conquests of waste
                    regions, and erected a monument of his victories. His death took place in 1425,
                    and he was in that year succeeded by his son Hung-ke.</p>
                <p>Hung-ke’s reign was short and uneventful. He did that which was right as far his
                    knowledge went. He strove to promote only such mandarins as had proved
                    themselves to be able and honest, and to further the welfare of the people.
                    During the reign of his successor, Seuen-tïh (1426-1436), the empire suffered
                    the first loss of territory since the commencement of the dynasty. Cochin-China
                    rebelled and gained her independence. But this was but the beginning of
                    troubles. The next emperor, Ching-tung (1436) was defeated and taken prisoner by
                    a Tatar chieftain, a descendant of the Yuen family named Ye-seen, who had
                    invaded the northern provinces. With unusual clemency the Tatar gave him his
                    life, though he kept him a close prisoner until the fortunes of war turned
                    against him. Having been completely defeated by a Chinese force from Leaou-tung,
                    Ye-seen liberated his captive, who returned to his capital amidst the rejoicings
                    of the people, again to occupy the throne which during his imprisonment (1450-
                    1457) had been held by his brother King-te. The two following reigns, those of
                    Ching-hwa (1465-1488) and of Hung-che (1488-1506) were quiet and peaceful. But
                    their successor Ching-tïh (1506-1522) was called upon to face a very formidable
                    insurrection headed by the prince of Ning. He was, however, victorious over the
                    rebel, who lost 30,000 men in the engagement which put an end to his hopes. The
                    disorder into which the empire had been thrown by this civil war encouraged the
                    foreign enemies of China. First of all from the dreaded north came a Tatar army
                    under Yen-ta in 1542, during the reign of Kea-tsing, which laid waste the
                    province of Shen-se, and even threatened the capital, and a little later a
                    Japanese fleet appeared off the coast and carried fire and sword through the
                    littoral provinces. Ill-blood had arisen between the <pb break="no"

                    had been driven out of Ningpo by force and not without bloodshed a few years
                    previously. Kea-tsing was not equal to such emergencies, and his death, which
                    took place in 1567, would have been an advantage to the empire, had his son been
                    a more able prince. But the only weapon Lung-king (1567-1573) was able to wield
                    against the Tatar Yen-ta was a bribe. He made him a prince of the empire, and
                    gave him certain commercial privileges, which were further supplemented by the
                    succeeding emperor Wan-leĭh (1573- 1620) by a grant of land in Shen-se. During
                    the reign of this sovereign, in the year 1592, the Japanese successfully invaded
                    Corea, and Taikosama, the emperor of Japan, was on the point of proclaiming
                    himself king of the peninsula, when a large Chinese force answering to the
                    invitation of the king, appeared on the field and completely routed the Japanese
                    army, at the same time that the Chinese fleet cut off their retreat by sea. In
                    this extremity the Japanese sued for peace, and sent an embassy to Peking to
                    arrange terms. But the peace was of short duration. In 1597 the Japanese again
                    invaded Corea and defeated the Chinese army which was sent against them, nor
                    were they less successful at sea. They destroyed the Chinese fleet and ravaged
                    the coast. Suddenly, however, when in the full tide of conquest, they evacuated
                    Corea, which again fell under the direction of China. Four years later Ricci
                    arrived at the Chinese court; and though at first the emperor was inclined to
                    send him out of the country, his abilities gradually won for him the esteem of
                    the sovereign and his ministers, and he remained the scientific adviser of the
                    court until his death in 1610. About this time the power which was destined to
                    overthrow the Ming dynasty began to grow restless. The Manchoo Tatars, goaded
                    into war by the injustice they were constantly receiving at the hands of the
                    Chinese, led an army into China in 1616 and completely defeated the force which
                    was sent against them. Three years later they were again victorious over the
                    Chinese, and they then gained possession of the province of Leaou-tung. This
                    final series of disasters was more than the emperor could bear, and he died of a
                    broken heart in 1620.</p>
                <p>In the same year Teen-ning, the Manchoo sovereign, having declared himself
                    independent, and possessed himself of Leaou-tung, moved the court to San-koo, to
                    the east of Moukden, which, five years later, he made his capital Meanwhile
                    Tai-chang, the son of Wan-leïh, ascended the Chinese throne, but barely had he
                    assumed the reins of power when he fell ill. Acting on the advice of his doctors
                    he drank of the liquor of immortality and died. The next emperor Teen-ke, after
                    a brief and troublous reign, followed him to the grave in 1627, and to him
                    succeeded Tsung-ching, the last emperor of the Ming dynasty. In his reign the
                    storm-clouds, which had been collecting for some years, burst over the empire.
                    In addition to the threatened danger on the north, rebel bands, enriched by
                    plunder, and grown bold by success, began to assume the proportion of armies.
                    They dominated over whole districts and provinces and paralyzed the imperial
                    forces by their energy and daring. Out of this seething mass of insubordination
                    two leaders showed themselves conspicuously. These were Le Tsze-ching and Shang
                    Ko-he. In order that there should be no dispute as to which should be greatest,
                    they decided to divide the empire between them, and to begin with it was agreed
                    that Shang should take possession of Sze-chuen and Hoo-kwang, and that Le should
                    make himself master of Ho-nan. Bent on this mission Le besieged Kaifung Foo, the
                    capital of the province, and so long and closely did he beleaguer it that in the
                    consequent famine human flesh was regularly sold in the market. At length an
                    imperial force came to raise the siege, with consequences as fatal to the
                    inhabitants as if the rebels had gained the city; for, fearful of meeting Le’s
                    army in the field, they cut through the dykes of the Yellow River, “China’s
                    Sorrow,” and flooded the whole country including the city. The rebels escaped to
                    the mountains, but upwards of 200,000 inhabitants perished in the flood, and the
                    city became a heap of ruins (1642). From Kaifung Foo Le marched against the
                    other strongholds of Honan and Shen-se, and was so completely successful that he
                    determined to attack Peking. A treacherous eunuch opened the gates to him, on
                    being informed of which the emperor committed suicide. When the news of this
                    disaster reached the general-commanding on the frontier of Manchoo Tatary, he,
                    in an unguarded moment, concluded a peace with the Manchoos, and invited them tσ
                    dispossess the rebel Le Tsze-ching. With ready acquiescence the Manchoos entered
                    China, and after defeating a rebel army sent against them, they marched towards
                    Peking. On hearing of the approach of the invaders, Le Tsze-ching, after having
                    set fire to the imperial palace, evacuated the city, but was overtaken, and his
                    force was completely routed. The object for which the Manchoos had been
                    introduced into the empire having now been accomplished, the Chinese wished them
                    to retire, but, like the Mongols, having once gained a footing in the empire,
                    they declared themselves unwilling to leave it, and having taken possession of
                    Peking they proclaimed the ninth son of Teen-ning emperor of China under the
                    title of Shun-che, and adopted the name of Ta-tsing, or “Great pure,” for the
                    dynasty (1644). Meanwhile the mandarins at Nanking had chosen an imperial prince
                    to ascend the throne. But with all the prestige of victory the Tatars bo∣e down
                    all opposition, and at this most inopportune moment “a claimant” to the throne,
                    in the person of a pretended son of the last emperor, appeared at court. This
                    additional complication still further reduced the Chinese power of acting. While
                    this contention prevailed inside Nanking the Tatar army appeared at the walls.
                    But there was no need for them to use force. The gates were thrown open, and
                    they took possession of the city without shedding a drop of blood. Following the
                    conciliatory policy they had everywhere pursued, they confirmed the mandarins in
                    their offices and granted a general amnesty to all who would lay down their
                    arms. As the Tatars entered the city the emperor left it, and after wandering
                    about for some days in great misery, he threw himself into the Yang-tsze Keang
                    and was drowned. Thus ended the Ming dynasty, and the empire passed again under
                    a foreign yoke.</p>
                <p>All accounts agree in stating that the Manchoo conquerors are descendants of a
                    branch of the family which gave the Kin dynasty to the north of China; and in
                    lieu of any authentic account of their early history, native writers have thrown
                    a cloud of fable over their origin. These tell us that in remote ages three
                    heaven-born virgins dwelt beneath the shadow of the Great White mountains, and
                    that while they were bathing in a lake which reflected in its bosom the
                    snow-clad peaks which towered above it, a magpie dropped a blood-red fruit on
                    the clothes of the youngest. This the maiden instinctively devoured, and
                    forthwith conceived and bore a son, whose name they called Ai-sin Ghioro, which
                    being interpreted is the “Golden Family Stem,” and which is the family name of
                    the present emperors of China. When his mother had entered the icy cave of the
                    dead, her son embarked on a little boat and floated down the River Hurka until
                    he reached a district occupied by three families who were at war with each
                    other. The personal appearance of the supernatural youth so impressed these
                    warlike chiefs that they forgot their enmities and hailed him as their ruler.

                    waxed fat, and at length, as we have seen, kicked against their oppressors, the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>This legend confirms the general belief that the original seat of the Manchoos
                    was in the valley of the Hurka, a river which flows into the Sungari in about
                    46° 20' N^. lat,, and 129° 50' E. long. Under a succession of able and hardy
                    chiefs they added land to land and tribe to tribe, until, in the 16th century,
                    we find them able to cope with, and in a position to demand favourable terms by
                    treaty from, their Chinese neighbours. As they became more powerful their
                    complaints became louder against acts of aggressive oppression which they laid
                    at the door of the Mings. But who will say that the fault was all on one side?
                    Doubtless the Mings tried to check their ambition by cruel reprisals— a mistaken
                    policy common to oppressors who find themselves with waning powers in the
                    presence of growing discontent. But if we are to square the account, against
                    this must be put numerous Manchoo raids into Leaou-tung, entailing loss of life
                    and property on the subjects of China. And the ready rapidity with which these
                    Manchurian horsemen swept round the corner of the Great Wall into China proper
                    on the fatal invitation of the Chinese general shows that they were neither
                    unwilling nor unaccustomed to wander beyond their own frontiers.</p>
                <p>But the accession to the throne of the Emperor Shun-che did not by any means at
                    first restore peace to the country. In Keang-se, Fuh-keen, Kwang-tung, and
                    Kwangse the adherents of the Ming dynasty defended themselves vigorously but
                    unsuccessfully against the invaders, while the pirate Ching Che-tung, the father
                    of the celebrated Koxinga, kept up a predatory warfare against them on the
                    coast. On one occasion he was bought over to the Tatar camp and accepted a
                    princess as a reward for his conversion, but he soon returned to his former
                    allegiance, only, however, once again to prove himself a turn-coat. Finding him
                    too formidable as a foe the Tatars determined again to gain his alliance. A
                    general’s command proved too tempting a bait to the buccaneer to be refused. He
                    accepted the offer and went on shore to visit the Tatar commander, who received
                    him with all civility. But when the pirate wished to return to his ships he was
                    politely urged to visit Peking. Once there he was thrown into prison, where he
                    died shortly afterwards. His son Koxinga, warned by his father’s example,
                    determined to leave the mainland and to seek an empire elsewhere. His choice
                    fell on Formosa, and having driven the Dutch out of the island, he established
                    himself as king and held possession of the island until the reign of Kang-he,
                    when he resigned in favour of the Imperial Government. Meanwhile a prince of the
                    house of Ming was proclaimed emperor in Kwang-se, under the title of Yung-leïh.
                    But the Tatars having reduced the provinces of Fuh-keen and Keang-se, and having
                    taken Canton after a siege of eight months, marched against and so completely
                    routed his followers that he was compelled to fly to Pegu. There he remained for
                    some years until, believing that his adherents in Yun-nan and Kwei-chow were
                    sufficiently numerous to justify his raising his standard in those provinces, he
                    crossed the frontier and. advanced to meet the imperial forces. On this as on
                    the former occasion, fortune declared against him. His army was scattered to the
                    four winds, and he was taken prisoner and strangled. Gradually opposition to the
                    new regime became weaker and weaker, and the shaved head with the pig tail—the
                    symbol of Tatar sovereignty—became more and more universally adopted. In 1651
                    died Ama Wang, the uncle of Shun-che, who had acted as regent during his
                    nephew’s minority, and the emperor then assumed the government of the state.
                    Little is known of this monarch.</p>
                <p>He appears to have taken a great interest in science, and to have patronized Adam
                    Schaal, a German Jesuit, who was at that time resident at Peking. It was during
                    his reign (1656) that the first Russian embassy arrived at the capital, but as
                    the envoy declined to kowtow before the emperor he was sent back without having
                    been admitted to an audience. After an unquiet reign of seventeen years Shun-che
                    was gathered to his fathers (1661), and Kang-he, his son, reigned in his stead.
                    This emperor was as renowned as his father had been unknown. He was
                    indefatigable in administering the affairs of the empire, and at the same time
                    he devoted much of his time to literary and scientific studies under the
                    guidance of the Jesuits. The dictionary of the Chinese language, published under
                    his superintendence, proves him to have been as great a scholar as his conquests
                    over Eleuths shows him to have been famous as a general. During one of his
                    hunting expeditions to Mongolia he caught a fatal cold, and he died in 1721
                    after a glorious reign of sixty years. Under his rule Tibet was added to the
                    empire, which extended from the Siberian frontier to Cochin-China, and from the
                    China Sea to Turkestan. Almost the only national misfortune that visited China
                    while he sat upon the throne was an earthquake at Peking, in which 400,000
                    people are said to have perished.</p>
                <p>Kang-he was succeeded by Yung-ching, who, reaping the benefits of his father’s
                    vigorous administration, enjoyed a peaceable reign, though a short one. He died
                    in 1735, and Keen-lung his son reigned in his room. Ambitious and warlike, this
                    monarch despised the conciliatory measures by which his father had maintained
                    peace with his neighbours. On but a slight provocation, he marched an army into
                    Hi, which he converted into a Chinese province, and he afterwards added eastern
                    Turkestan to the far-reachjng territories of China Twice he invaded Burmah, and
                    once he penetrated into Cochin-China, but in neither country were his arms
                    successful. He is accused of great cruelty towards his subjects, which they
                    repaid by rebelling against him. During his reign it was that the Mahometan
                    standard was first raised in Kansuh. But the Mussulmans were unable to stand
                    against the imperial troops; their armies were dispersed; ten thousand of them
                    were exiled; and, effectually to prevent a renewal of the outbreak for some
                    years, an order was issued that every Mahometan in Kansuh above the age of
                    fifteen should be put to death (1784). Amidst all the political calls upon his
                    time Keen-lung still found leisure for study. He wrote incessantly, both poetry
                    and prose, and did much to promote the cause of literature by collecting
                    libraries and republishing works of value. His campaigns furnished him with
                    themes for his verses, and in the Summer Palace was found a handsome manuscript
                    copy of a laudatory poem he composed on the occasion of his war against the
                    Gorkhas. This was one of the most successful of his military undertakings. His
                    generals marched 70,000 men into Nepaul to within sixty miles of the British
                    frontiers, and having subjugated the Gorkhas they received the submission of the
                    N^epaulese, and acquired an additional hold over Tibet (1792). In other
                    directions his arms were not so successful. We find no poem commemorating the
                    campaign against the rebellious Formosans, nor lament over the loss of 100,000
                    men in that island, and the last few years of his reign were disturbed by
                    outbreaks among the Meaou-tsze or hill tribes, living in the mountains in the
                    provinces of Kwei-chow and Kwangse. In 1795, after a reign of sixty years,
                    Keen-lung abdicated in favour of his fifteenth son, who adopted the title of
                    Kea-king as the style of his reign. He only lived three years in retirement, and
                    died at the age of eighty-eight in 1798.</p>

                <p>During the reign of Keen-lung the relations of the East India Company with his
                    Government had been the reverse of satisfactory. All kinds of unjust exactions
                    were demanded from the merchants, and many acts of gross injustice were
                    committed on the persons of Englishmen. So notorious, at length, did these
                    matters become that the British Government determined to send an embassy to the
                    court of Peking, and Lord Macartney was chosen to represent George III. on the
                    occasion. On arriving at Jehol, where the court then was, Lord Macartney was
                    received most graciously by the emperor, and subsequently at Yuen-ming-yuen he
                    was admitted into the imperial presence and was treated with every courtesy. But
                    the concessions he sought for his countrymen were not accorded to him, and in
                    this sense, but in this sense only, his mission was a failure.</p>
                <p>Kea-king ’ s reign, which extended over a period of five-and-twenty years, was
                    disturbed and disastrous. In the northern and western provinces, rebellion after
                    rebellion broke out, due in a great measure to the carelessness and incompetency
                    of the emperor, who was as obstinately self-opinionated as he was unfit to rule,
                    and the coasts were infested with bands of pirates, whose number and
                    organization enabled them for a long time to hold the imperial fleet in check.
                    But, fortunately for the Government, dissensions broke out among the pirate
                    chiefs, and, weakened by internal fighting, they finally made their peace with
                    the mandarins and accepted posts under the emperor. Meanwhile the condition of
                    the foreign merchants at Canton had in no wise improved. The mandarins were as
                    exacting and as unjust as ever, and in order to set matters on a better footing
                    the British Government despatched a second ambassador in the person of Lord
                    Amherst to Peking in 1816. On arriving at the mouth of the Peiho he was received
                    by imperial commissioners who conducted him to Yuen-ming yuen, taking every
                    advantage on the way of pointing out to him the necessity of his performing the
                    kowtow before the emperor if he wished to be allowed to enter the imperial
                    presence. This he declined to do, and he was consequently dismissed from the
                    palace on the same day on which he arrived, and thus a new impetus was given to
                    mandarinic insolence.</p>
                <p>Destitute of all royal qualities, a slave to his passions, and the servant of
                    caprice, the emperor Kea-king died in the year 1820, after a reign of
                    twenty-five years, leaving a disturbed country and a disaffected people as a
                    legacy to his successor Taou-kwang.</p>
                <p>Though possessed in his early years of considerable energy Taou-kwang no sooner
                    ascended the throne than he turned his powers, which should have been directed
                    to the pacification of the empire, to the pursuit of pleasure and amusement. The
                    reforms which his subjects had been led by his first manifestoes to believe
                    would be introduced never seriously occupied his attention, and the discontent
                    which had been lulled by hope soon became intensified by despair. In Formosa,
                    Kwang-se, Ho-nan, and other parts of the empire insurrections broke out, which
                    the imperial generals were quite unequal to suppress by force, and the Triad
                    Society, which had originated during the reign of Kang-he, again showed a
                    formidable front under his degenerate successor. Meanwhile the hardships
                    inflicted on the English merchants at Canton became so unbearable, that when, in
                    1834, the monopoly of the East India Company ceased, the English Government
                    determined to send out a minister to superintend the foreign trade at that port.
                    Lord Napier was selected for the office; but so vexatious was the conduct of the
                    Chinese authorities, and so inadequately was he supported, that the anxieties of
                    his position brought on an attack of fever, from which he died at Macao after
                    but a few months’ residence in China. The chief cause of complaint adduced by
                    the mandarins was the introduction of opium by the merchants, and for years they
                    attempted by every means in their power, by stopping all foreign trade, by
                    demands for the prohibition of the traffic in the drug, and by vigilant
                    preventive measures, to put a stop to its importation. At length Captain Elliot,
                    the superintendent of trade, in 1839 agreed that all the opium in the hands of
                    Englishmen should be given up to the native authorities, and he exacted a pledge
                    from the merchants that they would no longer deal in the drug. On the 3d April,
                    20,283 chests of opium were handed over to the mandarins and were by them
                    destroyed—a sufficient proof that they were in earnest in their endeavours to
                    suppress the traffic. This demand of commissioner Lin was considered by the
                    English Government to amount to a <hi rend="italic">casus belli,</hi> and in
                    1840 war was declared. In the same year the fleet captured Chusan, and in the
                    following year the Bogue Forts fell, in consequence of which operations the
                    Chinese agreed to cede Hong-Kong to the victors and to pay them an indemnity of
                    6,000,000 dollars. As soon as this news reached Peking, Ke Shen, who had
                    succeeded commissioner Lin, was dismissed from his post and degraded, and Yih
                    Shan, another Tatar, was appointed in his room. But before the new commissioner
                    reached his post, Canton had fallen into the hands of Sir Hugh Gough, and
                    shortly afterwards Amoy, Ningpo, Tinghai in Chusan, Chapoo, Shanghai, and
                    Chin-keang Foo shared the same fate, and a like evil would have happened to
                    Nanking had not the Imperial Government, dreading the loss of the “Southern
                    Capital,” proposed terms of peace. After much discussion, Sir Henry Pöttinger,
                    who had succeeded Captain Elliot, concluded, in 1842, a treaty with the imperial
                    commissioners, by which the four additional ports of Amoy, Fuh-chow-Foo, Ningpo,
                    and Shanghai were declared open to foreign trade, and an indemnity of 21,000,000
                    dollars was to be paid to the English. Nor was the remainder of the reign of
                    Taou-kwang more fortunate than its beginning; the empire was completely
                    disorganized, rebellious outbreaks were of frequent occurrence, and the imperial
                    armies were powerless to oppose them. So complete was the demoralization of the
                    troops, that on one occasion the Meaou-tsze or hill tribes of Kwang-se defeated
                    an army of 30,000 men sent against them by the viceroy of the two Kwangs. In
                    1850, while these clouds were hanging gloomily over the land, Taou-kwang
                    “ascended on high,” and Heen-fung, his son, reigned in his stead.</p>
                <p>A cry was now raised for the reforms which had been hoped for under Taou-kwang,
                    but Heen-fung possessed in an exaggerated form the selfish and tyrannical nature
                    of his father, together with a voluptuary’s craving for every kind of sensual
                    pleasure, and he lived to reap as he had sown. For some time Kwang-se had been
                    in a very disturbed state, and when, on the accession of the new emperor, the
                    people found that no relief from the oppression they endured was to be given
                    them, they broke out into open revolt and proclaimed a youth, who was said to be
                    the representative of the last emperor of the Ming dynasty, as emperor, under
                    the title of Teen-tih or “Heavenly Virtue.” From Kwang-se the flames spread into
                    Hoo-pih and Hoo-nan, and then languished from want of a leader and a definite
                    political cry. Just at the moment, however, when there appeared to be a
                    possibility that, by force of arms and the persuasive influence of money, the
                    imperialists would re-establish their supremacy, a leader presented himself in
                    Kwang-se, whose energy of character, combined with great political and religious
                    enthusiasm, speedily gained for him the suffrages of the discontented. This was
                    Hung Sew-tseuen. Seizing on the popular longing for the return of a Chinese
                    dynasty <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n665/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0665-0652"/> he proclaimed himself as sent by heaven to drive
                    out the Tatars, and to restore in his own person the succession to China. At the
                    same time having been converted to Christianity, and professing to abhor the
                    vices and sins of the age, he called on all the virtuous of the land to
                    extirpate rulers who, both in their public laws and in their private acts, were
                    standing examples of all that was base and vile in human nature. Crowds soon
                    flocked to his standard. Teen-tih was deserted; and, putting himself at the head
                    of his followers, Hung Sew-tseuen marched northwards into Hoo-nan and Hoo-pih,
                    overthrowing every force which was sent to oppose him. The first city of
                    importance which fell into his hands was Woo-chang Foo on the Yang-tsze-Keang,
                    the capital of Hoo-pih. Situated at the junction of the Han River with the
                    Yang-tsze Keang, this city was a point of great strategical importance. But Hung
                    Sew-tseuen was not inclined to rest upon his laurels, knowing full well that he
                    must be able to call Nanking his before there would be any chance that his
                    dreams of empire could be realized. Having made Woo-chang secure, he therefore
                    moved down the river, and after taking Gan-king on his way he proceeded to the
                    attack of Nanking. So wide-spread was the disaffection at this time throughout
                    the country that the city was ripe for falling, and without much difficulty Hung
                    Sew-tseuen in 1852 established himself within its walls, and proclaimed the
                    inauguration of the Tai-ping dynasty, of which he nominated himself the first
                    emperor under the title of Teen Wang or “Heavenly king.” For the next few years
                    it appeared as though he had nailed the flag of victory to his staff. His armies
                    penetrated victoriously as far north as Tientsin and as far east as Chin-keang
                    and Soochow, while bands of sympathizers with his cause appeared in the
                    neighbourhood of Amoy. As if still further to aid and abet him in his schemes,
                    England declared war against the Tatar dynasty in 1857, in consequence of an
                    outrage known as the “Arrow” affair. In December of the same year Canton was
                    taken by an English force under Sir Michael Seymour and General Straubenzee, and
                    a still further blow was struck against the prestige of the ruling Government by
                    the determination arrived at by Lord Elgin, who had been sent out as special
                    ambassador, to go to Peking and communicate directly with the emperor. In May
                    1858 the Taku Forts were taken, and the way having thus been cleared of
                    obstacles, Lord Elgin went up the Peiho to Tientsin <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">route</hi> for the capital. At Tientsin, however, he was met by
                    the imperial commissioners, who persuaded him so far to alter his plans as to
                    conclude a treaty with them on the spot, which treaty it was agreed should be
                    ratified at Peking in the following year. When, however, Sir Frederick Bruce,
                    who had been in the meanwhile appointed minister to the court of Peking,
                    attempted to pass Taku to carry out this part of the arrangement, the vessels
                    escorting him were fired on from the forts with such precision and persistency
                    that he was compelled to return to Shanghai to await the arrival of a larger
                    force than that which he then had at his command. As soon as news of this defeat
                    reached England Lord Elgin was again sent out with full powers, and accompanied
                    by a large force under the command of Sir Hope Grant. The French likewise took
                    part in the campaign, and on 1st August 1860 the allies landed without meeting
                    with any opposition at Peh-tang, a village twelve miles north of Taku. A few
                    days later the forts at that place which had bid defiance to Sir Frederick Bruce
                    twelve months previously were taken, and from thence the allies marched to
                    Peking. Finding further resistance to be hopeless, the Chinese opened
                    negotiations, and as a guarantee of their good faith surrendered the An-ting
                    gate of the capital to the allies. On the 24th October the treaty of 1858 was
                    ratified by Prince King and Lord Elgin, and a convention was signed under the
                    terms of which the Chinese agreed to pay a war indemnity of 8,000,000 taels. The
                    Emperor Heen-fung did not live long to see the results of his new relations with
                    the hated foreigner, but died in the summer of the following year, leaving the
                    throne to his son Tung-che a child of five years old.</p>
                <p>The conclusion of peace with the allies was the signal for a renewal of the
                    campaign against the Tai-pings, and benefiting by the friendly feelings of the
                    English authorities engendered by the return of amicable relations, the Chinese
                    Government succeeded in enlisting Major Gordon of the Royal Engineers in their
                    service. In a surprisingly short space of time this officer formed the troops,
                    which had formerly been under the command of an American named Ward, into a
                    formidable army, and without delay took the field against the rebels. From that
                    day the fortunes of the Tai pings declined. They lost city after city, and,
                    finally in July 1864, the imperialists, after an interval of twelve years, once
                    more gained possession of Nanking. Teen Wang did not survive the capture of his
                    capital, and with him fell his cause. Those of his followers who escaped the
                    sword of the victors dispersed throughout the country, and the Tai-pings ceased
                    to be.</p>
                <p>With the measure of peace which was then restored to the country trade rapidly
                    revived, and, with the exception of the province of Yun-nan, where the Mahometan
                    rebels under Suleiman still kept the imperial forces at bay, prosperity was
                    everywhere re-awakened. Against these foes the Government was careless to take
                    any active measures, until in 1872 Prince Hassan, the adopted son of Suleiman,
                    was sent on a mission to England with the object of gaining the recognition of
                    the Queen for his father’s government. This step at once aroused the
                    susceptibilities of the Imperial Government, and a large force was instantly
                    organized and despatched to the scene of the rebellion. The war was now pushed
                    on with vigour, and before the year was out the Mahometan capital Ta-le Foo fell
                    into the hands of the imperialists, and the followers of Suleiman at that place
                    and throughout the province were mercilessly exterminated. In the succeeding
                    February the Regents— <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    i</hi> the dowager-empresses, who had governed the country since the death of
                    Heen-fung—resigned their powers into the hands of the emperor. This
                    long-expected time was seized upon by the foreign ministers to urge their right
                    of audience with the emperor, and on the 29th June 1873 the privilege of gazing
                    on the “sacred countenance” was accorded to them. From that time until his death
                    from smallpox on the 12th of January 1875, Tung-che’s name fails to appear in
                    connection with any public act of importance.</p>
                <p>The Emperor Tung-che having died without issue, the succession to the throne, for
                    the first time in the annals of the Tsing dynasty, passed out of the direct
                    line, and a cousin of the deceased emperor, a princeling, said to be not quite
                    four years old, was chosen to reign in his room, under the title of Kwang-seu or
                    “Succession of Glory.” Thus is the country again doomed to suffer all the
                    inconveniences of a long imperial minority, at a time, too, when events seem to
                    show that the civilization of China has grown old, and is like to vanish away;
                    when the introduction of new ideas and western modes of thought is about to
                    stretch the old bottle of Confucian tradition to its fullest extent; and when,
                    therefore, the empire will sorely need wisdom and strength at the head of
                    affairs to guide it safely through the critical times which lie before it in the
                    future.</p>

                    emperor, who was styled She-tsu-chang Hwang-te, adopted the title of Shun-che
                    for his reign, which began in the year 1644. The legendary progenitor of these
                    Manchoo rulers was Aisin Gioro, whose name is said to point to the fact of his
                    having been related to the race of Neu-chih, or Kin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> Golden Tatars, who reigned in Northern China during the 12th and
                    13th centuries. The present emperor, whose reign is styled Kwang-seu or
                    “Succession of Glory,” is the eighth from the founder of the dynasty, and is the
                    only ruler since the establishment of the line who has not succeeded as a direct
                    descendant. Kang-he (1661-1722), for instance, was the third son of Shun-che;
                    Yung-ching (1722-1735) was the fourth son of Kang-he; Keen-lung (1736-1795) was
                    the fourth son of Yung-ching; Kea-king (1796-1820) was the fifteenth son of
                    Keen-lung; Taou-Kwang (1821-1850) was the second son of Kea-king; Heen-fung
                    (1851-1861) was the fourth of the nine sons who were born to the emperor
                    Taou-kwang; and Tung-che (1862-1875) was the only son of Heen-fung. As by
                    Chinese law the heir must be younger than the individual from whom he inherits,
                    it became necessary when the Emperor Tung-che “became a guest in Heaven,”
                    without issue, in 1875, to select as his successor one of the sons of one of his
                    father’s younger brothers, and the choice, which was recorded in his will, fell
                    upon the infant son of the Prince of Chun, the seventh son of the Emperor
                    Taou-kwang.</p>
                <p>In order to prevent the confusion which would arise among the princes of the
                    imperial house were they each to adopt an arbitrary name, the Emperor Kang-he
                    decreed that each of his twenty-four sons should have a personal name consisting
                    of two characters, the first of which should be <hi rend="italic">Yung,</hi> and
                    the second should be compounded with the determinative <hi rend="italic"
                    >she,</hi> “to manifest,” an arrangement which would, as has been remarked, find
                    an exact parallel in a system by which the sons in an English family might be
                    called Louis <hi rend="italic">Edward,</hi> Louis <hi rend="italic">Edwin,</hi>
                    Louis <hi rend="italic">Edwy,</hi> Louis <hi rend="italic">Edgar,</hi> and so
                    on. This device obtained also in the next generation, all the princes of which
                    had <hi rend="italic">Hung</hi> for their first names, and the Emperor Keen-lung
                    (1736-1795) extended it into a system, and directed that the succeeding
                    generations should take the four characters <hi rend="italic">Yung, Meen,
                    Yih,,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tsae</hi> respectively, as the first parts of
                    their names. Eight other characters, namely, <hi rend="italic">P</hi><hi

                    subsequently added, thus providing generic names for twelve generations. With
                    the present generation the first four characters are exhausted, and the sons of
                    the present emperor, should he have any, will therefore be <hi rend="italic"
                    >P</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">u</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> By the ceremonial
                    law of the ‘Great Pure” dynasty, twelve degrees of rank are distributed among
                    the princes of the imperial house, and are as follows :—1. Ho-shih Tsin Wang,
                    prince of the first order; 2. To-lo Keun Wang, prince of the second order; 3.
                    To-lo B 3 il eh, prince of the third order. 4. Koo-shan Beitsze, prince of the
                    fourth order; 5 to 8. Kung, or duke (with distinctive designations); 9 to 12.
                    Tseang-keun, general (with distinctive designations). The sons of emperors
                    usually receive patents of the first or second order on their reaching manhood,
                    and on their sons is bestowed the title of <hi rend="italic">Beileh.</hi> A <hi
                    rend="italic">Beileh's</hi> sons become <hi rend="italic">Beitsze</hi><hi

                    on.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Language and Literature.</hi></p>
                <p>The Chinese language is the chief among that small class of languages which
                    includes the Tibetan Cochin-Chinese, Burmese, Corean, and Chinese, and which is
                    usually described as monosyllabic. It is language in its most archaic form.
                    Every word is a root, and every root is a word. It is without inflexion or even
                    agglutination; its substantives are indeclinable, and its verbs are not to be
                    conjugated; it is destitute of an alphabet, and finds its expression on paper in
                    thousands of distinct symbols.</p>
                <p>It is then a language of monosyllabic roots, which, as regards the written
                    character, has been checked in its growth and crystallized in its most ancient
                    form by the early occurrence of a period of great literary activity, of which
                    the nation is proud, and to the productions of which, every Chinaman even of the
                    present day looks back as containing the true standards of literary
                    excellence.</p>
                <p>But in treating of the two branches into which Chinese naturally divides itself,
                    namely, the written medium or characters and the spoken medium or sounds, we
                    propose to begin with the former. And in following this course we shall be doing
                    no violence to the language, for it would be quite possible to separate the
                    characters from the sounds, and to treat them as two languages, as indeed has
                    already been partly done in Japan, where the Chinese characters were at one time
                    in general use as representing the phonetic value of their Japanese equivalents.
                    Beginning at the other end, but with a similar ultimate result, various members
                    of the missionary body have published text-books and dictionaries in Romanized
                    Chinese, that is to say, they have avoided the use of the characters by
                    transcribing the sounds of the language in Roman letters. But since, though the
                    characters are rich and copious to a degree, the sounds are out of all
                    proportion poor, this last dismemberment presents the language in a very denuded
                    form, and is at the same time attended with difficulties which only the most
                    sanguine can hope to see overcome. The necessity of distinguishing between words
                    having the same sound can only be met by the adoption of distinct diacritical
                    marks for each word; and as one sound often represents as many as a hundred
                    words, such a system cannot but be attended with confusion.</p>
                <p>The characters of the language form the medium which speaks to the eye, and may
                    be described as the equivalents of the written <hi rend="italic">words</hi> of
                    other languages; but unlike these, instead of being composed of letters of an
                    alphabet, they are either symbols intended to represent images, or are formed by
                    a combination of lines, or of two or more such symbols. AU characters, say the
                    Chinese lexicographer», had their origin in single strokes, or in hieroglyphics,
                    and this, no doubt, is a correct view of the case. Legends differ as to who was
                    the first inventor of writing in China. One attributes the invention to Fuh-he
                    (3200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), who is also said to have instituted
                    marriage, and to have introduced the use of clothing, and who caused the knotted
                    cords, which had been up to that time in use, to be superseded by characters
                    founded on the shapes of his celebrated diagrams. Another record states that
                    Tsang Ke who lived 2700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was the Cadmus of China.
                    According to received native accounts, Tsang Ke was a man of extraordinary
                    abUity, and was acquainted with the art of writing from his birth. While
                    wandering in the neighbourhood of his house at Yang-woo, he one day met with a
                    tortoise, and observing its shell distinctly and beautifuUy spotted, he took it
                    home, and thus formed the idea of representing the objects around him. Looking
                    upwards he carefuUy observed the figures presented by the stars and the heavenly
                    bodies; he then attentively considered the forms of birds, and of mountains and
                    rivers, &lt;fcc,, and from them at length originated the written character.</p>
                <p>But however great the uncertainty may be as to who invented the first characters,
                    we may take it for granted that they were simply pictures of the various objects
                    of sense which were present to the eye of the writer. Thus, when he wished to
                    express a mountain, he wrote, as did also the ancient Egyptians, ∕√∖Λ a symbol
                    which is written at the present day ∣i[; Q now written g, served him to signify
                    “the eye,” and so on. But such a written medium <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n667/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0667-0654"/> was naturally extremely limited, and by degrees,
                    in some instances by the addition of strokes, and in others by a combination of
                    one or more of these primary characters, the written language has been formed as
                    it is at the present day. In tracing the growth of the later characters we are
                    assisted by the native philologists, who have divided them into six classes.</p>
                <p>The first they call <hi rend="italic">Slang</hi><hi rend="italic">hing,</hi> lit.
                    characters representing the forms of the objects meant, or, as we should say,
                    hieroglyphics, such as those just mentioned, and about 600 more, as, for
                    example, Θ <hi rend="italic">jih,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the sun,” T⅛ <hi
                    rend="italic">ma,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> a horse,” &amp;c.; and of these
                    are composed, with a few exceptions, the 214 determinative or radical
                    characters, one of which enters into the composition of every character in the
                    language.</p>
                <p>The second class is called <hi rend="italic">Chi sze,</hi> lit. characters
                    indicating things, that is to say, characters intended to represent ideas to the
                    mind by the position of their parts. Thus the character Θ <hi rend="italic"
                    >tan,</hi> “dawn,” in which the sun is represented as appearing above the
                    horizon, belongs to it, and also such characters as <hi rend="italic">
                    [^,</hi><hi rend="italic">shang,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> above,” and ψ <hi
                    rend="italic">hea,</hi> “beneath,” which are formed in the one case by placing a
                    man above the medium level, and in the other below it.</p>
                <p>The third class is made up of <hi rend="italic">Hwuy i,</hi> lit. characters
                    combining ideas, or ideographies. This class is formed by uniting two or more
                    significant characters to give the idea of a third. Of the time when these
                    characters were invented we know nothing; but it is plain that their
                    introduction must have given a very extended scope to the language, and they
                    offer an interesting study, as, in many instances, giving us an insight into the
                    moral and social conditions of those who framed them. For instance, if we
                    analyze the character fg <hi rend="italic">sin,</hi> “sincere,” we find that it
                    is formed by the combination of the characters A <hi rend="italic">jin,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,t</hi> a man,” and ⅛ ’ <hi rend="italic">yen,</hi>
                    “words,” a collocation of ideas which speaks well for the honourable
                    truthfulness of the ancient Chinese, and which, when the unfortunate failing in
                    this respect of their descendants is borne in mind, is decidedly opposed to the
                    Darwinian theory as applied to language. The character ⅜ <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hwang,</hi> “Emperor,” is another belonging to this class, which gives anything
                    but a contemptible notion of the moral standard of the people. This symbol was
                    originally written thus ⅜, and was composed of the characters meaning “oneself”
                    and “ruler;” the emperor was therefore to be ruler of himself, or autocrat in
                    the true sense of the term; for how can a man, said the ancient sages, rule
                    others unless he first learn to be master of himself <hi rend="italic"
                    >1</hi></p>
                <p>Curiously enough, by the omission of a stroke, this character has assumed its
                    present corrupted form, which consists of parts signifying “white” and “ruler,”
                    and this, as was mentioned in a recent letter from the St Petersburg
                    correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> has been literally translated
                    by the Mongols into Tchagau Khan, and then by the Russians into Biely Tsar, or
                    White Tsar, the name by which the emperor of Russia is now known throughout all
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>Another character in this class is ∏∏ <hi rend="italic">ming,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi> brightness,” which is composed of a combination of the sun
                    and moon to indicate brilliancy. Altogether, of these ideographies there are
                    said to be about 700 in the language, although some writers have held that this
                    class is a very much larger one, and have justified their belief by analyses
                    which, to say the least, are far-fetched. Callery quotes a Jesuit work, in which
                    it is stated that the character <hi rend="italic">dιuen,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi> a ship,” contains to the eye of faith—and we should imagine to that eye
                    alone—a reference to the Flood, since it consists of <hi rend="italic"
                    >chow,“a</hi> ship,” ∕∖ <hi rend="italic">pa,,</hi> “eight,” and ∏ <hi
                    rend="italic">kow,</hi> “a mouth,” plainly pointing, adds the writer, to Noah’s
                    ark with its eight inhabitants; and that <hi rend="italic">lan,</hi> “to covet
                    and desire,” bears traces of Eve's guilt in its component parts, which are <hi
                    rend="italic">fζ</hi><hi rend="italic">neu,</hi> “a woman,” and ∕fc <hi
                    rend="italic">muh,</hi> “a tree,” twice repeated, illustrating the longing
                    desire which overcame our first parent when between the trees of life and of
                    good and evil.</p>
                <p>The fourth class is the <hi rend="italic">Chuen choo,</hi> or characters which,
                    being inverted, either in form or sound, assume different meanings. These number
                    about 372, and are formed in two ways,—either by some slight alteration of the
                    character, as the turning of a stroke or of strokes to the left instead of the
                    right, as, for instance, the character for the hand pointing to the left in this
                    way means “left,” and when turned thus <hi rend="italic">J£-</hi> means “right;”
                    or by changing the sound of the character, and with the sound the meaning. Of
                    this kind are such characters as ∣ξ⅛, which when pronounced <hi rend="italic"
                    >yδ</hi> means “music,” and when <hi rend="italic">lδ,</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi> delight,” and <hi rend="italic">%j</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> j</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> which as <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    means “easy,” and as <hi rend="italic">yih</hi> means to “change.”</p>
                <p>The fifth class is the <hi rend="italic">Chia chieh,</hi> lit. characters having
                    borrowed meanings, and consists of about 600 characters, which are applied, as
                    is indicated by the name of the division, in a double sense, and hence have been
                    called metaphorical. As an illustration of this class, Chinese writers adduce
                    the character <hi rend="italic">shi,</hi> “an arrow,” which, from the straight
                    course of an arrow, has come to signify “direct,” “right,” “a word spoken to the
                    point.”</p>
                <p>The sixth class, which is known as the <hi rend="italic">Chieh shing,</hi> or
                    phonetic, embraces over 20,000 characters. The adoption of these phonetics was
                    the turning-point in the progress of Chinese writing. As was the case with the
                    Egyptians, the Chinese found that, having exhausted their power of invention in
                    forming hieroglyphics and ideographies, a further development of the characters
                    was necessary; and, like the subjects of the Pharaohs, they adopted certain
                    characters to represent certain sounds. As to when, or by whom, this system was
                    inaugurated, whether it was introduced from abroad, or whether it was the
                    product of native intelligence, history is silent; but when it was once decided
                    on, the language rapidly increased and multiplied. “A character,” writes a
                    well-known Chinese author, “is not sterile; once bound to another, it gives
                    birth to a son; and if this be joined to another, a grandson is born, and so
                    on.” The characters, then, which belong to the class called phonetic are
                    composed of two parts, namely, the primitive or phonetic element, that is to
                    say, one of the characters which have been chosen to represent certain sounds,
                    and which gives the sound to the whole character, and one of the 214
                    determinatives or radical characters of the language.</p>
                <p>One or more of these determinatives enter into the composition of every character
                    in Chinese, and as a very large proportion of them are plainly hieroglyphics,
                    they may be said to be the foundation of the written language. As might be
                    expected from their nature as hieroglyphics, they include the most remarkable
                    objects of nature, such as the sun, moon, a river, a mountain, fire, water,
                    earth, wood, stone, &amp;c.; the chief parts of the human body, as the head, the
                    heart, the hand, the foot, the eye, the ear &amp;c.; the principal parts of a
                    house, as the roof, the door, &amp;c.; domestic animals, such as the sheep, the
                    cow, the horse, the dog, &amp;c.; the primary relations of society, as father,
                    mother, son, daughter, àc.; qualities, such as great, small, straight, crooked,
                    high, low, long, &amp;c.; and actions, such as to see, to speak, to walk, to
                    run, to stop, to enter, to follow, &amp;c. They are thus admirably adapted to
                    form generic terms, and this is the part they play in composition with the
                    primitives. For instance, into the composition of every character signifying
                    anything made of wood such as a table, a chair, a club, &amp;c., the
                    determinative character meaning “wood” is introduced, and it then serves much
                    the same purpose as do the words “mat” and “steam” in the compounds “matshed”
                    and “steamboat.” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n668/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0668-0655"/> The number of the primitives has been variously
                    estimated. Dr Marshman gives them at 3867, Callery at about 1000, and later
                    writers have reckoned them to be from 1100 to 1200. Taking them even at the
                    lowest of these figures, it will readily be imagined how, by combination with
                    the 214 determinatives, they may be made to form the thirty and odd thousand
                    distinct characters of the language, since, of course, it would be possible by
                    combining each of the 1000 primitives with every one of the 214 determinatives,
                    to form more than seven times that number of characters.</p>
                <p>To illustrate this system of formation, we will take the primitive <hi
                    rend="italic">ngo,</hi> “I,” which by combination with 27 determinatives,
                    produces as many derivatives having the same phonetic value, in this
                    way—combined with the determinative ∣I∣ “a mountain,” it becomes jf(⅛ <hi
                    rend="italic">ngo,</hi> “a high mountain;” with ⅛ <hi rend="italic">neu,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi> a woman,” J[fξ <hi rend="italic">ngo,</hi> “fair,”
                    “beautiful;” with <hi rend="italic">tsao,</hi> “grass,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >ngo,</hi> “a certain herb;” with J⅜ <hi rend="italic">neaou,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> lt</hi> a bird,” <hi rend="italic">ngo,</hi> “a
                    goose,” and so on. From these examples it will be observed that the
                    determinatives play the part in some instances of adjectives; and in combination
                    with their primitives they form an exact parallel with many Egyptian and
                    Assyrian ideophonetics. The following example in Egyptian shows precisely the
                    same formation in the composition of the characters, and in the respective value
                    of their parts, as is seen in the Chinese instance just referred to. <hi
                    rend="italic">Un</hi> means in Egyptian “a hare combined with this deter-</p>
                <p>∣lllll∏Γ</p>
                <p>minative ^ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,it becomes ^π≡r <hi rend="italic"
                    >Un,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> tt</hi> to open;” and with this 2ø, 2,0
                    ^ <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> &gt; “<hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> tour.”
                    Speaking of Assyrian hieroglyphics, Sir Henry Rawlinson says, “Certain classes
                    of words have a sign prefixed or suffixed to them, more commonly the former, by
                    which their general character is indicated. The names of gods, of men, of
                    cities, of tribes, of wild animals, of domestic animals, of metals, of months,
                    of the points of the compass, and of dignities are thus accompanied. The sign
                    prefixed or suffixed may have originally represented a word; but when used in
                    the way here spoken of, it is believed that it was not sounded, but served
                    simply to indicate to the reader the sort of word which was placed before
                    it.”</p>
                <p>These words of Sir Henry Rawlinson may be illustrated by the following examples,
                    i=∣ means in Assyrian “wood,” and is used as the determinative for things made
                    of wood. Thus in combination with the primitive £Ïr it becomes a sceptre;” and
                    when combined with the primitive <hi rend="superscript"> we</hi> bave “a bow.”
                    Again, ^J&gt;~T</p>
                <p>is used in the same way as the determinative for all carnivorous animals. Thus,
                    for instance, Ud≡ is “a dog,” and is “a lion.” It will be seen that both the
                    Egyptian and Assyrian characters here quoted are constructed on exactly the same
                    principle as that to be observed in the formation of the majority of Chinese
                    characters, but it is noticeable that in Assyrian the primitives do not retain
                    in composition their phonetic values, as they generally do in Chinese, and as
                    they often do in Egyptian.</p>
                <p>Marking, then, the forces of the two parts of the characters, it is easy to
                    imagine the way in which new characters have from time to time been formed.
                    Supposing, for instance, that a tree for which a Chinaman wishes to give a name
                    on paper is known to him colloquially as <hi rend="italic">ma.</hi> The coiner
                    of the new character would then in the first place choose a common phonetic or
                    primitive possessing the sound <hi rend="italic">ma</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    very possibly he would take the hieroglyphic <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> “a horse”
                    and would combine with it the determinative <hi rend="italic">muh,</hi> meaning
                    “wood.” The new character would then stand thus f EÉJ, and might be understood
                    to signify “the <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> tree;” but, unless previously
                    informed, the reader would be left in complete ignorance as to the sort*of tree
                    meant, as the parts of the character would only supply the information that it
                    was either a tree or something made of wood, and that it was to be pronounced
                    <hi rend="italic">ma.</hi> This is equally the case, speaking generally, with
                    all the characters. By a careful study of the phonetics it is possible to arrive
                    at the sounds or approximate sounds— for certain variations constantly occur—of
                    the characters of the language; but the only hint at their meanings is to be
                    derived from the determinatives, which point only to the general nature of the
                    objects or actions signified.</p>
                <p>As has already been said, the determinatives are 214 in number, and these have
                    been considered by many of the native dictionary-makers to furnish convenient
                    headings under which to arrange the characters of the language. Again, others
                    have chosen to classify the characters according to their final sounds. Both
                    systems have their advantages. By adopting the first, the headings are
                    comparatively few, and the characters are, roughly speaking, classified
                    according to the generic meanings they have in common; and the second gives
                    constant practice to students in remembering the tones and correct rhyming
                    pronunciation of the characters. But in both the phonetic relationship between
                    the primitives is entirely lost sight of. And this is much to be regretted,
                    since, as Callery and others have pointed out, the scientific way ot arranging
                    the characters would be by placing them under their primitives, by which means
                    the respective values of both the primitives and determinatives would be brought
                    out in prominent relief. Only in two Chinese dictionaries that we have met with
                    have any attempts been made thus to arrange the characters, and the older of
                    these, on which the later work was probably framed, owes the system on which it
                    is composed to the experience imported from Japan by the co-compiler, who was a
                    native of that country.</p>
                <p>In the course of the above remarks a few instances have been given of the
                    original and modern forms of the same characters, as, for example, J≡⅜ and But,
                    as may readily be supposed, the change from one to the other was not made all at
                    once, and Chinese books afford instances of six distinct styles of writing,
                    varying in clearness from the square character used in the books at the present
                    day to the Seal and Grass or cursive characters, which are noted for their
                    obscurity. These styles are described as the <hi rend="italic">Chuen shoo</hi>
                    or “seal character,” the <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">shoo</hi> or
                    “official character,” the <hi rend="italic">Keae shoo or</hi> “model character,”
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hing shoo</hi> or “running character,” the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tsaou shoo</hi> or “grass character,” and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sung shoo</hi> or “Sung-dynasty character,” and may be illustrated by the
                    following example, in which the character <hi rend="italic">tsaou</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> tt</hi> herbs” is shown written in all the six styles just
                    specified :—seal character <hi rend="italic">&lt;f</hi> ∖; official character
                    ff'; model character J∣L; running character āf?; grass character * <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s</hi> ⅛; and Sung character J≠L. But above and beyond these
                    six styles of writing, Chinese penmen not unfrequently allow their imaginations
                    to run riot when engaged in fanciful or ornamental pieces of caligraphy. An
                    extraordinary specimen of this quaint taste is to be seen in the Chinese Library
                    of the British Museum, where there is a copy of the Emperor Keen-lung’s poeπr on
                    Moukden, printed both in Chinese and Manchoo in 32 kinds of strangely fanciful
                    characters.</p>
                <p>We will now pass on to the sounds of the language; and the first thing concerning
                    them which strikes the student on becoming acquainted with his dictionary is
                    their extreme poverty as compared with the characters. There are over 30,000
                    characters in the language, and these <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n669/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0669-0656"/> aro represented, to the ear by only 500 syllabic
                    sounds. No doubt the adoption of primitives as phonetics, as has been already
                    described, has contributed to this result, since it provided for the due
                    expression of the syllables then existing, but for no more. And thus, though it
                    vastly enriched the written language—one primitive producing as many as 74
                    derivatives—it at once put a stop to all increase in the number of the sounds.
                    The difficulty then arose as to the way in which 500 syllables were to be made
                    to represent in conversation the thousands of characters in common use. And
                    three methods have been adopted to prevent the confusion which at first sight
                    would appear to be inevitable. These are—</p>
                <p>1. By combining with the word which it is desired should be understood another,
                    bearing a similar or supplementary meaning, to distinguish it by pointing to its
                    meaning from other words bearing the same sound; thus, for “to hear,” it is
                    usual to say in conversation J[ <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ∣ <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">^</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">9 i</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    ceen</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >li</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">9</hi> meaning
                    “to hear,” and <hi rend="italic">keen</hi> “to see or perceive.”</p>
                <p>2. As regards noun substantives, by placing certain classifying words between
                    them and the numerals which precede them. These classifiers bear some
                    resemblance to our expressions <hi rend="italic">herd, head, fleet, troop,</hi>
                    &lt;fcc., and have a certain reference to the nature of the substantives to
                    which they are attached. For example, the word <hi rend="italic">pα,</hi> “to
                    grasp with the hand,” is used as a classifier to precede anything which is held
                    in the hand, such as a knife, a spoon, a hatchet, &lt;fcc. Instead of
                    expressing, therefore, a knife by <hi rend="italic">yih taou,</hi> which might
                    either mean a knife, a small boot, or a fringe, the classifier is introduced to
                    show which <hi rend="italic">taou</hi> is meant, and a speaker would say <hi
                    rend="italic">yih pa taou,</hi> literally “a grasped knife.” In like manner <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">[h]</hi><hi rend="italic">keen</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> a
                    space,” is used as a classifier for houses and enclosures; <hi rend="italic"
                    >kăn</hi> “a root,” for trees, poles, clubs, &lt;fcc., and so on.</p>
                <p>And thirdly, by dividing the words of the language among eight tones. These tones
                    partake of the nature of musical intonations, and are divided by the Chinese
                    into two series, the upper and the lower, and are called by them the upper even,
                    the upper rising, the upper departing, the upper entering, the lower even, the
                    lower rising, the lower departing, and the lower entering. To each character is
                    allotted its appropriate tone, which if wrongly rendered is liable to give an
                    entirely different meaning to the word from that intended by the speaker. This
                    possibility will be understood when it is remembered that the thirty and odd
                    thousand characters find expression in about 500 sounds, thus giving an average
                    of one sound to 60 characters, and these figures show that at best the system of
                    tones is but an incomplete solution of the difficulty, since, were this average
                    of 60 characters equally distributed among the full eight tones, there would
                    remain nearly eight characters of each sound identical both in sound and
                    tone.</p>
                <p>But as a matter of fact, only the four tones of the upper series are in general
                    use, to which sometimes the first or even tone of the lower series is added. The
                    even tone is, as its name signifies, simply the ordinary tone of voice; the
                    rising tone gives to the voice somewhat of the effect of an interrogation; the
                    departing tone, of doubtful surprise; and the entering tone, of peremptory
                    command. These may easily be illustrated by repeating our negative “No,” first
                    in the ordinary tone of conversation, secondly as an interrogation, thirdly as
                    expressing doubtful surprise, and fourthly as a peremptory refusal:—thus 1 No —,
                    2 No.z, 3No∖,4No-. The difficulty of acquiring a knowledge of the tones proper
                    even to the characters in common use is, as may be supposed, very great, and the
                    only way to master them is to learn them, as the children learn them, from the
                    lips of the natives themselves. No study of books will give the required
                    knowledge. The Chinese learn them by ear alone, and if an educated man be asked
                    to give the tone of an isolated character, he generally has to repeat a phrase
                    in which the character occurs in order that his lips may tell his ear the
                    intonation proper to it.</p>
                <p>It will be easily understood that the mistakes and difficulties into which this
                    intricate system drives Chinesespeaking foreigners are often inconvenient and
                    sometimes dangerous. Some years ago a petition on behalf of a Chinese criminal
                    was presented by a wealthy Chinese merchant in person to the governor and
                    council of Hong Kong. A well-known Chinese scholar undertook to interpret on the
                    occasion, and the Chinaman began his speech with a reference to our <hi
                    rend="italic">Kwai ×. Kwok</hi> or “Honourable kingdom,” as he designated
                    England. Now the syllable <hi rend="italic">kwai</hi> pronounced <hi
                    rend="italic">kwai∕</hi> means “devil,” and used in combination with <hi
                    rend="italic">kwok</hi> is an abusive term not uncommonly applied to any foreign
                    country. Unfortunately the interpreter confused the two tones, and turning
                    indignantly to the governor, he reported that at the very outset the petitioner
                    had begun by speaking of England as “the devil kingdom.” The just anger of the
                    council knew no bounds, and it was only after some minutes of wild confusion
                    that an explanation followed, which saved the Chinaman from sharing the cell of
                    the man for whom he was pleading. To a Chinaman such a mistake would be
                    well-nigh impossible, for the tones form integral parts of the words, and to the
                    ear of a native the difference between <hi rend="italic">kwai</hi> in the
                    ascending tone, and <hi rend="italic">kwai</hi> in the descending tone, would be
                    as great as between <hi rend="italic">kwai</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >kwan.</hi></p>
                <p>There is only one other point in connection with the sounds of the language to
                    which reference need now be made, and that is the system which has been adopted
                    for spelling, as it were, the various sounds. For this purpose 36 characters
                    which begin with the initial consonants of the language have been chosen, and 38
                    which end with the final sounds. In order, then, to indicate a desired sound,
                    the writer takes a character of the first series which begins with the required
                    initial, and a character of the second series which ends with the required
                    final. These are placed together, and the initial of the first and the final of
                    the second give the required sound. For instance, supposing a Chinaman were
                    desirous of expressing that the sound of a certain character was <hi
                    rend="italic">ting,</hi> he would write the two characters '∣∙j <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">tang</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >king,</hi> the first of which would give the initial <hi rend="italic">t,</hi>
                    and the second the final <hi rend="italic">ing.</hi> This syllabic spelling, the
                    initials of which are identical with the initial Sanskrit consonants, was
                    introduced by the Buddhist missionaries in the 5th and 6th centuries, and from
                    the time of the appearance of the dictionary <hi rend="italic">Y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">uh pien,</hi> which was published in the year 543, it has been
                    employed in every native dictionary of the language which has since seen the
                    light.</p>
                <p>With a language of roots, which is devoid of inflexion or even of agglutination,
                    in which a large number of words each play the part, under varying
                    circumstances, of substantives, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs, it may at first
                    sight appear that grammar must be an impossibility. But inasmuch as there are in
                    Chinese, as there must be in every language, certain words which, to quote Dr
                    Marshman, “denote things, and others which signify qualities, there must be
                    words to express actions done, and these as done by one or many, already done,
                    now doing, or intended to be done; they must also be described as done
                    absolutely or conditionally, as proper to be done, or peremptorily commanded.
                    Further, the various circumstances of the doer, and of the subject of the
                    action, must also be either plainly expressed or tacitly understood <hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">hence</hi> the need of prepositions.
                    Connecting words, too, necessarily exist in every language, as well as those
                    which express the emotions of the mind. Thus the principles of grammar must
                    substantially exist in every language.” And though the absence <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n670/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0670-0657"/> of all inflexion in Chinese places the grammar of
                    the language on a different footing from that of the polysyllabic languages, it
                    is yet distinctly defined by the position and connection of the words of the
                    sentence.</p>
                <p>Since, when a language is spoken and understood only in the country of its birth
                    or adoption, the study of the grammar affecting it is, as far as the natives are
                    concerned, comparatively unimportant, we find that little attention has been
                    paid by the Chinese to the grammar of their language. But practically the
                    grammar, which, as has just been stated, consists of rules for the construction
                    of the sentence, has for many centuries been enforced by example, and by the
                    censorship of the examiners at the competitive examinations. If then we observe
                    the connection of words which these authorities have preserved, we find that in
                    every Chinese sentence the subject comes first, then the verb, which is followed
                    by the complement direct and the complement indirect, and further that, as is
                    the case in most of the Turanian languages, every word which defines or modifies
                    another invariably precedes it. For instance, the adjective precedes the
                    substantive, the adverb the verb, the genitive the word which governs it, and
                    the preposition the word governed by it.</p>
                <p>The importance of exactly following these rules becomes at once apparent when we
                    remember that often one and the same word is capable of being used as a
                    substantive, an adjective, a verb, or an adverb. This is the case also with some
                    words in English. We use the word <hi rend="italic">present,</hi> for example,
                    as a substantive when we talk of giving a <hi rend="italic">present</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> as an adjective when we say the <hi rend="italic"
                    >present</hi> time; and as a verb when we say, “I <hi rend="italic">present</hi>
                    you.” <hi rend="italic">Cut</hi> is another word which we make use of in the
                    same way. We say, “the <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> of a sword,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >“cut</hi> grass,” and “to <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> a man down.”</p>
                <p>A number of other instances of the same kind might be adduced, but taking a
                    Chinese word, we may show how, by varying its position in a sentence, it changes
                    its grammatical value. The character <hi rend="italic">jtf∙ hao</hi> has for its
                    meanings “tolove,” “good,” “excellent,” “well,” &amp;c., and possibly with the
                    intention of illustrating, as it were, these meanings by representing the
                    highest and purest form of natural affection, that which exists between a mother
                    and her child, the inventor of the character has formed it of two parts
                    signifying respectively “a woman” and “a son.” If, then, we meet with it in such
                    a connection as this, which is taken from the lips of Confucius, J2, <hi
                    rend="italic">⅛ ½½, Kwei keen chih chia</hi><hi rend="italic">ehe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">hao,</hi> we recognize it at once as a substantive, since, were it
                    an adjective, it would be followed by a substantive <hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">were</hi> it a verb, it would be followed by its complement, and
                    also because it follows a substantive to which is added ⅛, the sign of the
                    possessive case. The sentence should then be translated <hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic">Kwei keen,</hi> “to peep and see,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >hao,</hi> “the excellence or the goodness,” <hi rend="italic">ehe,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                     superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >'oi,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">chih chia,</hi>
                    “the apartments.” In the sentence, also from Confucius, ½∏ ⅛f -g <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">J</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    o</hi><hi rend="italic">o haο haο sih,</hi> we see by the position of the two
                    Λαos that the first must be a verb, and that the second must be an adjective,
                    since it is followed by a substantive with which it forms the direct complement
                    to the verb. The meaning of the sentence then is <hi rend="italic">Jοο,</hi> “as
                    [when],” Λαo∖, “we love,” <hi rend="italic">haο ×'sìh,”</hi> excellent beauty.”
                    Again, in the modern colloquial expression ⅜JξJt we have an example of the use
                    of <hi rend="italic">haο</hi> as an adverb preceding a verb, and the phrase is
                    then incapable of being translated otherwise than as “well said,” <hi
                    rend="italic">hao,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> well,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >shwo,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> said.”</p>
                <p>The number of characters which might be treated as we have dealt with is legion.
                    Little has been said on the subject of this peculiarity of the language by
                    native grammarians, who have not done much more for the science of grammar than
                    to divide the characters into tjí <hi rend="italic">Sze tsze</hi> or “dead
                    words,” as they call nouns; ∣¾⅛ <hi rend="italic">Hwδ tsze,</hi> “living words,”
                    or verbs; and <hi rend="italic">Hsü tsze</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> r</hi>
                    “empty words,” or particles. It is worthy of remark that in a great many
                    instances the transition of a character from one part of speech to another is
                    marked by a change of tone. This is the case with the character <hi
                    rend="italic">haο,</hi> of which we have been speaking. When it stands for the
                    adjective “good,” it should be pronounced in the ascending tone <hi
                    rend="italic">haο×'</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when it becomes the verb
                    “to love,” it is transferred to the departing tone Λαox. And in some few cases
                    the character suffers a change of sound as well.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">shih,</hi> the verb “to eat,” is pronounced in the entering or
                    abrupt tone; but it becomes szexinthe departing tone, when it plays the part of
                    a substantive meaning “food.” In a lecture administered to the king of Leang,
                    Mencius, rebuking him, says, J∏Jf⅛ A í£ <hi rend="italic">T™</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ehe</hi><hi rend="italic">shih jin sze</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> “Your dogs and swine eat men’s food.” Hera it will be observed the first
                    must by the rules of position be the verb <hi rend="italic">shih</hi> “to eat,”
                    and by the same necessity this same character at the end of the sentence must be
                    a substantive; and the dictionaries tell us that, when, this is the case, it is
                    pronounced <hi rend="italic">sze.</hi> But though it is true that a vast number
                    of characters can be made to serve a writer in a variety of capacities, yet each
                    belongs more particularly to some one part of speech, and many are identified
                    with that one alone. For instance, we find that certain substantives which
                    express things, such as <hi rend="italic">cho</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> a
                    table,” or e “a chair,” remain fixed as substantives, and that others, if they
                    denote actions, are primarily verbs, and if conditions, such as “honour” or
                    “riches,” are in the first instance adjectives.</p>
                <p>As might be expected from the nature of the language of which this
                    interchangeability forms a part, Chinese admits no variations of gender, and in
                    this particular it agrees with the Manchoo, Mongolian, Turkish, and Finnish
                    families of tongues, in which, as Dr Caldwell points out, not only are all
                    things which are destitute of reason and life denoted by neuter nouns, but no
                    nouns whatever, not even nouns which denote human beings, are regarded in
                    themselves as being masculine or feminine. All nouns as such are neuter, or
                    rather are destitute of gender. “The unimaginative Scythian reduced all things,”
                    adds the doctor, “whether rational or irrational, animate or inanimate, to the
                    same dead level, and regarded them all as impersonal.” But in every language
                    there are certain words the gender of which must necessarily be distinguished,
                    and in common also with the peoples just referred to, to these the Chinese
                    prefix words denoting sex. Thus a son is spoken of as <hi rend="italic">∙J</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">nan tsze</hi> or “man-child,” and a daughter as ⅜ ∙ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> z</hi> p <hi rend="italic">neu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tsze</hi> or “woman-child.” In the case of animals other characters are used.
                    <hi rend="italic">⅛ kung,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> u</hi> noble,”
                    “superior,” is employed to denote the male and ½⅛ <hi rend="italic">mοo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> y</hi><hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> mother,” to
                    indicate the female. Thus ⅛ Rj <hi rend="italic">kung ma</hi> is “a horse,” and
                    ½J J⅞ <hi rend="italic">mοο ma</hi> is “a mare.” With birds other characters are
                    considered more appropriate. Thus, the male is described as <hi rend="italic"
                    >kung,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> martial” or “brave,” and the female as <hi
                    rend="italic">tsze,</hi> “weak,” or “inferior.”</p>
                <p>As regards number, Chinese is left in an equally indefinite condition. As a rule
                    it is the connection of the words of the sentence which determines whether a
                    noun is in the singular or plural. Often, however, the plural is indicated by
                    repeating the noun, as A A <hi rend="italic">jin jin,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi> the men,” or by the presence of a numeral, as in the following
                    expression, taken from the <hi rend="italic">Confucian Analects,</hi> “The three
                    disciples went out.” Here the character <hi rend="italic">san,</hi> " three,”
                    indicates that <hi rend="italic">tsze</hi> is in the plural, although it has no
                    inherent mark of number. Another way of pluralizing a noun is by adding to it
                    one of certain words signifying <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n671/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0671-0658"/> “all” or “many.” The most common of these are <hi
                    rend="italic">chung,</hi> j⅞ <hi rend="italic">choo, ⅞ keae, ⅛fan,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">tâng.</hi> The first four have for their meaning “all/’ and the
                    last, <hi rend="italic">tăng,</hi> means “a class.” Its use, like its meaning,
                    is distinct from the others; they precede the noun, <hi rend="italic">tdng</hi>
                    always follows it, and forms with it a compound such as “animal-class” for
                    animals, “man-class” for men. In colloquial Chinese the character fpj <hi
                    rend="italic">mun</hi> has been adopted as a sign of the plural, but its use is
                    almost entirely confined to the personal pronouns. Thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >wo</hi> means “I,” and fξfl <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> J <hi rend="italic"
                    >wο mun</hi> “we.”</p>
                <p>The rules of position which serve to fix the parts of speech of the words of a
                    sentence are allowed also in great measure to regulate the cases of nouns and
                    the moods and tenses of verbs. But this is by no means always the case. For
                    example, the possessive case is marked by certain particles of which mention
                    will be made presently; and although European writers on Chinese grammar have
                    been in the habit of considering that when two substantives come together, the
                    first is to be taken as being in the possessive case, thus in the sentence <hi
                    rend="italic">Teen tsze haο heδ,</hi> which we should translate as “the Son of
                    Heaven loves learning,” <hi rend="italic">teen,</hi> they would say, is in the
                    possessive case,—it may be questioned whether such expressions may not be more
                    appropriately considered as compound terms, in the same way, that we treat their
                    equivalents in English. For instance, we should never consider such an
                    expression as “the Chelsea-water-works” to consist of a nominative and two
                    possessive cases, as it would be parsed by these grammarians, were it turned
                    word for word, as it might be, into Chinese. And this treatment becomes still
                    more difficult of adoption when we find, as is often the case in Chinese, a
                    number of substantives strung together, all of which, with the exception of the
                    last, would then have to be considered as a succession of possessive cases. If
                    we take, for example, one of the ordinary marks on porcelain made in China, such
                    as <hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi><hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">9 Wan leíh san neen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ehe,</hi> we should be told to consider <hi rend="italic">Ta ming, Wan
                    leïh,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">neen,</hi> as possessive cases, and that the
                    phrase should be translated, “The manufacture of the third year of (the reign)
                    Wan-leïh of the Ta ming dynasty,” instead of treating it as a compound
                    expression on the “Chelsea-waterworks” principle, thus “The
                    Ta-ming-dynasty-Wan-leïh-third-year-manufacture.”</p>
                <p>Besides, Chinese is .by no means destitute of case-particles. In the literary and
                    colloquial languages the possessive is expressed by suffixing respectively ⅛,
                    <hi rend="italic">ehe</hi> and ∏'j <hi rend="italic">teïh</hi> to the
                    substantive. Thus these particles answer exactly to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >’s</hi> commonly used in English. 5ζ ⅛ <hi rend="italic">F</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> een c</hi><hi rend="italic">^</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ιe</hi><hi rend="italic">9^</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    n</hi> i≡ “The favour of heaven,” or, as we should as often say, “heaven’s
                    favour.” flā ⅜ A ÔÛ $3 <hi rend="italic">⅛</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 0
                    neu</hi><hi rend="italic">jin Mh ⅛</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> οw</hi> i≡
                    “The dog of that woman,” or “That woman’s dog.” If we trace back the
                    case-particle J⅛ <hi rend="italic">ehe</hi> to its earliest use, we find that it
                    was originally a verb, and meant “to proceed to,” and thus, as a sign of the
                    possessive case, it implies the sense of partition which is inherent in our “of”
                    and the French <hi rend="italic">de.</hi> In some instances, by its addition to
                    certain substantives, compound nouns of possession are formed which are capable
                    of being used as adjectives. For example, <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ⅛ <hi
                    rend="italic">kin</hi> is “gold,” and ⅛ is “of gold,” or “golden.” It is used
                    also to express relation, but not as frequently as its colloquial equivalent (Kj
                    <hi rend="italic">teïh,</hi> which is very commonly thus employed. Such
                    expressions as ^∙ J⅞ ¢Í-J <hi rend="italic">kwan ping teïh,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">tăh,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> he who,”
                    <hi rend="italic">kwan,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> rules over,” <hi
                    rend="italic">ping,</hi> “soldiers ”—are in constant use.</p>
                <p>With verbs of giving to and speaking to the dative case is marked by position The
                    person to whom a thing is given immediately follows the verb, and the thing
                    given comes next. The sentence “The prince gave the officer some money,” is in
                    accordance with the Chinese idiom, which would not admit the more usual English
                    form, “The prince gave some money to the officer.” The dative case, with the
                    sense of “for,” is marked by the use of the characters f½j <hi rend="italic"
                    >tae,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> to succeed,” ∣⅜ <hi rend="italic">te,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi> to put another instead of,” and <hi rend="italic">wei,</hi>
                    “to be”; thus <hi rend="italic">tae wο</hi><hi rend="italic">seay shοο,</hi> “to

                <p>The accusative case is as a rule marked by position. But occasionally, as has
                    been shown by Μ. Julien, the particles jy <hi rend="italic">e, ⅞⅛ yu, ∙</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">½* yu,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 5</hi> J <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∙ <hi rend="italic"
                    >hoo,</hi> are disassociated from their usual signification, and are employed
                    simply as signs of this case.</p>
                <p>The instrumental case is indicated by the character <hi rend="italic">e,</hi>
                    “by,” in the language of the books, and by ∫∏ <hi rend="italic">yvng,</hi> “to
                    use,” in the colloquial. As an instance of the use of the first, we may quote
                    the following passage from Mencius :— ItíïlW <hi rend="italic">^</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> aη</hi><hi rend="italic">wang e</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">by</hi> that which is contrary to right principles.”</p>
                <p>The ablative case, having the sense of “from,” is marked by the signs Q <hi
                    rend="italic">tsze,</hi> and ⅛ <hi rend="italic">yew,</hi> and in the colloquial
                    by <hi rend="italic">⅛ (sung,</hi> as in the following examples:—§ J¾</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tsze săng min e lae,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                    Peking.”</p>
                <p>The remarks which have been made on the gender, number, and case of the
                    substantives apply in like manner to the adjectives, and we need only now refer
                    therefore to the manner in which degrees of comparison are formed. The
                    comparative is denoted either by certain particles meaning “more than,” or
                    “beyond,” or in the colloquial by forms of expression such as “This man compared
                    with that man is good,” or again, “This man has not that man’s goodness.” As
                    signs of the superlative, words such as frj <hi rend="italic">tsuy,</hi>
                    “excelling,” ⅛ <hi rend="italic">keïh,</hi> “the highest point,” or ⅜½ <hi
                    rend="italic">shin,</hi> “exceeding” are employed.</p>
                <p>In all Oriental languages the personal pronouns play a prominent part from their
                    number and the variety of equivalent terms, whether of self-depreciation or of
                    complimentary adulation, used to express them; and in Chinese they derive
                    additional importance from the fact that in the absence of all verbal inflexion,
                    they serve to indicate the person, and in the spoken language the number of the
                    verb. <hi rend="italic">⅞ woo,</hi> ¶/J <hi rend="italic">urh,</hi> and ⅛t <hi
                    rend="italic">ke,</hi> are the terms most commonly used in classical writings to
                    signify the first, second, and third persons of the personal pronoun, of which
                    <hi rend="italic">wo,</hi> f⅞^(<hi rend="italic">ne,</hi> and j⅛, <hi
                    rend="italic">ta,</hi> are the common colloquial equivalents. These latter have
                    for their plural <hi rend="italic">wo rnun, ne mun,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ta</hi><hi rend="italic">mun.</hi> Quite separate and apart from these and all
                    their equivalents is the character <hi rend="italic">chin,</hi> which is
                    reserved especially for the emperor, and has been the traditional imperial “We”
                    since the time of the three mythical emperors to whose wisdom, energy, and
                    foresight the greatness of China is attributed by the native historians.</p>
                <p>But not always does the emperor feel himself entitled to use this inherited
                    character. In times of national misfortune he chooses to believe that his own
                    remissness is the cause of the evils which have overtaken the country, and then
                    it is the custom for him to designate himself <hi rend="italic">Kwa jin,</hi> or
                    “Deficient man.” With his subjects the assumption of a similar humble position
                    is habitual, and among acquaintances the place of “I” is nearly always taken by
                    terms by which the speaker seeks to give a complimentary importance to the
                    person addressed at the expense of his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n672/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0672-0659"/> own intellectual or social position. “The
                    dullard,” “the little one,” and “the man of low degree,” are terms most
                    frequently used in this sense, while <hi rend="italic">nu tsai,</hi> or “slave,”
                    is the self-assumed epithet adopted by ministers when addressing the emperor. In
                    like manner the speaker’s relations and personal belongings are spoken of as
                    “the little,” “the mean,” and “the cheap.” The respect due to age guides on the
                    other hand the choice of expressions employed towards the person addressed, who,
                    instead of being called by the second person of the pronoun, hears himself
                    addressed as “Master,” “Old Gentleman,” or “Senior.” The holders of the lower
                    offices, such as the <hi rend="italic">Heen</hi> or district magistrates, are
                    addressed by law as <hi rend="italic">Lao ye</hi> or “Old Fathers as they rise,
                    they become <hi rend="italic">Ta lao ye</hi> “Great Old Fathers;” and when they
                    reach the higher ranks, such as the governors of the provinces, they are called
                    <hi rend="italic">Ta jin</hi> “Great Men.” In the same spirit it is customary to
                    speak of the belongings of another as being “worshipful,” “honourable,” or,
                    “august.”</p>
                <p>History is vague as to the date when the Chinese adopted the numerals they at
                    present employ; but as we find reference to them in the <hi rend="italic">Book
                    of History,</hi> it is fair to infer that they were in existence before the 6th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> They are 17 in number, and are these: <hi

                    and <hi rend="italic">kai,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> a hundred millions.” The
                    last four are now very seldom used, the rest are hourly employed. It will be
                    seen that there is no single numeral between ten and one hundred, and the
                    intervening numbers are therefore formed by <hi rend="italic">slιilι</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> ti</hi> ten” in combination with the lower numerals. For
                    example, the numbers between ten and twenty are expressed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >slιilι</hi> “ten” with the addition of the number required. Thus “thirteen”
                    would be -f* ~ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> t <hi rend="italic">Shih san.</hi>
                    The figures between twenty and a hundred are denoted by -p <hi rend="italic"
                    >shilι,</hi> “ten” preceded by the other numeral, and in this way Ξ+ <hi
                    rend="italic">San shih</hi> would be “thirty.”</p>
                <p>After the explanation given of the manner in which the number, gender, and case
                    of nouns are clearly expressed in composition, it need not be a matter of
                    surprise that by position and the use of particles it is possible to give
                    expression to all the moods and tenses of the verb. Such a fact should not
                    astonish us when it is recollected that, as stated by Marshman, in the case of
                    certain English verbs, such as “to cut,” position is found equal to the task of
                    forming 211 out of the 215 verbal variations which such verbs undergo, and four
                    only are formed by the addition of terminations to the original monosyllable,
                    namely “cuttest,” “cuts,” “cutteth,” and “cutting.” As no change, not even the
                    lengthening of a line, or the addition of a dot, can possibly be effected in a
                    Chinese character without entirely altering its meaning, position has to do
                    everything for the Chinese verb, and it accomplishes its mission in two ways,
                    either by stating the time at which the action has taken place, or is about to
                    take place, or by prefixing or suffixing certain words which by their several
                    meanings supply like information. For instance, in the colloquial sentence ½[1
                    (⅛ 3j¼ <hi rend="italic">joo kin</hi><hi rend="italic">ta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lai, joo kin,</hi></p>
                <p>“now,” indicates that the action is present, and the three characters are to be
                    translated “he is coming.” But if we were to exchange the <hi rend="italic">joo
                    kin</hi> for ∏∫J 4p <hi rend="italic">ming neen,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi>
                    next year,” the verb <hi rend="italic">lai</hi> will be in the future tense,
                    “next year he will come;” and if yet once again we say, <hi rend="italic">shang
                    yuĕ</hi><hi rend="italic">ta</hi><hi rend="italic">lai, shang yuè</hi> meaning
                    “last month,” the verb will then be in the past tense, and the sentence will
                    run, “last month he came.” But more frequently the present tense of the verb is
                    not accompanied with any word to denote the time of the action, and indeed the
                    only tense-particles employed are those which serve to explain the past and
                    future tenses. The characters ^J* <hi rend="italic">leaou,</hi> “to complete,”
                    and <hi rend="italic">kwo,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> to pass over,” are the
                    commonest of those which are suffixed to denote the first, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >'få tseang,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> to take,” and <hi rend="italic"
                    >yaou,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> to want,” are the most frequently used as
                    prefixes to mark the second. Thus, <hi rend="italic">ta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >keu leaou,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ta</hi><hi rend="italic">keu kwo,</hi>
                    would mean “he went,” while <hi rend="italic">ta</hi><hi rend="italic">tseang
                    keu</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ta</hi><hi rend="italic">yaou keu</hi> would be
                    “he will go.”</p>
                <p>In every language, as Marshman has pointed out, “it will sometimes be found
                    necessary to indicate or declare a thing, to command an action to be performed,
                    to express it as desirable, obligatory, or possible, to represent it as
                    conditional, and to describe it in a general way,” and Chinese is no exception
                    to this rule. In the case of the active and infinitive moods, position, which,
                    as we have already seen, has done so much for Chinese grammar, is again equal to
                    the occasion, but the imperative, the optative, and the potential moods all,
                    although not always, have their distinctive signs.</p>
                <p>The third person of the imperative mood, for instance, is formed in modern
                    Chinese by prefixing a verb meaning either “to give” or “to permit,” and answers
                    exactly to our “let.” ∣⅝'f⅛⅛ <hi rend="italic">heu ta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >keu</hi> is “let him go,” <hi rend="italic">heu</hi> meaning “to allow,” “to
                    permit.” The optative mood is formed by the addition of words meaning “to wish”
                    or “to desire,” and the potential by the addition of words implying “power,”
                    “duty,” or “doubt.”</p>
                <p>The above sketch, although necessarily brief, serves to show that by carefully
                    following the laws of Chinese syntax, it is possible to express in Chinese, as
                    exactly as in other languages, all the parts of speech in all their variety of
                    number, gender, case, mood, tense, and person, and therefore every shade of
                    meaning which it is possible to convey by word of mouth. The difficulties of
                    acquiring a knowledge of Chinese have hitherto shared that exaggeration which
                    surrounds the unknown. It is time that the language was better understood, and
                    at this period of the world’s history we cannot afford to leave unnoticed a
                    language so ancient as to dwarf into insignificance the antiquity of western
                    tongues, and one which is the solitary medium of communication between
                    400,000,000 of our fellow-men.</p>
                <p>Having thus attempted to trace the growth of the written Chinese character from
                    its first creation as a hieroglyphic to its final development in the more modem
                    ideophonetic form, and also the rules which govern the position of these
                    characters in a sentence, our object will now be to show the use which Chinese
                    authors have made of the characters and of the grammar to which they are
                    subservient. It was obviously necessary to begin with the language, before
                    dealing with the literature, since some of the leading characteristics of the
                    literature are, as is the case in every tongue, plainly traceable to the
                    structure of the language. The words of a sentence are as a piece of clay in the
                    hands of a potter. If they be soft and pliable, that is to say, if they be
                    capable of inflections and of syntactical motion, they may be moulded to express
                    with varying vigour and force the highest fancies and noblest thoughts of an
                    able writer in all the changing beauty of poetic diction or of rhetorical
                    eloquence. But if on the other hand they be destitute of inflexion, and be
                    cramped by inexorable laws of position, which cannot for a moment be departed
                    from, without a sacrifice of sense, the result must be that the literature of
                    which they are the component parts will partake to some extent of their hard
                    unyielding nature.</p>
                <p>If we turn for a moment to the poetry of ancient Greece and Rome, we find that
                    some of the finest effects have been produced by the power which the inflexional
                    nature <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n673/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0673-0660"/> of those languages gave of transposing the
                    position of words in a sentence, so as to give vigour and grace to the rhythm.
                    To prove the truth of this we have only to take some striking passage, and
                    compare it in the original with a plain straightforward translation in prose.
                    The idea is the same in both, but how differently it appeals to the imagination
                    of the reader. The gem is there, but it has lost the advantage of its setting.
                    It must now be judged by the prosaic rule of its intrinsic value, with no
                    softening surroundings to add grace and brilliancy to its natural beauty.</p>
                <p>But the effective weapon which was thus placed in the hands of the poets and
                    authors of ancient Greece and Rome has been completely denied to Chinese
                    writers. As has been explained, the language is absolutely without inflexion,
                    and the grammar consists so entirely of syntax, that no word can be moved out of
                    its determined position in a sentence, without either changing its value or
                    rendering it meaningless. Thus the literature has lost much of the variety and
                    elegance which belongs by nature to that of the polysyllabic languages. And we
                    might go beyond this and say that the lack of that power of expression which is
                    given by syntactical motion has been accompanied by a blighting influence on the
                    imaginations of Chinese authors. Other causes, to which reference will presently
                    be made, are also to some extent responsible for this result; but in our review
                    of the various branches of Chinese literature, we shall find that those which
                    are most dependent for their successful development on the powers of imagination
                    are those which least repay attention, and that the more excellent are those
                    which contain simple narrations of facts, or consist of the arguments of the
                    philosopher or of the man of science.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding this the Chinese are eminently a literary, in the sense of a
                    reading, people. The system of making competitive examinations the only royal
                    road to posts of honour and emolument, and the law which throws these open to
                    everybody who chooses to compete, have caused a wider diffusion of book learning
                    among the Chinese than is probably to be found among any other people. As to the
                    date when the literature first took its rise, it is impossible to speak with any
                    certainty. The vicissitudes which attended the early manuscripts and books which
                    were collected by private individuals and in the imperial libraries have been
                    such as to render the preservation of any ancient record a matter of wonder.
                    Constant references are found in books to works which are said to have existed
                    at early dates, but of many of these the titles are all that remain to us
                    now.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest published works on which we can lay our hands is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of Changes,</hi> the first, and the most revered, because the
                    least understood, of the nine classics. This work first saw the light within a
                    prison’s walls. In the year 1150 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> its author Wăn
                    Wang was, we are told, imprisoned for a political offence, and sought to while
                    away the tedium of his confinement by tracing out a system of general philosophy
                    from the eight diagrams and their 64 combinations invented by the Emperor Fu-he.
                    These diagrams have been likened to the mystical numbers of Pythagoras, and the
                    leading idea of Wăn Wang’s system seems to have been founded upon the Chinese
                    notions of the creation of the world, according to which all material things
                    proceed from two great male and female vivifying elements, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yin</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Yang,</hi> which in their turn owe their
                    existence to the <hi rend="italic">Tai keih,</hi> or the first great cause. As
                    Sir John Davis says, this “might, with no great impropriety, be styled a sexual
                    system of the universe. They, that is to say the Chinese, maintain that when
                    from the union of the <hi rend="italic">Yang</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yin</hi> all existences, both animate and inanimate, had been produced, the
                    sexual principle was conveyed to and became inherent in all of them. Thus
                    heaven, the sun, day, &amp;c., are considered of the male gender; earth, the
                    moon, night, &lt;fcc., of the female. This notion pervades every department of
                    knowledge in China. It exists in their theories of anatomy and medicine, and is
                    constantly referred to on every subject. The chief divinities worshipped by the
                    emperor as high priest of the state religion are heaven and earth, which in this
                    sense appear to answer in some degree to the <hi rend="italic">ουρανός</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">γη</hi> in the cosmogony of the Greeks.”</p>
                <p>The style and matter of Wăn Wang’s writings were, however, so cramped and vague
                    that Confucius among others attempted the task of elucidating their dark places.
                    Many years the sage spent in endeavours to make straight that which was so
                    crooked; and the only result attained has been to add some inexplicable chapters
                    to an incomprehensible book. But the fact that it gave rise to a system of
                    divination saved it from sharing the fate which, in the year 221 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> befell all books except those on medicine,
                    divination, and husbandry, at the hand of the Emperor Che Hwang-ti of the Tsin
                    dynasty. This monarch ordered, for political reasons, the destruction of all the
                    books to be found within the empire, except those on the subjects just
                    mentioned. Fortunately, no monarch, however powerful, is able to carry out to
                    the letter an order of so inquisitorial a nature; and the roofs of houses, the
                    walls of dwellings, and even the beds of rivers, became the receptacles of the
                    literary treasures of the nation until the tyranny was overpast. The works of
                    Confucius, the <hi rend="italic">Book of History,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Book of Odes,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Spring and Autumn Annals,</hi>
                    together with the <hi rend="italic">Book of Rites,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Four Books</hi> by the disciples of the sage and of Mencius, were
                    all alike condemned to the flames. How all these were preserved we know not, but
                    history tells us that, when in after years efforts were made to restore the <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of History,</hi> 28 sections out of the 100 composing the
                    entire work were taken down from the lips of a blind man who had treasured them
                    in his memory. One other was recovered from a young girl in the province of
                    Honan. And these are all which would probably have come down to us, had not a
                    complete copy been found secreted in the wall of Confucius’s house, when it was
                    pulled down in the year 140 B.c.</p>
                <p>This <hi rend="italic">Book of History</hi> takes us back to about the time of
                    Noah. It consists of a number of records of the Yu, Hea <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> Shang, and Chow dynasties, embracing the period from the middle of the
                    24th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 721 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> These, and a number of other MSS., attracted the attention of
                    Confucius when he was at the court of Chow, and selecting those which he deemed
                    of value, he compiled them in a work which he called the <hi rend="italic">Shoo
                    king</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Book of History.</hi></p>
                <p>This work, as Mr Wells Williams says, “contains the seeds of all things that are
                    valuable in the estimation of the Chinese; it is at once the foundation of their
                    political system, their history, and their religious rites, the basis of their
                    tactics, music, and astronomy.” For the most part it consists of conversations
                    between the kings and their ministers, in which are traced out the same
                    patriarchal principles of government as guide the rulers of the empire at the
                    present day. “Virtue,” said the minister Yih, addressing the emperor, “is the
                    basis of good government; and this consists first in procuring for the people
                    the things necessary for their sustenance, such as water, fire, metals, wood,
                    and grain. The ruler must also think of rendering them virtuous, and of
                    preserving them from whatever can injure life and health. When you would caution
                    them, use gentle words, when you would correct, employ authority.” “Do not be
                    ashamed of mistakes, and thus make them crimes,” was another piece of wholesome
                    advice offered to the emperor by his advisers, the effect of which is still
                    observable in the outspoken confessions of official incompetence which are daily
                    to be met with in the columns of the <hi rend="italic">Peking Gazette.</hi></p>

                <p>As we shall have occasion at a subsequent stage to treat at some length of the
                    compilation which stands next on the list of the classics,—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Book of Odes,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> we pass on to mention a work whose
                    dicta have entered into the very marrow of Chinese life—namely the <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">ke,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Rites.</hi> This work is said to have been compiled by the duke of Chow in the
                    12th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> since which time it has ever been
                    the guide and rule by which Chinamen have regulated all the actions and
                    relations of their lives. No every-day ceremony is too insignificant to escape
                    notice, and no social and domestic duty is considered to be beyond its scope.
                    From the nature of its contents, therefore, it is the work of all the classics
                    which has left the most palpable impression on the manners and customs of the
                    people. Its rules are minutely observed at the present day, and one of the six
                    governing boards at Peking—the Board of Rites—is entirely concerned with seeing
                    that its precepts are carried out throughout the empire.</p>
                <p>Speaking of this work, Callery says with justice, “In ceremonial is summed up the
                    whole soul of the Chinese, and to my mind the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Rites</hi> is the most exact and complete monograph that this nation can give of
                    itself to the rest of the world. Its affections, if it has any, are satisfied by
                    ceremonial; its duties are fulfilled by means of ceremonial. Its virtues and
                    vices are recognized by ceremonial; the natural relations of created beings are
                    essentially connected with ceremonial; in a word, for it ceremonial is man, the
                    man moral, the man politic, and the man religious, in their numberless relations
                    with the family, society, the state, morality, and religion.”</p>
                <p>But though each and all of the classics bear to some extent the impress of
                    Confucius, only one, the <hi rend="italic">Chun Tsew,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spring and Autumn Annals,</hi> was written by him. At first sight, therefore, a
                    more than usual interest attaches to this book, which is not lessened by the
                    statements made by the sage himself, and by contemporary scholars concerning it.
                    “The world,” says Mencius, “was fallen into decay, and right principles had
                    dwindled away. Perverse discourses and oppressive deeds were again waxen rife.
                    Cases were occurring of ministers who murdered their rulers, and of sons who
                    murdered their fathers. Confucius was afraid, and made the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chun tsew.”</hi> As soon as it appeared, we are told that rebellious ministers
                    quaked with fear and undutiful sons were overcome with terror. “Its righteous
                    decisions,” said Confucius himself, “I ventured to make.”</p>
                <p>The title also of the book, we are told, was given it, because its commendations
                    were life-giving like spring, and its censures life-withering like autumn. The
                    expectant student might therefore be excused for anticipating in its pages an
                    intellectual treat. He would look to have the history of the period dealt with
                    treated as a sustained narrative, interspersed with sage reflections and deep
                    analyses of the characters and circumstances of the time. He would expect to
                    find praise and blame distributed with a discriminating pen, and the foul crimes
                    of regicide and murder denounced in impassioned outbursts of indignation. But
                    how different is the book when we take it up! In the words of Dr Legge—“Instead
                    of a history of events woven artistically together, we find a congeries of the
                    briefest possible intimations of matters in which the court and state of Loo
                    were more or less concerned, extending over 242 years, without the slightest
                    tincture of literary ability in the composition, or the slightest indication of
                    judicial opinion on the part of the writer. The paragraphs are always brief.
                    Each one is designed to commemorate a fact; but whether that fact be a display
                    of virtue calculated to command our admiration, or a deed of atrocity fitted to
                    awaken our disgust, it can hardly be said that there is anything in the language
                    to convey to us the shadow of an idea of the author’s feeling about it. The
                    notices, for we cannot call them narratives, are absolutely unimpassioned. A
                    base murder and a shining act of heroism are chronicled just as the eclipses of
                    the sun are chronicled. So and so took place: that is all. No details are given;
                    no judgment is expressed.”</p>
                <p>The following extract from the annals of a year taken at random will be
                    sufficient to show that Dr Legge’s remarks are well founded. “1. In the 15th
                    year in spring the duke went to Tse. 2. A body of men from Tsoo invaded Seu. 3.
                    In the third month the duke had a meeting with the marquis of Tse and others,
                    when they made a covenant in Mow-Kew, and then went on to Kwang. 4. Kung-sun
                    Gaou led a force and, with the great officers of the other princes, endeavoured
                    to relieve Seu. 5. In summer in the 5th month the sun was eclipsed. 6. In autumn
                    in the 7th month an army of Tse and an army of Tsoo invaded Le. 7. In the 8th
                    month there were locusts. 8. The duke’s daughter went to her home in Tsang. 9.
                    On Ke-mao, the last day of the moon, the temple of E-pih was struck by
                    lightning. 10. In winter a body of men from Sung invaded Tsaou.” And so on page
                    after page.</p>
                <p>Having thus reviewed the <hi rend="italic">Five Classics,</hi> we will now
                    briefly consider the <hi rend="italic">Four Books</hi> which, together with
                    those just mentioned, make up the full complement of the <hi rend="italic">Nine
                    Classics.</hi> The first three of them—the <hi rend="italic">Ta-heδ</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Great Learning,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Chung-yung</hi> or the
                    <hi rend="italic">Doctrine of the Mean,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lun-yu</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Confucian Analects</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> are all by
                    the pupils and followers of the sage; while the fourth, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mdng-tsze,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Works of Mencius,</hi> is by a
                    disciple of that philosopher. All these, therefore, represent the views of
                    Confucius, and if we ask what those views point to, we find that they may be
                    summed up in the admonition: “Walk in the trodden paths.” For as Confucius said
                    of himself, he came not to originate but to fulfil, and the primary object of
                    his teaching was to revive in a dissolute age the purity, or supposed purity, of
                    former generations; to quote against the <hi rend="italic">roues</hi> of his day
                    the examples of the ancients, whom he believed to have been scrupulous in
                    fulfilling the universal obligations existing between sovereign and minister,
                    between father and son, between husband and wife, and between friend and friend.
                    He taught that man was a microcosm, and that by striving to improve himself by
                    acquiring knowledge, by purifying his thoughts, by rectifying his heart, and by
                    cultivating his person, he would then be able to regulate his family. When he
                    could regulate his family, he might then be able to govern a state; and when he
                    could govern a state, he might then be trusted to rule an empire. The empire was
                    as one family; and as it was the part of the emperor to cherish and guard his
                    people as a father does a child, so it was the duty of the people to render
                    willing and submissive obedience to their sovereign.</p>
                <p>It is due to these political opinions that Confucius has become such an object of
                    respect to both rulers and the ruled. The former see in his teaching a ready
                    argument for the maintenance of their authority, and the people, believing that
                    heaven has constituted for them rulers and teachers, whose duty it is to extend
                    favour and maintain tranquillity throughout the empire, have at the same time
                    learnt to hold that when the ruler ceases to be a minister of God for good, he
                    forfeits the title by which he holds the throne. Confucius was ambitious, and
                    was a courtier as well as philosopher, and beyond this point he avoided in any
                    shape or way indicating the manner in which an oppressive ruler should be
                    induced to abdicate. No such consideration influenced his disciple Mencius, who,
                    being superior to the ordinary ambitions of man, was superior also to their
                    common timidities, and who with much boldness of utterance freely taught that
                    the people were the most important element in a nation, and the sovereign was
                    the lightest; and he did not scruple to admit the conclusion <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n675/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0675-0662"/> that an iniquitous ruler should be dethroned,
                    and, if circumstances required it, that he should be put to death.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Confucian Analects</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Works of
                    Mencius</hi> differ in their construction from the <hi rend="italic">Great
                    Learning</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Doctrine of the Mean,</hi> both of which
                    are continuous treatises by individual authors; whereas the two first named are
                    records of the sayings and doings of the two sages, compiled from memory by
                    their faithful disciples, and somewhat resemble in construction, but at a vast
                    interval, the plan of the Gospel narrative.</p>
                <p>We have dwelt at some length on the classics, because, since they are the sacred
                    books of China, it is natural to suppose that in them we may find the mainspring
                    of the national literature. Unfortunately, to some extent this is the case, and
                    Confucius has much to answer for, both as regards his teaching and the literary
                    model he bequeathed to his countrymen. Instead of encouraging his disciples to
                    think for themselves, to look into their own hearts, and to acquire that
                    personal knowledge that enables a man to stand alone, he led them out both by
                    precept and example into the dreary waste of cold forma!ism, in which all
                    individuality is lost, and all force and originality of thinking is crushed out.
                    It may be said that, as far as his teachings were concerned, he strove to suit
                    his system to the capacity of his audience; and that he was successful in so
                    doing is proved by the fact that for twenty-two centuries his name has been
                    revered and his precepts have been followed by his countrymen of whatever rank
                    and station in life.</p>
                <p>As has been well observed by Wells Williams, “If Confucius had transmitted to
                    posterity such works as the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Officiis,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Dialogues of
                    Plato,</hi> he would no doubt have taken a higher rank among the commanding
                    intellects of the world; but it may be reasonably doubted whether his influence
                    among his own countrymen would have been as good or as lasting. The variety and
                    minuteness of his instructions for the nurture and education of children, the
                    stress he lays upon filial duty, the detail of etiquette and conduct he gives
                    for the intercourse of all classes and ranks in society, characterize his
                    writings from those of all philosophers in other countries, who, comparatively
                    speaking, gave small thought to the education of the young. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Four Books</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Five Classics</hi> would
                    not, as far as regards their intrinsic character in comparison with other
                    productions, be considered anything more than curiosities in literature, for
                    their antiquity and language, w ere it not for the incomparable influence they
                    have exerted over so many millions of minds.”</p>
                <p>But no such apology can be offered for the example he set them in the substance
                    and style of his writings. And we are forced to the conclusion that, though a
                    man of great force of character, he was yet strangely devoid of imagination, and
                    that, in his blind admiration for the ancients, he constrained himself to walk
                    humbly and passively in the paths that had been traced by others. At all events
                    he has done his countrymen an irreparable injury. The inflexible sterility of
                    the earliest specimens of literature might possibly have been the characteristic
                    of a particular phase in the national mind, but Confucius helped to perpetuate
                    it throughout all generations. As might be expected, in no class of the
                    literature is the effect thus produced more apparent than in the commentaries on
                    the classics. These works are to be numbered by thousands, and, with some few
                    exceptions, they are, as has been said of the writings of the scribes at the
                    time of our Lord, cold in manner, second-hand and iterative in their very
                    essence; with no freshness in them, no force, no fire; servile to all authority,
                    opposed to all independence; never passing a hair’s-breadth beyond the
                    carefully-watched boundary line of precedent; full of balanced inference and
                    orthodox hesitancy, and impossible literalism; elevating mere memory above
                    genius, and repetition above originality.</p>
                <p>But whatever may be the shortcoming of Confucius as a writer, the respect he felt
                    and inculcated for letters gave an impetus to literature. Following the example
                    he set, men began to compile the histories of the various states; and authors
                    with a turn for more original composition, busied themselves with the production
                    of works on such, arts and sciences, including medicine, mathematics, law, and
                    husbandry, as were known to them. It was just as this new industry was beginning
                    to flourish that the Emperor Che Hwang-ti, to whom reference has already been
                    made, an able and ambitious prince, ascended the throne. By a judicious mixture
                    of force and diplomacy, he abolished the feudal states, into which the empire
                    had up to his time been divided, and drew all power and authority into his own
                    hands.</p>
                <p>Estimating the traditions of the past to be almost as potent as Confucius had
                    supposed, and for that very reason deeming them as dangerous to the existence of
                    his rule as Confucius had considered them to be beneficial to the empire, he
                    determined to break with them once and for ever. He therefore issued an order
                    that all books should be burned, except those containing records of his own
                    reign; that all who dared to speak together about the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Odes</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Book of History</hi> (harmless subjects
                    enough, one would think) should be put to death, and their bodies exposed in the
                    market-place; that those who should make mention of the past, so as to blame the
                    present, should be put to death along with their relatives; and that any one
                    possessing a book after the lapse of thirty days from the issuing of the
                    ordinance should be branded and sent to labour on the Great Wall for four years.
                    The publication of this edict was followed shortly afterwards by an order for
                    the execution of upwards of 460 scholars who had failed to obey the mandate of
                    the emperor.</p>
                <p>Curiously enough it was during the reign of this uncompromising enemy to
                    literature that the brush-pencil as at present used in China for writing
                    purposes, was invented,—an invention which implies that about this time a
                    substitute was found for the bamboo tablets which had up to that period served
                    the purposes of paper. At first this new material was a kind of closely woven
                    silk. But this was soon found to be as unsuitable for general purposes from its
                    expense as the tablets had been from their cumbrousness; and shortly after the
                    establishment of the Han dynasty, when the decrees of Che Hwang-ti were reversed
                    and every encouragement was given by the state to men of letters, the Marquis
                    Tsae “invented the manufacture of paper from the inner bark of trees, ends of
                    hemp, old rags, and fishing-nets.” The increased facility thus afforded for the
                    multiplication of books was eagerly taken advantage of; and from the Annals of
                    the Han dynasty, 206 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 25 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> we learn that the imperial library of that reigning house consisted
                    of 3123 sections on the classics, 2705 on philosophy, 1318 of poetry, 790 on
                    military affairs, 2528 on mathematics, and 868 on medicine. But at the end of
                    the second century an insurrection, which brought the Han dynasty to a close,
                    gave another check to the growing literary taste. And though the then reigning
                    emperor, in his flight from his capita] at Lo-yang, attempted to carry off the
                    contents of the imperial library, only half the books reached their destination
                    at Chang-gan, and the remnant was shortly after given to the flames by the
                    successful revolutionists.</p>
                <p>Such as had been the course of literature up to this time, so it continued until
                    the close of the 6th century, when the art of printing, which became known in
                    Europe nearly 900 years later, was invented in China. A well-known Chinese
                    Encyclopaedia tells us that on the 8th day of the 12th month <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n676/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0676-0663"/> of the thirteenth year of the reign of Wăn-ti
                    (593 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> it was ordained by a decree that the
                    various texts in circulation should be collected, and should be engraved on
                    wood, to be printed and published. Thus within a few years of the time when St
                    Augustine brought the enlightening influences of Christianity to these Isles,
                    the art of printing —a civilizing agency second only to Christianity—was made
                    known in China. But at first comparatively little use seems to have been made of
                    the invention, for we are told that though it made some way during the Tang
                    (618- 907) and the five following dynasties (907-960), it only arrived at its
                    full development under the Sang dynasty (960-1127). It was during this last
                    epoch that a further improvement was made in the art by the introduction of
                    movable types, by a blacksmith named Pe Ching. This inventor, writes Μ. Julien,
                    used to take a paste of fine and glutinous clay, and make of it regular plates
                    of the thickness of a piece of money, on which he engraved the characters. For
                    each character he made a type, which he hardened at the fire. He then placed an
                    iron plate on the table, and covered it with a cement composed of resin, wax,
                    and lime. When he wanted to print, he took an iron frame divided by
                    perpendicular threads of the same metal, and placing it on the iron plate,
                    ranged his types in it. The plate was then held near the fire, and when the
                    cement was sufficiently melted, a wooden board was pressed tightly upon it, so
                    as to render the surface of the type perfectly even. This method was neither
                    convenient nor expeditious, so says a Chinese writer, when only a few copies of
                    a book were to be printed; but when a large number were required, it printed
                    them off at a prodigious speed.</p>
                <p>At this and at later periods the art of printing has been turned to no better
                    purpose in China than to the publication of the histories of the various
                    dynasties. Debarred both by the nature of the material at their command and by a
                    lack of original genius from indulging in the higher branches of imaginative
                    writing, Chinese authors have devoted themselves with untiring energy and with
                    very considerable ability to the compilation of information concerning the
                    physical and political features of their own and the neighbouring countries.
                    Each dynasty has its official chronicle of these subjects, and the celebrated
                    collection of twenty-one histories, which forms a well-nigh unbroken record of
                    the nation’s annals, by contemporary authors, from the 3d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> down to the middle of the 17th century, forms a
                    notable monument of the indefatigable industry of their authors. The edition of
                    this huge work which stands on the shelves of the Chinese library at the British
                    Museum is contained in sixty-six European-bound volumes of folio size. In order
                    to facilitate the process of reference the different histories of which it is
                    composed, though they vary considerably in extent, are all formed on the same
                    model. First in order come the Imperial Records, which consist of the purely
                    political events which occurred in each reign; then follow the Memoirs,
                    including articles on mathematical chronology, rites, music, jurisprudence,
                    political economy, state sacrifices, astronomy, elemental influences, geography,
                    literature, biographies, and records of the neighbouring countries.</p>
                <p>On all these subjects they contain a vast amount of valuable and varied
                    information, much of which possesses considerable interest for European readers.
                    The position which China, as a nation, has occupied and maintained through so
                    many centuries has been such as to render her the natural depository of the
                    annals of the kingdoms of Central and Eastern Asia. With Burmah, Cochin-China,
                    Tibet, Japan, and Corea as her vassels, with a never-ceasing relationship with
                    the tribes of Central Asia, kept up as times and circumstances changed, now as
                    subjects, now as allies, and now as enemies, alone unchanging in her political
                    constitution amidst the recurring wrecks of neighbouring states, she has had the
                    means at her command of collecting masses of ethnological information which are
                    beyond the reach of any other people. The movements of the tribes in Central
                    Asia, to which her policy has largely contributed, are all clearly traced in the
                    dynastic annals; and it was with the view of placing the record of these within
                    the reach of European readers that a proposal was recently made to translate, as
                    a beginning, the history of the Han dynasty.</p>
                <p>Allied to these annals are the topographical works of China, which for breadth of
                    scope and for minuteness of detail are scarcely to be equalled in the literature
                    of any other country. The most generally comprehensive of these is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ta Tsing yih tu,ng chi,</hi> which forms a geography of the
                    empire, together with the Chinese districts of Mongolia and Manchuria as
                    existing since the accession of the present dynasty. This work, which consists
                    of 356 books, was published at Peking in the year 1744. In it each province,
                    each prefecture, each department, and each district is separately dealt with;
                    and all are severally treated of under the following twenty-four headings :—1. A
                    table of the changes which the district to be described has undergone during the
                    successive dynasties from the Han downwards; 2. Maps; 3. A list of the distances
                    from the various places to the chief towns of the department; 4. Its
                    astronomical bearings; 5. Its ancient geography; 6. Its geographical position
                    and its notable localities; 7. The manners and customs of the inhabitants; 8.
                    Its fortified places; 9. Its colleges and schools; 10. The census of the
                    population; 11. The taxes on land; 12. Its mountains and rivers; 13. Its
                    antiquities; 14. Its means of defence; 15. Its bridges; 16. Its dykes; 17. Its
                    tombs and monuments; 18. Its temples and ancestral halls; 19. Its Buddhist and
                    Taouist temples; 20. Patriotic native officials from the time of the Han dynasty
                    downwards; 21. Celebrated men and things; 22. Illustrious women; 23. Saints and
                    immortals; 24. The products of the soil</p>
                <p>On this model distinct topographies have also been compiled, under official
                    superintendence, of every province, every prefecture, every department, and
                    almost every district. And not only this, but the water-ways of China, as well
                    as the rivers of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet, have all been accurately
                    surveyed and minutely described. The narrow train of thought, however, into
                    which the system of Chinese education has compressed the mind of the people
                    tends to develop in them a faculty for the observation of minute details rather
                    than to foster the power of taking a correct comprehensive view of any wide
                    subject. This peculiarity is observable in the class of works just spoken of;
                    for while they are wonderfully accurate as to details, their maps and general
                    descriptions are often vague and untrustworthy. But when we remember how only
                    recently the very important duty of causing surveys to be made of the British
                    Islands has been undertaken by the Government, it becomes us rather to speak
                    with respect of the energy and wisdom shown by the Chinese topographers, than to
                    criticise too closely their shortcomings.</p>
                <p>It would not be dealing fairly by Chinese literature were we to leave this part
                    of our subject without referring to the historical and literary encyclopaedias
                    which form so very notable a feature in every library throughout the country.
                    The best known of these compilations, and the one which may be taken as a
                    specimen of the class, is the <hi rend="italic">Wăn been tung kaou,</hi> by Ma
                    Twan-lin. This work has been more largely drawn upon by European authors than
                    has any other Chinese book of reference, and those who are best acquainted with
                    it are those who speak most highly in its praise. “One cannot cease to admire,”
                    says Remusat, “the depth of research which the author was compelled to <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n677/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0677-0664"/> make in order to collect his materials, the
                    sagacity he has shown in the arrangement of them, and the clearness and
                    precision with which he has presented this multitude of objects in every light.
                    It may fairly be said that this excellent work is a library in itself, and that
                    if Chinese literature contained nothing else, it would be worth while to learn
                    the language in order to read it. One has only to choose the subject one wishes
                    to study, and one finds all the facts recorded and classified, all the sources
                    of information indicated, and all the authorities cited and discussed.” “It
                    elevates our opinion,” says Wells Williams, “of a nation whose literature can
                    boast of a work like this exhibiting such patient investigation and candid
                    comparison of authorities, such varied research and just discrimination of what
                    is truly important, and so extensive a mass of facts and opinions upon every
                    subject of historical interest”</p>
                <p>In point of size and importance, however, this encyclopaedia yields place to one
                    other, entitled <hi rend="italic">Koo kin too shoo tseih chiηg,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">A Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books.</hi> During the
                    reign of the Emperor Kang-he (1661— 1721) it occurred to that monarch that, in
                    view of the gradual alterations which were being introduced into the texts of
                    works of interest and value, it would be advisable to reprint such from the old
                    editions. He therefore appointed a commission, and directed them to reprint in
                    one huge collection all such works as they might deem worthy of preservation. A
                    complete set of copper type was cast for the undertaking, and when the
                    commisioners brought their labours to a close, they were able to lay before the
                    emperor a very palpable proof of their diligence in the shape of a compilation
                    consisting of 6109 volumes. The contents they divided under thirty-two heads,
                    embracing works on every subject contained in the national literature. Only a
                    small edition was printed off in the first instance, and before long the
                    Government, yielding to the necessities of a severe monetary crisis, ordered the
                    copper type employed to print it to be melted down for cash. Thus only a few
                    copies of the first edition are in existence, and it is but rarely that one
                    finds its way into the market. It so happens, however, that one is now (1876)
                    for sale at Peking, and it is much to be hoped that this copy of a work which is
                    the largest in the world, unique of its kind, and incapable of reproduction,
                    may, though at present fate is adverse, find its way to the shelves of some one
                    of the great libraries of the West.</p>
                <p>Space would fail were we even to refer to the immense number of biographies and
                    of works on the sciences, on education, and on jurisprudence, which have from
                    time to time issued, and are still issuing, from the presses in China. Nor need
                    the literature of the religious sects of China—the Confucianists, the Buddhists,
                    and the Taouists—detain us long, since the works of Confucius have already been
                    noticed, and since the great bulk of Chinese Buddhist literature is of Indian
                    origin. It remains, therefore, for us to refer only to the Taouist literature,
                    which has its foundation in <hi rend="italic">The Sûtra of Reason and of
                    Virtue</hi> by Laou-tsze, the founder of the sect. Like Confucius, of whom he
                    was a contemporary, he held office at the court of Chow; but being less
                    ambitious than the sage, he retired early from his post, and we are told that as
                    he passed the frontier on his way westward, whither we know not, he placed in
                    the hands of the officer in charge of the frontier guard a small volume, which
                    embodied the results of his meditations. According to the interpretation put
                    upon his system thus expounded by the famous commentator Choo He, it would
                    appear to bear a strong analogy to those of the Quietists and Manicheists.
                    “Laou-tsze’s scheme of philosophy,” he tells us, “consists in modesty,
                    self-emptiness, in being void of desires, quiet and free from exertion, in being
                    self-empty, retiring, and self-controlling in actual life.” But beyond this his
                    great object seems to have been to elucidate and develop his idea of the
                    relations between something which he calls Taou and the universe. To this Taou,
                    Laou-tsze refers all things as the ultimate ideal unity of the universe. All
                    things originate from Taou, conform to Taou, and to Taou they at last return
                    Formless, it is the cause of form. It is an eternal road; along it all beings
                    and all things walk; but no being made it, for it is being itself, and yet
                    nothing. It is the path, and also the path-goers, and everything and nothing,
                    and the cause and effect of all.</p>
                <p>This is a sufficiently mystical foundation to allow of any superstructures,
                    however wildly superstitious, to be based, upon it. And just as the religion of
                    ancient Rome became incrusted and overlaid by superstitious vanities gathered
                    from Egypt, and from wherever the Roman arms penetrated, so the teachings of
                    Laou-tszβ have been debased and disfigured in the hands of later writers, who,
                    casting aside his profound speculations, busy themselves with the pursuit of
                    immortality, the search after the philosopher’s stone, the use of amulets, with
                    the observance of fasts and sacrifices, rituals and charms, and the indefinite
                    multiplication of objects of worship</p>
                <p>In China, as elsewhere, the first development of literary talent is found in
                    poetry. The songs and ballads which form the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Odes,</hi> already spoken of, date back to a time long antecedent to the
                    production of any works of which we have knowledge. In those early days, before
                    China was China, the then empire was divided into a number of feudal states, all
                    of which, however, acknowledged fealty to the ruling sovereign, at whose court
                    were a number of music-masters and historiographers, whose duty it was to
                    collect and set to music the songs of the people, and to preserve the historical
                    records of the empire. In strict imitation of the surroundings of their liege
                    lord the feudatory princes numbered among their retinuea officers of like
                    position and professing similar functions. At stated intervals these princes,
                    accompanied by their followings, were in the habit of meeting the king at
                    certain recognized places to take orders for the future and to receive credit or
                    blame as the case might be for their past conduct. On such occasions the music
                    masters would carry with them the ballads and songs collected in their
                    principalities, and present them to their superior at the royal court. These he
                    would collect and classify, reminding one of Queen Elizabeth’s minister, who,
                    according to the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> “had all manner of books and
                    ballads brought to him, of what kind soever, and took great notice how much they
                    took with the people; upon which he would, and certainly might very well judge
                    of their present dispositions, and of the most proper way of applying them
                    according to his own purposes.” Thus it happened, that at the time of Confucius
                    there existed an official collection of some 3000 songs. On these the sage set
                    to work, and, in the words of the historian Sze-ma Tseen, “he rejected those
                    which were only repetitions of others, and selected those which would be
                    serviceable for the inculcation of propriety and righteousness.” Such he
                    arranged to the number of 311 under four heads, namely, “National Airs,” the
                    “Lesser” and the “Greater Eulogies,” and the “Song of Homage,” and gave the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">She king,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Odes,</hi> to the collection.</p>
                <p>If we can imagine ourselves seated in the study of the royal minister, searching
                    with him into the ballads thus laid before us for an indication of the temper
                    and mind of the people among whom they had had their birth, we should be
                    inclined to congratulate him on the easy task entrusted to him of governing such
                    a population. Through most of them there breathes a quiet calm and patriarchal
                    simplicity of thought and life. There are few sounds of war, little tumult of
                    the camp, but, on the contrary, a spirit of peaceful repose, of family love, and
                    of religious <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0678-0665"/> feeling. We have brought before the minds eye the
                    lowly cottage, where dwell a family united by the bonds of affection and of
                    duty. Their food is the produce of the soil and the spoils of the chase. The
                    highest ambition of the men is to excel as archers and charioteers, and their
                    religious worship is the same as that which, untainted by Buddhism or any other
                    form of philosophical teaching, is now practised at the imperial temples of
                    heaven and earth, by the emperor only as high priest. Their wives are objects of
                    affection and respect, and though in one song we find the belief expressed that
                    “a wise woman will ruin a city,” yet there seems to have been abundance of
                    regard for honest housewives who did their duty, who shared the toil of their
                    husbands, and enjoyed with them the simple pleasures within their reach.</p>
                <p>It is true that now and again we meet with traces of scenes of revelry bordering
                    on licentiousness; but their idyllic surroundings, and the absence of all
                    violence, deprive the most dissolute descriptions of all vulgarity and
                    coarseness. More serious by far are the wailing complaints of misrule and
                    tyranny under which the subjects of certain princes groan. But even here there
                    are no signs of insubordination or tumult; the remedy which suggests itself to a
                    people patient and long-suffering to a degree is to emigrate beyond the reach of
                    the tyrant, not to rise in rebellion against him. In the following lines, for
                    instance, the writer begs his friends to fly with him from the oppression and
                    misery prevailing in his native state, which he likens to the north wind and
                    thickly falling snow :—</p>
                <p>“Cold blows the North wind; Thickly falls the snow.</p>
                <p>Oh come all ye that love me, Let’s join hands and go.</p>
                <p>Can we any longer stay, Victims to this dire dismay! ’’</p>
                <p>Foxes and crows were looked upon as creatures of evil omen, and so, giving play
                    to his imagination, he tells us that the only variations noticeable in the
                    monotony of the present distress were these prognostics of future evil, in these
                    words :—</p>
                <p>“Nought red is seen but foxes, Nor aught else black but crows, Oh come all ye
                    that love me, Let ’s fly before our foes.</p>
                <p>Can we any longer stay, Victims to this dire dismay?</p>
                <p>Though the style and diction of these songs are of the simplest description, yet
                    through some of them there runs a rich vein of sentiment, and in forming a
                    judgment on them it is necessary to remember that they are not studied poems,
                    but simply what they profess to be, songs of the people. Like all political
                    ballads also, many of them refer to contemporary events about which we know next
                    to nothing. We are therefore much in the hands of the commentators, and they
                    tell us that the following song is intended to depict a rural scene, in which an
                    industrious wife impresses on her husband the necessity of early rising, and
                    encourages him to make virtuous and respectable acquaintances :—</p>
                <p>“ ‘ Get up, husband, here ’s the day!</p>
                <p>‘ Not yet, wife, the dawn ’s still grey.</p>
                <p>Get up, sir, and on the right See the morning star shines bright. Shake off
                    slumber, and prepare Ducks and geese to shoot and snare.</p>
                <p>“ ‘All your darts and line may kill I will dress for you with skill. Thus, a
                    blithesome hour we ’ll pass, Brightened by a cheerful glass; While your lute its
                    aid imparts To gratify and soothe our hearts.</p>
                <p>“ ‘ On all whom you may wish to know I ’ll girdle ornaments bestow;</p>
                <p>And girdle ornaments I ’ll send To any one who calls you friend; With him whose
                    love for you’s abiding My girdle ornaments dividing.’ ’’</p>

                <p>One other we will quote, taken from the songs of homage, or hymns which were sung
                    either by or before the emperor when he sacrificed as high priest to God. We are
                    told that this one was sung by King Seuen on the occasion of a great drought in
                    the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In it he expostulates with God
                    for bringing this misery upon him, and expresses his belief that he had a right
                    to expect succour instead of disaster from the Most High.</p>
                <p>“Brightly resplendent in the sky revolved The milky way.</p>
                <p>The monarch cried, Alas!</p>
                <p>What crime is ours, that Heaven thus sends on us Death and Disorder, that with
                    blow on blow Famine attacks us?</p>
                <p>Surely I have grudged</p>
                <p>To God no victims; all our store is spent Of tokens. Why is it I am not
                    heard?</p>
                <p>Rages the drought. The hills are parched, and dry The streams. The demon of the
                    drought Destroys like one who scatters fiery flames.</p>
                <p>Terrified by the burning heat my heart, My mourning heart, seems all consumed
                    with fire. The many dukes and ministers of the past Pay me no heed.</p>
                <p>0 God! from Thy great Heaven Send me permission to withdraw myself Into
                    seclusion.</p>
                <p>Fearful is the drought.</p>
                <p>I hesitate, I dread to go away.</p>
                <p>Why has the drought been sent upon my land <hi rend="italic">ĭ No</hi> cause for
                    it know I. Full early rose My prayers for a good year; not late was I In off

                <p>In the high Heaven God listens not. And yet Surely a reverent man as I have been

                    iii. Ode 4.)</p>
                <p>Such is the poetry of the <hi rend="italic">Book of Ode»,</hi> and such we should
                    have expected to find it, since the earliest specimens of poetry in every land
                    partake of a simple and religious nature, are crude in their measure, and are
                    wanting in that harmony which is begotten of study and cultivation. The Chinese
                    say of poetry that the <hi rend="italic">Book of Odes</hi> may be likened to its
                    roots, that during the Han and Wei dynasties it burst into foliage, and that
                    during the Tang dynasty (620-907) it came into full bloom. Certainly the change
                    that came over it after the time of Confucius is very marked. Instead of the
                    peaceful odes of his day, we find pieces reflecting the unsettled condition of
                    political and social affairs. Songs breathing fire and sword, mingled with wild
                    fancies, the offspring of Taouist teaching, have taken the place of the domestic
                    ballads of the <hi rend="italic">Book of Odes.</hi> The simple monotheistic
                    belief of the early Chinese is exchanged for a superstitious faith in a host of
                    gods and goddesses, who haunt every hill, and dance in every glade. As a
                    specimen of the poetry of this period, we may quote the following “Lament of a
                    Soldier on a Campaign,” by Sun Tsze-king, of the Wei dynasty :—</p>
                <p>“On the hilly way blows the morning breeze; the Autumn shrubs are veiled in mist
                    and rain.</p>
                <p>The whole city escorts us far on our way, providing us with rations for a
                    thousand <hi rend="italic">li.</hi></p>
                <p>Their very worst have the three Fates done. Ah me! how can I be saved? There is
                    nought more bitter than an early death. Do not the Gods desiro to gain perpetual
                    youth?</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n679/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0679-0666"/>
                <p>As Sorrow and Happiness, so are Fortune and Misfortune intermingled. Heaven and
                    Earth are the moulds in which we are formed, and in them is there nothing which
                    does not bear significance.</p>
                <p>Far into the future looks the sage, early striving to avert calamity. But who can
                    examine his own heart, scrutinize it by the light of heaven, regulate it for his
                    present life, and preserve it for the old age which is to come?</p>
                <p>Longer grows the distance from what I have left behind me: my trouble <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> s greater than I can bear. ’</p>
                <p>With other poets this new phase of belief encouraged a contempt for life, and an
                    uncertainty of all beyond it; and these during the first two centuries gave vent
                    to their indifference in odes advocating the Epicurean philosophy, “Let us eat
                    and drink, for to-morrow we die.” Eight short dynasties, times of confusion and
                    disorder, followed after the Han dynasties (206 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    to 221 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> and then came the Tang dynasty (620-907),
                    a period which is looked back upon as being the golden age of literature, as,
                    indeed, it was in every field which marks a nation’s greatness. It was during
                    this epoch that imperial armies occupied Bokhara and Samarcand, that the
                    Buddhist traveller Heuen-tsang made his way to India, and to every spot rendered
                    sacred by the presence of Buddha, and that the softening influences of
                    Christianity were introduced by the Nestorians into the very heart of the
                    empire. It was a time of prosperity and peace. Literature flourished, and skill
                    and art were employed to soften and add harmony to the national poetry. The four
                    syllables, of which nearly all the lines in the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Odes</hi> were composed, were exchanged for five and seven. The subjects also
                    partook of the change. Le Tai-pih, the greatest poet of his time, tuned his lyre
                    to notes on the pleasures of wine and of beauty, which would have done honour to
                    Anacreon. Evening feasts amid the parterres of gardens rich with the bloom of a
                    thousand flowers furnished themes upon which he and his imitators were never
                    tired of dilating. Such sonnets are sometimes pretty, and occasionally the ideas
                    they contain are striking; but the disadvantages of the language and of
                    education weigh heavily upon their authors, and they seldom rise beyond the
                    level of the merest mediocrity. The following is taken from the writings of the
                    poet just mentioned, and is translated <hi rend="italic">lineatim</hi><hi

                <p>The streams and trees glory in the brightness of the Spring, The bright sun
                    illuminates the green shrubs, And the falling flowers are scattered and fly

                <p>So, seated opposite the moon shining o’er the cliff, I drink and sing to the

                <p>Of epic poetry the Chinese know nothing, and this need not surprise us when we
                    remember how entirely that style of writing was an importation from Greece into
                    Western Europe; and Voltaire tells us that, when he was thinking of publishing
                    the <hi rend="italic">Henriade,</hi> he consulted a friend on the subject, who
                    recommended him to give up the undertaking, “for,” said he, “the French have not
                    epic heads.” Neither have the Chinese. A sustained effort of imagination is
                    difficult to them, and the strict laws of rhyme and metre which hamper the poet
                    would make a lengthened poem in Chinese the work of a lifetime. It is probably
                    due to this cause that the literature shows no instance of real dramatic poetry.
                    Their dramas abound with short lyrical pieces, which are introduced to break the
                    monotony of the dialogue; but dramas in verse are unknown, except in the case of
                    low plays written in vulgar rhythm. As, however, love for the drama is one of
                    the most noticeable features of the Chinese character, every encouragement has
                    been given to playwrights, and this branch of literature is therefore well
                    supplied both as regards matter and bulk. The most celebrated plays are
                    contained in a collection entitled <hi rend="italic">The, Hundred Plays of the
                    Yuen Dynasty,</hi> many of which have been translated into European languages,
                    and one of which, <hi rend="italic">the Orphan of Chaou,</hi> served as the
                    groundwork of Voltaire’s tragedy, <hi rend="italic">L</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Orphelin</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Chine.</hi> Their dramas are divided in the playbooks into acts, generally four
                    or five, but as there is an absence of all scenery, and as the dresses are never
                    changed during the piece, the acting is as a rule continuous throughout without
                    break or interval. The stage directions are given in their books as in ours, but
                    not with the same minuteness. “Enter” and “exit” are expressed by “ascend” and
                    “descend,” and “aside,” by “turn the back and say.” By the rules of the Chinese,
                    as was the case also in the Greek drama, only two players are allowed to have
                    possession of the stage at any one time. This, and the absence of all scenery,
                    obliges the dramatists to put in the mouths of the actors long pieces of spoken
                    narrative, much after the manner of the prologues in the plays of Euripides,
                    which appear tame and heavy to a European spectator accustomed to have the plot
                    and locality explained by dialogue and scenery. The plots are for the most part
                    simple and well sustained. The unities, though sometimes observed, are more
                    often disregarded, especially that of place, the characters being frequently
                    sent to different parts of the country in the same act, and made to inform the
                    audience of their whereabouts by the simple expedient of walking up and down the
                    stage, and exclaiming, “Now I am at such and such a place,” or “at such and such
                    a house.” The acting, generally speaking, is good. The Chinese are actors by
                    nature, and are no doubt a good deal improved by their inherent cunning and want
                    of sincerity, which make them quick of observation and fertile in resource, and
                    in every-day life enable them easily to catch the tone of those with whom they
                    associate, and on the stage to assume the characters they wish to represent.</p>
                <p>The theatre is in China, as it was in Greece, national and religious. It is under
                    the direct control of the law, and is closed by imperial edict during all
                    periods of public mourning, while at the same time it plays a prominent part at
                    all the yearly religious festivals. In order to give some idea of the substance
                    and plot of a Chinese drama, we will quote from Sir John Davis’s <hi
                    rend="italic">China</hi> an abstract of a play, which he has translated and
                    published at full length, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Heir in Old Age.</hi>
                    This piece serves, as is observed by the translator, to illustrate the
                    consequences which the Chinese attach to the due performance of the oblations at
                    the tombs of departed ancestors, and also the true relation of the handmaid to
                    the legitimate wife. The <hi rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi> are, he says,
                    “made up entirely of the members of a family in the middle class of life,
                    consisting of a rich old man, his wife, a handmaid, his nephew, his son-in-law,
                    and his daughter.” The old man, having no son to console him in his age, and to
                    perform the obsequies at his tomb, had, like the Jewish patriarch, taken a
                    handmaid, whose pregnancy is announced at the opening of the play, in which the
                    old man commences with saying, “I am a man of Tung-ping Foo,” &amp;c. In order
                    to obtain from Heaven a son, instead of a daughter, he makes a sacrifice of
                    sundry debts due to him, by burning the bonds, and this propitiatory holocaust
                    serves at the same time to quiet some scruples of conscience as to the mode in
                    which part of his money had been acquired. He then delivers over his affairs to
                    his wife and his married daughter, dismissing his nephew (a deceased brother’s
                    son) with a hundred pieces of silver to seek his fortune, as he had been
                    subjected at home to the persecution of the wife. This done, the old man sets
                    out for his estate in the country, recommending the mother <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n680/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0680-0667"/> of his expected son to the humane treatment of
                    the family, and with the hope of receiving from them speedy congratulations on
                    the birth of a son.</p>
                <p>The son-in-law now betrays to the daughter his disappointment at the expected
                    birth, since, if it prove a girl, they shall lose half the family property, and
                    if a son, the whole. His wife quiets him by a hint how easily the handmaid may
                    be got rid of, and the old man persuaded that she had suddenly disappeared; and
                    shortly afterwards both the son-in-law and the audience are left to infer that
                    she had actually contrived to make away with her. In the mean time the old man
                    waits the result in great anxiety; his family appear in succession to console
                    him for the loss of his hopes. In the bitterness of his disappointment, he
                    bursts into tears and expresses his suspicions of foul play. He then attributes
                    his misfortunes to his former thirst for gain, resolves to fast for seven days,
                    and to bestow alms publicly at a neighbouring temple, in the hope that the
                    object of his charity may treat him as a father. Among the beggars at the temple
                    his nephew appears in the most hopeless state of poverty, being reduced to take
                    up his lodgings under the furnace of a pottery; he is insulted by the
                    son-in-law, and reproached by the old wife, but his uncle, moved with
                    compassion, contrives to give him a little money, and earnestly advises him to
                    be punctual in visiting the tombs of his family at the approaching spring,
                    assuring him that a due attention to those sacred rites must ultimately lead to
                    prosperity. It is on the importance attached to the sepulchral ceremonies that
                    the whole drama is made to turn.</p>
                <p>The nephew accordingly appears at the tombs, performs his oblations as well as
                    his poverty will admit, and invokes the shades of his ancestors to grant him
                    their protection. He no sooner departs than the old man appears with his wife,
                    expressing their indignation that their own daughter and son-in-law had
                    neglected to come with the customary offerings. They observe, from the
                    appearances at the sepulchre, that their nephew must have been there. The scene
                    at the tombs, and the reflections of the old man thereon, have considerable
                    interest; he reasons with his wife, and convinces her that the nephew is nearer
                    in blood and more worthy than the son-in-law; she relents, and expresses a wish
                    to make him reparation; he appears, and a reconciliation takes place, and he is
                    received back into the family. The son-in-law and daughter now enter with a
                    great bustle and a procession, to perform the ceremonies, but are received with
                    bitter reproaches for their tardy piety and ingratitude, and forbidden to enter
                    the doors again.</p>
                <p>On the old man’s birthday, however, they claim permission to pay their respects,
                    when, to the boundless surprise and joy of the father, his daughter presents him
                    with the long-lost handmaid and child, both of whom, it appears, had been
                    secreted by the daughter, unknown to her jealous husband, who supposed they were
                    otherwise disposed of. The daughter is taken back, and the old man divides his
                    money in three equal shares, between her, his nephew, and his newly-found
                    son,—the play concluding with expressions of joy and gratitude that the
                    venerable hero of the piece had obtained an “heir in his old age.”</p>
                <p>This play furnishes us with a very good type of Chinese plays in general. The
                    incidents are true to life, but they have no psychological interest about them.
                    There is no delineation of character in it, and there is nothing in the plot to
                    make it more appropriate for the groundwork of a play than for that of a novel.
                    In the works of fiction we are treated only to the same crude narration of
                    facts, without any just representation of nature. Exaggerated sentiments, which
                    always precede correct reasoning and refined simplicity, fill the pages of their
                    works of fiction, rendering them favourites only with those who are taught to
                    judge of them according to their own standard of taste. Of the characters
                    portrayed, we have to judge only from actions attributed to them, which are
                    strung together with no connecting links, except those supplied by the iteration
                    of details, which are wearisome to a degree. Several novels have been translated
                    into English by Sir John Davis and others; but, from the causes I have
                    described, few have attracted any public interest. Some of their shorter tales,
                    being to a great extent purged of the cumbrous repetitions common to larger
                    works, are better fitted for translation, and the novelty of many of the
                    situations and incidents serves to keep alive the attention of the reader.
                    Unfortunately the tone of most Chinese novels is not such as to afford any
                    palliation for the dreariness of their contents. If Chinese novelists are to
                    believed, virtue in women and honour in men are to be found only in a few
                    rarely-gifted individuals, and this has been so constantly insisted on, that it
                    appears to have become one of those beliefs which have been the means of their
                    own justification.</p>
                <p>If then, having considered the past and present literature of China, we cast a
                    glance into the future, the prospect is not encouraging. Already every subject
                    within the scope of Chinese authors has been largely treated of and infinitely
                    elaborated. Every grain of wheat has long ago been beaten out of it, and any
                    further labour expended upon it can but be as thrashing out of straw. The only
                    hope for the future of the literature is that afforded by the importation of
                    foreign knowledge and experience into the country. For many years these can only
                    be introduced in the shape of translations of books. But the time will come when
                    Chinese authors will think for themselves; and when that period arrives, they
                    wiIl learn to estimate their present loudly-vaunted literature at its true
                    value.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.</hi></p>
                <p>The government may be described as a patriarchal despotism. The emperor is the
                    father of his people, and as a father is responsible for the training and
                    behaviour of his children, receiving blame when they prove unworthy, and reward
                    when they show themselves to be virtuous; so is the people’s welfare the
                    emperor’s first care, and their preservation from all harm, both moral and
                    physical, his first duty. When the people become unruly the emperor views their
                    conduct as the result of his own negligence or want of wisdom, and when peace
                    prevails he accepts it as the consequence of his fatherly solicitude and care.
                    Like a father, also, he holds autocratic sway over his household,— the empire.
                    In his hand lies the power of b'fe and death. Whom he will he slays, and whom he
                    will he keeps alive. But there is a limit to his absolutism. The duties
                    attaching to the relations existing between emperor and people are reciprocal;
                    and, while it is the duty of the subject to render willing and submissive
                    obedience to the sovereign so long as his rule is just and beneficent, it is
                    also incumbent on him to resist his authority so soon as he ceases to be a
                    minister of God for good. This sacred right of rebellion was distinctly taught
                    by Confucius, and was emphasized by Mencius, who went the length of asserting
                    that a ruler who, by the practice of injustice and oppression, had forfeited his
                    right to rule, should not only be dethroned, but might, if circumstances
                    required it, be put to death.</p>
                <p>All this carries us back to a very primitive state of society—to one which
                    probably existed among the Chinese immigrants who first settled on the plains of
                    China, and which has been perpetuated down to the present day unaltered and
                    without interruption. That among the changing fates of empires this system
                    should have been so accurately maintained in China through so many centuries is
                    a fact into the causes of which it is worth while to inquire. We find it
                    pictured in the records which make up <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n681/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0681-0668"/> the <hi rend="italic">Book of History,</hi> the
                    earliest of which carry us back to the time of Noah, and we find it enforced in
                    the writings of the great apostle of patriarchal institutions, Confucius, and in
                    all the other works which go to make up the nine classics. The reverence with
                    which these Scriptures are viewed has been the principal means of perpetuating
                    the primitive form of Chinese imperialism. The contents of their pages form the
                    study of every schoolboy, and supply the only themes at the competitive
                    examinations through which every one must pass who seeks an official career.
                    Thus the mind of the nation is constantly and almost exclusively turned towards
                    them, and their dogmas have become part and parcel of the national training. The
                    isolation in which China, owing to her geographical and political position, has
                    been wrapt for so many centuries has prevented the introduction of foreign
                    opinions and literature, and the national mind has been so emasculated by the
                    constant contemplation of these ready-made models of excellence, that neither
                    from without nor from within has there been any temptation to Chinamen, by the
                    creation of new ideas, on this or any other subject, to dissent from the dicta
                    of Confucius and his predecessors, and the result has been that such as the
                    government was in their time so it is at the present day.</p>
                <p>The whole theory of government is the embodiment of parental and filial piety. As
                    the people are the children of the emperor, so is he the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teen-tsze</hi> or the Son of Heaven; and standing in this intermediary
                    position, it pertains to him, and to him alone, to mediate between his father,
                    Heaven, and his children, his subjects. His sacrifices and prayers to Heaven are
                    conducted with great parade and ceremony. The chief of these state observances
                    is the sacrifice at the winter solstice, which is performed before sunrise on
                    the morning of the 21st of December at the altar of Heaven. The form of this
                    altar is peculiar. “It consists of a triple circular terrace, 210 feet wide at
                    the base, 150 in the middle, and 90 at the top The emperor, with his immediate
                    suite, kneels in front of the tablet of Shang-tis (The Supreme Being, or
                    Heaven), and faces the north. The platform is laid with marble stones, forming
                    nine concentric circles; the inner circle consists of nine stones, cut so as to
                    fit with close edges round the central stone, which is a perfect circle. Here
                    the emperor kneels, and is surrounded first by the circles of the terraces and
                    their enclosing walls, and then by the circle of the horizon. He then seems to
                    himself and to his court to be in the centre of the universe, and turning to the
                    north, assuming the attitude of a subject, he acknowledges in prayer and by his
                    position that he is inferior to Heaven, and to Heaven alone. Round him on the
                    pavement are the nine circles of as many Heavens, consisting of nine stones,
                    then eighteen, then twenty-seven, and so on in successive multiples of nine till
                    the square of nine, the favourite number of Chinese philosophy, is reached in
                    the outermost circle of eighty-one stones.” On this occasion, also, a bullock of
                    two years old, and without blemish, is offered as a whole-burntoffering in a
                    green porcelain furnace which stands close beside the altar.</p>
                <p>But though occupying the lofty position described, the power wielded by the
                    emperor of China is circumscribed by ceremonial laws and hampered by precedents.
                    His whole life is one continual round of ceremonial observances. From the day on
                    which he ascends the throne to the time when he is carried to his tomb in the
                    Eastern Hills, his hours and almost minutes have special duties appointed to
                    them by the Board of Rites. He never leaves his palace except on state
                    occasions, and every relaxation from the cares of sovereignty must therefore be
                    found within its walls. It is thus that the temptations of harem life have been
                    the ruin of so many emperors, and it is rarely the case that such sovereigns are
                    to be met with as Kang-he and Keen-lung, who reigned in the last two centuries,
                    and each of whom devoted the sixty years of his reign to the high duties of his
                    position and to the charms of literary pursuits.</p>
                <p>In all affairs of state the emperor is assisted in his deliberations by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nuy</hi><hi rend="italic">ko,</hi> or privy council, which,
                    according to the regulations of the present dynasty, consists of nine Manchoos
                    and seven Chinamen; and the administrative departments are presided over by six
                    boards, namely, the Board of War, the Board of Punishments, the Board of Office,
                    the Board of Ceremonies, the Board of Revenue, and the Board of Works. Besides
                    these there are the Board o( Music and that of the Censors; and this last,
                    though an inferior office, exercises considerable influence, since its officers,
                    both in the capital and in the provinces, are encouraged to criticise freely the
                    actions of the mandarins and even of the emperor himself. Like many of the other
                    branches of Government, this one has fallen a victim to a great extent to the
                    corruption which prevails throughout all the departments, but it is still at
                    times instrumental in bringing to light official misdeeds; and only lately a
                    general in command of an army, acting against the Mahometan rebels in
                    North-Western China, was degraded and dismissed from his post for crimes with
                    which he was first charged by a censor.</p>
                <p>The provincial governments are mainly self-governed. Each province (in a few
                    cases, two conjointly) is presided over by a viceroy, who is supreme within his
                    jurisdiction, and who has, in cases of emergency, the power of life and death in
                    his hands. Next to him comes the governor, whose authority in all matters
                    relating to the province is second only to that of the viceroy. After these two
                    officials the treasurer holds the highest rank. He controls the finances of the
                    whole province, receiving the taxes and paying the salaries of the mandarins.
                    The judge, the salt commissioner, and the grain collector are the only other
                    mandarins whose authority extends over the whole province, the remaining
                    officials being charged with the government of the various divisions into which
                    the provinces are divided. The chief of them is the Taou-tai, or intendant of
                    circuit, who has a direct general superintendence over all the affairs of the
                    circuit intrusted to his charge. Each circuit is divided into a number of
                    prefectures and sub-prefectures which are administered by prefects and
                    sub-prefects, and these, again, are subdivided into districts over each of which
                    is placed a magistrate. Subordinate to this last-named officer are a host of
                    petty officials, among whom the coroner is one of the most important. Each
                    province collects its own taxes, pays its own expenses, and supports its own
                    army and navy. Its officials are held responsible for the preservation of peace
                    within its borders, and are compelled to contribute a fixed sum annually to the
                    expenses of the Peking Government. Mandarins of all classes are divided into
                    nine ranks, each distinguished by the button worn on the top of the cap. These
                    buttons follow thus in order of superiority—first and highest, a plain red
                    button; second, a flowered red button; third, a transparent blue button; fourth,
                    an opaque blue button; fifth, an uncoloured glass button; sixth, a white glass
                    button; seventh, a plain gilt button; eighth, a gilt button, with flowers in
                    relief; ninth, a gilt button, with engraved flowers. These buttons are no
                    indication of the office held by their wearers, but simply of their rank. The
                    peacock’s feather, again, which is worn in the hats, has nothing to do with
                    either the office or the rank of the wearer, but is like the European orders,
                    and is specially granted to individuals as a reward for merit.</p>
                <p>Theoretically the system of government in the provinces is excellent, but as a
                    matter of fact it is corrupt to the core. Several causes have tended to bring
                    about this <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0682-0669"/> disastrous state of things. In the first place,
                    the mandarins, even when they receive their salaries, which is by no means
                    always the case, are so wretchedly underpaid that the money they receive from
                    this source is barely sufficient to support the staff which it is necessary for
                    them to maintain. A district magistrate, for instance, is supposed to receive
                    about £275 per annum, a prefect about £685, and an intendant of circuit about
                    £1035. The pay of the higher officers varies in different parts of the empire.
                    The salary of the viceroy of the two provinces, Kwang-tung and Kwang-se, is said
                    to be about £9000 a year. The consequence is that, as few mandarins have private
                    means, they are obliged to supplement their official incomes by illegal
                    exactions and bribes. And this evil is further heightened by the regulation
                    which forbids that a mandarin should hold any office for more than three years.
                    It becomes the selfish interest, therefore, of every office-holder to get as
                    much out of the people within his jurisdiction as he possibly can in that time.
                    The instant he arrives at his post it is customary for all the subordinate
                    officials to pay their respects to him, on which occasion they are expected to
                    display their loyalty by offering presents of more or less value according to
                    the means at their command. No subaltern dare absent himself, being perfectly
                    aware that such an omission of duty would deprive him of all hope of promotion,
                    and would subject him on the slightest pretence, or even without any pretence
                    whatever, to official persecution and ruin. Then, again, when a suitor comes
                    with a legal cause to the Yamun, or mandarin’s office, he is obliged to fee the
                    mandarin, and all the subordinate officials, the secretary, the police, and the
                    doorkeeper, in proportion to his wealth, or otherwise his chance of gaining a
                    hearing would be very small indeed. In a great many cases also the bribery goes
                    beyond the preliminary fee. In an officialdom, where illegal exactions are
                    recognized, it would be impossible to suppose that the stream of justice should
                    be pure, and a limited acquaintance with the practices of Chinese Yamuns is
                    enough to verify the common belief that justice is bought and sold, and that a
                    suitor’s chance of success is in proportion to his wealth.</p>
                <p>As may readily be imagined, this corruption in high places has a most
                    demoralizing effect on the people generally. Dishonesty prevails to a frightful
                    extent, and with it, of course, untruthfulness. The Chinese set little or no
                    value upon truth, and thus some slight excuse is afforded for the use of torture
                    in their courts of justice; for it is argued that where the value of an oath is
                    not understood, some other means must be resorted to to extract evidence, and
                    the readiest means to hand is doubtless torture. The kind most commonly
                    inflicted is flogging. The obdurate witness is laid flat on his face, and the
                    executioner delivers his blows on the upper part of the thighs with the concave
                    side of a split bamboo, the sharp edges of which mutilate the sufferer terribly.
                    The punishment is continued until the man either supplies the evidence required
                    or becomes insensible. Numberless other forms of torture are occasionally
                    resorted to, such as tying the witness up to a beam by his thumbs and big toes,
                    squeezing his fingers between pieces of bamboo, &amp;c.; and these, of course,
                    vary both in kind and severity, according to the disposition of the presiding
                    mandarin. Theoretically every safeguard is adopted to secure for the public
                    service only officers of enlightened and refined dispositions. The law ordains
                    that every man who wishes to obtain Government employment must qualify himself
                    for office by passing the prescribed competitive examinations; and as there is,
                    speaking generally, no hereditary nobility nor any class equivalent to English
                    country gentlemen, office supplies the only distinguishing rank in the
                    empire.</p>
                <p>The consequence is that it is sought after by all except those who engage in
                    trade. Thus the Government has the cream of the national talent at its disposal,
                    and if posts were only given to the foremost men at the examinations as the law
                    provides, no system could be better, and when it has been carried out China has
                    reaped the benefits of it. Unfortunately, however, it has constantly happened
                    that when the Government has been embarrassed by want of money, offices have
                    been put up for sale, and thus the man who has the longest purse steps into the
                    post of honour; and if, as must often happen, he should chance to be cruel as
                    well as uncultured, unjust as well as ignorant, woe betide the people under him.
                    One great defect in the competitive system in China is that there is no limit to
                    the number of candidates, nor to the age when they may go up for examination,
                    and the result is that, what with the surplus victors and the unsuccessful
                    aspirants who go on trying year after year until they become grey-haired old
                    men, there exists a large non-producing class in the community which acts as a
                    dead weight on the national prosperity.</p>
                <p>It is only natural to expect that in a country where the torture of witnesses is
                    permitted, the punishments inflicted on the guilty should exceed in cruelty, and
                    this is eminently the case in China. The Mongolian race is confessedly
                    obtuse-nerved and insensible to suffering, and no doubt Chinese culprits do not
                    suffer nearly as much as members of more sensitive races would under similar
                    treatment. But even granting this, the refined cruelties perpetrated by Chinamen
                    on Chinamen admit of no apology. Not long since, for instance, at one of the
                    Treaty Ports, an offender was placed in a cage, through the top of which his
                    head protruded, and which was just long enough to allow the tips of his toes to
                    touch the ground. In this position, hanging as it were by his neck, with just
                    enough support from his feet to prevent his neck dislocating, the wretched man
                    remained for days, the object of the jeers and laughter of the passers by, until
                    starvation and exhaustion put an end to his sufferings. As punishments for
                    heinous offences such cruelties would be sufficiently shocking, but the fact
                    that this and kindred tortures are not unfrequently inflicted for very
                    insignificant crimes, and sometimes even to gratify the malice or the greed of
                    the officiating mandarin, is significant of a strangely callous indifference in
                    the Chinese nature to the sufferings of others. For capital offences the usual
                    modes of inflicting the extreme penalty of the law are —in bad cases, such as
                    parricides, “cutting to pieces,” and for less aggravated crimes either
                    strangulation or decapitation. The culprit who is condemned to be “cut to
                    pieces” is fastened to a cross, and while thus suspended cuts are made by the
                    executioner on the fleshy parts of the body, and he is then beheaded.
                    Strangulation is reserved for offenders of high rank, it being considered a
                    privilege to pass out of life with a whole body. When it has been granted to a
                    criminal thus to meet his end, a silken cord is sent to him in prison. No
                    explanatory message is considered necessary, and he is left to consummate his
                    own doom. Sometimes, of course, the prisoner’s nerve forsakes him at the supreme
                    moment, as was the case with a prince of the blood, who in 1861 was presented
                    with a silken cord, for treason. This imperial personage could not make up his
                    mind to be his own executioner, and it became necessary to call in the jailers
                    to carry out the sentence of the law. Decapitation in China is a very speedy
                    death, and were it not that popular sentiment regards it as a peculiarly
                    disgraceful end, it would be a very merciful one. Constant practice makes the
                    executioners wonderfully expert in the performance of their deadly office. No
                    block or resting-place for the head is used. The neck is simply outstretched to
                    its full length by the aid of an assistant, and one blow invariably leaves the
                    body headless.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Social and Domestic Life.</hi></p>
                <p>But side by side with all these horrors there is a vast deal of quiet, happy,
                    domestic life in China. It is not every one who gets into the clutches of the
                    mandarins and their satellites, and as long as a man is loyal to the powers that
                    be, and is not over rich, he may expect to be left alone in undisturbed
                    enjoyment of the pleasures within his reach. And in the ordering of a Chinese
                    household there is much that might be imitated with advantage by European
                    families. The duty of filial piety, which is the final object of Chinese
                    religious teaching, represents much more than the ceremonial observances which
                    outwardly mark its performance. The reverence with which children are taught to
                    regard their parents fosters the affection of which this reverence is the
                    outward and visible sign, and the peace of each household is assured by the
                    presence of a supreme authority, against whose dicta there is no appeal.
                    Although sons very generally remain under their fathers’ roofs after they are
                    married and have themselves become fathers, yet so impossible would it be for a
                    young Chinaman to rebel against, or even to dispute with, his parent that
                    difficulties seldom arise from this close association of several generations.
                    The patriarchal system of family life is dear to the heart of every Chinaman,
                    and when his time comes to die, death loses to him half its terrors if he is
                    assured that his sons will be present at his tomb to perform the customary rites
                    and to offer the prescribed sacrifices. It is his belief that the peace of his
                    soul depends on the due celebration of these posthumous observances, and if he
                    has no son present to officiate, to whom can he look for the performance of them
                    î</p>
                <p>It is mainly due to this cause that early marriages are almost universal in
                    China. Like the Jews of old, the Chinese look upon the possession of children,
                    especially of sons, as the chief blessing of life, and consequently as soon as a
                    young man comes of age his parents cast about to find a helpmate for him. The
                    would-be bridegroom has very little to say in the matter. Marriage is not the
                    result of acquaintanceship ripening into affection, as amongst Western nations.
                    The bridegroom rarely sees his betrothed until she has become his wife. The
                    preliminaries are entirely arranged by a professional “go-between” or
                    “match-maker,” who makes it her duty to acquaint herself with all the
                    marriageable young people of both sexes in the neighbourhood. When employed by
                    the bridegroom’s friends she calls on the parents of some young lady who she
                    considers would make a suitable wife for the future bridegroom, armed with a
                    card on which are inscribed the ancestral name, and the eight symbols which
                    denote the year, month, day, and hour of the birth of the suitor. Should the
                    lady’s parents be inclined to accept the proposal they consult a fortune-teller
                    as to the future prospects of such a union. If the answer be favourable a return
                    card is given to the go-between, and this in turn is submitted to the scrutiny
                    of a fortune-teller employed by the man’s parents. Should the oracles prophesy
                    good concerning the match the bridegroom prepares two large cards on which are
                    written the particulars of the engagement; and on the outer side of the one
                    which he keeps is pasted a paper dragon, and on the one which is sent to the
                    lady, a phoenix, — emblems of conjugal fidelity. Each card is further sewn
                    together with two pieces of red silk. Legend traces the original of these silken
                    cords to the time of the Tang dynasty (618-907). During that period, it is said
                    that a man named Hwuy Ko, while staying at the town of Sung, saw one evening an
                    old man reading a book by the light of the moon, who addressed him thus: “This
                    book is the register of the engagements of marriage for all places under heaven,
                    and in my pockets I have red cords with which I tie together the feet of those
                    who are destined to become man and wife. When this cord has been tied, though
                    the parties are of unfriendly families, or of different nations, their fates are
                    fixed. Your future wife,” said he, “is the child of the old woman who sells
                    vegetables in yonder shop on the north.” Upon hearing this Hwuy Ko started off
                    in search of the old woman, and found her possessed of such a hideous little
                    infant of about twelve months old, that in despair he hired a man to kill the
                    child. Years afterwards the prefect of a neighbouring district gave Hwuy Ko in
                    marriage a beautiful young lady whom he affirmed to be his own daughter. Seeing
                    that his bride always wore an artificial flower over her eyebrow, Hwuy Ko asked
                    her the reason of her doing so. “I am the daughter,” she replied, “of the
                    prefect’s brother who died at Sung when I was an infant, leaving me to the care
                    of an old woman who sold vegetables. One day, when I was out with her in the
                    street a ruffian struck me on my eyebrow, and made such a scar that I am obliged
                    to wear this flower to conceal it.” On hearing this Hwuy Ko recognized the
                    immutability of fate, and from that time forward red silken cords have been
                    entwined in the marriage cards, of every pair in China. Following the exchange
                    of cards, presents of more or less value according to the wealth of the
                    contracting parties pass between the two households, and at last when the happy
                    day has arrived, the bride, surrounded by her friends, starts from her father’s
                    house in a sedan chair for her future home. Half-way between the two houses she
                    is met by a party of the bridegroom’s followers, who escort her the rest of the
                    way. In this custom it is impossible not to see a survival of the primitive
                    custom of marriage by capture. At the present day, in some parts of Central
                    Asia, the bride rides off on horseback at full gallop from the door of her
                    father’s house or tent, followed by the bridegroom, who, after an exciting
                    chase, is allowed to come up with her, and she straightway becomes his property.
                    Among some of the Siberian tribes, again, the bridegroom is obliged to hunt his
                    bride through the compartments of her father’s tent, while old women go through
                    the farce of tripping him up and otherwise hindering him in his pursuit. In more
                    civilized China there are fewer traces of the ancient capture, and the contest
                    has there become but a formal act of taking over the bride on her way to the
                    bridegroom’s house. On alighting from her sedan chair she is led with her head
                    covered into the room where her future husband awaits her. Without exchanging a
                    word they sit down side by side, and each tries to sit on a part of the dress of
                    the other, it being considered that the one who succeeds in so doing will rule
                    in the household. After this silent trial of skill they adjourn to the reception
                    hall, where stands the family altar, and there they worship Heaven, and Earth,
                    and their ancestors. This done, they drink a glass of wine together, when for
                    the first time the bridegroom is allowed to see the face of his bride. Here the
                    marriage ceremony ends, and the guests give themselves up to feasting and
                    rejoicing.</p>
                <p>Like many other apparent paradoxes, the co-existence of infanticide with an
                    universal desire for children among the Chinese admits of a ready explanation.
                    The chief object of desire is the possession of sons, and in the parts of the
                    country where infanticide exists—and this is the case only in poverty-stricken
                    households in certain districts of certain provinces—female infants are the only
                    victims. In some parts of the province of Fuh-keen the people make no attempt to
                    concöal the existence of the practice, and even go the length of defending it.
                    What is the good of rearing daughters, they say; when they are young they are
                    only an expense, and when they reach an age when they might be able to work for
                    their own living, they marry and leave us. But even the poorest people <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n684/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0684-0671"/> nourish and cherish their sons. Their labour soon
                    becomes remunerative, they support their parents in their old age, and when
                    these are gathered to their fathers they perform the prescribed observances at
                    their tombs,—offering sacrifices at fixed periods to the souls of the departed,
                    and keeping the tombs in repair. Should anything interfere with the repose of
                    the dead, the living may expect to be visited with misfortune; and to allow the
                    soul of a parent to pass between its tomb and the households of the descendants,
                    the entrance to the grave must be kept unimpeded. Curiously enough, the tombs,
                    especially in the south of China, are all made in the shape of an Ω. This is
                    probably an importation from the West.</p>
                <p>The principal religions of China are Buddhism, Taouism, and Confucianism, to
                    which must be added Mahometanism in the northern and western provinces of the
                    empire. Buddhism was introduced from India during the 1st century of the
                    Christian era; and thus coming at a time when the national mind had been
                    prepared by the teachings of Confucius and the mysticisms of Laou-tsze for the
                    reception of a religious system which should satisfy the requirements of its
                    higher nature, the new faith spread rapidly through the country, and at the
                    present day numbers more adherents than either of the other two leading
                    religions. Laou-tsze, who was the founder of the Taouist sect, was a
                    contemporary of Confucius. Like that sage also, he held office at the court of
                    Chow, but being disheartened at the want of success attending his efforts to
                    reform the manners of the age, he retired into private life and devoted himself
                    to the composition of <hi rend="italic">The Sŭtra of Reason and Virtue.</hi> In
                    this work he enunciated a scheme of philosophy which bears a strong analogy to
                    the doctrines of the Quietists and Manichaeists, the leading point being the
                    relation between something which he calls <hi rend="italic">Taou</hi> and the
                    universe. The philosophical bearing of his system was, however, soon lost sight
                    of and his profound speculations were exchanged for the pursuit of immortality
                    and the search after the philosopher’s stone by his followers. But while
                    Buddhism and Taouism find their adherents among the common people, Confucianism
                    is <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> the religion of the learned. The
                    opinions and teachings of the sage are their constant study; and at stated
                    periods they assemble in temples devoted to his honour to worship at the shrine
                    of the “Throneless King.” But the process of decay,which has been going on for
                    so many centuries in the distinctive features of these creeds, has served so to
                    obliterate the fines of demarcation which originally separated them, that at the
                    present day the dogmas of Buddha and Laou-tsze and the teachings of Confucius
                    may, as far as the masses are concerned, be treated as the foundations of a
                    common faith.</p>
                <p>Education is probably more widely spread among the male population in China than
                    in any other country. Being the only high road to honour and emolument it is
                    eagerly sought after by all who are desirous of following an official career,
                    while the universal respect for letters which has become a national tradition
                    encourages all of every degree to gain at least a smattering of learning—except
                    the women. Very little trouble is taken with the education of girls. If they are
                    taught to be good needle-women and expert cooks, if they learn to act modestly
                    and to show due deference to their superiors, little more is as a rule required
                    of them. But it is very different with the men. No one can hold any Government
                    office unless he has passed at least the first of the three great literary
                    competitive examinations, and the whole education of boys is arranged with the
                    object of enabling them to pass successfully through these ordeals.
                    Unfortunately for the real education of the aspirants to office, the only
                    subject required of them is a knowledge of the Nine Classics, and the result is
                    that from childhood upwards these works are the only text-books which are put
                    into the hands of Chinese schoolboys. These they are taught to regard as the
                    supreme models of excellence, and any deviation either from the opinions they
                    contain or from the style in which they are written, is looked upon as
                    heretical. The result is that there have grown up in China generation after
                    generation of men who have learned to elevate mere memory above genius, and
                    whose mental powers have been dwarfed by servile imitation and by the paltry
                    literalism of the schools.</p>
                <p>Turning to the every-day customs and manners of the Chinese, it is passing
                    strange to find how diametrically opposed they are to what we are familiar with.
                    In a country “where,” as has been said by Wingrove Cook, “the roses have no
                    fragrance, and the women no petticoats; where the labourer has no Sabbath, and
                    the magistrate no sense of honour; where the needle points to the south, and the
                    sign of being puzzled is to scratch the antipodes of the head; where the place
                    of honour is on the left hand, and the seat of intellect is in the stomach;
                    where to take off your hat is an insolent gesture, and to wear white garments is
                    to put yourself into mourning,” it would at first sight seem useless to seek for
                    any point of similarity with ourselves. But it is extremely probable, for
                    instance, that the choice of the left as the seat of honour is in principle
                    entirely at one with our custom of considering the right hand as the place due
                    to the most highly-honoured guest, and that both are survivals of the ancient
                    and almost universal adoration of the sun. The needle of the Chinese compass
                    points towards the south, and every house in China of any pretensions faces the
                    same way, as well as the state seats in all reception rooms. The place on the
                    left of the host, therefore, is that nearest to the light-bringing,
                    life-producing East, and hence its title to honour; and in the same way the
                    opposite custom among ourselves is susceptible of a like interpretation. In
                    daily life the Chinese are frugal, sober, and industrious. Their wants are few,
                    and they are easily satisfied. The poorer classes live almost entirely on rice
                    and vegetables, to which they sometimes add small pieces of fish or meat. Their
                    clothes are of the cheapest kind, and they are so accustomed to crowded
                    apartments that house rent forms an insignificant item in a Chinaman’s
                    expenditure. Thus a Chinaman can live where a European would starve, and it is
                    on account of the advantages which he thus possesses, combined with sobriety and
                    frugality, that he is able to underbid the American workmen in California, and
                    the English colonist in Australia, in almost every branch of industry. The
                    over-populated condition in which China has been for so many centuries has had a
                    powerful influence in thus moulding the national character. Vast as China is, it
                    cannot contain all those who call themselves her sons and daughters, and in many
                    cities a large section of the inhabitants are driven to live in boats on the
                    neighbouring rivers and lakes. It would be very difficult to say how the boat
                    population provide food for themselves and their families; indeed, were it not
                    for the extreme cheapness of their ordinary daily food, and for their sober
                    habits, they could not do so. Spirits—they have no wine—appear to have no great
                    attraction to Chinamen. They drink them occasionally, and sometimes to excess,
                    but a reeling Chinaman is rarely to be seen in the streets. Drunkenness is not a
                    national vice, but, unfortunately, their abstinence does not extend to opium, a
                    drug which seems to have a greater attraction for them than for any other people
                    nn the face of the earth. They take to it greedily, and when once the habit of
                    smoking it 'becomes confirmed, the difficulty of relinquishing it is exceedingly
                    great. There has, no doubt, been much exaggeration in what has been talked and
                    written on this subject But on the testimony of Chinamen themselves the effects
                    of opium smoking must <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0685-0672"/> be regarded as injurious to health and
                    destructive to all the better parts of man’s nature. From the time of its
                    introduction into the country, the Chinese Government has opposed the traffic;
                    and on the occasion of the last revision of the Treaty by Sir Rutherford A1cock,
                    Prince Kung and his colleagues made a vigorous stand against the clause which
                    legalizes its importation. In this as in other attempts they were unsuccessful,
                    and it remains to be seen whether the policy they appear now to be adopting of
                    encouraging the growth of native opium will extinguish the import trade.</p>
                <p>Since the condusion of the treaty in 1860 numerous attempts have been made to
                    induce the Chinese Government to permit the introduction of railways and
                    telegraphs into China, but to all such counsel the emperor’s advisers have
                    turned a deaf ear. Not that they are ignorant of the advantages to be derived
                    from these weapons of progress, but they consider that these advantages would be
                    dearly bought if the price to be paid is to be the admittance of foreigners into
                    the interior of the country, coupled with the hold on the soil which these would
                    acquire were they allowed to construct lines of railway and telegraphs through
                    the provinces. It is difficult, however, even for so autocratic a Government as
                    that of China, to carry out such a curbing policy, and in one or two instances
                    lately, events have forced an advance beyond the hard and fast line laid down by
                    the Peking mandarins. The first step in this direction was taken during the war
                    in Formosa, when the viceroy of the province of Fuh-keen ordered the
                    construction of a line of telegraph from Pagoda Island to his Yamun at Fuh-chow
                    Foo. His action was disapproved by the Government, and several attempts were
                    made to frustrate the undertaking, but, mainly through the influence of the
                    foreign ministers, who insisted on the fulfilment of the contract with the
                    telegraph company, the line was finished. The introduction of railways is,
                    however, considered to be a more serious matter, and though at several of the
                    arsenals tramways have for some time been employed, no mandarin has, until quite
                    lately, been bold enough to sanction the use of a locomotive. Quite recently the
                    idea was originated of quietly buying up a strip of land between Shanghai and
                    Woo-sung, and of using it for the construction of a railway. The local mandarins
                    and the Peking Government met the projected line with decided opposition; but
                    here again the arguments brought to bear by the resident foreign ministers were
                    sufficiently cogent to induce it to withdraw all actively obstructive measures,
                    and the first railway in China was opened to traffic under the negative approval
                    of the rulers of the soil. Much importance has been attached to this
                    introduction of railways into China, and the crowded trains which daily travel
                    between the two termini are considered to point to the probable speedy extension
                    of railways throughout the country. But the approval given to the Shanghai
                    railway is merely that of the people; and its completion has at present only
                    intensified the determination of the Government to withstand the adoption of the
                    iron road.</p>
