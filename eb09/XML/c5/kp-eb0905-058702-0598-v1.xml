                            Salvatore</hi></label> (1760-1842), one of the greatest musical
                    composers of modern times, was born at Florence, 14th September 1760. His father
                    was accompanyist <hi rend="italic">(moestro al cembalo)</hi> at the Pergola
                    theatre, and himself guided the first musical education of his son, whose talent
                    began to evince itself at a very early period. “I commenced learning music,”
                    Cherubini says of himself, “at six years, composition at nine; the former I was
                    taught by my father, the latter by Bartholomew Felici and his son Alexander.”
                    Italian music at that time was at a low ebb. The popular composers of <hi
                        rend="italic">opera</hi><hi rend="italic">seria</hi> chiefly aimed at
                    inventing pleasing tunes and <hi rend="italic">fioriture</hi> for the vocal
                    display of the singers; the dignity and grandeur of the old Italian school were
                    all but lost. To imbue himself with these great traditions of the past was the
                    chief aim of young Cherubini’s ambition, and for that purpose he went in 1777 to
                    Bologna, where for four years he studied under Joseph Sarti, a well-known
                    composer and theorist of the time, and himself the pupil of the celebrated Padre
                    Martini, one of the greatest contrapuntists Italy has produced. It was in this
                    school that Cherubini laid the foundation of that deep knowledge of his art
                    which gives to all his works the impress of perfect mastership. It was also
                    under Sarti’s guidance that he made his first attempts at dramatic composition.
                    They were preceded, however, by a mass written at the age of thirteen, and
                    various other sacred compositions. Sarti was the composer of numerous operas,
                    amongst which <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Nozze di Donina</hi>
                    may be mentioned as the most successful one. It now became Cherubini’s task to
                    supply the music for the minor characters in his master’s dramatic works, an
                    excellent way of gaining versatility of style and resource, turned to full
                    account by the young composer. His first independent work was called <hi
                        rend="italic">Quinto Fabio,</hi> an <hi rend="italic">opera</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">seria,</hi> in three acts, first performed in 1780, and soon
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">Armida</hi> (1782), <hi rend="italic">Adriano
                        in</hi><hi rend="italic">Siria</hi> (same year), and several other works of
                    a similar kind. At this time of his life his artistic individuality was forming
                    gradually; but as yet he had not emerged from the purely imitative stage of
                    production. Absolute artistic value these juvenile works do not possess, but
                    they tended to prepare Cherubini for greater things, and in the meantime secured
                    him a dignified position amongst contemporary composers. In 1784 he was asked to
                    write two works for the Italian opera in London, one of which, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lafinta ρrincipessa,</hi> was favourably received, while the other, <hi
                        rend="italic">Giulio Sabino,</hi> was “murdered” by the critics, to use the
                    emphatic expression of a contemporary witness. In 1786 he left London, whither
                    he had gone to be present at the production of his operas, and went to Paris.
                    After a short stay in Italy he took up his permanent residence iu the latter
                    city.</p>
                <p>Cherubini may be cited as a striking instance of the amalgamating power inherent
                    in the French type of national culture; Spontini, Meyerbeer, and to some extent
                    Gluck, submitted to the same spell. With the last-mentioned master Cherubini
                    shares the grand declamatory pathos, the classic dignity which characterizes the
                    Augustan age of French tragedy. A work like Cherubini’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >M'edée</hi> is imbued with the same elevation of pathos which in
                    Corneille’s greatest tragedies makes us forget the stilted affectations of his
                    heroes and heroines. The first opera composed by Cherubini in France is called
                        <hi rend="italic">Demophoon,</hi> words by Marmontel. Its merits were
                    appreciated by connoisseurs, but it <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n599/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0905-0599-0588"/> was not a popular success. This, however, was
                    achieved in the most brilliant manner by Cherubini’s next opera, <hi
                        rend="italic">Lodoislca</hi> (1791), which opens the series of great
                    dramatic works belonging to the composer’s second period. The representative
                    production of this period is <hi rend="italic">Médxe,</hi> already alluded to.
                    The main characteristics of the composer’s style have also been briefly touched
                    upon. From a mere musical point of view a bold though always strictly logical
                    sequence of harmonies, a rich vein of melodious developments, and great
                    brilliancy and originality of instrumental effects ought to be added.</p>
                <p>By the production of <hi rend="italic">Médée</hi> (1797) the composer’s
                    reputation was firmly established. All Paris was in rapturous admiration of his
                    genius, with one exception— Napoleon Bonaparte. The young victorious general
                    aspired to musical amateurship, and loved to speak authoritatively on that as on
                    most other subjects. But it was not in Cherubini’s character to bow to any man,
                    however great, in matters artistic. Cherubini’s repeated remonstrances against
                    Napoleon’s exaggerated enthusiasm for Paesiello, Zingarelli, and other ephemeral
                    composers culminated in the blunt repartee,—“Citoyen-général, I perceive that
                    you love only that music which does not prevent you from thinking of your
                    politics.” The emperor remembered the affront offered to the citizen-general,
                    and the appointment of Imperial chapelmaster was given to Lesueur, in spite of
                    the Italian composer’s superior merits. But Cherubini does not seem to have
                    suffered much under this disappointment. Two works replete with serenest joy owe
                    their origin to the period alluded to— <hi rend="italic">Anacreon</hi> (1803)
                    and <hi rend="italic">Les deux Journées</hi> (1804). The last-mentioned work is
                    Cherubini’s masterpiece of comic opera. In it we admire the grace and true <hi
                        rend="italic">gaieté de coeur,</hi> which have made the comic opera of
                    France deservedly famous amongst civilized nations. The libretto of <hi
                        rend="italic">Les deux Journées,</hi> although clever and piquant, does not
                    offer many opportunities for musical expansion, the action, as is usual in
                    French comic opera, being to a great extent carried on in spoken dialogue. But
                    Cherubini has succeeded in delineating with a few graphic touches the import of
                    his characters and situations. A peasant chorus in the third act, a Savoyard’s
                    song, and the couplets of Micheli the jovial water-carrier, are insurpassable
                    specimens of their <hi rend="italic">genre,</hi> equal in melodious beauty and
                    grace to anything that French composers have produced in these forms of art.
                    Cherubini, indeed, ranks with the greatest masters of the French school,—with
                    Gretry, Dalayrac, Auber, and Boieldieu, all of whom he infinitely surpasses as
                    far as musical workmanship is concerned.</p>
                <p>In 1805 Cherubini went to Vienna, in compliance with an invitation to compose an
                    opera for the imperial theatre of that city. Here his chances of success were
                    once more thwarted by his great antagonist Napoleon, who entered Vienna at the
                    head of the victorious French army, and for a time interrupted all artistic
                    enterprise. The personal meeting of emperor and composer was again of anything
                    but a friendly kind. Soon after the performance of his new work <hi
                        rend="italic">Faniska</hi> (1806) at Vienna, Cherubini returned to Paris,
                    and <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> or a long time kept an unbroken silence. His
                    chief occupation was his lessons at the Conservatoire, besides which he filled
                    up great part of the day by cutting the hearts and diamonds of ordinary playing
                    cards into all kinds of fantastic figures and landscapes. The results of his
                    extraordinary ingenuity, carefully framed, covered the walls of his study. An
                    accidental circumstance at last roused him from this morbid indolence. He was
                    staying at a country seat of the Prince de Chimay, where a new church was to be
                    inaugurated. Timidly was an appeal made to him for a religious composition to be
                    performed on the occasion, and in compliance with this request he wrote in a few
                    weeks his .great Mass in F. Thus at a time of life when most artists rest on
                    their laurels he entered a new field of creative labour—that of sacred music. Of
                    the works of Cherubini’s third and perhaps his greatest period only the most
                    important can be mentioned here. They are the Missa Solemnis in D, the
                    coronation mass written for the consecration of Charles X., and the two requiems
                    in C and D, the latter for male voices. Besides these he wrote numerous smaller
                    compositions for the service of the Chapel Royal, most of which are still
                    unpublished. The most striking feature of Cherubini’s sacred compositions is
                    their solemn grandeur of conception, combined with an unequalled mastership of
                    artistic treatment.</p>
                <p>The Restoration of the Bourbons drew Cherubini from his long seclusion. The royal
                    family were eager to show their favour to the opponent of Napoleon Bonaparte.
                    Cherubini was created composer and conductor to the Chapel Royal, and in 1821
                    obtained the permanent directorship of the Conservatoire. His days were
                    prolonged beyond the ordinary age of men, and after having witnessed and partly
                    celebrated numberless revolutions in his adopted country, the more than
                    septuagenarian retained sufficient vigour of mind to write one of his most
                    charming operas when Louis Philippe was king in France. It is called <hi
                        rend="italic">Ali Baba,</hi> and was first performed in 1833. To the list of
                    his dramatic compositions ought also to be added another important opera, <hi
                        rend="italic">Les Abencerrages,</hi> written in 1813, but treated with
                    undeserved neglect by the public. He also wrote several pieces of chamber music,
                    amongst which six quartets for strings, and one quintet and six sonatas for the
                    pianoforte may be mentioned. A great number of his compositions, moreover,
                    remained in manuscript at his death, March 15, 1842. Cherubini’s external
                    bearing was frequently harsh and arrogant; his prejudice against Beethoven, both
                    personally and artistically, is a deplorable instance of his one-sidedness. But
                    his more intimate friends found him kind and faithful. His love of order was
                    carried to excess. All his music was carefully labelled and distributed in
                    pigeon-holes, and even his pocket-handkerchiefs were numbered for consecutive
                    use. To this extreme carefulness we owe a complete catalogue of his own
                    compositions from 1773-1841, edited by M. Bottée de Toulmon, under the title of
