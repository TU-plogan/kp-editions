                    and 22° 20' and 25° 30' W. long., consists of ten islands, viz. :—Sant’ Antao
                    (commonly miswritten St Antonio), São Vicente, Santa Luzia, São Nicolao, Sal,
                    Bõa Vista, Maio, San Thiago (the St Jago of the English), Fogo, and Brava,
                    besides a few uninhabited islets. They form a sort of broken crescent, with the
                    concavity towards the west. The last four constitute the leeward (Sotovento)
                    group and the other six the windward (Barlavento). The distance between the
                    coast of Africa and the nearest island (Bõa Vista) is about 200 miles. Their
                    total area is estimated at 1240 square geographical miles. They belong to
                    Portugal, and derive their name <hi rend="italic">(Ilhas do Cabo Verde),</hi>
                    frequently but erroneously written Cape <hi rend="italic">de</hi> Verd Islands,
                    from the African promontory off which they he, known as Cape Verd, or the Green
                    Cape. The archipelago was partially discovered in 1441 by an expedition fitted
                    out by Dom Henrique of Portugal, under Antonio and Bartolomeo di Nolli; but no
                    settlement was made on the islands till after the voyage of Cada Mosto in
                    1456.</p>

                <p>It is most probable that the islands were uninhabited at the period of the
                    Portuguese discovery. The new settlers, however, imported negroes from the
                    African coast. The population now amounts to upwards of 70,000, and would have
                    been much greater if famine, caused by droughts and epidemics, had not
                    frequently diminished it. The blacks and mulattoes far outnumber the whites,
                    whose constitution is less suited to the climate. Slavery existed in the islands
                    in full force until the Portuguese Government set free the public slaves in
                    1854, and modified the condition of those who belonged to private individuals.
                    At that time the number of persons subjected to “involuntary servitude” amounted
                    to about 6000, but at the census of 1860 they had been reduced to 3979.
                    Criminals are transported thither from the mother country, and the punishment is
                    much dreaded. All the towns are poor, dirty places; even the best have few
                    tolerable houses. The people are mild and hospitable, but indolent and
                    uncleanly. In religion they are Roman Catholics. They are extremely ignorant and
                    superstitious, and many heathen notions and practices prevail among them,
                    brought from the African coast. All the inhabited islands have churches, except
                    S. Luzia. The language is a bastard Portuguese, known to the people of the
                    mother country as <hi rend="italic">lingua creoula.</hi></p>
                <p>The archipelago forms one of the foreign provinces of Portugal, and is under the
                    command of a governor-in-chief appointed by the Crown. There are two principal
                    judges, one for the windward and another for the leeward group, the former with
                    his residence at S. Nicolao, and the latter at Praia; and each island has a
                    military commandant, a few soldiers, and a number of salaried officials, such as
                    police, magistrates, and custom house directors. There is also an ecclesiastical
                    establishment, with a bishop, dean, and canons. In every island there is a
                    primary Government school conducted by the priests, but the attendance is very
                    small, and the children of the wealthier inhabitants are sent to Lisbon for
                    their education. There are no roads in the islands, and ponies and donkeys are
                    the beasts of burden.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Meteorology.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    atmosphere in the vicinity of these islands is generally hazy, especially in the
                    direction of the continent. With occasional exceptions during summer and autumn,
                    the north-east trade is the prevailing wind, blowing most strongly from November
                    to May. The rainy season is during the mouths of August, September, and October,
                    when there is thunder and a light variable wind from south east or south-west,
                    which is principally due to the close approach of the inner margin of the
                    northeast trade winds, and the in-draught to the neighbouring continent,
                    occasioned by the Tarification of the air over the Sahara. The Harmattan, a very
                    dry east wind from the African continent, occasionally makes itself felt. The
                    heat of summer is high, the thermometer ranging from 80° to 90° Fahr, near the
                    sea. The unhealthy season is the period during and following the rains, when
                    vegetation springs up with surprising rapidity, and there is much stagnant
                    water, poisoning the air on the lower grounds. Remittent fevers are then common.
                    The people of all the islands are also subject in May to an endemic of a bilious
                    nature called locally <hi rend="italic">levadiαs,</hi> but the cases rarely
                    assume a dangerous form, and recovery is usually attained in three or four days
                    without medical aid. The droughts already spoken of are sometimes general,
                    sometimes partial. On some of the islands rain has occasionally not fallen for
                    three years. The immediate consequence is a failure.of the crops, and this is
                    followed by the death of great numbers from sheer starvation. To add to these
                    horrors, epidemics usually break out afterwards. These disastrous occurrences
                    have greatly obstructed the progress of the colonies. In the general famine of
                    1730-3, about two-thirds of the population perished, and in that which began in
                    1831-3, 30,000 persons are supposed to have perished. The years 1855 and 1856
                    were also marked, by great distress in several of the islands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Productions, Agriculture, Ac.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    chief occupation of the islanders is cattle-feeding. In some of the islands the
                    making of salt from sea-water employs a considerable number of persons. Orchil
                    is gathered, and the indigo and castor-oil plants, as well as the physic-nut
                    plant <hi rend="italic">(C ureas</hi><hi rend="italic">purgans),</hi> are
                    cultivated. The fruit of the last is exported in large quantities to Portugal,
                    where the oil is expressed and consumed in lamps. Maize, sugar-cane, ami the
                    manioc plant are also much cultivated, as well as cotton and tobacco to a
                    limited extent. Coffee was introduced in 1790, and grows well. Though the soil
                    and climate are fitted to produce many tropical fruits, these receive little
                    attention. Cocoa-nut trees, date-palms, tamarinds, and bananas are seen on most
                    of the islands. Pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and the <hi rend="italic">kalo</hi>
                    are generally cultivated. Wood, except in the interior of S. Antao, is entirely
                    wanting, and the people are often reduced to great straits for firing.</p>
                <p>Quails are found in all the islands; rabbits in Bõa Vista, and in San Thiago and
                    Fogo. Goats and asses are reared, and the skins of the former are exported. The
                    neighbouring sea abounds with fish, and the coral animal is at work building up
                    dangerous reefs on submerged rocks. Turtles come from the African coast to lay
                    their eggs on the sandy shores.</p>
                <p>The exports consist chiefly of coral, salt, physic-nuts, hides, coffee, maize,
                    kidney-beans, sugar-cane spirit, and coarse sugar. The imports are cotton
                    cloths, timber, hardware, crockery, glass, and wine. There is a con siderable
                    intercourse in the way of exchange between tne islands one with anothsr. There
                    is a British consul stationed at Porto Grande in S. Vicente, and a vice-consul
                    at Porto Sal Rey in Bõa Vista. Ou none of the islands have any lighthouses as
                    yet been erected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Botany.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The flora of these islands
                    has been described by Mr P. Barker Webb in his <hi rend="italic">Spicilegia
                    Gorgonea,</hi> a catalogue of all the plants then discovered in the Cape Verd
                    Islands, which forms part of Hooker’s <hi rend="italic">Niger Flora,</hi>
                    London, 1849; also by Dr J. A. Schmidt in his <hi rend="italic">Beiträge

                    Inseln,</hi> Heidelberg, 1852. From these works it appears that the total number
                    of wild flowering plants amounted to 424, of which 77 are monocotyledonous, and
                    347 dicotyledonous. Of the former an asparagus and 14 grasses are peculiar; and
                    of the latter, 50 are peculiar. There are besides 14 ferns, two of which are
                    peculiar. The flora is closely related in the main to that of the
                    neighbouringcontinent,and is strongly impressed with a tropical character.
                    Doubtless a large proportion of the plants have been introduced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The whole archipelago is
                    of volcanic origin, but little is known of its geological structure. Mr Darwin’s
                    examination of San Thiago (St Jago) appears to be the fullest that has been made
                    of any of the islands, and that was only partial. Marine shells are found
                    embedded in tufa at Bõa Vista (as we learn from Bowdich, who visited that island
                    in 1823), showing an upheaval to some extent. In Fogo is a still active volcano
                    several thousand feet high, which merits the investigation of geologists; and
                    indeed all the islands would, doubtless, repay the student of volcanic phenomena
                    for the time and labour bestowed on their examination. For instance, an inquiry
                    into the circumstances under which calcareous sand is thrown upon the island of
                    Bõa Vista, and heaped up by the winds into hills 30 feet high, would probably
                    tend to explain the origin of the superficial layer of similar sand in part of
                    Madeira and Porto Santo.</p>

                <p>N. <hi rend="italic">Antao,</hi> the most north-westerly of the group, has an
                    area of 240 square geographical miles, and a population of about 29,000. Its
                    surface is very rugged, and the interior lofty. The Sugar Loaf, its highest
                    mountain, is thought to reach the altitude of 8000 feet. This island is reputed
                    to be at once the most picturesque, the healthiest, the best watered, and the
                    most fertile of the archipelago. On the other hand, the difficulty of passing
                    from one part to another is very great. There are three indifferent
                    landing-places, of which the most frequented is Ponta do Sol, where the
                    custom-house stands, distant more than a league from the chief town, Ribeira
                    Grande, situated in the north-west of the island, a place of about 7000
                    inhabitants. Tarrafal Bay is spacious, and is sheltered from the prevalent
                    winds. The island produces good coffee and sugar, and abundance of fruit; but
                    the people are reputed to be indolent and inattentive to the advantages which
                    soil and water afford them. Lead is said to be obtained, and there is a current
                    opinion that other metals exist. Somewhere on the island is an extinct crater,
                    from which the people declare that a wind occasionally issues so strong as to
                    fling back any object that may be cast into the hollow.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">&amp; Vicente</hi> (St Vincents) lies adjacent to S. Antao on
                    the east. It has a superficies of 70 square miles, and a population of about
                    1700. At Porto Grande, on the north-west coast, is an extensive and excellent
                    harbour, with a coaling station for British steamers; and barracks and municipal
                    buildings are in course of erection. The island is so exposed to the fury of the
                    north-east winds that not a tree will flourish. Its soil yields very little, and
                    the inhabitants are supplied with grain and fnιit from S. Antao. The distance
                    from S. Vicente to S. Antao is about 8 miles, to S. Luzia about 4 miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Santa</hi><hi rend="italic">Luzia</hi> is a small island
                    between S. Vicente and S. Nicolao, with an area of about 18 square miles. The
                    inhabitants, who are wholly occupied in attending to their cattle, do not exceed
                    a dozen. Much orchil was formerly gathered. A little to the south are the two
                    uninhabited islets of Branca and Rasa.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">S.</hi><hi rend="italic">Nicolao</hi> is a long narrow island
                    of a crescentic shape, with an area of about 115 square geographical miles, and
                    a population of about 6000 persons. The climate is not very healthy. Maize,
                    kidney-beans, manioc, sugar-cane, and vines are cultivated; and in ordinary
                    years grain is exported to the other islands. The interior is mountainous, and
                    has two remarkable hills which can be seen for many leagues; one has the shape
                    of a sugar-loaf, and is near the middle of the island; the other, Monte Gordo,
                    is near the west end, and has a height of 4280 feet. All the other islands of
                    the group can be seen from S. Nicolao in clear weather. Vessels frequently enter
                    Freshwater Bay, near the south-east extremity of the island, for water and fresh
                    provisions; and the custom-house is here. The bishop of the archipelago has his
                    headquarters in the island, and there is also a seminary for priests. The
                    distance from S. Nicolao to S. Vicente is over 20 miles, to Sal, nearly 60
                    miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sal,</hi> a narrow island, through whose centre passes the
                    meridian.of 23°, has a length of 20 miles, an area of 70 square geographical
                    miles, and a population of about 750 persons, one-third of whom are employed in
                    the manufacture of salt, of which about 15,000 tons are manufactured in
                    favourable years. The name is derived from a natural salt-spring, at which the
                    trade commenced; but this has now been abandoned for artificial salinas more
                    conveniently situated. A space of nearly 20 miles intervenes between Sal and Boa
                    Vista.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">B'òa Vista,</hi> the most easterly island of the group, lies in
                    lat. 16° 5' N. and long. 22° 55' W. Its length from east to west is about 17
                    miles, and its breadth from north to south is about 16 miles. Its coast is
                    indented by numerous shallow bays, the largest of which, situated on the western
                    side, serves as a road for shipping. A chain of heights traverses the middle of
                    the island, and there are inferior hilly ranges on each side; the loftiest peak
                    attains the altitude of 1260 feet. All the hills have basaltic summits. The
                    plateau from which the hills rise has a height of about 60 feet above the sea,
                    and is composed chiefly of calcareous sandstone. Near Porta Sal Rey are tufas
                    containing abundance of marine remains; and near the same place is a raised
                    beach containing shells, &amp;c. The superficial calcareous sandstone also
                    abounds in shells. In the north-western angle of the island there is a low tract
                    covered with loose sand, which is blown about by the winds, to the great
                    annoyance of the inhabitants. This part is inundated with water during the rainy
                    season; and here are some extensive salt-pans, where the sea-water is evaporated
                    by the heat of the sun. The inhabitants number about 5000, and the island is in
                    great part uncultivated. Horned cattle and goats are tolerably numerous. Salt
                    and orchil are exported. With the exception of a few cocoa-nut trees, there is
                    no wood; and in the dry season the island offers to the eye nothing but an arid
                    waste. The little vegetation that then exists is in the bottom of ravines, where
                    com, beans, and cotton are cultivated. The springs of good water are few. Porto
                    Sal Rey, on the western side of the island, is the chief town (population about
                    1000); and there are several villages scattered about the island. Remittent
                    fevers are common during and after the rainy season, and diarrhoea, pectoral
                    complaints, and ophthalmia occasionally occur. A good deal of fish is taken on
                    the coast, and supplies the impoverished islands with much of their food.
                    Towards the end of 1845 yellow fever broke out in the island, and carried oft’
                    about a fourteenth of the population. About the beginning of the century there
                    resided on this island a certain Senhor Μanoel Martins, who had great influence
                    and power. He it was who constructed the salt-works in Sal, and laid down there
                    the first iron railway that the Portuguese dominions possessed, for the purpose
                    of conveying the salt from the salinas to the shore.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Maio</hi> has a length of 15 miles, and its area is about 50
                    square geographical miles. The inhabitants, who number 773, derive their support
                    chiefly from their cattle and from the exportation of salt. Fish is abundant.
                    This island is a barren treeless waste, surrounded by dangerous rocks. The best
                    landing-place is at English Road, on the west side. Maio is 35 miles from Bóa
                    Vista, and is separated from San Thiago by a channel 7 miles wide.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">San Thiago</hi> (St Jago), the largest but also the most
                    unhealthy island of the archipelago, has a length of 37 miles, an area of 360
                    square geographical miles, and a population of 32,000 persons. Its geological
                    structure is volcanic, and. part of it has been minutely described by Mr Darwin
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Observations on Volcanic Islands,</hi> 1844. Its
                    interior is very hilly, the highest point being a pointed conical mountain
                    called Pico de Antonio, which attains the altitude of 4500 feet. There are
                    numerous ravines which bring down perennial streams, and in these ravines there
                    is a good deal of cultivated ground, where crops of sugar-cane, maize,
                    kidney-beans, rice, and manioc are raised. Some of the produce is exported to
                    the other islands. Spirit is distilled from the juice of the sugar-cane, and a
                    coarse sugar is also made. The purgerra or physic-nut tree is largely grown, and
                    in 1869 the crop amounted to no less than 15,750 tons. Fine specimens of the
                    baobab may also be seen. The chief port is at Villa da Praia, a town at the
                    southern extremity of the island, with 2000 inhabitants. At this place, called
                    Porta Praya by the English, the governor-general usually resides. Before the
                    establishment of the coal dépôt for British steamers at S. Vicente, it was
                    better known to voyagers than any other town in the group. It stands on a
                    basaltic plateau overhanging the bay, and presents a not unpleasing appearance,
                    with its numerous cocoa-nut trees, and the lofty peak of Antonio rising from
                    behind successive steps of tableland in the background. The streets are wide and
                    well laid out, and there is a large square in the heart of the town. The
                    neighbourhood has a desolate aspect from its utter sterility. On the west coast
                    an inlet penetrates several miles into the interior, but does not afford secure
                    anchorage. In the ravine, at its head, is the town of Ribeira Grande, the former
                    capital of the island, which, with its ruined fort and cathedral, has a
                    picturesque appearance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fogo.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This island is 30 miles
                    distant from San Thiago, and lies between the parallels of 14° 42' and 15° 1' N.
                    lat., and 24° 8' and 24° 32' λV. long. It measures about 12 leagues from N. to
                    S., and about 14 leagues from E. to W. Its area is estimated at 144 square
                    geographical miles. Through the middle runs a mountain ridge of a semicircular
                    form, the concavity being towards the east, and about the centre there rises a
                    volcanic cone to the height of 9150 feet. This volcano produ ced fire
                    uninterruptedly from 1680 to 1713. It has been active several times since then,
                    the last eruptions having taken place in 1847, when a current of lava flowed to
                    the sea; the summit still emits vapour. In one part of the island there are a
                    number of extinct craters where much sulphur could be collected. The only
                    anchorage for vessels of burden is in Luz Bay, on the west side. Deep ravines
                    add to the inequalities of the island, and carry off the rain as soon as it
                    falls. The inhabitants, with great want of foresight, have been in the habit of
                    felling trees, without replanting, so that very few trees are now to be found.
                    The water is good but not abundant. The population amounts to about 8400. Sâo
                    Felippe, the largest town, and the only place with any commerceras a population
                    of about 1000. The chief articles of produce are sugar-cane, ground nuts, sweet
                    potatoes, and cassava. There are few goats and swine, but horned cattle are
                    abundant. This island is reputed to be one of the healthiest of the group; but
                    in addition to the usual endemic, remittent and intermittent fevers manifest
                    themselves in October and November, the intensity of which is in proportion to
                    the abundance of the rains. In July 1855 there was an outbreak of cholera, which
                    attacked upwards of a fourth of the entire population, and carried off nearly
                    650 persons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Brava,</hi> the most southerly of the group, has an area of 36
                    square geographical miles, and its population amounts to nearly 7500, so that it
                    is the most densely populated of all. Its distance from Fogo is about 12 miles.
                    The interior is mountainous, but near the coast the soil is comparatively
                    fertile; its agricultural productions are numerous, and much maize is exported.
                    Whalers resort to this island for supplies, and by their means the scanty
                    resources of the population are eked out. This island is usually covered with
                    dense clouds, otherwise its high land would be seen from a great distance.</p>
