                    critical moment when the free state was in its fullest vigour, but was
                    threatened with sudden and rapid decline. His early youth fell in with the
                    period of Hannibal’s invasion of Italy. Before he had reached middle age Rome
                    had escaped from imminent danger of destruction, and had entered upon its career
                    of universal conquest beyond the limits of the Italian peninsula. He was bred,
                    after the manner of his Latin forefathers, to agriculture, to which he devoted
                    himself assiduously when not engaged in military service. But having attracted
                    the notice of L. Valerius Flaccus, a magnate of the city, he was brought to
                    Rome, and became successively quaestor (204), aedile (199), praetor (198), and
                    consul (195). Meanwhile he served in Africa under Scipio, and took part in the
                    crowning campaign of Zama (202). He had a command in Sardinia, where he first
                    showed his strict pubb'c morality, and again in Spain, which he reduced to
                    subjection, and gained thereby the honour of a triumph (194). In the year 191 he
                    acted as military tribune in the war against Antiochus, and contributed to the
                    great revolution by which Greece was finally delivered from the encroachments of
                    the East, and subjected to the dominion of the West. From this period the morals
                    and principles of the Romans became fatally affected by their contact with the
                    advanced and corrupt civilization of the Hellenic world. Cato was among the
                    first of his countrymen to perceive the danger, and to denounce it. His
                    character as an able soldier was now well established; and henceforth he
                    preferred to serve the state in the Forum at home. For several years he occupied
                    himself in scrutinizing the conduct of the candidates for public honours, and
                    whenever he seemed to detect in them a decline from the stainless virtue of the
                    olden time, he persistently opposed their claims. He questioned the “pretended
                    battles” of Minucius Thermus, and baffled his demand for a triumph (190); he
                    denounced the “peculation” of Acilius Glabrio, the conqueror of Antiochus (189);
                    he declaimed against Fulvius Nobilior, for meanly flattering his soldiers, and
                    for carrying about with him in his campaigns a “frivolous verse-writer,” such as
                    Ennius. If he was not personally engaged in the prosecution of the Scipios
                    (Africanus and Asiaticus) for corruption, it was by his spirit that the attack
                    upon them was animated. Africanus, indeed, refused to reply to the charge,
                    saying only, “Romans, this is the day on which I conquered Hannibal,” and the
                    citizens absolved him by acclamation; nevertheless, so marked was the blot which
                    Cato had hit in the character of the self-seeking commanders of the time, that
                    Africanus himself found it necessary to retire selfbanished to his villa at
                    Liternum.</p>
                <p>But Cato was engaged in making head against corruptions more deeply-seated and
                    more widely-prevalent than these. The pride of conquest, the infection of
                    foreign manners, and the dissolution of national ideas and prejudices had made
                    formidable inroads upon the narrow simplicity of the ancient Romans. Both the
                    Etruscans and the Greeks were imbued with a more refined and artificial culture;
                    and with their higher education and enhanced power of persuasion, both these
                    peoples were now exerting a powerful influence upon the minds of their
                    conquerors. Cato conceived it to be his special mission to resist this invasion.
                    It was in the discharge of the censorship that his character as a maintainer of
                    primitive discipline was most strongly exhibited, and hence that he derived the
                    title by which he is most generally distinguished. He revised with unsparing
                    severity the lists of senators and knights, ejecting from either order the men
                    whom he judged unworthy of it, either from their want of the prescribed means,
                    or from notorious crimes or vices. The expulsion of the great imperator L.
                    Quinctius Flamininus was a splendid example of. his rigid justice. He regulated
                    with pedantic strictness the expenses of the table, and also of dress and
                    personal ornament, especially of the women. He contended gallantly, but even
                    more ineffectually, against bribery at the public elections; and though he
                    gained little success in the crusades to which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n251/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0251-0240"/> he thus religiously devoted himself, it may be
                    allowed that the example of the great censor did actually raise and maintain a
                    higher spirit of public morality among his contemporaries, aud gave
                    encouragement and strength to many struggling consciences even in later
                    generations.</p>
                <p>From the date of his censorship (184) to his death in 149, Cato held no public
                    office at home or abroad; but continued to the last to distinguish himself in
                    the senate as the persistent opponent of the new ideas and the men who supported
                    them. He was struck with horror, along with many other Romans of the graver
                    stamp, at the licence of the Bacchanalian mysteries (181), which he attributed
                    to the fatal influence of Grecian manners; and he vehemently urged the dismissal
                    of the sophists who came as ambassadors from Athens. It was not till his
                    eightieth year that he consented to learn even the rudiments of the Greek
                    language. His speeches, of which as many as 150 were collected, were principally
                    directed against the young free-thinking and loose-principled nobles of the day.
                    It is hard to say, was the remark of Livy, whether he attacked them most or they
                    him; for they too did not fail to retaliate, and when he was required to defend
                    himself in his eighty-first year against a capital charge, he was heard to
                    complain of having to plead his cause before men of other minds and of another
                    generation. Almost his last public act was to urge his countrymen to the third
                    Punic war and the destruction of Carthage. Rome, he constantly declared, could
                    never be safe while so great a city lay so near her ,∙ aud he plucked, on one
                    occasion, from under his robe the fresh figs which, he said, had been gathered
                    but three days before on the coast which fronted the mouth of the Tiber,
                    exclaiming again and again “Delenda est Carthago !”</p>
                <p>The great principle of Cato’s life was to do everything by rule. With him the
                    individual life was a continual discipline, and public life was the discipline
                    of the many. He regarded the individual householder as the germ of the family,
                    the family as the germ of the state. All his actions were measured, and every
                    one assigned to its proper place and hour; he was a great economist of his time,
                    and thereby enabled himself to get through a great variety of work, though it
                    all lay within narrow limits. He exacted similar application from his
                    dependents, and proved himself a hard husband, a strict father, a severe and
                    cruel master. There was little difference, apparently, in the esteem in which he
                    held his wife and his slaves; his pride alone induced him to take a deeper
                    interest and indulge a warmer feeling in regard to his sons. It may be remarked,
                    however, that among the Romans themselves there was little in this behaviour
                    which seemed worthy of censure; it was respected rather as a traditional example
                    of the old Roman manners. In the remarkable passage in which Livy describes the
                    character of Cato <hi rend="italic">(Hist.,</hi> xxxix. 40), there is no word of
                    blame for the rigid discipline of his household.</p>
                <p>During the course of his long and industrious life, Cato contributed to the
                    formation of the Latin language by at leaat two important works, the treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De Re</hi><hi rend="italic">Rustica,</hi> which is supposed to
                    be at least substantially his own, and the <hi rend="italic">Origines,</hi> of
                    which last only fragments remain. The one is a miscellaneous collection of rules
                    of good husbandry, conveying much curious information on the domestic habits of
                    the Romans of his age, the other seems to have been a more methodical
                    compilation of Roman history from the foundation of the city to his own time.
                    The fragments which remain of it furnish us with information which is often
                    interesting, but sometimes perplexing, and it is observed that Livy seems to
                    have made no use of the work of which he could not have been ignorant. Of the
                    numerous speeches of Cato but few passages have been preserved. His collection
                    of <hi rend="italic">Åpophthegmata</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> he was himself
                    curt, caustic, and sententious in conversation—is wholly lost.</p>
                <p>We possess the life of Cato as written by Cornelius Nepos, Plutarch, and Aurelius
                    Victor. Many particulars of his career and character are to be gathered from
                    Livy and Cicero. (c. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.)</hi></p>
