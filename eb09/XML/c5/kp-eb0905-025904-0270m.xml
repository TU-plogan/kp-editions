                    served in the Morea in 1828. When the revolution of 1830 broke out, he was
                    stationed at Arras, and was the first officer of his regiment to declare for the
                    new order of things. In 1831 he incurred the displeasure of the Government of
                    Louis Philippe by joining in a protest against its reactionary tendencies; but
                    in 1832 he was recalled to the service, and sent to Algeria. This continued to
                    be the main sphere of his activity for sixteen years, till the revolution of
                    1848; and he took an active part, though in a subordinate capacity, in the
                    different sieges and campaigns by which Algeria was gradually reduced under
                    French mle. After passing through almost all the successive grades in the army,
                    he was, in 1844, raised to the rank of general of brigade, as a reward for his
                    skill and courage. When the revolution of February (1848) took place, the
                    Provisional Government appointed him governor-general of Algeria; and they
                    shortly after offered him the post of minister at war, which he declined. On his
                    election to the National Assembly, however, Cavaignac returned to Paris. When he
                    arrived on the 17 th May, he found the capital in an extremely critical state.
                    The socialists of Paris, incited and organized by skilful leaders, were in a
                    state of bitter hostility to the National Assembly, and a formidable
                    insurrection was gradually maturing. The National Assembly had proved a bitter
                    disappointment to them; for the peasant proprietors, terrified by the vast
                    increase of taxation, and the general uncertainty of revolution, had returned a
                    decidedly conservative majority. Several collisions had already taken place. The
                    crisis was at last brought about by the threatened abolition of the national
                    workshops <hi rend="italic">(ateliers</hi><hi rend="italic">nationaux),</hi>
                    which the reasonable majority of the Assembly was especially anxious for, as the
                    finances were being ruined by the maintenance in utter idleness of 120,000 men.
                    By the 22d of June a formidable insurrection had been organized, and it remained
                    only for the National Assembly to assert its authority by force of arms.
                    Cavaignac, first as minister at war, and then as dictator, was called to the
                    task of suppressing the revolt. It was no light task, as the national guard was
                    doubtful, regular troops were not at hand in sufficient numbers, and the
                    insurgents had abundant time to prepare themselves. Variously estimated at from
                    30,000 to 60,000 men, well armed and well organized, they occupied the
                    north-eastern part of the city, their front line stretching from the Pantheon on
                    the south of the Seine by the Pont St Michel to the Portes St Martin and St
                    Denis. Resting on the Faubourg St Antoine as central point, and threatening the
                    Hotel de Ville, they had entrenched themselves at every step behind formidable
                    barricades, and were ready to avail themselves of every advantage that ferocity
                    and despair could suggest to them. Cavaignac, knowing the work he had before
                    him, remained inactive, notwithstanding the urgent representations of the βivil
                    members of Government, till a sufficient regular force had been collected. At
                    last, by a strong combined'movement on the two flanks <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n271/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0271-0260"/> and against the centre of the insurgent forces,
                    he attempted to drive them from t*heir barricades,—with doubtful success for
                    some time, as every inch of ground was disputed, and the Government troops were
                    frequently repulsed, till, fresh regiments arriving, he forced his way to the
                    Place de la Bastille, and crushed the insurrection in its headquarters. The
                    contest, which raged from the 23d to the morning of the 26th of June, was,
                    without doubt, the bloodiest and most resolute the streets of Paris have ever
                    seen. It is calculated that more Frenchmen fell in it than in the bloodiest
                    battles of the first empire.</p>
                <p>Cavaignac was severely censured by some for having, by his delay, allowed the
                    insurrection to gather head; but he was declared by an immense majority to have
                    deserved well of his country, and continued to be president of the Executive
                    Committee till the election of a regular president of the republic. It was
                    expected that the suffrages of France would raise Cavaignac to that position.
                    But the mass of the people, and especially the rural population, sick of
                    revolution, and weary even of the moderate republicanism of Cavaignac, were
                    anxious for a stable government. Against the five and a half million votes
                    recorded for Louis Napoleon, Cavaignac received only a million and a half. Not
                    without chagrin at his defeat, he withdrew into the ranks of the opposition. At
                    the <hi rend="italic">coup</hi><hi rend="italic">Petat</hi> of the 2d December
                    1851, he was arrested along with the other members of the opposition; but after
                    a short imprisonment at Ham he was released, and, with his newly-married wife,
                    lived in retirement till his death in 1857. Cavaignac was no statesman, but was
                    a loyal, skilful, and courageous soldier, a zealous republican, and in every way
                    an honourable man.</p>
