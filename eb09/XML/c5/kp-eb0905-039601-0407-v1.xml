                <p><label type="entry">CHAPELAIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean</hi></label>
                    (1595-1674), a French poet and man of letters, was the son of a notary, and was
                    born in Paris. His father destined him for his own profession; but his mother,
                    who had known Ronsard (she was the daughter of a certain Michel Corbière, an
                    intimate friend of the great poet), had determined otherwise. At an early age
                    Chapelain began to qualify himself for literature, acquiring by his own unaided
                    efforts, not only Greek and Latin, but also Italian and Spanish, and even
                    applying himself to medicine. Having finished his studies, he was engaged for a
                    while in teaching Spanish to a young nobleman. He was then appointed tutor to
                    the two sons of a Μ. de la Trousse, grand provost of France. Attached for the
                    next seventeen years to the family of this gentleman, the administration of
                    whose fortune was wholly in his hands, he seems to have published nothing during
                    this period, yet to have acquired a great reputation as a probability. His first
                    work given to the public was a preface for the <hi rend="italic">Adons</hi> of
                    Marini, who printed and published that notorious poem at Paris. This was
                    followed by an excellent translation of Mateo Aleman’s novel, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Guzman de Alfarache,</hi> and by four extremely indifferent odes, one of
                    them addressed to the great Richelieu, whom Chapelain had the honour of
                    grounding in the dramatic unities. Rewarded with a pension of a thousand crowns,
                    and appointed from the first a member of the newly-constituted Academy,
                    Chapelain drew up the plan of the grammar and dictionary, the compilation of
                    which was to be a principal function of the young institution, and at
                    Richelieu’s command prepared a criticism of the <hi rend="italic">Cid.</hi> In
                    1756 he published, in a magnificent form, the first twelve cantos of his
                    celebrated epic <hi rend="italic">La Fuselle,</hi> on which he had been engaged
                    during twenty years. His reputation at this time was so great that six editions
                    of the poem were disposed of in eighteen months. But this was the end of
                    Chapelain, “the legist of Parnassus.” The epigrams of Montdor and Furetière, the
                    slashing satire of Boileau (in this case fairly master of his subject), had done
                    their work, and Chapelain (“le plus grand poète· Français qu’ait jamais été et
                    du plus solide jugement,” as he is called in Colbert’s list) had taken his place
                    among the failures of modern art. The last twelve cantos of <hi rend="italic">La
                        Pusells</hi> never published. A complete manuscript of it exists, with
                    corrections and a preface in the author’s autograph, in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bibliothèque Nationale;</hi> but its readers, it may be presumed, are
                    few.</p>
                <p>In 1662 Chapelain was employed by Colbert to draw up an account of contemporary
                    men of letters, destined to guide the king in his distribution of pensions. In
                    this pamphlet, as in the extracts from his letters published by Camusat in 1726
                        <hi rend="italic">(Mélanges de Littérature tirés des Lettres manuscrites de
                        Chapelain),</hi> he shows to far greater advantage than in his unfortunate
                    epic. His prose is said to be incomparably better than his verse; his criticisms
                    are remarkable for their justice and generosity; his erudition and kindliness of
                    heart are everywhere apparent; the royal attention is directed alike towards the
                    author’s firmest friends and bitterest enemies. The man, indeed, appears to have
                    been as excellent as the poet was worthless. He does not seem to have known
                    jealousy; Corneille was the object of his warmest praises; and to him the young
                    Racine was indebted not only for kindly and seasonable counsel, but also for
                    that pension of six hundred livres which was so useful to him. Moving in the
                    best society, polite and literary, and loaded with honours and pensions, in his
                    old age Chapelain is reported to have become a miser of the most sordid type,
                    the clothes he wore being so patched and clouted as to procure for him the
                    nickname of the Chevalier de 1’Araignée; while Ménage relates that, calling upon
                    the old man after a long estrangement, he found on the hearth the same cinders
                    that he had remarked thereon twelve years before. His avarice, moreover, is said
                    to have been indirectly the cause of his death, which happened in his
                    seventy-ninth year. Some 50,000 crowns, a large fortune for those days, were
                    found in his apartments.</p>
                <p>As a poet, Chapelain seems to occupy on the French side of Parnassus a place
                    analogous to that one filled on the English side by Sir Richard Blackmore. <hi
                        rend="italic">La Pucelle</hi> is an enormous allegorical nightmare, towards
                    a correct appreciation of which the satire of Boileau is said to be the best
                    guide. As a prose-writer and critic, Chapelain seems to have had real merit; in
                    a passage of his, concerning the legendary epic of the Middle Ages, quoted by
                    Sainte-Beuve (who calls him “homme instruit, sinon poète ”), he would appear to
                    have anticipated much of what modern criticism has had to say on the
                    subject.</p>
