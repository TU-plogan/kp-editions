                    ramparts. Its houses are antique and straggling; but there are four fine
                    squares, in one of which, used as the herb-market, is an obelisk in memory of
                    General Marceau, a native of the town. Chartres is theseat of a tribunal of the
                    first instance, a tribunal of commerce, a communal college, and a diocesan
                    seminary; and it has a weekly corn-market, which is one of the largest in France
                    and is well managed by a corporation of women. Its chief manufactures are
                    woollens and leather. Its cathedral of Nôtre Dame, a vast Gothic edifice, with
                    two spires of different construction, is reckoned one of the finest cathedrals
                    in France. It was founded in the 11th century by Bishop Fulbert on the site of
                    an earlier church destroyed by fire in 1020. In 1194 another conflagration laid
                    waste the new building then hardly completed; but clergy and people set
                    zealously to work, and the main part of the present structure was finished by
                    1240. Though there have been numerous minor additions and alterations since that
                    time, the general character of the cathedral is unimpaired. The upper woodwork
                    was consumed by fire in 1830, as well as the beautiful belfry of the old tower,
                    but the rest of the building was saved; and it still preserves some of its
                    magnificent stained-glass windows of the 13th century. (See Bulteau, <hi
                    rend="italic">Descript, de la cathxdr. de Chartres,</hi> 1850.) The churches of
                    St Pierre and St Andró may also be noticed.</p>
                <p>Chartres was one of the principal towns of the Carnutes, and by the Romans was
                    called Autricum, from the river Autura (Eure). From the Romans it passed into
                    the hands of the Frankish kings, and was successively taken by Thierry II., king
                    of Orleans and Burgundy, and by the Normans, who burnt it in 852 and 872. It
                    afterwards fell into the hands of the English, from whom it was recovered in
                    1432. It was attacked unsuccessfully by the Protestants in 1568, and was taken
                    in 1591 by Henry IV., who was consecrated there three years afterwards. In the
                    Franco-Prussian War it was seized by the Germans on 21st Oct. 1870, and
                    continued during the rest of the campaign an important centre of operations.
                    During the Middle Ages it was the chief town of the district of Beauce, and gave
                    its name to the counts of Chartres; and since the time of Louis XIII. the title
                    of duke of Chartres has been hereditary in the family of Orleans. Population of
                    the town in 1872, 19,322; and of the commune, 19,580.</p>
