                    Piano della Magione, stands near Perugia, on the road to Cortona. He was one of
                    the companions and disciples of his countryman St Francis of Assisi, and from
                    sundry indications can hardly have been younger than the latter, born in 1182.
                    John bore a high repute in the order, and took a foremost part in the
                    propagation of its teaching in Northern Europe, holding successively the offices
                    of warden <hi rend="italic">(custos)</hi> in Saxony, and of provincial <hi
                    rend="italic">(minister)</hi> of Germany, and afterwards of Spain, perhaps of
                    Barbary, and of Cologne. He was in the last post at the time of the great Mongol
                    invasion of Eastern Europe and of the disastrous battle of Liegnitz (April 12,
                    1241), which threatened to cast European Christendom beneath the feet of
                    barbarous hordes. The dread of the Tartars was, however, still on men’s mind
                    four years later, when Pope Innocent IV. determined (1245) on sending a mission
                    to the Tartar and other Asiatic princes, the real object of which apparently was
                    to gain trustworthy information regarding the hordes and their purposes.</p>
                <p>At the head of this mission the Pope placed Friar John, at this time certainly
                    not far from 65 years of age, and to his discretion nearly everything in the
                    accomplishment of the mission seems to have been left. The legate started from
                    Lyons, where the Pope then resided, on Easter Day (16th April 1245), accompanied
                    by another friar, who speedily broke down and was left behind. After seeking the
                    counsel of an old friend, Wenceslaus, king of Bohemia, he was joined at Breslau
                    by another minorité, F. Bennet the Pole, appointed to act as interpreter. The
                    onward journey lay by Kiev; the Tartar posts were entered at Kaniev, and thence
                    the route ran across the Dnieper <hi rend="italic">(Neper)</hi> and the Don to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ethil</hi> or Volga, on which stood the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ordu</hi> or camp of Batu, at this time the senior of the Chinghizid family.
                    Here the envoys with their presents had to pass between two fires before being
                    presented to the prince. Batu ordered them to proceed onward to the court of the
                    supreme Kaan in Mongolia, and on Easter Day once more (April 8, 1246) they
                    started on the second and most formidable part of their journey—“so ill,” writes
                    the legate, “that we could scarcely sit a horse; and throughout all that Lent
                    our food had been nought but millet with salt and water, and with only snow
                    melted in a kettle for drink.” Their bodies were tightly bandaged to enable them
                    to endure the excessive fatigue of this enormous ride, which led them across the
                    <hi rend="italic">Jaic</hi> (now called River Ural), and then north of the
                    Caspian and the Aral to the Jaxartes <hi rend="italic">(quidam fluvius magnus
                    cujus nomen ignoramus),</hi> and the Mahometan cities which then stood on its
                    banks; then along the shores of the Dzungarian lakes and so forward, till, on
                    the Feast of St Mary Magdalene (2 2d July), at last they reached the imperial
                    camp called <hi rend="italic">Sira Ordu</hi> (Yellow Pavilion), near the Orkhon
                    River,—this stout-hearted old man having thus ridden something like 3000 miles
                    in 106 days.</p>
                <p>Since the death of Okkodai the imperial authority had been in <hi rend="italic"
                    >interregnum.</hi> Kuyuk, his eldest son, had now been designated to the throne;
                    his formal election in a great <hi rend="italic">Kwmltai,</hi> or diet of the
                    tribes, took place while the friars were at Sira Ordu, numbered among 3000 to
                    4000 envoys and deputies from all parts of Asia and Eastern Europe, bearing
                    homage, tribute, and presents. They afterwards, on the 24th of August, witnessed
                    the formal enthronement at another camp in the vicinity called the Golden Ordu,
                    after which they were presented to the emperor.</p>
                <p>It was not till November that they got their dismissal, bearing a letter to the
                    Pope in Mongol, Arabic, and Latin, which was little else than a brief imperious
                    assertion of the Kaan’s office as the scourge of God. Then commenced their long
                    winter journey homeward; often they had to lie on the bare snow, or on the
                    ground scraped bare of snow with the traveller’s foot. They reached Kiev on the
                    9th of June 1247. There, and on their further journey, the Slavonic Christians
                    welcomed them as risen from the dead, with festive hospitality. Crossing the
                    Rhine at Cologne, they found the Pope still at Lyons, and there delivered their
                    report and the Kaan’s letter.</p>
                <p>Not long afterwards Friar John was rewarded with the archbishopric of Antivari in
                    Dalmatia, arid was sent as legate to St Louis. We do not know the year of his
                    death, but it would seem that his <hi rend="italic">successor</hi> in the see
                    died before April 1253; hence it is probable that John did not long survive the
                    hardships of his journey.</p>
                <p>He recorded the information that he had collected in a work, called in one MS.
                    <hi rend="italic">Liber Tartarorum,</hi> in another <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Monga-lorιιm</hi><hi rend="italic">quos</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nos</hi><hi rend="italic">Tartaros appellamus.</hi> The work is
                    divided into eight ample chapters on the country, climate, manners, religion,
                    character, history, policy, and tactics of the Tartars, and on the best way of
                    opposing them, followed by a single chapter on the regions passed through. The
                    book thus answers to its title. Like some other famous mediaeval itineraries it
                    shows an entire absence of a traveller’s or author’s egotism, and contains, even
                    in the last chapter, scarcely any personal narrative. John of Pian del Carpine
                    was not only an old man when he went cheerfully upon this mission, but was, as
                    we know from accidental evidence in the annals of his order, a fat and heavy man
                    <hi rend="italic">(vir gravis</hi><hi rend="italic">et corpulentus),</hi>
                    insomuch that during his preachings in Germany he was fain,contrary to
                    Franciscan precedent, to ride a donkey. Yet not a word approaching more nearly
                    to complaint than those which we have quoted above appears in his narrative. His
                    book, both in its defect of personal detail and in literary quality, is inferior
                    to that written a few years later by a younger brother of the order, and envoy
                    to the Mongol, William de Rubruck. But it is an excellent work, and in orrr own
                    day an educated Mongol, Galsang Gçmboyev, has borne detailed and interesting
                    testimony to the great accuracy of its statements (see <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The book must have been prepared immediately after the return of the traveller,
                    for the Friar Salimbene, who met him in France in the very year of his return
                    (1247), gives us these interesting particulars :—“He was a clever and
                    conversable man, well lettered, a great discourser, and full of a diversity of
                    experience. . . . He wrote a big book about the Tattars <hi rend="italic"
                    >(sic),</hi> and about other marvels that he had seen, and whenever he felt
                    weary of telling about the Tattars, he would cause that book of his to be read,
                    as I have often heard and seen” <hi rend="italic">(Chron. Fr. Salimbeni</hi><hi

                <p>For a long time the work was but partially known, and that chiefly through an
                    abridgment in the vast compilation of Vincent of Beauvais <hi rend="italic"

                    following the traveller’s own, and printed first in 1473. Hakluyt (1598) and
                    Bergeron (1634) published portions of the original work; but the complete and
                    genuine text was not printed till 1839, when it was put forth by the late Μ.
