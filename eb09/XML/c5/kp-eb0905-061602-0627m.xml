                <p><label type="entry">CHILI, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Chile</hi></label>, occupies a
                    strip of land on the western side of South America, extending from 24° to 56°
                    28' <hi rend="italic">50" S.</hi> lat., from the Bay of Mejillones to Cape Horn,
                    a distance of 2270 miles. On the E. it is bounded by the Andes, on the W. by the
                    Pacific Ocean, and on the N. by Bolivia. Its breadth varies from 40 to 200
                    miles, and its area is computed at 218,925 square miles, with a population of
                    2,319,266. Between lat. 24° and 32° (comprehending the provinces of Atacama,
                    Coquimbo, and the northern half of Aconcagua) the principal industry is mining;
                    between lat. 32° and 38° (comprehending the southern half of Aconcagua and the
                    provinces of Valparaiso, Santiago, Colchagua, Curicó, Talca, Maule, Nubie,
                    Concepcion, and part of A rauco) the staples are agricultural produce and coal;
                    while the remaining part produces timber, potatoes, and salted meat. The Andes
                    extend in two parallel lines throughout nearly the entire length of the country.
                    Between these two ranges or “Cordilleras” is a table-land, which attains its
                    greatest breadth between lat. 33° and 40°, and which narrows both towards the
                    northern and southern extremity, where the ramifications of both chains meet and
                    form a continuous undulating plain. Chili further lays claim to the whole of
                    Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mountains.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The Andes commence in
                    the district called the Colony óf Magellan, where their general elevation is
                    lowest, the perpetual snow-line only 3000 feet, the highest peak, Mount Stokes,
                    6400 feet, and the coast excessively rough and broken and full of fiords of
                    immense depth, fed by glaciers descending from the high lands. N orthwards,
                    towards lat. 41°, the coast becomes less indented, the range more continuous and
                    elevated, and the peaks higher,—such as Minchinmadiva, 8000 feet, Corcobado
                    Volcano 9158 feet, and Yanteles, 8030 feet. From lat. 41°, or from the southern
                    extremity of the province of Llanquihue, commence the table-land and the
                    parallel granitic belt that skirts the Chilian coast, which together nowhere
                    exceed 120 geographical miles in breadth from the sea to the Andes. At this lat.
                    the snow-line rises to 8000 feet, at Valparaiso (33° S. lat.) to 12,780 feet,
                    and at Coquimbo (29° S. lat:) to 15,200 feet. The centre table-land is in lat.
                    41° under 200 feet above the sea; at Talca it rises to 350, at Rancagua to 1560,
                    at Santiago to 1800; and it continues to increase in elevation as it extends
                    northward. The mean elevation of the Andes in Chili is 11,830 feet. The
                    culminating peak is the volcano of Aconcagua, in the province of Aconcagua,
                    which reaches the height of 22,427 feet. The principal summits to the north of
                    this are Cima del Mercedario, 22,302 feet, in lat. 32°, and Cima del Cobre,
                    18,320 feet, in lat. 28° 30'. South of Aconcagua, in the province of Santiago,
                    are Juncal (19,495 feet), and the volcanoes of Tupungato (20,269), San José
                    (20,000 feet), and Maipu (17,664 feet). In Arauco is the volcano of Villarica,
                    15,996 feet; in Talca, the great truncate mountain called the Descabezado,
                    12,757 feet; in the province of Nubie, the volcano of Chilian, 9446 feet; and in
                    Llanquihue, the volcano of Osorno, 7396 feet. In the Chilian range there are 23
                    volcanoes, of which only a few, such as the volcanoes of Osorno, Villarica,
                    Antuco, and San José, are occasionally active. There are many passes over the
                    Andes from Chili to the Argentine Republic; but the western slope of the
                    mountains being steeper than the eastern, the ascent from Chili is more
                    laborious than from the Argentine Republic, into which the mountains descend by
                    a series of terraces, consisting of Secondary strata terminating in the vast
                    expanse of flat country or “Pampas,” occupied by the Tertiary formations. The
                    passes may be said to be open during eight months of the year, but even at their
                    best they can never be traversed by vehicles,—mules being the only means of
                    conveyance. The highest of the passes, as well as the most frequented, are those
                    of Doña Ana, 14,770 feet, and Colguën, 14,700 feet, in the province of Coquimbo;
                    the Dehesa, 14,500 feet, east from Santiago and neaι the volcano of Tupungato;
                    the Patos, 13,965 feet, and Uspallata, 13,125 feet, both in the province of
                    Aconcagua; and the Planchon, 11,455 feet, in the province of Curicó. The part of
                    the Andes bordering the province of Atacama may be crossed at numerous places at
                    any period of the year, as the range there is generally free from snow.<note

                    >Earthquakes.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Chili is subject to frequent
                    earthquake shocks <hi rend="italic">(temblores),</hi> which, without causing
                    damage, occasion much alarm lest they should be followed by the earthquake
                    itself <hi rend="italic">(terremotd).</hi> The occurrence of this terrible
                    phenomenon is not indicated by any particular state of the weather, but it
                    rarely happens during the night. It is the common belief that when <hi
                    rend="italic">shocks</hi> are frequent there is not much fear of their being
                    followed by an <hi rend="italic">earthquake,</hi> and certainly experience
                    justifies that opinion. Though shocks are very common, earthquakes are rare,—the
                    same province being the focus of one only about once in fifty years, though it
                    is calculated one in every tenth year makes itself felt in some part of
                    Chili.</p>
                <p>Earthquakes manifest themselves by a quick horizontal and sometimes rotatory
                    vibration, and when the focus is near the sea it also is agitated. The ground
                    undulates, but very rarely bursts open; and even the most violent are over in a
                    few seconds, though for some time afterwards (at gradually lengthening intervals
                    from twelve hours) there is a succession of gradually lessening shocks. By the
                    earthquake of February 1835 the Isle of Santa Maria was uplifted, the southern
                    end 8, the central part 9, and the northern end 10 feet; but both it and
                    Concepcion subsided a few weeks afterwards, and even lost part of their previous
                    elevation. During this earth- 3uake two great waves rolled over the town of
                    Talcahuano; the eep sea, close in shore, was dry for a few moments, and smoke
                    burst from the surface of the water. During a very smart earthquake at Coquimbo,
                    in November 1849, the sea retired about 150 yards, and then rolled back about 12
                    feet high. An English ship, anchored in 7 fathoms water, in the neighbouring bay
                    of Herradura, nearly touched the bottom from the receding of the sea, which
                    afterwards rolled in like a bore, and the water continued to ebb and flow for an
                    hour and a half after the shock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lakes.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In the southern part of
                    Chili there are several inland lakes abounding with fish, and frequented by
                    numerous varieties of aquatic birds. The largest of these lakes is that of
                    Llanquihue, situated in 41° 10' S. lat., 197 feet above the sea, at the base of
                    the volcano of Osorno, which rises 7199 feet above its surface. Its shape is
                    triangular, its greatest length from north to south being 30 miles and greatest
                    breadth 22 miles. The little river Maullin is its sole outlet, and conveys its
                    surplus water to the Pacific, in lat. 4l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 35'. In
                    the neighbourhood are the lakes Todos los Santos or Esmeralda, 18 miles long by
                    6 broad, and Rupanco, 24.miles long by 4 broad. Twelve miles northward is Lake
                    Ranco, 32 miles long by 18 broad. In lat. 39° is Lake Villarica or Llauquen,
                    measuring 100 square miles. In the province of Concepcion is Lake Guilletué,
                    measuring 50 square miles. Near Santiago, is Lake Aculeo, occupying about 8500
                    acres. In all these the water is fresh and pleasant to the taste; but in the
                    small lakes situated near the coast, such as Bacalemu, Cahuil, Vichuquen, and
                    Bolleruca the water is brackish.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The rivers, like the
                    lakes, are much larger aud more numerous in the south than in the north of
                    Chili.</p>

                <p>They are almost entirely fed by the melting of the snow on the Andes, but are
                    also liable to swelling from the winter rains. A few are navigable for a short
                    distance; but nearly all yield immense service to agriculture by irrigation,
                    carrying, like the Nile, both substance and moisture to the otherwise barren
                    plains. The largest river is the Biobio, which, rising near the volcano of
                    Antuco, in lat. 38° 15', enters the Pacific after a course of 220 miles, where
                    it is 2 miles broad. It is navigable for barges and small steamers as far as
                    Nacimiento, 100 miles from the mouth.</p>

                    they flow, and the lengths of their courses :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Mineral Waters</hi> are numerous in Chili; they are principally
                    saline and sulphureous, containing carbonate of lime, bicarbonate of soda, and
                    chloride of sodium. In temperature the waters range from 50° to that of boiling
                    water. They are situated at various heights, from 1150 feet above the sea, as
                    the baths of Panimavida, 18 miles from Talca, to 10,690 feet, as the baths of
                    Toro, near Elqui in Coquimbo. The most remarkable as well as the most important
                    of the bathing establishments is that of Chilian in the province of Chilian, on
                    the western flank of the Cerro Nevado, 2050 feet above the sea, containing in
                    close proximity icy cold and boiling springs,—sulphureous, ferruginous,
                    alkaline, and saline. The season is from the first of December to the first of
                    April, when they are visited by multitudes for the cure of gout, rheumatism,
                    dyspepsia, and cutaneous diseases. Among the others most frequented are the
                    baths of Apoquindo and Colina, near Santiago; Cauquenes, near Rancagua;
                    Tinguiririca, near Colchagua; Mondaca, near Talca; Trapa-Trapa, near Los
                    Anjeles; and Nahuelhuapi in Llanquihue.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Islands.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The most important
                    Chilian islands are those of the province of Chiloé, coveredwith great forests
                    of the magnificent cedar <hi rend="italic">Fitzroya patagonixa,</hi> and the
                    tall and elegant cypress <hi rend="italic">Libocedrus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tetragona.</hi> The interesting island of Juan Fernandez may be included with
                    those of Chili, although it is 360 miles from the coast, in lat. 33° 42' S. It
                    is a mountainous and well-wooded island, 52 miles in circumference, and exhibits
                    generally those features familiar to the readers of <hi rend="italic"
                    >RobinsonCrusoe</hi> as the abode of Alexander Selkirk. It is stocked with herds
                    of goats, while the beach is a haunt of seals. Forty-two miles further out to
                    sea is the smaller island of Mas Afuera.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> As Chili extends from hot
                    parched deserts in the Tropic of Capricorn to a boisterous cold and wet country
                    within 12° of the Antarctic Circle, and as while one-fourth of the territory is
                    not much above the level of the sea, another fourth lies slightly below the
                    snow-line, the only general· qualification that can be assigned to this union of
                    extremes is that both in the high aud the low, the wet and the dry, the hot and
                    the cold regions the climate is healthy throughout. Omitting the inhospitable
                    regions of Cape Horn and Tierra del Fuego, and commencing with the most
                    southern, portion colonized by Chili, the Territory of Magellan, between lat.
                    54° and 51° 50', we find that although the· moisture and rainfall are too great
                    for the ripening of wheat, yet potatoes, cabbage, celery, and carrots are
                    readily grown. The principal town, Punta Arenas, is situated in the peninsula of
                    New Brunswick, on the Straits of Magellan, in 53° 10' 30' S. lat and 70° 50' W.
                    long. The next zone, between lat. 51° 50' and 37°, comprehends the provinces of
                    Chiloé, Llanquihue, Valdivia, and Arauco, of which the climate is very like that
                    of Great Britain,—the most southern parts having more rain but less cold than
                    the Highlands of Scotland, while the more northern have a more genial climate
                    than the most favoured parts of the south of England. In Valdivia the mean
                    temperature throughout the year is 52° Fahr. Timber is the great article of
                    export; but potatoes, wheat, barley, rye, and flax are grown in quantities
                    sufficient for exportation. The next zone extends from 37° to 28° lat.,
                    embracing the provinces from Concepcion to Aconcagua, where irrigation is more
                    or less necessary, and where flax, corn, grapes, figs, olives, peaches, and
                    melons grow freely, but oranges and lemons only in the northern portion. Bain
                    falls in June, July, and August with more or less frequency, according to the
                    latitude. During these months a mild northerly wind prevails, interrupted
                    occasionally by a dry wind from the east. During all the rest of the year a wind
                    blows from the south, which falls towards the evening. In Santiago the mean
                    annual temperature is 55° Fahr., and in Valparaiso 58° Fahr. From lat. 28° to
                    24°, including the provinces of Coquimbo and Atacama, there is a gradually
                    decreasing amount of moisture,—from four or five showers of from five to ten
                    hours, as in Coquimbo, to nothing but an occasional mist, as in Atacama. Spring
                    commences in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in
                    June.</p>

                    children born only 543,900 live to the age of five years. One female child is
                    born for every 105 male children; but the death rate is in precisely the
                    opposite proportion. The annual increase of the population is one in every

                    amounting to 55,897, are distributed among the different months of the year as
                    follows :—January, 5333; February, 4398; March, 4228; April, 3937; May, 4423;
                    June, 4213; July, 4613; August, 4773; September, 4767; October, 4940; November,
                    4749; December, 5523. The rate is greatest (9 ’ 9 per cent.) in December, and
                    least (7T per cent.) in April.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that the three provinces, Chiloé, Llanquihue, and Valdivia, which
                    are the wettest are also the most salubrious. The healthiest period is just
                    before the rains set in, the least healthy during the heats of December and
                    January, when dysentery prevails, owing perhaps to a too free consumption of the
                    water-melon. The mortality of children under 7 years ranges from 47 per cent, in
                    some years to 60 per cent, in others of the whole number of deaths; and
                    four-fifths of the children who die under 7 years of age belong to the poorest
                    classes. The most fatal diseases are gastric, typhoid, and typhus fevers; and
                    the next, pulmonary complaints, dysentery, and syphilis. The system of sewerage
                    in Chili is generally bad, consisting of partially open channels passing through
                    the houses, sometimes with running water and at other times nearly dry. Even
                    Valparaiso is not well provided with drainage. Intermittent fevers are unknown,
                    and Asiatic cholera has not yet passed the Andes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The name Chili (or, in
                    its Spanish form, Chile) is supposed to be derived from Tchile, a word belonging
                    to the ancient language of Peru, signifying “snow.” The country first became
                    known to Europeans in the 16th century. It was then to a considerable extent
                    under the dominion of the Incas, but had been previously inhabited by certain
                    tribes of Indians, of whom the most important and only warlike race were the
                    Araucanians.</p>
                <p>In the time of the Inca Yupanqui (1433), grandfather of the monarch who occupied
                    the throne of Peru on the arrival of the Spaniards, and the tenth in succession
                    from Manco Capac, the reputed founder of the Peruvian empire, the first attempt
                    was made by the Incas to extend their dominion over the territory of Chili.
                    Yupanqui, leading his army across the desert of Atacama, and penetrating into
                    the southern regions of the country, made himself master of a considerable
                    portion of it. The permanent boundary of the dominions of this prince is said by
                    some writers to have been determined by the River Maule, 35° 30' S. lat.,
                    although it is more probable the River Rapel, 34° 10' S. lat., constituted the
                    extreme limits of the Peruvian empire towards the south. The latter opinion is
                    to some extent supported by the fact, that the remains of an ancient Peruvian
                    fortress, apparently marking the frontier, are still found upon the banks of the
                    Rapel, while no such remains are known to exist in any part of the country
                    farther south.</p>
                <p>The Peruvian dominion in Chili ceased with the Inca Atahualpa in 1533. The first
                    Spanish invasion was led by Diego de Almagro (1535 or 1536), who however met
                    with such determined resistance from the Araucanians that he was compelled to
                    retrace his steps. Undaunted by this failure, Pizarro despatched another
                    expedition, composed of Spanish troops and Peruvian auxiliaries, under Don Pedro
                    de Valdivia, and was preparing to follow it in person with a larger force, when
                    he was assassinated in 1541. Meanwhile Valdivia entered Chili, and fighting his
                    way onwards, encamped on the banks of the Mapocho, where he founded the city of
                    Santiago, the present capital of the republic, and about eleven years afterwards
                    the town of Valdivia. At last, after twelve years’ stay in Chili his life and
                    conquests were brought to an end in a desperate engagement with the Araucanians,
                    who for 180 years afterwards continued to wage a sanguinary war with the
                    Spaniards, till 1722, when they consented to a treaty which fixed the River
                    Biobio as the boundary between them. Spanish Chili, extending from the Biobio
                    northward to Atacama, was divided into thirteen provinces, under the rule of a
                    governor appointed by the viceroy of Peru. The last of these governors was Mateo
                    de Toro, 1810.</p>
                <p>During the entire period of this connection between Spain and Chili, the
                    viceroys, governors, and all the other Spanish officials of every grade regarded
                    the inhabitants only as a means of furthering their own aggrandizement, which at
                    length so exasperated the better educated classes that they determined to throw
                    off the hateful yoke on the first favourable occasion. In 1810 this desired
                    opportunity at last presented itself, when Spain, overrun by the armies of
                    France, was no longer able to vindicate her own claims to a national existence.
                    In July of that year the Chilians took the first step towards asserting their
                    independence by deposing the Spanish president, and putting in his place
                    (September 18, 1810) a committee of seven men, nominated by themselves, to whom
                    were entrusted all the executive powers. In April 1811 the first blood was spilt
                    in the cause of Chilian independence. A battalion of royal troops, which had
                    been drawn up in the great square of Santiago, was attacked by a detachment of
                    patriot grenadiers, and routed with considerable loss on both sides. In the same
                    year (December 20) the government was vested in a triumvirate, and Juan Jose
                    Carrera was appointed general-in-chief of the army about to be formed.</p>
                <p>In 1813 a powerful army, under the command of General Paroja, invaded Chili, but
                    was twice defeated by the republican troops under Carrera. The royalists,
                    however, speedily received larger enforcements; and after a severe contest,
                    Chili was once more obliged to own the sovereignty of Spain. For three years
                    more the people submitted (under the Spanish governors Osorio and Pont) to the
                    old system of tyranny and misgovernment, till at length the patriot refugees,
                    having levied an army in La Plata, and received the support of the Buenos
                    Ayreans, marched against the Spaniards, and completely defeated them at
                    Chacabuco in 1817.</p>
                <p>The patriots next proceeded to organize an elective government, of which San
                    Martin, the general of the army, was nominated the supreme director. Their
                    arrangements, however, were not completed when they were attacked once more by
                    the royalists, and routed at the battle of Cancharayada with great loss.
                    Betrayed into a fatal security by this success, the royalist troops neglected
                    the most ordinary military precautions, and being suddenly attacked by the
                    patriots in the plains of Maipu, were defeated with great slaughter This victory
                    secured the independence of Chili.</p>
                <p>The new Republic had no sooner vindicated for itself a place among the nations of
                    South America, than it resolved to assist the neighbouring state of Peru in
                    achieving a similar independence, which object was at last effected after a
                    bloody war of six years’ duration. No small share of this success was due to the
                    daring courage and consummate ability with which Lord Cochrane, under the most
                    trying circumstances, conducted the naval affairs. In acknowledgment of these
                    important services a well-executed statue of him has been erected in Valparaiso.
                    With 1817 commenced again the national government, under the <pb break="no"

                    till 1823, when he was compelled to resign in consequence of a popular tumult.
                    For a few weeks, a provisional triumvirate discharged the duties of an executive
                    government. General Freire was next chosen director. During the period of three
                    years in which he held the reins of government, the country was harassed by
                    constant dissensions; and for the four years subsequent to his resignation it
                    continued in a state of disorder bordering upon anarchy. From 1826 to 1830 the
                    government was administered by six different directors, in addition to a second
                    provisional triumvirate. In 1828, under the administration of General Pinto, a
                    constitution was promulgated, which had the effect of temporarily reconciling
                    political differences and calming party spirit. In 1831, however, when General
                    Prieto was raised to the chief magistracy, a convention was called for the
                    purpose of revising this constitution. The result of its deliberations was the
                    present constitution of Chili, which was promulgated on the 25th of May 1833.
                    From that time Chili has enjoyed remarkable prosperity, and its government has
                    been administered with such firmness and regularity, that it occupies a high
                    rank among nations, and its funds stand well in the Stock Exchange.</p>
                <p>After holding office for ten years, Prieto retired, and was succeeded by General
                    Bulnes, a distinguished officer of the war of independence. Like his
                    predecessor, he was fortunate in finding in Manuel Montt an able and intelligent
                    prime minister, who was to him what Portales had been to Prieto. In 1851 an
                    insurrectionary movement broke out, headed by General ürriola, who, during the
                    disturbances in Santiago in the Semana Santa was accidentally killed. The same
                    party then brought forward as their candidate for the presidency General José
                    Maria de la Cruz in opposition to D. Manuel Montt, but the latter was elected,
                    and continued in office for two periods (1851-1861). To him succeeded José
                    Joaquin Perez (1861-1871), who in 1871 was followed by Federico Errazuriz, and
                    he in his turn by Anibal Pinto in 1876. The administration of recent presidents
                    has been conducted with firmness, wisdom, and prudence. They have been ready to
                    use their influence for the reform of abuses and for the advancement of civil
                    and religious liberty, and for the promotion of every thing which could tend to
                    increase the prosperity of the country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Races.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The greater part of Chili,
                    when Almagro invaded it, was inhabited by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Araucanians,</hi> who were, with other Indians, partly exterminated, but more
                    generally absorbed into the Chilian nationality as at present existing. A
                    remnant of independent Araucanians still occupy a province south of the Biobio;
                    but they scarcely number 24,000, and are on the decrease. These Araucanians are
                    divided into tribes, whose chief, called a cacique, has from two to six wives,
                    or even more, according to his means of supporting them and their progeny. They
                    cultivate maize, rear herds of horses, sheep, and cattle, weave coarse woollens,
                    build comfortable cottages, binding the beams together by the rope creeper <hi
                    rend="italic">Lardizabαla biternata,</hi> and from the reed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chusquea Coleou</hi> make shafts for their lances. They acknowledge a creator
                    god called Pillan, and some inferior divinities, such as Eponeman, the god of
                    war, Moilen, the god of good, and Guëcubu, the god of evil. They have neither
                    temples nor priests, their worship consisting of the sacrificing of some animal
                    under a tree belonging to the Magnolia order, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Drymis</hi><hi rend="italic">chilensis,</hi> which is considered sacred by
                    them. This tree was first described by Dr Winter, who accompanied Drake in his
                    expedition round Cape Horn in 1577. The Araucanians believe also in sorcerers
                    and enchantments, and that every natural death, other than by old age, is caused
                    by the evil influence of some one. whose life the friends of the deceased
                    endeavour to take in expiation and revenge. The Patagonians who inhabit the
                    territory of Magellan and Tierra del Fuego, and who may number about 20,000, are
                    not given to polygamy. They worship one god called Coche, and believe in the
                    immortality of the soul. The average height of fifty Patagonians taken at random
                    lately was found to be 6 feet 4∣ inches. The tallest was 6 feet 8⅛ inches, and
                    the least 6 feet and ½ inch. The <hi rend="italic">Chilians</hi> themselves hold
                    the same position to Spain as the inhabitants of the United States do towards
                    England. Their instincts and language are Spanish, modified by admixture and
                    intercourse with other nations. The conventionalities of social life are much
                    the same in Chili as in France, Belgium and Catholic Germany; and this remark
                    applies to dress, living, amusements, and propensities. Sunday is spent as a
                    holiday, and enlivened by festivals, balls, theatricals, and concerts. Cricket
                    and athletic sports are unknown, but good horsemanship is common. The great
                    extent of seaboard not only induces large numbers of the inhabitants to visit
                    foreign lands (calculated to average 78,000), but promotes the diffusion of the
                    civilization of the most highly cultivated nations over the whole of Chili. The
                    beautiful provinces of Valdivia and Llanquihue are colonized by Germans and
                    North Americans, who prepare timber, meat, cheese, butter, beer, cider, and
                    leather. The university and the learned professions have ever numbered among
                    their distinguished members Polish, French, German, and English men of science.
                    The North American colonists have been chiefly instrumental in the construction
                    of flour-mills, telegraphs, and railways. At the commercial centres, such as
                    Valparaiso, Concepcion, Copiapo, Coquimbo, and Huasco, many of the leading
                    Chihan citizens are of English, French, and German descent. There are in the
                    country about 35,000 Europeans, chiefly Germans, French, and English.</p>

                    adopted on the 25th of May 1833, the sovereignty is declared to reside in the
                    people; but the exercise of its functions is delegated to three distinct
                    powers—the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. The legislative power
                    is committed to the National Congress, which consists of the Chambers of
                    Deputies and Senators. The Chamber of Deputies comprises over 100 members,
                    elected for a term of three years, on the principle of equal electoral districts
                    with cumulative voting, and by a suffrage enjoyed by all citizens who are of
                    twenty-one years of age if married, or twenty-five if unmarried, and who are
                    able to read and write, and pay yearly taxes to a certain amount.</p>
                <p>The senate is composed of fewer members, chosen by indirect election in each
                    province for a term of nine years. One-third of the house is renewed every three
                    years.</p>
                <p>The Chamber of Deputies and the Senate have concurrent as well as separate
                    functions. The former body alone can impeach the higher officers of the state
                    before the Senate. It originates all money bills, and measures relating to the
                    military force of the country. The Senate alone has the right of pronouncing
                    judgment on public functionaries impeached by the Chamber of Deputies; it
                    confirms ecclesiastical nominations, and in certain cases gives or withholds its
                    consent to the Acts of the executive. In all other proceedings of the
                    legislature the concurrent voice of the two houses is necessary. Laws may
                    originate with either body, but require to be passed by both houses, sanctioned
                    by the president (after consultation with the Council of State), and promulgated
                    by the minister to whose department the matter relates. The period during which
                    the Congress sits is limited to the three winter months; but the session may be
                    prolonged by the president for fifty days. On the day before the regular session

                    for a term of five years, after expiry of which he is not eligible for
                    reelection until other five years have elapsed The president concludes treaties,
                    and declares peace or war; he appoints and removes ministers, councillors, and
                    clerks of department, as well as diplomatic representatives, consuls, and the
                    administrative officers of provinces. He also inducts the higher legal and
                    judicial functionaries; but the nomination of these officers, as well as of
                    ecclesiastical dignitaries, must proceed from the Council of State. He
                    distributes the army and navy at will; and when, with the sanction of the
                    Senate, he assumes the command of the national troops in person, he has the
                    exclusive bestowal of naval and military commissions, though ordinarily
                    appointments of this nature must be approved by the Senate.</p>
                <p>The president is liable to impeachment for maladministration for a year after the
                    expiry of his authority. During that time he is not allowed to leave the
                    country, except with the permission of Congress. All the other officers of
                    Government are subject to the same law: but in their case the time is more
                    limited.</p>
                <p>The Council of State is composed of ministers in the exercise of their functions,
                    a member of the courts of justice, an ecclesiastical dignitary, a general or
                    admiral, a chief of the administration of finances, and one ex-minister or
                    diplomatic agent,—all named by the president, together with six other
                    councillors, named one-half by the Senate and one-half by the Chamber of
                    Deputies. The duties of the Council of State are to advise and act as a check
                    upon the president.</p>
                <p>The government is conducted by five cabinet ministers, each with a salary of
                    £1200. The Ministro del Interior presides over the preparation of the national
                    statistics, over roads and railroads, public buildings, and hospitals; the
                    Ministro de Hacienda over the finance; the Ministro de Justicia, Culto, é
                    Instruccion over the law and prisons, the church, and education; the Ministro de
                    Guerra over the army and navy; and the Ministro del Esterior over foreign
                    affairs and colonization. The president has no power of enforcing obedience to
                    orders relating to any one of these departments until they have been confirmed
                    by the minister in charge. The ministers are entitled to take part in all the
                    debates of Congress; but, unless holding at the same time the office of senator
                    or of deputy, they are not allowed to vote. Any of them may be impeached by the
                    Chamber of Deputies for treason against the laws of the state, or for the
                    mal-administration of the duties of his office. An action may be brought against
                    them even by private individuals who have suffered by any of their acts if the
                    Senate, to whom appeal must in the first place be made, decide that there is
                    sufficient ground for complaint.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Local Government.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Upon the
                    executive depend directly the administrative officials throughout the country.
                    For administrative purposes Chili is divided into fifteen provinces, each with
                    subordinate departments, subdelegations, and districts, and one settlement,
                    viz., the provinces of Atacama, Coquimbo, Valparaiso, Aconcagua, Santiago,
                    Colchagua, Curicô, Talca, Maule, Nubie, Concepcion, Arauco, Valdivia,
                    Llanquihue, and Chiloé, and the settlement of Magellan. The capital is Santiago,
                    on the Mapocho. Each of the provinces is governed by an intendant, who is
                    nominated by the president, and holds office for three years. The departments
                    are under governors, who hold office for a similar term. The intendant generally
                    acts as governor in that department iu which the capital of the province is
                    situated, and is, at the same time, mayor of the municipal corporation; but the
                    authority of this body is very limited, as it cannot dispose even of its local
                    funds without the permission of Government. The subdelegates are appointed by
                    the governors for a period of two years, as are also the inspectors of
                    districts. Both these offices are compulsory,—those who decline to serve being
                    liable to fines.</p>
                <p>The united revenue of the municipal corporations of Chili amounts to about
                    £500,000, of which about £80,000 is contributed by the State, and the remainder
                    derived from local sources.</p>
                <p>The procedure of the Chilian courts of justice is based on the same fundamental
                    principles as those which hold among the Latin nations generally, and
                    approximates therefore to that of equity. Evidence is mostly taken by
                    depositions in writing. The suitor appears by a sworn procurator or attorney,
                    who must be conversant with the technicalities of the law. In the higher courts,
                    the aid of an advocate is further obligatory. The advocate, who combines the
                    functions of the consulting lawyer with those of the barrister, is only admitted
                    to practice after taking a university degree, and passing an examination by the
                    Supreme Court. Trial by jury is unknown, except as applied in a modified form to
                    libel cases connected with the press. The whole law of Chili is being gradually
                    digested into codes,—the civil, penal, commercial, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>The supreme court, which sits at Santiago, takes cognizance of criminal and civil
                    causes alike. Its decisions are final, and also bind the Government upon
                    questions of law submitted for the consideration of í 'ie bench. There are three
                    courts of intermediate appeal, siting iu Santiago, Serena, and Concepcion, which
                    also have both criminal and civil jurisdiction, and whose decisions are final in
                    certain cases.</p>
                <p>In each department of every province there are one or more salaried judges of
                    letters (or judges learned in the law), who divide among them the local
                    jurisdiction,—the criminal and civil sides being, in places of importance,
                    vested in different judges, each of whom, as a rule, sits alone. Below these,
                    again, are the judges of subdelegations and of districts, of whom the latter can
                    only decide civil cases when the value at issue òs below £10, and in criminal
                    causes can arrest the criminal and prepare evidence; while the former decides
                    civil suits up to £40 value, hears-appeals from the district judge, and takes
                    cognizance of minor criminal offences.</p>
                <p>In places where access to a judge of letters is difficulty an alcalde or local
                    police magistrate retains a limited jurisdiction. With a view to reduce
                    litigation, the law expressly encoursges reference to arbitration in various
                    forms; and the duties of public prosecutor and public advocate are performed by
                    officials, who intervene before the higher courts and the judges of letters in
                    all cases which involve public morality, or the interests of the State, of
                    minors, of the incapable, of the absent, and of charitable trusts.</p>
                <p>Military and ecclesiastical offences come under the cognizance of special
                    tribunals, but neither ecclesiastical nor military persons are, as such, exempt
                    from the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals in respect of offences against
                    the law of the land. Certain special jurisdiction is reserved to the Council of
                    State and to the revenue courts; and under a treaty with Great Britain,
                    guaranteeing the mutual right of search in suspected slave vessels, a mixed
                    tribunal decides, without appeal, as to the validity of capture.</p>
                <p>The clerks and secretaries of the higher courts, and the secretaries of the
                    judges of letters, must be qualified advocates, as also the notaries public, who
                    are charged <pb break="no"

                    property, and of deeds of partnership, having then the title of notary
                    conservator. The registers are open to public inspection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The form of worship
                    recognized by the constitution is the Roman Catholic, yet Government tolerates
                    the public profession of others. For the purposes of ecclesiastical
                    administration, Chili is divided into four dioceses—one archbishopric and 3
                    bishoprics—which are subdivided into 144 parishes. The salary of the archbishop
                    is £1600, of the bishops of Concepcion and Serena £1200 each, and of Ancud
                    £1000. The salaries of the curates range from £20 per annum to £200. The mission
                    department is under the direction of Capuchin friars, and consists of a prefect
                    and sub-prefect, and a staff of 30 missionaries and several chaplains, stationed
                    in the provinces of Arauco <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> Valdivia, Llanquihue,
                    and Magallanes. Their labours among the adult Indians produced little fruit, but
                    in their schools they have been more successful. Worship, including salaries and
                    repairs of churches, costs Government annually £63,425.</p>
                <p>In Santiago there is one handsome Protestant church, in Valparaiso three, and a
                    chapel in Talca. Roman Catholicism exists in a mild form among the educated
                    classes, but with a good deal of superstition among the miners and peasantry <hi

                    only one great place of pilgrimage in Chili, and that is to an image of the
                    Virgin in the church of Andacollo, a small village near Serena. Upwards of
                    20,000 persons visit it annually, and the yearly festival is occasionally
                    presided over by the bishop of the province, when the image is carried in
                    procession round the square. The greatest devotees are the miners.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The first educational
                    establishments in rank are the University and the National Institute of
                    Santiago. The university, which grants degrees in law and medicine, has 37
                    professors, besides numerous assistants, and is attended by nearly 700 students.
                    It is governed by a rector and a vice-rector, a secretary, and the five deacons
                    of the faculties of humanity, mathematics, medicine, law, and theology, who are
                    also charged with the inspection of education in all schools throughout the
                    republic. Whoever has the necessary elementary knowledge may attend the classes
                    without paying fees.</p>
                <p>The preparatory section or “Institute,” corresponding with our high schools, is
                    under the management of a rector, a vice-rector, 48 masters, and several
                    inspectors. It is attended by about 1000 pupils, of whom only those pay who
                    lodge and board in the establishment, this costing £32 a year. The institute is
                    endowed with 45 exhibitions or bursaries, 15 of which are divided equally among
                    youths from Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
                <p>These two establishments cost the Government annually £25,000. Lyceums, on the
                    same plan as the National Institute, are established in every provincial
                    capital, 16 altogether, and are supported by local taxation, government grants,
                    and fees from pupils. In these institutions boarders pay an annual sum of £20,
                    and day scholars £2, 8s.; but many receive instruction gratuitously. The
                    directly practical branches of education receive the largest share of attention,
                    but the learned languages are not neglected. The lyceums of Talca, Concepcion,
                    and Serena possess the privilege of granting degrees in mathematics and
                    chemistry.</p>
                <p>Government expends annually on the lyceums in the province £35,000, and they are
                    attended by 2200 pupils. Government supports besides 810 schools throughout the
                    country, in which 62,220 children are taught the catechism, reading, writing,
                    arithmetic, and geography. Those who choose may leam in addition the histories
                    of Chili and America, sacred history, drawing, music, and sewing. There are also
                    480 private schools, with 24,000 pupils, which differ more in the rank of the
                    children than in the subjects taught.</p>
                <p>One in every 3*8 of the population in Santiago can read, and 1 in every 4*4 can
                    both read and write—and the proportion is nearly the same in the provinces of
                    Atacama, Coquimbo, Valparaiso, Concepcion, and Chiloé; while In the entire
                    population of the republic one in 7 can read, and one in 8 can both read and
                    write. Upon an average 1 child for every 24 ’ 71 inhabitants goes to school. In
                    the public schools each child costs' Government an average of 45 shillings.</p>

                    consisting of 700 cavalry, 2000 infantry, and 800 artillery. This force is
                    distributed on sentry duties and upon the frontiers, but the real military
                    strength of the country is the National Guard.</p>
                <p>The National Guard, also divided into cavalry, infantry, and artillery, averaged
                    55,000 men from 1867 to 1871, but in 1875 had become reduced to 22,000, the

                <p>The navy consists of two powerful ironclads, the “A1mirante Cochrane” and the
                    “Valparaiso,” constructed in England, each of 1000 horse-power, and of about
                    2000 metric tons measurement, besides three corvettes, a sloop, and several

                <p><hi rend="italic">Mineral Productions.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Chili is rich
                    in minerals. Among its metals are gold, silver, copper, lead, antimony, cobalt,
                    zinc, nickel, bismuth, iron, molybdenum, and quicksilver, found in mines in the
                    northern division, while rich beds of coal occupy the southern division, but
                    only copper, silver, and coal are profitable to any extent. The various ores are
                    found in all the series of rocks between granite and trachyte, the latter being
                    sterile in Chili. The veins generally run from N. and N.W. to S. and S.E.; in
                    some places, however, their course is irregular, or they extend E. and W.</p>
                <p>The auriferous veins run nearly parallel to the imperfect cleavage of the
                    surrounding granite rocks. Copper ores, containing a small quantity of gold, are
                    generally associated with micaceous specular iron. Some mines are remarkable for
                    the variety of minerals mixed with the gold, such as galena, blende, copper and
                    iron pyrites, and peroxide of iron. These substances are found disseminated in
                    quartz veins running nearly N. and S. Near Illapel are some very poor gold
                    mines, in the beds of the gypseous formation, in altered felspathic clay-slate,
                    which alternate with purple porphyritic conglomerate.</p>
                <p>The richest silver mines are found in Jurassic rocks of the Oolitic formation in
                    the province of Atacama. The richest districts are Chaŭarcillo, Très Puntas,
                    Florida, and Caracoles. In Chaŭarcillo the upper part of the mines produce
                    immense quantities of embolite, while in those of Caracoles, on the frontier of
                    Bolivia, the chloride of silver is found in still greater quantities. And in
                    general these are the. two kinds of silver ore met with most frequently in the
                    upper region of the veins; while as the mines become deeper, the prevailing ores
                    are various kinds of pyrargyrite or red silver, polybasite, and argentite or the
                    sulphuret of silver. Native silver, in smaller or larger masses, is generally
                    found in the upper region, although at Chaŭarcillo, from the vein San Juan, at
                    325 feet below the surface, 800,000 ounces of metallic silver were extracted in
                    a few months. Gold is also found in Magellan.</p>
                <p>Copper is more equally distributed than silver over the northern provinces, and
                    is mostly found in the lower granitic and metamorphic schistose series, where it
                    is met with most abundantly as pyrites, although other ores are also common,
                    such as bornite or variegated copper, the black oxide, malachite, and atacamite.
                    Domeykite, or arsenical copper, is found in the Calabozo mine, near Coquimbo;
                    the hydrosilicate and olivenite in the mine San Antonio, near Copiapo; the
                    vanadiate of copper in cavities in an arsenio-phosphate of lead, along with
                    amorphous carbonate of lead and copper, in Mina Grande or La Marquesa, near
                    Arqueros. That rare ore, the oxychloride of copper, or atacamite, occurs at
                    Remo-linos and Santa Rosa in veins in granite. The principal copper mines are in
                    the provinces of Atacama, Coquimbo, and Aconcagua, and the most important are
                    those of San Juan and Carrizal, near Copiapo, La Higuera, near Coquimbo, and
                    Tamaya, about 40 miles from the coast, and 70 from Coquimbo. This last is a
                    mountain district about 3500 feet above the sea, which produces about 150,000
                    cwts. a year of various kinds of sulphurets, of a produce from 9 to 64 per cent.
                    Tambillos, 10 leagues from Coquimbo, produces principally poor sulphurets;
                    Runeral, near the river, entirely poor carbonates; Andacollo, carbonates,
                    oxides, oxysulphurets, and native copper; La Higuera, black sulphurets and
                    pyrites; Herradura and Huasco, carbonates and sulphurets of low produce. In the
                    Cordilleras, above Huasco, are some mines containing ores of copper, silver, and
                    lead combined together. Silver and copper mines are sold by the “barra,” or
                    twenty-fourth part of the share of the mine.</p>
                <p>The most common ores of cobalt are the arsenate and the sulph-arsenate,
                    containing from 19 to 22 per cent, of cobalt. The most important mine is the
                    Veta Blanca of San Juan. At Tambillos and Huaseo there are mines containing
                    glance cobalt, and arsenate or erythrine; the former sort is frequently combined
                    with nickel, which has been found in considerable quantities in a mine in the
                    Cordilleras above Copiapo.</p>
                <p>The sulphuret of zinc is found in various parts, as well as antimony, lead,
                    manganese, bismuth, mercury, and molybdena. Iron ores of every description are
                    very abundant; amongst the most peculiar are coquimbite, or white copperas, and
                    copiapite, or yellow copperas, much used by the inhabitants for dyeing and
                    tanning, in the manufacture of ink, and for other purposes.</p>
                <p>Gypsum is found in immense beds, particularly in the province of Santiago. The
                    fine massive variety called alabaster is found at the Salto de Agua, near to
                    Santiago, of a quality nearly equal to that of Italy. Lapis lazuli is found in
                    the Cordilleras above the province of Coquimbo, but it is impossible to convey
                    large slabs to the coast, and the principal use of the small pieces is to make
                    ultramarine; but as the artificial equals the native in brilliancy of colour and
                    permanency, it is not of much value. In the province of Atacama, where it

                <p>Of great and increasing importance are the coal mines in southern Chili,
                    extending along the coast from the province of Concepcion in 36° 50' S. lat. to
                    the Straits of Magellan, including some of the islands of Chiloe. The richest
                    and at the same time the oldest coal mines are immediately south from the Biobio
                    at Coronel, Lota, and Lebu. These coal mines are worked on the same plan as
                    those in England with all the modem improvements and accessaries. Steamers coal
                    at the pit’s mouth, and a great deal of the ore that used to be carried to
                    England to be smelted is now sent to Coronel and Lota. There are also extensive
                    works for amalgamating silver and smelting ores in Copiapo, Chaŭarcillo,
                    Carrizal, and Guayacan.</p>
                <p>Of the entire metal exports copper is 70 per cent, and silver 25. The amount of
                    coal produced annually is increasing so rapidly that it will probably soon
                    average from 2 to 3 millions of tons. The average value of the minerals exported
                    is above 46 per cent, of the value of the whole of the exports, while that of
                    agricultural products is about 44 per cent.</p>

                    flora contains 128 genera. Twenty-two of the genera belonging to the continent
                    of Europe are not indigenous to Chili, while, on the other hand, that country
                    posseses thirty-six genera not belonging to Europe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Till Chili had to
                    compete with California and Australia in the foreign markets, the agricultural
                    appliances were of that rude description introduced by the Spaniards. The
                    ploughs were jointed sticks; corn was trodden out by mares or oxen, winnowed by
                    throwing it up against the wind, and ground in small primitive mills. All this
                    is now changed. The largest and most approved agricultural implements
                    manufactured in the United States and in England are now employed, while the
                    flour mills in power and machinery rival the best in Great Britain. Care is also
                    being taken to improve the breeds by the introduction of horses, cattle, and
                    sheep from England. About 82 per cent, of the entire surface of Chili is desert,
                    mountain pasture, and forests, and only about 18 per cent, arable land. There
                    are in the country 30,000 estates of various sizes, from many square miles to a
                    few acres. The most important agricultural product, both for home consumption
                    and exportation, is <hi rend="italic">wheat,</hi> of which the average yield
                    over the whole country is 7 for 1, and the average annual quantity from

                    grain, flour, and biscuit. In the province of Santiago the yield may be
                    estimated at 12 for 1. Of <hi rend="italic">barley</hi> the average annual
                    production is 200,000 quarters, and the yield in the provinces in which it is

                    country, the extraction of the oil from the berries is only beginning to receive
                    due attention. There are 890,000 <hi rend="italic">mulberry trees,</hi> but the

                    called chicha and chacoli. The most important plant for the fattening of cattle

                    rend="italic">sativa,</hi> which flourishes throughout all the warmer regions of

                    earth, is cut from three to four times in the year, and irrigated from five to
                    ten times, according to the nature of the soil, and yields of green food 49 tons
                    the cuadra. Cattle brought from the mountains, and oxen that have been working
                    in carts and in the plough, are speedily fattened on it, while cows fed on it
                    yield rich milk and butter. The hills in the warm regions of Chili are sparingly
                    covered with a short and wiry grass, which, after one winter of abundant rain,
                    lasts for two seasons, even although the succeeding winter may have been
                    dry.</p>
                <p>The sterile plains and mountains produce the carob tree <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ceratonia)</hi> which, in defiance of a broiling sun, stretches out its
                    spacious limbs, covered with foliage, forming an agreeable retreat to the weary
                    traveller by day as well as by night; the espino <hi rend="italic">(Acacia
                    Cavenia)</hi> inferior to the carob tree in size, hardness, and durability of
                    its timber; and the great torch thistle, whose long, smooth spines are used by
                    the country people for knitting-needles, and whose interior woody substance,
                    stripped of its fleshy bark, forms the beams and rafters of the cottages of the
                    peasantry in the northern provinces. Timber is abundant in all the provinces S.
                    of Santiago, but chiefly in Arauco, Valdivia, and Chiloé, which may be termed
                    the forest region of Chili. There are altogether above a hundred different kinds
                    of indigenous trees, of which not more than thirteen ever shed their leaves.
                    Several have been found serviceable in ship-building, but for purposes of
                    house-carpentry none afford an adequate substitute for pine. Ornamental woods
                    are scarce, and too soft for the use of cabinet-makers. The principal timber
                    trees are the roble or Chilian oak <hi rend="italic">(Fagus obliqua)</hi> which
                    attains a height of 100 feet, and as the timber retains its soundness in water,
                    it makes excellent stakes; the lingue <hi rend="italic">(Persea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lingue)</hi> 90 feet, which furnishes the best wood for furniture,
                    while the bark is of great value in tanning; the peumo <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cryptocarya Peumus),</hi> the bark of which is used in Valdivia for
                    tanning,—the Germans exporting large quantities of first class sole leather, of
                    which the largest quantity goes to England; two species of cypress, both
                    exceeding in height the loftiest trees in England,—the timber,of a reddish hue,
                    is used for beams, doors, pillars, and ornamental flooring. The cypress <hi
                    rend="italic">(Libocedrus chilensis)</hi> grows on the Andes of the middle
                    provinces, while the <hi rend="italic">Libocedrus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tetragona</hi> is found on the southern Andes. The quillay tree <hi
                    rend="italic">(Quillaja Saponaria)</hi> grows north from the Biobio. A decoction
                    of the bark is used for clearing the colours in dyeing and cleansing articles of
                    silk and woollen cloth, and as a wash for the hair. The laurel <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Lauretta</hi><hi rend="italic">aromatica)</hi> is a tall handsome tree, but
                    its wood warps so much that it is suitable only for the coarsest work. The lumo
                    <hi rend="italic">(Myrtus</hi><hi rend="italic">Luma)</hi> produces timber liker
                    the English oak than the Chilian oak. The Araucanian pine <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Araucaria</hi><hi rend="italic">imbricata)</hi> 150 feet, flourishes on the
                    mountains S. from the Biobio. When seen from a distance the trees look like
                    gigantic umbrellas. The cone, which takes two years to ripen, contains from 50
                    to 100 oblong nuts 2 inches long, which, when cooked, form more delicate eating
                    than chestnuts. Under the governorship of O’Higgins their trunks were used for
                    ship-masts; but at present the expense of bringing them to the coast prevents
                    their being employed in this way. The Chilian cedar or alerce <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Fittroya patagonica}</hi> is the largest and most important tree in Chili. The
                    wood is reddish, soft and durable, and not liable to warp. The trunk is divided
                    into pieces of 8 feet long, and then split up into boards 6 or 7 inches broad,
                    and about half an inch thick, which is, on account of the straightness of the
                    fibre, very easily effected. An ordinary tree yields from 500 te 600 of these
                    boards. The general height is from 150 to 180 feet. Yet some specimens have been
                    met with 300 feet high and 60 in circumference, which yielded upwards of 5200
                    boards. The best grow in Llanquihue, Chiloé, and Valdivia. Indeed, the
                    luxuriance of vegetation in these regions is as great as in the tropics. The
                    forests are frequently quite impenetrable on account of the creepers and the
                    “quila,” a rudely branched reed, which, however, affords a good food for the
                    cattle. A creeper <hi rend="italic">(Lardiuabala bitsmata)</hi> is used by the
                    Araucanians instead of ropes. In the same districts grows likewise the <hi
                    rend="italic">coliguË</hi> or <hi rend="italic">coleu (Chusquea Coleou),</hi> a
                    bamboolike reed, which attains a height of 30 feet, and furnishes the snafts of
                    the lances of the Araucanians and Pehuenches.</p>
                <p>Fruit is plentiful. Besides the kinds already mentioned, in Valdivia there are
                    large apple orchards, and further north pears, cherries, and quinces. The
                    strawberries of the south of Chili have long been famous, and are still
                    unrivalled, especially those of Tomé.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Animals.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The most formidable
                    animal in Chili is the puma. On account of its ravages in the farm-yard, it is
                    frequently hunted with dogs, or caught by the lasso. The guanaco roams about
                    among the lower regions of the Chilian Alps in herds numbering from 20 to 109.
                    The vicuña is more rare; it inhabits the Andes of the province of Atacama. The
                    huemul is found in the territory of Magellan, and iu other districts the otter,
                    wild cat, fox, and chinchilla. The horses of Chili are iøferior in strength and
                    height to those of England, but greatly superior in point of endurance. The mule
                    is the beast of burden, and will carry on an average a load of 355 lb. a
                    distance of 20 or even 30 miles a day. The beef is excellent; meat is mostly
                    cured by drying, making it into charqui. In this manufacture several hundred
                    head of cattle are killed at a time, the flesh rapidly stripped off the bones,
                    cut into long thin shreds, and then dried in the sun.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Birds.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Among the birds of Chili
                    the most remarkable is the condor, which is easily recognised by the white ruff
                    encircling its neck. As its wings on an average extend 8 or 9 feet, its flight
                    has a very majestic appearance. Humboldt mentions having seen one flying at the
                    height of 22,000 feet above the level of the sea. They scent an exposed carease
                    for a great distance, but seldom earn-off live prey. The turkey-buzzard is also
                    common in the northern districts; white eagles, hawks, and owls are more
                    numerous in the south. The only song-birds worthy of notice are,—the tenca, the
                    thrush, the tordo (a kind of blackbird), and the lloica (a kind of redbreast);
                    but none of these can rival the notes of our English birds. The tenca is said to
                    emulate the mocking-bird in imitative power. The tapaculo <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pteroptochus albicollis),</hi> a bird about the same size as the thrush,
                    rarely flies, but runs about with great agility, emitting an odd but cheerful
                    note. The chingol, or sparrow, has gayer plumage than his European
                    representative. Besides these, parroquets, flamingoes, partridges, and
                    woodpeckers abound in several localities, likewise the black-headed swan, and
                    several varieties of crane. Patagonia has an ostrich much hunted by the Indians.
                    The pelican, the penguin, and the shag inhabit the sea and the salt-water
                    lakes.</p>

                    found off the coast of Chili, and of these the pichihuen, which is caught
                    chiefly in the Bay of Coquimbo, is regarded as a choice delicacy. There are
                    small sweet oysters off Chiloé; huge mussels, barnacles, and fissurellae, off
                    Concepcion; and large clams off Coquimbo; besides sea-urchins, cockles, and
                    limpets, which are found along the whole coast.</p>

                    snakes vary from 12 to 30 inches in length. Scorpions and large spiders are
                    common, but not dangerous. Of beetles there are upwards of 4000 species not
                    found in Europe. Chili is never infested by the clouds of locusts which from
                    time to time devastate the neighbouring plains of the Argentine Republic. Small
                    ants enter houses and attack provisions.</p>
                <p>In 1844, J. P. Larrain made an unsuccessful attempt to introduce bees; however,
                    about two years afterwards he succeeded. Since then they have multiplied so fast
                    that there are now upwards of 100,000 hives, producing on an average £50,000
                    worth of honey and wax annually, of which by far the greatest part is
                    exported.</p>

                    consists in the development of its great and abundant resources, for which its
                    scanty population is insufficient; hence manufactures which require many skilled
                    hands and much cheap labour have as yet not prospered,—the cost of production
                    being too great. But such works as flour mills, smelting works, tanneries,
                    breweries, roperies, and soap works have long proved successful. Wine-making is
                    progressing rapidly. At Tomé there is a cloth mill, and at Valparaiso a large

                <p>The commercial intercourse of Chili is most extensive with Great Britain. The
                    value of the Chilian exports to England averages annually £3,700,000, and the
                    imports from England £3,900,000. The exports to France are about one-third of
                    those to England, and the imports from France about one-fifth of those from
                    England. Next follow Germany, Peru, the United States, Bolivia, Brazil, and the
                    Argentine Republic.</p>
                <p>Chili exports and imports both by sea and by the passes in the Cordillera. Mules
                    do the land traffic, and formerly only sailing vessels the traffic by sea; but
                    steamers are now taking their place. The value of the imports by land averages
                    £198,000, and the exports £23,000; and the value of the imports by sea averages
                    £9,802,000, and the exports £9,700,000, which in both cases includes goods in
                    transit. Of the land imports the most valuable article is cattle, which are
                    imported in large herds into the provinces of C'oquimbo and Atacama from the
                    Argentine Republic. The number of vessels that leave the ports of Chili averages
                    5900, with about 4,019,000 tons; and 5950 enter the ports, with about 4,059,880
                    tons. Of the total amount three-eighths are English and about the same Chilian,
                    then follow the United States, French, German, Peruvian, Belgian, Dutch, and
                    Portuguese vessels. The merchant navy of Chili in 1875 consisted of 28 steamers
                    with 9880 metric tons, and 59 sailing vessels with 12,554 metric tons. Many
                    small vessels, however, owned in Chili, have remained under the foreign flags to
                    which they were transferred for safety during the last war with Spain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Revenue.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The annual income of
                    Chili may be estimated at £3,550,000, and the expenditure at sometimes a little
                    less and sometimes a little more. The chief source of revenue is the
                    customhouse, which yields about half of the whole amount. Next in importance are
                    the railways, yielding about a quarter of the whole; and after these, the
                    monopoly of tobacco and cards, the land tax, trade licences, stamps, tolls, the
                    mint, post-office, and telegraphs.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">National Debt.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The national debt
                    amounts to about £10,000,000 sterling, of which about £2,000,000 is of internal
                    and £8,000,000 of external debt. The whole of the latter has been contracted in
                    England, and the bulk of it invested in existing railways and railways in
                    construction, which yield both directly and indirectly a fair return. The
                    λvanton bombardment of Valparaiso by the Spanish fleet (March 31, 1866) having
                    suggested to the Chilians the necessity of providing against such outrages, they
                    have spent a great deal of money in the purchase of ironclads and in the
                    construction of forts,—besides having had to rebuild the bonded warehouses
                    destroyed at that time. A large sum has also been spent on the House of
                    Congress, which is being built on an ambitious scale.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Chili is connected
                    with Europe by telegraph, and the wires ramify over the greater part of the
                    country. Santiago and Valparaiso and all the most important towns southward as
                    far as Talcahuano, are connected by rail. In the northern provinces are also
                    railways, which facilitate the working of the mines.</p>
                <p>On the 15th of October 1840, the first steamers of the Pacific Steam Navigation
                    Company arrived at Valparaiso, the “Peru” (Captain Peacock)and the “Chili”
                    (Captain Glover), both 700 tons. At first they sailed merely between Valparaiso
                    and Callao, calling at the intermediate ports. In June 1846, the route was
                    extended by Panama and the Isthmus to Europe. On the 13th of May 1868 the
                    Company commenced their line between Liverpool and Chili by the Straits of
                    Magellan, the first of their steamers which made the voyage being the “Pacific,”
                    1174 tons.</p>

                <p>In her monetary system Chili possesses the double standard, gold and silver, the

                    cent-pieces of a bronze containing zinc and nickel.</p>
                <p>The gold and larger silver coins contain one-tenth of alloy; the smaller silver
                    ones, which are of limited legal tender, are rather less pure. The bronze
                    tokens, the emission of which has been limited to a value of about £20,000,
                    replace the former coinage of copper. There is no Government paper; but some of
                    the banks issue, under due restrictions, notes payable in coin. (C, B. B.-F.
