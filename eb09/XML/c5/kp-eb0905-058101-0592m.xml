                    in infancy to France, he lived till his ninth year at Carcassonne, under care of
                    a paternal aunt; and in 1773, on his father’s return, he was placed at the
                    Parisian Collège de Navarre. At sixteen he was rhyming from Sappho and reading
                    the Greek authors. At twenty (1782) he obtained a sub-lieutenancy in the
                    regiment of Angoumois, then in garrison at Strasburg. He left Paris, and
                    reported himself at headquarters. But military life had no charm for him, and
                    neither the neighbourhood of Brunck, whose <hi rend="italic">Analecta</hi> was
                    one of his favourite books, nor the classic tradition of the Alsatian capital,
                    could bind him to his calling; in six months he threw up his commission and
                    returned to Paris. There he studied hard, and wrote idylls <hi rend="italic">(Le
                    Mendiant, F Aveugle, Le Jeune Malade);</hi> he sketched out plans of great
                    poems; he sat and talked with Palissot, David, and Pindar-Lebrun. A serious
                    illness was induced by excess of work; to complete his recovery he set out, in
                    company with the brothers Trudaine, towards the end of 1784, for Switzerland,
                    Italy, and the Archipelago. In 1786 he returned to Paris, plunged into study
                    anew, aud conceived the passion for Madame de Eonneuil which inspired so many of
                    the perfect elegiacs afterwards to win regard and imitation from Hugo
                    himself.</p>
                <p>He was tìve-and-twenty, and at heart a Greek. The .Idyllists aud Anthologists
                    were his masters. From their styles did he compound his own; and from them did
                    he learn the exquisite purity of form, the admirable restraint, the chastened
                    vigour of thought and diction, that render him pre-eminent among modern poets.
                    And with the <hi rend="italic">Élégies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Art
                    d’Aimer,</hi> which are the purely subjective fruit of this part of his life, he
                    prepared the plans for other and greater structures. In <hi rend="italic">L'
                    Invention,</hi> a completed poem, he promulgated a noble theory of aesthetics;
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Hermès,</hi> an incomparable fragment, he made himself
                    the Lucretius of his epoch; in <hi rend="italic">Suzanne,</hi> which remains a
                    mere <hi rend="italic">canevas,</hi> he purposed to deal in the style of Milton
                    with a biblical episode. A few only of his friends were admitted to his feast of
                    poesy; and he continued for some time to work and wait. But his family were
                    anxious that he should settle in life, and a secretaryship in the French
                    Legation at London was offered him. It cost him much to accept it, as his fine
                    idyll <hi rend="italic">La Liberté</hi> remains to prove; but in the December of
                    1787 he left for England.</p>
                <p>His residence beyond sea was unhappy enough. The duties of his place occupied him
                    scarcely at all; and among English poets he cared only for Milton, the purely
                    intellectual quality of whose verse seems to have been peculiarly grateful to
                    him. In 1790 he resigned his post, and returned to France. The Revolution was in
                    full coil; and Chénier, who worshipped liberty and loathed anarchy, threw in his
                    lot at once with the moderate party. Introduced into the brilliant “Société de
                    ’89,” he drew up for it a manifesto of principles <hi rend="italic">(Avis aux
                    Français sur leurs Véritables Ennemis),</hi> which, moderate in substance and
                    aggressive in form, gained him the honours of a translation into Polish,
                    together with a medal from King Stanislas, and brought down upon him, through
                    the <hi rend="italic">Révolutions</hi><hi rend="italic">de France</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">de Brabant,</hi> the wrath of Camille
                    Desmoulins. In 1791 he addressed to David the painter his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dithyrambe</hi><hi rend="italic">sur le Jeu de Paume—</hi> one of the most
                    Pindaric of modern odes; he was defeated in his candidature for a seat in the
                    National Assembly; and in 1792 an invective against the jacobins, published in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Paris,</hi> involved him in a quarrel with his
                    brother, Joseph Chénier, whom he was afterwards to defend against the attacks of
                    Burke. This dispute was followed by his Archilochian iambics, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sur les Suisses Révoltés du Régiment de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Chateauvieux.</hi> The Tenth of August, in ruining the hopes of monarchy, ended
                    his chances of political success, and he resolved to retire from the arena, and
                    devote himself wholly to art. The trial of Louis XVI. brought him, however, once
                    more to the front; he assisted in preparing the defence, the responsibility of
                    which he offered to share with Malesherbes; and he drew up an appeal to the
                    people which was rejected in favour of the letter afterwards printed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Moniteur.</hi> He was broken in health and spirits; Paris was
                    dangerous; he went to Rouen and to Versailles. At the latter place he wrote the
                    poems to “Fanny” and the <hi rend="italic">A Versailles,</hi> so highly praised
                    and subtly analyzed by Sainte-Beuve.</p>
                <p>But he had never ceased to oppose and to stigmatize the action of the Jacobin
                    section, and his mind was turned toward the inevitable end. It came at last. At
                    Passy (6th January 1794) his opposition to the arrest of a Madame de Pastoret,
                    with whom he was staying, led to his own seizure and to his incarceration in the
                    Saint-Lazare. A durance of some months ensued; he wrote for Mademoiselle de
                    Coigny, duchess of Fleury, the beautiful elegy, <hi rend="italic">La Jeune
                    Captive,</hi> and for the Convention the furious iambics so often read and
                    quoted. At the tribunal he appeared with forty-four others; thirty-eight were
                    condemned to death. On the morrow (25th July 1794) with Roncher the poet,
                    Trenck, and the Counts de Montalembert and de Créqui, André Chénier was taken to
                    death. As he descended the Conciergerie steps he said to Roucher, <hi
                    rend="italic">“Je n'ai rien fait pour la postérité. Pourtant</hi> (striking his
                    forehead) <hi rend="italic">j’avais quelque chose là.’’</hi> According to Henri
                    de Latonche, Roucher and Chénier, as the tumbrel rolled scaffoldwards, repeated
                    to each other the first scene of the <hi rend="italic">Andromaque</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> another account represents Roucher as noisily valiant,
                    while Chénier was mute and thoughtful. Three days afterwards, in the same place,
                    Robespierre and his fellows were executed, and the Terror was at an end.</p>
                <p>The poems of André Chénier, with the exception of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dithyrambe</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ode to Charlotte Corday,</hi> both of
                    which saw light during his life, remained unedited for five-and-twenty years. A
                    selection from his manuscripts was published at last, with retouches, by Henri
                    de Latouche, the novelist and journalist. The moment was opportune; young France
                    was in revolt against the bastard classicism of the great century, and Chénier
                    became a force in modern letters. Sainte-Beuve has compared his influence over
                    the poets of the romantic movement of the second Renaissance—an influence that
                    restrains and chastens—to that of Ingres over its painters. His greatest
                    excellence now is one of form; and this is said entirely without prejudice as to
                    his matter. His sympathy with Milton is a striking fact in his intellectual
                    character, and one that will help not a little to a just appreciation of his
                    poetical qualities. To the English reader, conscious and mindful of the rolling
                    majesty of the Miltonic harmonies, the verse of Chénier, always vigorous and
                    declamatory, often splendid and stately, sometimes passionate and lyrical, may
                    seem ineffectual enough. To his countrymen it is otherwise: <hi rend="italic"
                    >“Une flûte de buis, un archet d’or, une lyre d'ivoire,”</hi> says Sainte-Beuve,
                    <hi rend="italic">“lebeau pur, en un mot, voilà André Chénier.”</hi></p>
