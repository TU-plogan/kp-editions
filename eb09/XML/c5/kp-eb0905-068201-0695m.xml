                <p><label type="entry">CHOLERA</label> (from <hi rend="italic">χoλη,</hi> bile, and
                    pεω, to flow). Two distinct forms of disease are included under this general
                    term, namely, Simple Cholera and Malignant Cholera. Although essentially
                    different both as to their causation and their pathological relationships, these
                    two diseases may in individual cases present many symptoms of mutual
                    resemblance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Simple Cholera</hi> (synonyms, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cholera</hi><hi rend="italic">Europaea,</hi><hi rend="italic">British Cholera,
                    Summer or Autumnal Cholera)</hi> is the cholera of ancient medical writers, as
                    is apparent from the accurate description of the disease given by Hippocrates,
                    Celsus, and Arataeus. Its occurrence in an epidemic form was noticed by various
                    physicians in the 16th century, and an admirable account of the disease was
                    subsequently given by Sydenham in describing an epidemic of cholera in London in
                    1669-72.</p>
                <p>The chief symptoms in well-marked cases are vomiting and purging occurring either
                    together or alternately. The seizure is usually sudden and violent. The contents
                    of the stomach are first ejected, and this is followed by severe retching and
                    vomiting of thin fluid of bilious appearance and bitter taste. The diarrhoea
                    which accompanies or succeeds the vomiting, and is likewise of bilious
                    character, is attended with severe griping abdominal pain, while cramps
                    affecting the legs or arms greatly intensify the suffering. The effect upon the
                    system is rapid and alarming, a few hours of such an attack suflicing to reduce
                    the strongest person to a state of extreme prostration. The surface of the body
                    becomes cold, the pulse weak, the voice husky, and the whole symptoms may
                    resemble in a striking manner those of malignant cholera, to be subsequently
                    described. In unfavourable cases, particularly where the disorder is epidemic,
                    death may result within forty-eight hours. Generally, however the attack is
                    arrested and recovery soon follows, although there may remain for a considerable
                    time a degree of irritability of the alimentary canal, rendering necessary the
                    utmost care in regard to diet.</p>
                <p>Attacks of this kind are of frequent occurrence in summer and autumn in almost
                    all countries. They appear specially liable to occur when cold and damp
                    alternate with heat. Occasionally the disorder prevails so extensively as to
                    constitute an epidemic. The exciting causes of an attack are in many cases
                    errors in diet, particularly the use of unripe fruit and new vegetables, and the
                    excessive drinking of cold liquids during perspiration. Outbreaks of this
                    disorder in a household or community can sometimes be traced to the use of
                    impure water, or to noxious emanations from the sewers.</p>
                <p>In the treatment, vomiting should be encouraged so long as it shows the presence
                    of undigested food, after which opiates ought to be administered. Small opium
                    pills, or Dover’s powder, or the aromatic powder of chalk with opium, are likely
                    to be retained in the stomach, and will generally succeed in allaying the pain
                    and diarrhoea, while ice and effervescing drinks serve to quench the thirst and
                    subdue the sickness. In aggravated cases where medicines are rejected, enemata
                    of starch and laudanum, or the hypodermic injection of morphia ought to be
                    resorted to. Counterirritation by mustard or turpentine over the abdomen is
                    always of use, as is also friction with the hands where cramps are present When
                    sinking threatens, brandy and ammonia will be called for. During convalescence
                    the food should be in the form of milk and farinaceous diet, or light soups and
                    all indigestible articles must be carefully avoided.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of this disease as it affects young children <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cholera Infantum),</hi> most reliance is to be placed on the administration of
                    chalk and the use of starch enemata. In their case opium in any form cannot be
                    safely employed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Malignant Cholera</hi> (synonyms, <hi rend="italic">Asiatic
                    Cholera, Indian Cholera, Epidemic Cholera,</hi><hi rend="italic">Algide</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cholera)</hi> is probably the most severe and fatal of all
                    diseases. This form of cholera belongs originally to Asia, more particularly to
                    India, where, as well as in the Indian Archipelago, epidemics are known to have
                    occurred at various times for several centuries. It was not, however, till 1817
                    that the attention of European physicians was specially directed to the disease
                    by the outbreak of a violent epidemic of cholera at Jessore in Bengal. This was
                    followed by its rapid spread over a large portion of British India, where it
                    caused immense destruction of life both among natives and Europeans. During the
                    next three years cholera continued to rage all over India, as well as in Ceylon
                    and others of the Indian islands. The disease now began to spread over a wider
                    extent than hitherto, invading China on the east, and Persia on the west. In
                    1823 it had extended into Asia Minor and Russia in Asia, and it continued to
                    advance steadily though slowly westwards, while at the same time fresh epidemics
                    were appearing at intervals in India. From this period up till 1830 no great
                    extension of cholera took place, but in the latter year it reappeared in Persia
                    and along the shores of the Caspian Sea, and thence entered Russia in Europe.
                    Despite the strictest sanitary precautions, the disease spread rapidly through
                    that whole empire, causing great mortality and exciting consternation
                    everywhere. It ravaged the northern and central parts of Europe, and spread
                    onwards to England, appearing in Sunderland in October 1831, and in London in
                    January 1832, during which year it continued to prevail in most of the cities
                    and large towns of Great Britain and Ireland, and its disastrous effects are
                    still in the recollection of many persons. The disease subsequently extended
                    into France, Spain, and Italy, and crossing the Atlantic spread through North
                    and Central America. It had previously prevailed in Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, and
                    the Nile district, and in 1835 it was general throughout North Africa. Up till
                    1837 cholera continued to break out in various parts of the Continent of Europe,
                    after which this epidemic disappeared, having thus within twenty years visited a
                    large portion of the world.</p>
                <p>About the year 1841 another great epidemic of cholera appeared in India and
                    China, and soon began to extend in the direction traversed by the former, but
                    involving a still wider area. It entered Europe again in 1847. and spread
                    through Russia and Germany on to England, and thence to France, whence it passed
                    to America, and subsequently appeared in the West Indies. This epidemic appeal’s
                    to have been even more deadly than the former, especially as regards Great
                    Britain and France. A third great outbreak of cholera took place in the East in
                    1850, entering Europe in 1853. During the two succeeding years it prevailed
                    extensively throughout the Continent, and fell with severity on the armies
                    engaged in the Crimean War. Although widely prevalent in Great Britain and
                    Ireland it was less destructive than former epidemics. It was specially severe
                    throughout both North and South America. A fourth epidemic visited Europe again
                    in 1865-66, but was on the whole less extensive and destructive than its
                    predecessors. Cholera has since appeared in the form of limited epidemics in
                    various districts of Russia, Turkey, and Western Asia, while it still continues
                    to maintain its footing in India, where sudden outbreaks are of frequent
                    occurrence, being often connected with the assembling of crowds at native
                    festivals.</p>
                <p>A disease so widespread in its distribution and deadly in its effects has
                    naturally engaged the attention of scientific physicians in all countries.
                    Investigations into the nature of cholera and the conditions favouring its
                    propagation have been extensively carried on in England, in Germany, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n696/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0696-0683"/> and in India, not merely by those whose
                    opportunities of observing and treating the disease have been numerous, but by
                    others specially undertaking such inquiries at the suggestion of Governments or
                    other public authorities. Although many conflicting views have been propounded
                    on the above-named points, the result of these investigations has been the
                    collection of an amount of information sufficient to form the basis of a
                    rational theory of cholera, and which may be expected yet to lead to the
                    discovery of means to counteract the spread of this pestilence.</p>
                <p>The following points respecting the nature and mode of propagation of cholera are
                    generally admitted by the best authorities :—</p>
                <p>1. That cholera is a specific disease depending upon the action in the human
                    system of a morbid material (whether of the nature of a parasitic germ or a
                    poisonous miasm being still undetermined) which is originally generated in
                    certain parts of India, particularly in the delta of the Ganges and the flat
                    lands around Madras and Bombay;</p>
                <p>2. That this infective material is capable of spreading from its centre of origin
                    indefinitely, and thus cholera has appeared in an epidemic form in almost all
                    countries; and further that the disease may become acclimatized (endemic) in
                    some places;</p>
                <p>3. That when it spreads abroad the vehicle of its transmission is the discharges
                    from the bowels of persons already affected; and that from these the
                    cholera-infecting matter is exceedingly apt to be diffused through the air, to
                    contaminate water, and to become attached to clothing, bedding, furniture,
                    &amp;c., and in these various ways to find ready entrance through the lungs or
                    alimentary canal into the bodies of healthy persons, where it is capable of
                    developing the disease in a more or less severe form according to the quantity
                    introduced;</p>
                <p>4. That cholera is thus in a certain sense contagious;</p>
                <p>5. That overcrowding and other insanitary conditions, particularly the presence
                    of decomposing organic matter, afford the conditions favourable to the
                    multiplication of the cholera matter, and thus tend to spread the disease,
                    although of themselves incapable of originating it.</p>
                <p>But even admitting these propositions, it is obvious that they are insufficient
                    to explain the intense tendency of cholera to spread widely at some times more
                    than others. Without alluding to the various hypotheses which have been advanced
                    on this point, it seems probable, from the history of the disease as exhibited
                    both in Europe and in India, that various factors may alone or together be
                    concerned in the rise and spread of epidemics of cholera. It is stated that a
                    high temperature favours the development of cholera, and in general this appears
                    to be the case, but it is by no means invariable, as some of the most severe
                    epidemics raged with greatest fury in winter. That cholera might be carried by
                    the agency of winds from one country to another must be held as a possibility,
                    although no satisfactory evidence exists upon the point More probable are the
                    theories which assign to local conditions an important part in the propagation
                    of cholera. With regard to mere locality it appears that the disease has been
                    generally found to prevail more extensively and with greater virulence in
                    low-lying districts than in elevated situations. In connection with this, the
                    relation of the character of the soil to the propagation of cholera has been
                    elaborately investigated by Professor Pettenkofer of Munich, whose work in this
                    department has attained world-wide reputation, and who ascribes a powerful
                    influence in the diffusion of the disease to the ground-water of a locality
                    where cholera is prevailing,—shallow, porous soils affording, according to his
                    views, special facilities for the reception, proliferation, and distribution of
                    the so-called cholera germs. Further, the observations of Dr Snow, Dr Frankland,
                    and Mr Simon in certain epidemics of cholera in London have conclusively
                    connected outbreaks of the disease in various districts with the use of
                    drinking-water contaminated with the discharges from cholera patients. All
                    investigations appear clearly to show that the prime factor, and that without
                    which no other conditions can take effect, is the introduction into the locality
                    of the specific infecting matter, this being accomplished in general by the
                    arrival of infected persons, for cholera epidemics, as is well known, spread
                    mostly in the lines of human intercourse and travel. But further, in this as in
                    other acute infectious diseases, a special liability of individuals must be
                    admitted, as is proved by the fact that among persons living under precisely the
                    same conditions some will suffer while others escape, and likewise that persons
                    inhabiting cholera districts may come to enjoy an immunity from attacks of the
                    disease. Among known predisposing causes, the incautious employment of purgative
                    medicines, the use of unripe fruit, bad and insufficient food, intemperance,
                    personal uncleanliness, overcrowding, and all kinds of unfavourable hygienic
                    surroundings play an important part during the course of any epidemic of
                    cholera.</p>
                <p>In describing the symptoms of cholera it is customary to divide them into three
                    stages, but it must be noted that these do not always present themselves in so
                    distinct a form as to be capable of separate recognition. The first or
                    premonitory stage consists in the occurrence of diarrhoea. Frequently of mild
                    and painless character, and coming on after some error in diet, this symptom is
                    apt to be disregarded. The discharges from the bowels are similar to those of
                    ordinary summer cholera, which the attack closely resembles. There is, however,
                    at first the absence of vomiting. This diarrhoea generally lasts for two or
                    three days, and then if it does not gradually subside either may pass into the
                    more severe phenomena characteristic of the second stage of cholera, or on the
                    other hand may itself prove fatal.</p>
                <p>The second stage of cholera is termed the stage of collapse or the algide or
                    asphyxiai stage. As above mentioned, this is often preceded by the premonitory
                    diarrhoea, but not unfrequently the phenomena attendant upon this stage are the
                    first to manifest themselves. They come on often suddenly in the night with
                    diarrhoea of the most violent character, the matters discharged being of
                    whey-like appearance, and commonly termed the “rice-water” evacuations. They
                    contain large quantities of disintegrated epithelium from the mucous membrane of
                    the intestines. The discharge, which is at first unattended with pain, is soon
                    succeeded by copious vomiting of matters similar to those passed from the
                    bowels, accompanied with severe pain at the pit of the stomach, and with intense
                    thirst. The symptoms now advance with rapidity. Cramps of the legs, feet, and
                    muscles of the abdomen come on and occasion great agony, while the signs of
                    collapse make their appearance. The surface of the body becomes cold and assumes
                    a blue or purple hue, the skin is dry, sodden, and wrinkled, indicating the
                    intense draining away of the fluids of the body, the features are pinched and
                    the eyes deeply sunken, the pulse at the wrist is imperceptible, and the voice
                    is reduced to a hoarse whisper (the vox cholerica). There is complete
                    suppression of the urine.</p>
                <p>In this condition death often takes place in less than one day, but in epidemics
                    cases are frequently observed where the collapse is so sudden and complete as to
                    prove fatal in one or two hours even without any great amount of previous
                    purging or vomiting. In most instances the mental faculties are comparatively
                    unaffected, although in the later stages there is in general more or less
                    apathy.</p>
                <p>Reaction, however, may take place, and this constitutes the third stage of
                    cholera. It consists in the arrest of the alarming symptoms characterizing the
                    second stage, and the gradual but evident improvement in the patient’s con <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0697-0684"/> dition. The pulse returns, the surface assumes a
                    natural hue, and the bodily heat is restored. Before long the vomiting ceases,
                    and although diarrhoea may continue for a time, it is not of a very severe
                    character and soon subsides as do also the cramps. The urine may remain
                    suppressed for some time, and on returning is often found to be albuminous. Even
                    in this stage, however, the danger is not past, for relapses sometimes occur
                    which speedily prove fatal, while again the reaction may be of imperfect
                    character, and there may succeed an exhausting fever (the so-called typhoid
                    stage of cholera) which may greatly retard recovery, and under which the patient
                    may sink at a period even as late as two or three weeks from the commencement of
                    the illness.</p>
                <p>Many other complications are apt to arise during the progress of convalescence
                    from cholera, such as diphtheritic and local inflammatory affections, all of
                    which are attended with grave danger.</p>
                <p>When the attack of cholera is of milder character in all its stages than that
                    above described, it has been named <hi rend="italic">Cholerine,</hi> but the
                    term is an arbitrary one and the disease is essentially cholera.</p>
                <p>The bodies of persons dying of cholera are found to remain long warm, and the
                    temperature may even rise after death. Peculiar muscular contractions have been
                    observed to take place after death, so that the position of the limbs may become
                    altered. The soft textures of the body are found to be dry and hard, and the
                    muscles of a dark brown appearance. The blood is of dark colour and tarry
                    consistence. The upper portion of the small intestines is generally found
                    distended with the rice-water discharges, the mucous membrane is swollen, and
                    there is a remarkable loss of its natural epithelium. The kidneys are usually in
                    a state of acute congestion.</p>
                <p>With respect to the mortality from cholera no very accurate estimate can be
                    formed, since during the prevalence of the disease the milder cases are apt to
                    escape notice, and it is certain that some epidemics are of a more virulent
                    character than others. It is generally reckoned, however, that about one-half
                    the cases of fully developed cholera prove fatal, death taking place in a large
                    proportion of instances in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours. It has been
                    noticed that in cholera epidemics the mortality is relatively greater at the
                    commencement of the outbreak. The disease appears to be most fatal in children
                    and aged persons.</p>
                <p>As illustrating the destructive effects of cholera, it may be mentioned that in
                    the first epidemic in England and Wales 52,547 deaths were reported to the Board
                    of Health, but this number was doubtless below the actual amount. In the second
                    epidemic (1848-9) there were 55,181 deaths from cholera in England alone,
                    besides 28,900 from diarrhoea. The subsequent epidemics in this country have
                    been much less fatal.</p>
                <p>Thetreatment of cholera embraces those sanitary measures requisite to be adopted
                    with the view of preventing as far as possible the introduction of the disease
                    into localities previously unaffected, or of checking its spread when
                    introduced, as well as the special medical management of those who have been
                    attacked. These topics can be alluded to only in general terms.</p>
                <p>When cholera threatens to invade any place, however favourably circumstanced as
                    to its hygienic condition, increased vigilance will be requisite on the part of
                    those entrusted with the care of the public health. Where the disease is likely
                    to be imported by ships, quarantine regulations will be necessary, and, where
                    practicable, measures of isolation should be adopted in the case of individuals
                    or companies of people coming from infected localities, more especially if they
                    have, or have recently had, any symptoms of cholera in their own persons. It is
                    certain that cholera may be introduced into a community by one or more
                    individuals who have themselves only suffered from the first or milder stage of
                    the disease (cholera diarrhoea), since the discharges from the bowels abound in
                    the infective matter, and where sanitary arrangements are deficient may readily
                    contaminate the water or air of a locality.</p>
                <p>The utmost care will be demanded, particularly in populous districts, in
                    cleansing and disinfecting places where accumulations of animal refuse are apt
                    to occur. The condition of the drinking water and of the wells in which it is
                    collected will always require inspection, as will also the quality of the food
                    supplied, more especially to the poor. Where suspicion attaches to the water, it
                    should be boiled before being used, and the same holds true of the milk. The
                    establishment of cholera hospitals, with a thoroughly equipped staff of medical
                    attendants and nurses, is one of the first and most important steps to be taken
                    in any threatened epidemic, as affording opportunity for the removal and
                    isolation of those attacked at an early period, while every facility should be
                    given to the poorer classes of obtaining medical aid. Instructions should be
                    issued by the authorities warning all persons against the use of unwholesome
                    food, unripe fruit, and excesses of every kind, and recommending early
                    application for medical advice where there is any tendency to diarrhoea. House
                    to house visitation by members of a sanitary staff will be of great service, not
                    merely in discovering cases of the disease, but in the important work of
                    disinfection, which should not be left entirely to the inhabitants, but be done
                    systematically by the authorities. The discharges from cholera patients should
                    be disinfected with such substances as carbolic acid or sulphate of iron before
                    removal, and special care be taken that they are not disposed of in places where
                    they may contaminate drinking water. Every article of clothing which has been in
                    contact with a cholera patient should if possible be burnt, while infected
                    apartments should be thoroughly disinfected with carbolic acid or by fumigation
                    with sulphur. The early burial of those dying from cholera is obviously a matter
                    of urgent necessity.</p>
                <p>The influence of fear in predisposing to attacks of cholera has been greatly
                    exaggerated and is now generally discredited. But apart from such considerations
                    there can be no doub of the wisdom of those to whom it is practicable in
                    removing from a place where cholera is raging.</p>
                <p>With respect to the treatment of cholera, it may be safely affirmed, that as to
                    no disease has so much difference of opinion prevailed or so many extravagant
                    notions been entertained regarding the value of remedies. There is a want of
                    agreement as to fundamental principles of treatment; for while astringents have
                    been regarded by some as their sheet anchor, others have condemned them as worse
                    than useless, and rely on the elimination of the <hi rend="italic">materies
                    morbi</hi> by means of laxatives. Much evil has been done by the manner in which
                    various systems of treatment have been extolled by over-sanguine practitioners
                    as possessing special curative value. Indeed to enumerate the different
                    medicines which have been suggested and employed for the treatment of this
                    disease would be a work of no little difficulty. It is sufficient to state that
                    no medicinal agent has yet been found to be of infallible efficacy in the
                    treatment of cholera. Nevertheless, much may be done, and many lives saved, by
                    the timely application of certain well-approved remedies. The various stages of
                    the disease demand special treatment. In the earlier period of the attack for
                    the cholera-diarrhoea the use of opium is of undoubted value. Given alone in
                    small and oft-repeated doses, or in combination with other astringents, such as
                    catechu, tannin, bismuth, nitrate of silver, or acetate of lead, it frequently
                    succeeds in quelling this symptom, and thus arresting the disease at the
                    outset.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0698-0685"/>
                <p>Strict confinement to bed and the administration of bland drinks such as milk,
                    barley-water, and beef-tea, along with counter-irritation to the abdomen, will
                    be found valuable adjuvants to treatment. In the second stage of cholera opium
                    is of less value, and other remedies are called for. The violent vomiting and
                    purging and the intense thirst may be relieved by iced effervescing drinks,
                    while at the same time endeavours should be made to maintain the heat of the
                    body by friction with stimulating liniments or mustard to the surface, and by
                    enveloping the body in flannel and surrounding it with hot bottles. For the
                    relief of the cramps the inhalation of chloroform is recommended, and probably
                    chloral would be found of equal value. Stimulants such as ammonia and brandy
                    must be had recourse to where these measures fail to establish reaction and the
                    patient threatens to sink. When reaction occurs and the vomiting ceases, liquid
                    food in small quantities should be cautiously administered.</p>
