                            Howard, Seventh Earl of(1802-1864)</hi></label>, Lord-Lieutenant of
                    Ireland, was born in London, 18th April 1802. He was the eldest son of the sixth
                    earl by his wife Lady Georgiana Cavendish, eldest daughter of the duke of
                    Devonshire, and bore at first the courtesy title of Lord Morpeth. He was
                    educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, where he earned a reputation as a
                    scholar and writer of graceful verse, obtaining in 1821 both the Chancellor’s
                    and the Newdigate prizes for a Latin and an English poem. Two years later he
                    graduated B.A. as first class in classics. In 1826 he accompanied his uncle, the
                    duke of Devonshire, to Russia, to attend the coronation of the Emperor Nicholas,
                    and became a great favourite in society at St Petersburg. At the general
                    election of the same year he was returned to parliament as member for the family
                    borough of Morpeth. In one of his earliest speeches he undertook, at the risk of
                    forfeiting the good opinion of the Liberal party, the defence of the Russian
                    emperor against severe attacks made on him in reference to the suppression of
                    the Polish insurrection of 1830. In the agitation for parliamentary reform he
                    took the side of Earl Grey; and after the dissolution of parliament, which took
                    place about that time, he was elected member for Yorkshire. This seat he held
                    till after the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832. In the following year he was
                    returned for the West Riding; and in 1835 he was appointed by Lord Melbourne
                    Chief Secretary for Ireland, a position at that time of great difficulty,
                    O’Connell being then at the height of his reputation. This post he held for
                    about six years, winning great popularity by his amiable manners and kindly
                    disposition. Losing his seat at the election of 1841, he availed himself of the
                    leisure thus afforded him *to visit the United States. He afterwards gave an
                    account of this visit in a popular lecture, first delivered at Leeds and
                    subsequently repeated at other places. In 1846 he was again elected for the West
                    Riding. Two years later, on the death of his father, he succeeded to the peerage
                    and took his seat in the Upper House. He accepted office as Chief Commissioner
                    of Woods and Forests, and afterwards as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
                    The great event of his life, however, was his appointment by Lord Palmerston to
                    the Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland in 1855. This high office he continued to hold
                    till March 1858, and again from June 1859 till within a few months of his death.
                    His retirement in August 1864 was necessitated by failing health. Lord Carlisle
                    was not a man ot great and original power, but he was above the average in
                    knowledge, in acquirements, and in eloquence. As* a debater he held his own in
                    the midst of a large number of great orators, and in the stormy controversies of
                    his Irish secretaryship he succeeded in carrying through the House of Commons
                    several measures of great importance. His literary tastes and culture were
                    displayed in various popular lectures and in several published works. Among
                    these may be mentioned a lecture on <hi rend="italic">The Life and Writings of
                        Pope</hi> (1851); <hi rend="italic">Ths Last of the Greeks,</hi> a tragedy
                    (1828); a <hi rend="italic">Diary in Turkish and Greek Waters</hi> (1854), the
                    fruit of travels in the East in 1853 and 1854; and a volume of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Poems,</hi> published after his death. He took warm interest in the
                    reformation of juvenile criminals, and established on his own estate one of the
                    best conducted reformatories in the country. Lord Carlisle died at Castle Howard
                    on the 5th of December 1864. He was never married, and was succeeded in the
                    peerage by his brother. In 1866 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Viceregal
                        Speeches,</hi> collected and edited by J. Gaskin.</p>
