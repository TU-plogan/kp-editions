                    interesting buildings of modern date are a feudal castle on the top of the hill,
                    and the church of St Sabinus the patron saint of the city, with its mosque-like
                    cupolas and ancient pulpit. In the neighbourhood of the latter stands the tomb
                    of Bohemond of Antioch, who died in 1102. The ruins of the o!d Roman city extend
                    for a considerable distance beyond the modern town; large portions of its walls
                    can still be traced; and there are extensive remains of an amphitheatre which
                    was larger than that of Pompeii, and a gateway, frequently described as a
                    triumphal arch, dedicated to Trajan. Various explorations have brought to light
                    great numbers of vases, inscriptions, and miscellaneous antiquities, among which
                    is a complete list of the members of the municipal senate. The vases, which have
                    been principally derived, from the sepulchres excavated in the tufa rock which
                    were, discovered about 1803, are large in size and somewhat coarse in
                    workmanship. (See Millin, <hi rend="italic">Description des</hi><hi

                    several of the more important cities in this part of Italy, Canusium is said to
                    have been founded by the Grecian hero Diomede; the origin of the city, however,
                    can be traced with tolerable certainty to the Pelasgi. Canusium is first
                    mentioned in history as assisting the Samnites in their wars against the Romans,
                    by whom it was subdued for the first time 318 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In
                    the second Punic war the inhabitants gave shelter within their walls to the
                    remnant of the Roman army, which retreated thither after the rout at Cannae. In
                    the second year of the social war, in which Canusium joined the revolted allies,
                    it was besieged unsuccessfully by the Romans. In the civil wars it suffered
                    severely, but always contrived to preserve its municipal privileges, and was
                    never <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n33/mode/1up"

                    Aurelius. In the <hi rend="italic">Iter ad Brundusiu∕rn</hi> of Horace, its
                    bread is described as gritty, and its water as extremely scanty. This last
                    defect was remedied by Herodes Atticus, who constructed an aqueduct, of which
                    the remains are still visible. In the tenth satire of the first book of Horace,
                    the inhabitants are called <hi rend="italic">bilingues,</hi> probably from their
                    speaking Latin or Greek indifferently. Till a late period in the Middle Ages
                    Canusium continued an important and flourishing city; but it suffered severely
                    at the hands of Lombards and Saracens. In 1694 it was laid in ruins by an
                    earthquake, and in 1851 it was considerably injured by a similar disturbance.
                    The title of prince of Canosa was bestowed in 1712 on Tiberio Capece.
