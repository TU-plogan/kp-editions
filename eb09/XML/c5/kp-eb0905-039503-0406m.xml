                    solicitor, and was accordingly placed with a Mr Ramsay, wood-carver in
                    Sheffield. When in this situation, he became acquainted with Mr Raphael Smith, a
                    distinguished draftsman in crayon, who gave him lessons in painting; and
                    Chantrey, eager to commence his course as an artist, procured the cancelling of
                    his indentures, and went to try his fortune in Dublin and Edinburgh, and finally
                    in London. Here he first obtained employment as an assistant wood-carver, but at
                    the same time devoted himself to portrait-painting, bust-sculpture, and
                    modelling in clay. The sculptor Nollekens showed particular zeal in recognizing
                    his merits. His first imaginative work was the model of the head of Satan, which
                    was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1808. He afterwards executed for Greenwich
                    Hospital four colossal busts of the admirals Duncan, Howe, Vincent, and Nelson;
                    and so rapidly did his reputation spread that the next bust which he executed,
                    that of Horne Tooke, procured him commissions to the extent of £12,000. From
                    this period he was almost uninterruptedly engaged in professional labour. In
                    1819 he visited Italy, and became acquainted with the most distinguished
                    sculptors of Florence and Rome. He was chosen an associate, and afterwards a
                    member, of the Royal Academy (1816 and 1818), received the degree of Μ.A. from
                    Cambridge, and that of D.C.L. from Oxford, and in 1837 was knighted. He died
                    after an illness of only two hours* duration, on the 25th November 1841, having
                    for some years suffered from disease of the heart, and was buried in a tomb
                    constructed by himself in the church of his native village. The works of
                    Chantrey are extremely numerous. The principal are the statues of Washington in
                    the Statehouse of Boston, of George III. in London, of George IV. at Brighton,
                    of Pitt in Hanover Square, London, of Watt in Westminster Abbey and at Glasgow,
                    of Roscoe and Canning at Liverpool, of Dalton at Manchester, of Lord-President
                    Blair and Lord Melville in Edinburgh, &amp;c. Of his equestrian statues the most
                    famous are those of Sir Thomas Munro at Calcutta, and the Duke of Wellington in
                    front of the London Exchange. But the finest of Chantrey’s works are his busts,
                    and his delineations of children. The figures of two children asleep in each
                    other’s arms, which form a monumental design in Lichfield Cathedral, have always
                    been lauded for beauty, simplicity, and grace. So is also the statue of the
                    girlish Lady Louisa Russell, represented as standing on tiptoe and fondling a
                    dove in her bosom. Both these works, it should, however, be explained, were
                    executed from designs by Stothard; for Ohantrey knew his own scantiness of ideal
                    invention or composition, and on system sought aid from others for such
                    attempts. In busts, his leading excellence is facility —a ready unconstrained
                    air of life, a prompt vivacity of ordinary expression. Allan Cunningham and
                    Weekes were his chief assistants, and were indeed the active executants of many
                    works that pass under Chantrey’s name. Chantrey was a man of warm and genial
                    temperament, and is said to have borne a noticeable though commonplace
                    resemblance to the usual portraits of Shakespeare. He bequeathed his valuable
                    collection, and his whole fortune, after the death of Lady Chantrey, to the
                    Royal Academy, for the encouragement of British sculpture and painting. It is
                    but very recently that this bequest has taken actual <pb break="no"

                    mean to administer the trust still (1876) remains indefinite.</p>
