                    rendered defensible either by nature or art. The term is also often applied to
                    the principal mansion of a prince or nobleman.</p>
                <p>The frequent and protracted wars between neighbouring tribes and peoples which
                    took place in early times must soon have rendered evident the expediency of
                    erecting forts. These at first consisted only of earthen ramparts or rows of
                    palisades, situated mostly on commanding eminences. With improved methods of
                    assault and the advance of constructive art came erections of wood and stone,
                    which by and by were flanked with towers and surrounded by a wall and ditch.
                    Increased mechanical and architectural skill, while it made little alteration on
                    the fundamental plan of such buildings, gradually introduced numerous
                    contrivances for repelling assault, and. rendering a great castle well-nigh
                    impregnable.</p>
                <p>Confining our narrative of the progress of castle-building to Britain, we notice
                    first the hiU-forts which are ascribed to the ancient Britons. Typical examples
                    of them are the Herefordshire Beacon on the Malvern Hills, and the Barmekin of
                    Echt in Aberdeenshire. The latter consists of the remains of two circular dry
                    stone walls surrounded by three ditches. The inner wall seems to have been about
                    12 feet thick, and 300 yards in circumference, and contains five entrances all
                    in an oblique direction. The outer wall, which is said to be more modern than
                    the inner, is much more entire, and has no entrances through it. The ditches are
                    about 9 feet broad.</p>
                <p>Of the castella which the Romans erected in this country during their long
                    occupation of it, Richborough Castle near Sandwich in Kent is almost the only
                    relic. It is, from the evidence of coins found there, supposed to have been
                    built, or at any rate completed, in the time of the Emperor Severus. The ruins
                    at present form nearly three sides— the southern, western, and northern—of a
                    rectangle, and it is commonly supposed that the fourth side, the eastern, facing
                    the River Stour, has been destroyed by the giving way of the terrace on which it
                    stood. The length of the southern wall is 260, of the western 460, and of the
                    northern 440 feet.</p>
                <p>The height of the walls varies from 10 to 30 feet; and their thickness, from 11
                    to 12 feet at the base, diminishes slightly towards the top. In the western and
                    northern walls are two openings which are usually denominated the decuman and
                    postern gates. Round towers are said to have existed at the corners, and square
                    ones at convenient distances along the walls, but no traces of them are now to
                    be found. The walls, which are enormously strong and faced with regular courses
                    of squared stones, consist of rows of boulders alternating with courses of
                    bonding tiles. Nearly in the centre of the castle is the base of a cruciform
                    building resting on a substructure of masonry, which is conjectured to have been
                    the <hi rend="italic">augurale,</hi> where the auguries were taken, and where
                    was situated the <hi rend="italic">sacellum</hi> for the reception of the
                    ensigns.</p>
                <p>Regarding the castles built by our Saxon forefathers our knowledge is scanty.
                    They were probably not very numerous, and some of them were built principally of
                    wood. Alfred, who did so much for the defence of the country, constructed
                    several strongholds which his successors do not seem to have kept up or
                    improved. At all events they offered little resistance to William the Norman,
                    who, in order effectually to guard against invasions from without as well as to
                    awe his newly-acquired subjects, immediately began to erect castles all over the
                    kingdom, and likewise to repair and augment the old ones. Besides, as he had
                    parcelled out the lands of the English amongst his followers, they, to protect
                    themselves from the resentment of the despoiled natives, built strongholds and
                    castles on their estates, and these were multiplied so rapidly that tow ards the
                    latter end of the reign of King Stephen they amounted to 1115.</p>
                <p>As the feudal system gathered strength, the lords of castles began to arrogate to
                    themselves a royal power, not only within their castles, but likewise in their
                    environs, —exercising judicature both civil and criminal, coining money, and
                    arbitrarily seizing forage and provisions for the subsistence of their
                    garrisons, which they afterwards demanded as a right. Their insolence and
                    oppression grew to such a pitch that, according to William of Newbury, “there
                    were in England as many kings, or rather tyrants, as lords of castles;” and
                    Matthew Paris emphatically styles them “nests of devils and dens of thieves.”
                    The licentious behaviour of the garrisons having at length become intolerable,
                    it was agreed in the treaty between Stephen and Henry II., when the latter was
                    duke of Normandy, that all the castles built within a certain period should be
                    demolished; in consequence of which many were actually razed, but not the number
                    stipulated.</p>
                <p>The style of castle erected in England after the Conquest seems to have been that
                    of buildings of a similar kind in France, such as the castles of Chamboy,
                    Domfront, Falaise, Nogent-le-Rotrou, Beaugency, Loches, Chauvigny, and many
                    others. Like them, the Norman castle was commonly situated on an eminence, or on
                    the bank of a river. The whole site of the castle, which was frequently of great
                    extent and irregular figure, was surrounded by a deep and broad ditch, called
                    the moat or fosse, which could be easily filled with water or left dry. In some
                    of the later castles, before the principal entrances was placed an outwork
                    called the barbacan, which was a high wall surmounted by battlements and
                    occasionally turrets to defend the gate and the drawbridge, which communicated
                    therewith. The drawbridge across the moat was constructed of wood, and, by means
                    of chains and weights, could be pulled up against the entrance, thus cutting off
                    all communication with the outside. On the inside of the moat stood the outer
                    bailey wall, about 8 or 10 feet thick, and from 20 to 30 feet high, surmounted
                    by a parapet not less than 1 foot thick, with crenellated embattlements or
                    embrasures. This parapet afforded protection to the defenders of the castle, who
                    stood upon the wall, and through the crenelles discharged arrows, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n209/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0209-0198"/> darts, and stones at the besiegers. On the wall,
                    and projecting out from it were built at proper distances square or round
                    towers, sometimes called bastions, generally one story higher than the wall so
                    as to command it. The lower story of the walls and towers was often built with a
                    batter, or slope outwards to strengthen, and also to keep the assailants farther
                    from, the walls. Thus the defenders were not compelled to lean far over the
                    parapet, and expose their bodies to the archers of the enemy who were placed at
                    a distance to guard those engaged in undermining the walls. In one of the towers
                    and sometimes in the wall near a tower was the postern gate at a considerable
                    distance from the ground. This gate was used for the egress of messengers during
                    a siege. The principal entrance or main gate of the castle was of great
                    strength, and was usually flanked with strong towers having embattled parapets.
                    It was made of wood, cased with iron, and was rendered doubly secure by an iron
                    portcullis which slid downwards in grooves in the masonry. Within the outer wall
                    was a large open space or court called the outer bailey, bayle, or ballium, in
                    which stood commonly a church or chapel. On the inside of the outer bailey and
                    surrounded by a ditch stood another wall and parapet, with gate and towers
                    similar to those on the outer wall. Round the inside of this inner wall were
                    arranged the offices for the servants and retainers, the granaries, storehouses,
                    and other necessary buildings. These constituted the inner bailey. Within all
                    these was the keep, built sometimes on an artificial mound. It was a large,
                    high, square or rectangular tower more strongly fortified than any of the other
                    parts of the castle, and was the last resort of the garrison when all the
                    outworks were taken. Its walls, from 10 to about 20 feet in thickness at the
                    base, and diminishing towards the top, on which was placed an embattled parapet,
                    often admitted of chambers and staircases being constructed in them. On each
                    side of the keep there was usually a flat Norman buttress, and at the corners
                    were embattled turrets carried one story higher than the parapet, as may bo seen
                    in the keeps ∩f Rochester, Newcastle, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The entrance was on the first floor, and was reached by an open flight of steps,
                    which could be readily defended, or by a staircase in a turret at one of the
                    angles. The interior was divided by a strong middle partition wall, in which
                    were openings for communication with the different apartments. In this wall was
                    the well of the castle, often of great depth, and with a shaft ascending through
                    all the stories to the top of the keep. The several floors were of stone or
                    wood. The basement floor contained the storerooms and the dungeon for prisoners,
                    and had no fights from the outside. On the first floor were situated the
                    soldiers’ apartments, guard-room, &amp;c., lighted only by small loopholes. The
                    second floor was taken up by the baronial hall in which the baron or governor
                    and his retainers dined. The third floor contained, probably, the chapel and
                    apartments of the governor and his family. The two upper floors were lighted by
                    small round-headed Norman windows. Although there were unquestionably great
                    variations in the structure of castles, yet the most perfect of them were built
                    on the plan above described. As an illustration we give a ground-plan of Dover
                    Castle copied by permission from <hi rend="italic">The Architect.</hi></p>
                <p>The towers along the outer bailey wall (such as Avranches tower, Marshall’s
                    tower, and the Constable’s tower in Dover Castle) were, in the case of royal
                    castles, each protected by men of approved fidelity and valour, to whom estate^
                    were granted on condition of their performing castle-guard. Each had also to
                    keep his particular tower in repair, and supply the requisite number of men to
                    defend it during a siege. In process of time these services were commuted for
                    annual rents, sometimes styled wardpenny and waytfee, but commonly castle-guard
                    rents, payable on fixed days, under prodigious penalties called sursizes. At
                    Rochester if a man failed in the payment of his rent of castle-guard on the
                    feast of St Andrew, his debt was doubled every tide while the payment was
                    delayed. These were afterwards restrained by an Act of Parliament made in the
                    reign of Henry VIII., and finally annihilated, with the tenures by knight’s
                    service, in the time of Charles II. Such castles as were private property were
                    guarded either by mercenary soldiers, or by the tenants of the lord or owner.
                    Windsor, Warwick, Kenilworth, Conway, Carnarvon, and many others of the later
                    Norman castles differ from the earlier ones chiefly in the structure of the
                    keep, which contained in some instances an open quadrangular court, and had the
                    chapel, the hall, and the state apartments arranged round the sides. The turrets
                    at the corners and on the walls were of various shapes, round, square, and
                    polygonal, and had embrasures and machicolations.</p>
                <p>The machicolations were corbelled projections, with apertures between, down which
                    stones could be thrown, or molten lead poured, on the assailants. The principal
                    entrances were defended by large circular towers, with machicolations over the
                    front of the gate, and sometimes more than one portcullis.</p>
                <p>The Scotch castles were in general square or rectangular <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n210/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0210-0199"/> keeps or peels, and depended for their security
                    greatly upon their site. Some of them were situated on precipitous rocks on the
                    seacoast, such as Fast, Tantallon, Dunot-tar; others on islands in a lake or
                    river, such as Lochleven and Th reave. Edinburgh and Stirling castles, like many
                    others in England and on the Continent, illustrate well one of the functions
                    often discharged by fortresses, that of forming a nucleus for a village or
                    city.</p>
                <p>As civilization advanced and the country enjoyed more peace and security,
                    buildings were erected with a greater regard to comfort and elegance, though
                    still retaining many of the features of a fortress, such as the moat, the
                    drawbridge, and the gatehouse. Examples of these castellated mansions are seen
                    in Caistor, Norfolk, and Herstmonceaux, Sussex, erected in the 15th century. But
                    it should not be forgotten that many of the castles of older date were by
                    subsequent repairs, improvements, and adaptations so transformed in course of
                    time as to resemble more modern structures. Castles of recent date are merely
                    imitations of these with some of their features preserved for ornament.</p>
