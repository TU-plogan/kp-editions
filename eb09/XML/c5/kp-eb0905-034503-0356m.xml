                    and harvest, worshipped jointly with Liber (Bacchus) and Libera (Proserpine). No
                    special myth or personal history is known to have been attached to her. But
                    early in the times of the Republic, when Greek deities were introduced into Rome
                    on the advice of the Sibylline books, Demeter, the Greek goddess of seed and
                    harvest, whose worship was largely spread in Sicily and Lower Italy, usurped in
                    Rome the divine position which Ceres held before; or rather to Ceres were added
                    the religious rites which the Greeks paid to Demeter, and the mythological
                    incidents which, originated with her. These rites were Greek in their language
                    and forms, the priestesses were Greeks, and the temple was Greek in its
                    architecture. Her principal festivals were (1) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cerealia</hi> (April 12-19), corresponding in the main idea with the Eleusinia,
                    and (2) the <hi rend="italic">Jejunium</hi> Cereris (October 4), corresponding
                    to the Thesmophoria of Demeter. The Cerealia included the spectacle of hunting a
                    fox with a torch attached to his tail. Her temple in Rome had been destroyed by
                    fire, and was rebuilt by Augustus. Claudius attempted to introduce the mysteries
                    of Eleusis into Rome in connection with her worship.</p>
                <p>As regards the Greek goddess, the chief interest of her worshippers was
                    concentrated on the myth which told how her only daughter Persephone
                    (Proserpine) had been carried off in a chariot by Pluto, the god of the lower
                    world, from the fields of Enna in Sicily, where she was gathering flowers; other
                    districts also were assigned for this incident, but the Romans naturally
                    preferred Enna as being the nearest. Demeter wandered over the earth searching
                    for her daughter in vain, in her anguish refusing food or drink, and threatening
                    a famine for mankind, till Zeus agreed to allow Persephone in future to live
                    half the year with her mother on the earth. The other half she must remain with
                    Pluto in the lower world. From the myth so far it was a∣ obvious step to think
                    of Demeter as a mother always anxious for her child, yearning through half the
                    year to see her again, and sad through the other half at the prospect of her
                    leaving again. But a deeper meaning appears to have been found in the myth by
                    those who were initiated into the mysteries of Eleusis, in which seems to have
                    been taught the principle of a new life after death, founded on the return of
                    Persephone to the upper world, or rather on the process of nature by which seed
                    sown in the ground must first die and rot before it can yield new life, a
                    process which the annual going and coming of Persephone was designed to
                    illustrate. To make more explicit this connection of Demeter with seed-sowing,
                    the myth tells how, in searching for her daughter, she was hospitably received
                    among other places at Eleusis in Attica, and how, when leaving Eleusis, she gave
                    to Triptolemus, the king’s son, her chariot drawn by winged snakes, with the
                    injunction to travel over the world teaching men to cultivate grain as she had
                    then begun to teach them. At the Thesmophoria, a festival in which only married
                    women took part, Demeter was regarded as having instituted certain laws <hi
                    rend="italic">(θeσμo[)</hi> for regulating life, in particular the married life
                    of women. In the Cretan myth of Demeter she was connected with a hero Jasion,
                    said to have been the first to sow grain, to whom she bore a son, Plutos.
                    Poseidon, the god of the sea, appears as repugnant to her in the myth, according
                    to which she took the form of a horse to escape him, but was overtaken, and
                    finally bore to him the winged horse Arion. It may have been with reference to
                    this that she was figured in . an ancient image at Phigaleia as having a horse’s
                    in place of a human head. Her attributes were a veil and diadem on her head,
                    ears of corn or poppies in her hand. Her principal sacrifice consisted of pigs.
                    Demeter was a daughter of Kronos and Rhea. Zeus was the father of
                    Persephone.</p>
