                    the chariots and horses were held in readiness. This end constituted also the
                    front of the building with the main entrance. At each end of the course were
                    conical pillars <hi rend="italic">(metoe)</hi> to mark its limits.</p>
                <p>The oldest building of this kind in Rome was the <hi rend="smallcaps">Circus
                    Maximus,</hi> in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine hills, where
                    previous to any permanent structure races ap <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> pear
                    to have been held beside the altar of the god Consus. The first building is
                    assigned to Tarquin the younger, but for a long time little seems to have been
                    done to complete its accommodation, since it is not till 329 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> that we hear of stalls being erected for the chariots
                    and horses. It was not in fact till under the empire that the circus became a
                    conspicuous public resort. Caesar enlarged it to some extent, and also made a
                    canal 10 feet broad between the lowest tier of seats and the course as a
                    precaution for the spectators’ safety when exhibitions of fighting with wild
                    beasts, such as were afterwards confined to the amphitheatre, took place. When
                    these exhibitions were removed, and the canal <hi rend="italic">(euripus)</hi>
                    was no longer necessary, Nero filled it up. Augustus is said to have placed an
                    obelisk between the metae or goals, and to have built a new <hi rend="italic"
                    >pulvinar,</hi> or state box; but if this is taken in connection with the fact
                    that the circus had been partially destroyed by fire in 31 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> it may be supposed that besides this he had restored it altogether.
                    Only the lower tiers of seats were of stone, the others being of wood, and this,
                    from the liability to fire, may account for the frequent restorations to which
                    it was subject; it would also explain the falling of the seats by which a crowd
                    of people were killed in the time of Antoninus Pius. In the reign of Claudius,
                    apparently after a fire, the carceres of stone (tufa) were replaced by marble,
                    and the metoe of wood by bronze gilt. Under Domitian, again, after a fire, the
                    circus was rebuilt and the carceres increased to 12 instead of 8 as before. The
                    work was finished by Trajan. The number of people it could seat is given at
                    150,000 and at 250,000, the latter being supposed to be the more correct. This
                    was the only public spectacle at which men and women were not assigned to
                    separate places. The lower seats were reserved for persons of rank; the state
                    box, <hi rend="italic">suggestus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cubiculum,</hi> was
                    midway in the range of seats. The principal object of attraction apart from the
                    racing must have been the spina or low wall which ran down the middle of the
                    course, with its obelisks, images, and ornamental shrines. On it also were seven
                    figures of dolphins and seven oval objects, one of which was taken down at every
                    round made in a race, so that spectators might see readily how the contest
                    proceeded. The chariot race consisted of seven rounds of the course. The
                    chariots started abreast, but in an oblique line, so that the outer chariot
                    might ba compensated for the wider circle it had to make at the other end. Such
                    a race was called a <hi rend="italic">missus,</hi> and as many as 24 of these
                    would take place in a day. The competitors <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n805/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0805-0792"/> wore different colours, originally white and red
                    <hi rend="italic">(albata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">russata)</hi>; afterwards
                    the colours green <hi rend="italic">(prasina)</hi> and blue <hi rend="italic"
                    >(veneta)</hi> were added, and further, under Domitian, gold and purple, but
                    these last two were not long retained. To provide the horses and large staff of
                    attendants, it was necessary to apply to rich capitalists and owners of studs,
                    and from this there grew up in time four select companies <hi rend="italic"
                    >(factiones)</hi> of circus purveyors which were identified with the four
                    colours, and with which those who organized the races had to contract for the
                    proper supply of horses and men. The drivers, who were mostly slaves, were
                    sometimes held in high repute for their skill. The horses most valued were those
                    of Sicily, Spain, and Cappadocia. Chariots with two horses <hi rend="italic"
                    >(bigoe)</hi> or four <hi rend="italic">(quadrigae)</hi> were most common, but
                    sometimes also they had three <hi rend="italic">(trigae)</hi> and exceptionally
                    more than four horses. Occasionally there was combined with the chariots a race
                    of riders <hi rend="italic">(desultores),</hi> each rider having two horses and
                    leaping from one to the other during the race. At certain of the races the
                    proceedings were opened by a <hi rend="italic">pompa</hi> or procession in which
                    images of the gods and of the imperial family deified were conveyed in cars
                    drawn by horses, mules, or elephants, attended by the colleges of priests, and
                    led by the presiding magistrate seated in a chariot in the dress and with the
                    insignia of a triumphator. The procession passed from the capitol along the
                    forum, and on to the circus, where it was received by the people standing and
                    clapping their hands. The presiding magistrate gave the signal for the races by
                    throwing a white flag <hi rend="italic">(mappa)</hi> on to the course. Next in
                    importance to the Circus Maximus in Rome was the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Circus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Flaminius,</hi> erected 221 B.C., in the
                    censorship of C. Flaminius, from whom it may have taken its name; or the name
                    may have been derived from Prata Flaminia, where it was situated, and where also
                    were held plebeian meetings. The only games that are positively known to have
                    been celebrated in this circus were the <hi rend="italic">Ludi Taurii</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Plebeii.</hi> There is no mention of it after the 1st century.
                    Its ruins were identified in the 16th century at S. Caterina de Funari and the
                    Palazzo Mattei. A third circus in Rome was erected by Caligula in the gardens of
                    Agrippina, and was known as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Circus</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Neronis,</hi> from the notoriety which it obtained through the
                    Circen sian pleasures of Nero. A fourth was constructed by Maxentius outside the
                    Porta Appia near the tomb of Caecilia Metella, where its ruins are still, and
                    now afford the only instance from which an idea of the ancient circi in Rome can
                    be obtained. It was traced to Caracalla, till the discovery of an inscription
                    showed it to be the work of Maxentius. Old topographers speak of six circi, but
                    two of these appear to be imaginary, the Circus Florae and the Circus Salustii.
                    There remain then the four described above,—C. Maximus, Flaminius, Neronis, and
                    Maxentii.</p>
                <p>Circus races were held in connection with the following public festivals, and
                    generally on the last day of the festival if it extended over more than one day
