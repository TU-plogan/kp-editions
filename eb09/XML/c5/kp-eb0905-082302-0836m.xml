                    were his first masters, and at the age of nine Clementi’s theoretical and
                    practical studies had advanced to such a degree that he was able to compete
                    successfully for the position of organist at a church. He continued his
                    contrapuntal studies <pb break="no"

                    mass which was performed in public and excited universal admiration. About this
                    time Beckford, the author of <hi rend="italic">Vathelc,</hi> persuaded Clementi
                    to follow him to England, where the young composer lived in retirement at one of
                    the country seats of his protector in Dorsetshire up to 1770. In that year he
                    first appeared in London, where his success both as a composer and pianist was
                    rapid and brilliant. In 1777 he was for some time employed as conductor of the
                    Italian opera, but he soon afterwards left London for Paris. Here also his
                    concerts were crowded by enthusiastic audiences, and the same success
                    accompanied Clementi on an artistic tour to Southern Germany and Austria which
                    he undertook about 1780. At Vienna he was received with high honour by the
                    Emperor Joseph IL, in whose presence he met Mozart, and sustained a kind of
                    musical duel with him. His technical skill proved to be equal if not superior to
                    that of his great rival, who on the other hand infinitely surpassed him by the
                    passionate beauty of his rendering. Such seems to have been the opinion of most
                    of the witnesses of this remarkable meeting, and it is confirmed to some extent
                    by the two musicians themselves. Apropos of the connection of these great men
                    the fact may be mentioned that one of the finest of Clementi’s sonatas, that in
                    B flat, shows an exactly identical opening theme with Mozart’s overture to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Flauto</hi><hi rend="italic">Magico,</hi> also that at the
                    concert given by the Philharmonic Society in commemoration of Clementi’s death,
                    the German composer’s <hi rend="italic">Recordare</hi> was the chief item of the
                    programme. Soon after his meeting with Mozart, Clementi returned to London,
                    where he continued for the next twelve years his lucrative occupations of
                    fashionable teacher and performer at the concerts of the aristocracy. He also
                    started a pianoforte manufacturing firm of his own, and the commercial
                    shrewdness characteristic of his nation greatly contributed to the lasting
                    success of the business. Amongst his pupils on the pianoforte during this period
                    may be mentioned John Field, the composer of the celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nocturnes.</hi> In his company Clementi paid, in 1804, a prolonged visit to the
                    large cities of the Continent, including Paris, Vienna, St Petersburg, and
                    Berlin. At the Prussian capital he made a prolonged stay, and there counted
                    Meyerbeer among his pupils. He also revisited his own country after an absence
                    of more than thirty years. In 1810 Clementi returned to London, but refused to
                    play again in public, devoting the remainder of his life to composition. Several
                    symphonies belong to this time, and were played with much success at
                    contemporary concerts, but none of them seem to have been published. His
                    intellectual and musical faculties remained unimpaired up to his death, which
                    took place at Evesham, Worcestershire, March 9, 1832. Clementi has been called
                    the “father of pianoforte playing,” and it cannot be denied that the modem style
                    of execution owes a great deal to his teaching and example. His <hi
                    rend="italic">technique</hi> is described as all but unequalled at his time, and
                    remarkable even according to our present advanced notions. Moscheles, a pianist
                    of a very different school, gives a vivid description of the effect produced by
                    Clementi’s playing. At a dinner given in his honour in 1828 the composer was
                    induced to play once more to a larger audience. “Smart, Cramer (another of
                    Clementi’s pupils), and I,” Moscheles writes in his diary, “conducted him to the
                    piano. Every one’s expectation is raised to the utmost pitch, for Clementi has
                    not been heard for years. He improvises on a theme of Handel and carries us all
                    away to the highest enthusiasm. His eyes shine with the fire of youth, those of
                    his hearers grow humid Clementi’s playing in his youth was marked by a most
                    beautiful <hi rend="italic">legato,</hi> a supple touch in lively passages, and
                    a most unfailing <hi rend="italic">technique.</hi> The remains of these
                    qualities could still be discovered and admired, but the most charming things
                    were the turns of his improvisation full of youthful genius.” Amongst his
                    compositions the most remarkable are 60 sonatas for pianoforte, and the great
                    collection of <hi rend="italic">Etudes</hi> called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gradus</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Parnassum.</hi> As a work
                    of instruction combining absolute artistic beauty with the highest usefulness
                    for the purposes of teaching and self-practice the <hi rend="italic">Gradus</hi>
                    remains unrivalled.</p>
