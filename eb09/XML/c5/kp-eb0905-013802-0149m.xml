                <p><label type="entry">CARRIER</label>, in its general acceptation, is a person who
                    conveys the goods of another for hire. In its mere colloquial use it was applied
                    to the class of men, now rendered comparatively obsolete by the railway system,
                    who conveyed goods in carts or waggons on the public roads. In jurisprudence,
                    however, the term is collectively applied to all conveyers of property, whether
                    by land or water; and in this sense the late changes and enlargements of the
                    system of transit throughout the world have given additional importance to the
                    subject. The law by which carriers, both by land and sea, are made responsible
                    for the goods intrusted to them, is founded on the praetorian edict of the civil
                    law, to which the ninth title of the fourth book of the Pandect is devoted. The
                    edict itself is contained in these few words, <hi rend="italic">“nautoe,</hi><hi

                    simplicity of the rule so announced has had a most beneficial influence on the
                    commerce of the world. Throughout the great civilized region which took its law
                    directly from the Roman fountain, and through the other less civilized countries
                    which followed the same commercial code, it laid a foundation for the principle
                    that the carrier’s engagement to the public is a contract of indemnity. It bound
                    him, in the general case, to deliver what he had been entrusted with, or its
                    value,— thus sweeping away all secondary questions or discussions as to the
                    conditions of more or less culpability on his part under which loss or damage
                    may have occurred; and it left any limitations of this general responsibility to
                    be separately adjusted by special contract.</p>
                <p>The law of England recognizes a distinction between a common and a private
                    carrier. The former is one who holds himself out to the public as ready to carry
                    for hire from place to place the goods of such persons as choose to employ him.
                    The owner of a stage coach, a railway company, the master of a general ship, a
                    wharfinger carrying goods on his own lighters are common carriers; and it makes
                    no difference that one of the <hi rend="italic">termini</hi> of the journey is
                    out of England. It has been held, however, that a person who carries only
                    passengers is not a common carrier; nor of course is a person who merely engages
                    to carry the goods of particular individuals. If a man undertakes to carry goods
                    safely, although he is not a common carrier, and is to have nothing for the
                    carriage, he is responsible for damage sustained by his negligence. A common
                    carrier is subject at law to peculiar liabilities. He is bound to carry the
                    goods of any person who offers to pay his hire, unless there is a good reason to
                    the contrary, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n150/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0150-0139"/> as, for example, when his carriage is full, or
                    the article is not such as he is in the habit of conveying. He ought to carry
                    the goods in the usual course without unnecessary deviation or delay. To make
                    him liable there must be a due delivery of the goods to him in the known course
                    of his business. His charge must be reasonable; and he must not give undue
                    preference to any customer or class of customers. The latter principle, as
                    enforced by statute, has come to be of great importance in the law of railway
                    companies. In respect of goods entrusted to him, the carrier’s liability, unless
                    limited by a special contract, is, as already stated, that of an insurer. There
                    is no question of negligence as in the case of injury to passengers, for the
                    warranty is simply to carry safely and securely. The law, however, excepts
                    losses or injuries occasioned immediately “by the act of God or the king’s
                    enemies ”—words which have long had a strict technical signification. It would
                    appear that concealmeant without fraud, on the part of the customer, will
                    relieve the carrier from his liability for <hi rend="italic">negligence,</hi>
                    but not for actual <hi rend="italic">misfeasance.</hi> Fraud or deceit by the
                    customer <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in misrepresenting the real value of the
                    goods) will relieve the carrier from his liability. The responsibility of the
                    carrier ceases only with the delivery of the goods to the proper consignee. By
                    the Carrier’s Act (11 Geo. IV. and 1 Will. IV. c. 68) the liability of carriers
                    for gold, silver, &lt;fcc. (in general “articles of great value in small compass
                    ”) is determined. Should the article or parcel exceed £10 in value, the carrier
                    is not to be liable for loss unless such value is declared by the customer, and
                    the carrier’s increased charge paid. Where the value is thus declared, the
                    carrier may, by public notice, demand an increased charge, for which he must, if
                    required, sign a receipt. Failing such receipt or notice, the carrier must
                    refund the increased charge and remain liable as at common law. Except as above
                    no mere notice or declaration shall affect a carrier’s liability; but he may
                    make special contracts with his customers. The carriage of goods by railway or
                    canal or by sea is subject to special regulations. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Railways</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Charter Party.)</hi> A carrier of
                    passengers is responsible for personal injuries only when they have been
                    occasioned by his negligence or want of skill. Where there has been contributory
                    negligence on the part of the plaintiff,—i.e., where he might, by the exercise
                    of ordinary care have avoided the consequences of the defendant’s negligence—he
                    is not entitled to recover. By 9 and 10 Vict. c. 93 (commonly called Lord
                    Campbell’s Act), when a person’s death has been caused by such negligence as
                    would have entitled him to an action had he survived, an action may now be
                    maintained against the party responsible for the negligence on behalf of the
                    wife, husband, parent, or child of the deceased. Previously such cases had been
                    governed by the maxim <hi rend="italic">actio personalis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >moritur</hi><hi rend="italic">cum persona.</hi></p>
