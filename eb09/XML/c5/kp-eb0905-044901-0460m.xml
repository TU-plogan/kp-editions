                    1340-1400). There are few fields of research in which antiquarians, from Speght
                    to Furnivall, have laboured so zealously and successfully as the life of
                    Chaucer. The secret of their success has been that Chaucer was more actively

                    consequently left many traces in official records. The chief biographical fact
                    known to Speght was that Chaucer gave evidence in a case tried at Westminster in
                    1386 touching the right of Lord Scrope to bear certain arms, and then deposed
                    that he was “forty years old and upward,” and had borne arms for twenty-seven
                    years. A casual fact of this sort offered no clue to further investigation; but
                    the fact that Chaucer received from Edward III. a pension of twenty marks was
                    more suggestive. This clue was first energetically followed up by Godwin, the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Caleb Williams</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Political
                    Justice,</hi> who searched diligently through several records, chiefly the
                    Patent, Close, and French Rolls, for other notices of Chaucer’s name, and
                    succeeded in enriching his biography of Chaucer, published in 1804, with various
                    important particulars. He was followed by Sir Harris Nicolas, who made an
                    exhaustive examination of the Issue Rolls of the Exchequer, and published the
                    results in 1843. Another determined search through records which Godwin and
                    Nicolas had shrunk from was made in 1873 by Mr Fumivall, and this also resulted
                    in several important finds.</p>
                <p>It is to Mr Furnivall that we are indebted for finally settling the parentage of
                    Chaucer. Speght in the course of his researches had hit upon the name of one
                    Richard Chaucer, a vintner, who died in 1348, and made a bequest to the church
                    of St Mary Aldermary. Merely on the ground of the name, Speght supposed this to
                    be the father of Chaucer; but Urry and Tyrwhitt, in the 18th century, disputed
                    this, and wished to give the poet a higher lineage, because in the grant of a
                    pension made to him in 41 Edward III. he was described as “valettus noster.” Mr
                    Furnivall settled the question by bringing to light a deed dated 1380, in which
                    Chaucer, relinquishing his right in a house belonging to his father, described
                    himself as “the son of John Chaucer, vintner.” By other documents this John
                    Chaucer is shown to be the son of Speght’s Richard. It is thus established that
                    both the poet’s father and his grandfather were London vintners. The precise
                    date of his birth has not been ascertained. The accepted date till lately was
                    1328 The difficulty with this date was his being described as. “forty years and
                    upwards” in 1386, and of late opinion has inclined to 1340 as a more probable
                    year. This is favoured by the discovery that the poet was Richard Chaucer’s
                    grandson and not his son, and fits in better with the facts than 1328.</p>
                <p>How Chaucer was educated, whether like “Philogenet,” the name which he assumes in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Court of Love,</hi> he was “of Cambridge clerk,” and how
                    he was introduced to the notice of the court, is left to conjecture. His name
                    occurs in the household book of the wife of Prince Lionel, second son of Edward
                    III., in 1357, probably, Mr Furnivall conjectures, as a page. He bore arms in
                    Edward III.’s invasion of France in 1359, John Chaucer being also in the
                    expedition, probably in connection with the commissariat. There was little
                    fighting in that expedition, the ravages of the English for several years before
                    having left little to fight for; but in the course of a disastrous retreat,
                    compelled rather by hunger than by martial force, Chaucer was taken prisoner. In
                    1360 the king paid £16 for his ransom. From 1360 to 1366 there is a gap in the
                    record of his life; but in the latter year his name occurs in a list of the
                    members of the royal household as one of thirtyseven “esquires” of the king, who
                    were to receive a gift of clothes at Christmas. By this time also he would seem
                    to have been married, if the Philippa Chaucer, one of the demoiselles of Queen
                    Philippa, who in 1366 was granted a yearly pension of ten marks, was, as is most
                    probable, his wife (see the discussion of the question in Sir H. Nicolas’s
                    memoir). In 1367 Chaucer himself received a pension of twenty marks from the
                    king, being described as “dilectus valettus noster.” To show that in being
                    courtier and scholar he had not ceased to be soldier, he took part in another
                    inglorious expedition against France in 1369, in <pb break="no"

                    French king there was little opportunity for distinction He was back in London
                    towards the end of 1370, and henceforward devoted himself to more peaceful
                    pursuits. His talents for diplomacy and his acquaintance with commerce were
                    recognized by the crown. In 1372 he was despatched to Genoa as a commissioner to
                    arrange a commercial treaty with the Genoese. About this embassy much has been
                    written on the supposition that he may have made the acquaintance of Petrarch in
                    the course of his visit to Italy. Whether in recognition of his services or on
                    other grounds, he received on his return, in 1374, the grant of a pitcher of
                    wine daily; and soon after, in further evidence of the royal favour, he was
                    appointed comptroller of the customs and subsidy of wools, skins, and tanned
                    hides in the port of London. In 1376 he was associated with Sir John Burley on
                    some secret service, the nature and place of which are not known, and in 1377 he
                    was sent on the secret mission to Flanders. And it was not merely in commercial
                    matters that the poet was considered serviceable; in 1378, after the accession
                    of Richard IL, he was attached to a mission sent into France to negotiate a
                    marriage for the young king His fortunes continued steadily to improve; with his
                    pension of twenty marks from the king, £10 from the duke of Lancaster, his
                    allowance for robes as one of the king’s esquires, his salary as comptroller,
                    his payments for occasional services, his pitcher of wine (commuted in 1378 into
                    an annuity of twenty marks), and his wife’s pension, he had no reason to
                    complain that his genius was neglected. The wonder was that his genius was not
                    smothered. His employment as comptroller was not a sinecure; he was bound to
                    write the rolls of his office with his own hand, and he had to be continually
                    present at his office, not having the option of appointing a deputy. Apparently
                    as he rose in the world he was allowed to make an easier arrangement; in 1382 he
                    was appointed comptroller of the petty customs of the port of London, with the
                    privilege of appointing a deputy, and in 1385 he was allowed to appoint a deputy
                    for the other comptrollership. In 1386 he touched the summit of his fortune,
                    being returned to Parliament as a knight of the shire of Kent. But that was an
                    unfortunate year for him; his patron, John of Gaunt, lost his ascendency at
                    court, and a commission which sat to inquire into the abuses of the preceding
                    administration superseded Chaucer in his two comptroller-ships. In the course of
                    two years he was obliged to transfer his annuities to another man, probably
                    selling them for a sum of ready money. The return of Lancaster to power in 1389
                    again brightened his prospects; he was appointed clerk of the king’s works, and
                    four years afterwards obtained a grant of an annnity of £20. How much he wanted
                    this assistance appears from the fact that he was several times obliged to apply
                    for small portions of it in advance. When Bolingbroke came to the throne in 1399
                    he gave the old poet an additional annuity of forty marks, which came in time to
                    comfort the last year of his life. The minutes of his pension cease in 1400,
                    and, according to the inscription on his tomb, he died on the 25th of October of
                    that year</p>
                <p>These are the main facts of Chaucer’s life as brought to light by successive
                    investigators, and they form a tolerably complete outline biography, more
                    complete than Spenser’s or Shakespeare’s. They are significant facts, throwing
                    light on the singularly varied circumstances, aptitudes, and occupations of the
                    man, supplementing in a really substantial way what may be gathered from his
                    works. They show that Chaucer was not merely a poet and a scholar, deeply read
                    in what then passed for science and philosophy, as well as in the rich
                    literature of his poetical predecessors, but a soldier, a courtier, a man of
                    business, familiar from the circumstances of his birth and subsequent rise in
                    position with all sides of the life of his time, ready to undertake any kind of
                    employment that his powerful patrons chose to obtain for him,—comptrollership of
                    customs, secretaryship of an embassy, diplomatic commissionership, guardianship
                    of a minor. Mr Furnivall has also discovered that, rather late in life, he was
                    charged with being concerned in the “raptus” (abduction, probably) of a girl,
                    which would show that he was willing to undertake more questionable services,
                    unless the “raptus” was for his own benefit. Great caution must be observed in
                    trying to fill up from hints in his poems the gaps in the documentary facts of
                    his biography,—great caution, that is, if we wish to get at the truth and not
                    merely to speculate for the sake of speculating. Antiquarian speculators are
                    usually more distinguished for fancy than imagination. They catch at hints and
                    push them to conclusions without having imagination enough to take account of
                    qualifying considerations. Thus it has often been taken for granted that in the
                    description of the poet of the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales,</hi> we have
                    an authentic portrait of Chaucer himself. The poet is a very quiet unobtrusive
                    man, and the Host, master of the ceremonies, suddenly casts his eye on him, and
                    addresses him in his bullying way :—</p>
                <p>What man art thou? quod he.</p>
                <p>Thou lookest as thou wouldst find an hare, For ever upon the ground I see thee
                    stare. Approachè near, and lookè merrily.</p>
                <p>Now ware you, sirs, and let this man have space.</p>
                <p>He in the waist is shapen as well as I; This were a puppet in an arm to embrace
                    For any woman, small, and fair of face. He seemeth elvish by his countenance,
                    For unto no wight doth he dalliance.</p>
                <p>There is no reason to suppose that this quaint, shy little figure was any more
                    like Chaucer than the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> was like Addison or
                    Steele. The allusion to his waist, coming from the burly host, is evidently
                    jocular, and the whole picture is in all likelihood a humorous description of
                    the opposite of Chaucer’s own appearance. We must be particularly careful in
                    accepting literally the statements of a writer one of whose favourite veins of
                    humour, appearing in every one of his works, is self-depreciation. We should
                    remember that Chaucer wrote for a limited audience, all of whom knew him
                    personally, and for whose amusement he was in the habit of making comical
                    allusions to himself. His jokes were more of the nature of family jokes than we
                    are now accustomed to in writings intended for wide and promiscuous circulation.
                    When he made the eagle in the <hi rend="italic">House of Fame</hi> complain of
                    his being heavy to carry, or promise to make him the butler of the gods, or
                    append to the statement that he lived like a hermit, the qualification
                    —“although thine abstinence is little,” or remind him that he had had no
                    personal experience of love, he knew that these little jests at his own expense
                    would be fully appreciated by his few readers. The extreme of frivolous
                    conjecture is reached when it is supposed that his wife was a termagant because
                    he “chaffs” women frequently. His graceful and chivalrous compliments to women
                    are quite as frequent as his chaff. There is, indeed, one passage in the <hi
                    rend="italic">House of Fame</hi> which is pretty clearly intended for his wife,
                    that where the eagle cries “awake” to him—</p>

                <p>But if it had been anything more serious than commonplace conjugal banter, he
                    would hardly have dared to circulate it. A conjecture of an equally frivolous
                    kind is that he was unmarried in 1369, because in that year he spoke of having
                    suffered for eight years pangs which none but one could heal. The pangs may have
                    been matrimonial pangs, or pangs of poverty, or purely imaginary pangs, <pb

                    Furnivall is so convinced that the poet’s sickness was a real lovesickness, and
                    that he was not then married to the queen’s demoiselle Philippa Chaucer, that he
                    accounts for this lady’s name by supposing her to have been Chaucer’s
                    cousin.</p>
                <p>A similar inelasticity of conjecture appears in the grounds on which certain of
                    the works commonly attributed to Chaucer are rejected as spurious. The <hi

                    Ladies,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Lamentation of Mary Magdalene</hi> bear
                    no internal marks of being Chaucer’s, and are now universally rejected j but of
                    late some commentators have adopted a test of genuineness which would deprive us
                    of several works which are in no respect unworthy of Chaucer’s genius. It is
                    known from Chaucer’s own statement in the undisputed <hi rend="italic">Legend of
                    Good Women</hi> that he translated the <hi rend="italic">Roman de la Rose,</hi>
                    but Mr Bradshaw refuses to believe that the extant translation, of which we have
                    only one 15th century manuscript, can be his, because its rhymes do not conform
                    to a rhyme-test which Chaucer observed in works which are undoubtedly his. The
                    extant <hi rend="italic">Romance of the Rose</hi> admits the adverbial <hi
                    rend="italic">ly</hi> to rhyme with the adjectival or infinitival <hi
                    rend="italic">ye,</hi> and it cannot be Chaucer’s because <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> is never allowed to rhyme with <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">House of Fame</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury
                    Tales.</hi> For the same reason—no other of any shadow of validity has yet been
                    adduced—the <hi rend="italic">Court of Love,</hi> which Mr Swinburne calls “that
                    most beautiful of young poems,” and the <hi rend="italic">Flower and the
                    Leaf,</hi> which Dryden and Hazlitt have praised and quoted as a choice example
                    of the poet’s genius, have also been pronounced to be spurious. We cannot give
                    up such poems unless more urgent reasons are advanced for their confiscation.
                    They cannot be set aside as spurious so long as their variation from the rhyming
                    rule, which the commentators have shown much ingenuity in detecting, can be
                    explained in any reasonable way. There is no getting over the plain question
                    which every one asks when first told that they are not Chaucer’s. If they are
                    not his, who else could have written them? Is it conceivable that the name of
                    the writer of such works could have been utterly unknown in his own generation,
                    or if known could have been by accident or design so completely suppressed? If
                    he deliberately tried to palm them off as Chaucer’s upon the transcribers, would
                    not this rule of rhyme have been precisely the sort of mechanical likeness which
                    he would have tried to preserve l The <hi rend="italic">Court of Love</hi> we
                    have special reasons for declining to give up. It might be argued that, though
                    the <hi rend="italic">Flower and the Leaf</hi> bears internal marks of being
                    Chaucer’s, although its picturesque richness, its tender atmosphere, and the
                    soft fall of its words are like his, yet it is easy to grow the plant once you
                    have the seed, and it may be the work of an imitator. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flower and the Leaf</hi> professes to be written by a lady, and there may have
                    been at the court some wonderful lady capable of it, although it passed in the
                    monkish scriptorium as Chaucer’s. But there is some external evidence for the
                    authenticity of the <hi rend="italic">Court of Love,</hi> which also contains
                    traces of Chaucer’s most inimitable quality, his humour. Mr Minto has put
                    forward some minor considerations for believing this to be Chaucer’s <hi
                    rend="italic">(Characteristics of English Poets,</hi> p. 22), but the strongest
                    fact in its favour is that the <hi rend="italic">Court of Love</hi> was imitated
                    by James I. of Scotland in the <hi rend="italic">King's Quhair,</hi> and that in

                    but Lydgate and Gower, who were clearly incapable of writing the poem, and
                    Chaucer. James’s captivity in England began five years after Chaucer’s death,
                    and it is simply inconceivable that he could have attributed the <hi
                    rend="italic">Court of Love</hi> to Chaucer in ignorance, and without having
                    heard a whisper of its real authorship. If, indeed, this rhyme-test were
                    absolute, we should have to treat these other considerations as inexplicable
                    difficulties and submit. But when we remark that all the poems in which <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">ye</hi> rhymes occur are earlier works of
                    Chaucer’s, if they are his at all, bearing the touch of his hand but wanting the
                    sustained strength of his mature workmanship, and when we remember that the <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">ye</hi> rhyme was the common practice of
                    his predecessors, a very simple explanation of the rhyme difficulty becomes
                    apparent. Chaucer adhered to the practice of his predecessors till he felt
                    strong enough to impose upon himself a restriction of his own devising.</p>
                <p>At what periods of his life Chaucer wrote his poetry, we have no means of
                    ascertaining. There are no manuscripts of any of his works that can be referred
                    to his own time; the earliest of them in existence are not supposed to have been
                    written till several years after his death. The only one of his works of which
                    the date is fixed by an external circumstance is the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    the Duchess;</hi> if, as is taken for granted, this was written to commemorate
                    the death of the wife of his patron John of Gaunt, its date is 1369. Chaucer, if
                    born in 134O, would then have been twenty-nine, and there is none of his extant
                    works, except the translation of the <hi rend="italic">Romance of the Rose,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Dream</hi> (which we hold to be Chaucer’s, though its
                    authenticity is not worth contending for), which can be confidently assigned to
                    an earlier period. Philogenet, in the <hi rend="italic">Court of Love,</hi>
                    professes to be eighteen, but this is not the slightest reason for concluding
                    that Chaucer was that age when he wrote it. The <hi rend="italic">Book of the
                    Duchess</hi> is certainly not very mature work for a poet of twenty-nine, and it
                    is probable that Chaucer did not cultivate the art, as he certainly did net
                    develop the faculty, till comparatively late in life. The translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Romance of the Rose</hi> is to all appearance the earliest of his
                    surviving compositions. If we may judge from his evident acquaintance with dry
                    studies, and his capacity for hard business work, the vintner’s son received a
                    scholastic training in the <hi rend="italic">trivium</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >quadrivium</hi> which then formed the higher education. If he had been nurtured
                    on troubadour love from his youth up, it is exceedingly unlikely that he would
                    afterwards have been able to apply himself to less fascinating labours. His
                    study of mathematics and astronomy in his old age for the benefit of “little
                    Lewis, his son,” looks like a return such as we often see in age to the studies
                    of youth. But, indeed, he can hardly be said ever to have lost his interest in
                    such studies, for in his theory of sound in the <hi rend="italic">House of
                    Fame</hi> and his description of alchemical processes in the Canon’s Yeoman’s
                    Prologue he shows a genuine scholar’s interest in the dry details of learning.
                    His knowledge of the Trouvère and Troubadour poetry, from which his genius
                    received its impulse, probably began with his introduction, however that was
                    brought about, to court society. He was about seventeen at the date of the first
                    mention of his name as attached to the household of Prince Lionel. It is
                    permissible to conjecture that he had French poets to beguile his captivity in
                    France a few years afterwards.</p>
                <p>Professor Ten Brink divides Chaucer’s work into three periods :—a period of
                    French influence, lasting up to 1372-3, the date of his visit to Italy; after
                    that a period of Italian influence, lasting up to 1387, the supposed date of his
                    <hi rend="italic">House of Fame</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> finally, a period
                    of mature strength and originality, in which he pursued the bent of his own
                    genius. Not much is gained by this division into strict periods. It is obvious
                    enough that, in the <hi rend="italic">House of Fame,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Legend of Good Women,</hi> and the general plan of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canterbury Tales,</hi> Chaucer strikes out more unmistakably a path for
                    himself, and exhibits a maturer power, a more masterly freedom of movement than
                    in his earlier works, but there profitable division ends. To erect a period of
                    Italian influence, implying that at any time the stimulus <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n463/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0463-0452"/> that Chaucer received from Italian sources was at
                    all comparable to the stimulus he received from French sources, is most
                    misleading. The difference between the <hi rend="italic">Book of the
                    Duchess</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">House of Fame,</hi> or between the <hi
                    rend="italic">Court of Love</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Troilus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">and Cresside</hi> is not to be explained by an influx of Italian
                    influence; it is part of the self-governed development, the spontaneous
                    expansion of his own mind. As he went on writing, his powers continued to
                    expand, and to take in materials and suggestions from all quarters open to him,
                    French, Italian, or Latin. Comparing the <hi rend="italic">Troilus,</hi> the raw
                    material of which is taken from Boccaccio's <hi rend="italic">Filostrato,</hi>
                    with his <hi rend="italic">Romance of the Rose,</hi> we can trace no change in
                    method or in spirit fairly attributable to Italian influence. In
                    both-translations he shows a bold independence of his originals; they are not so
                    much translations as adaptations. He does not imbibe the spirit of Guillaume de
                    Lorris or Jean de Meun in the one and the spirit of Boccaccio in the other; he
                    boldly modifies all three to bring them into harmony with his own conceptions of
                    love’s laws, and in both his so-called translations there is the same high
                    spirit of chivalry and the same tender worship and kindly mockery of woman.
                    Where he chiefly shows advance of strength, apart from the mere technical
                    workmanship, is in his grasp of character; and that is a clear development on
                    the lines of his earlier conceptions and not a new acquisition. His Cresside and
                    his Pandarus were not the Cresside and Pandarus of Boccaccio; they are
                    regenerated by him and developed till they become figures that might have moved
                    in his own <hi rend="italic">Court of Love.</hi> He held the knightly and
                    “gentle” character too high to adopt Boccaccio’s conceptions. In the method
                    also, <hi rend="italic">Troilus</hi> has a close affinity with Chaucer’s earlier
                    work and his first models. Troilus’ pursuit of Cresside is the pursuit of the
                    Rose over again in the concrete. The greater subtilty of the stages is due to
                    the increased strength of the narrator’s faculty.</p>
                <p>Μ. Sandras is in the main right as to the extent of Chaucer’s obligations to
                    French sources, although he fails to recognize the forceful individuality of the
                    man. Chaucer was really an English <hi rend="italic">trouvère,</hi> thoroughly
                    national, English in the whole texture of his being, but a <hi rend="italic"
                    >trouvère.</hi> We must not allow oùr conviction of his loyalty to his own
                    English nature to blind us to the fact that he was a poet in the school of
                    Guillaume de Lorris; nor on the· other hand must we allow the peculiar extent of
                    his obligations to his predecessors in the school to obscure the fact that he
                    was an original poet. Μ. Sandras is a special pleader for one side of the case,
                    and naturally presses unfairly against the other. Chaucer, writing in a
                    different language from his masters, was at liberty to borrow from them more
                    literally than he could have done if he had written in their language; but
                    though Μ. Sandras proves with superfluous completeness that he freely
                    appropriated from them not merely stories and hints of stories, but narrative
                    methods, phrases, images, maxims, reflections,—. not only treated their works as
                    quarries of raw material, but adopted their architectural plans, and even made
                    no scruple of seizing for his own purposes the stones which they had polished,
                    still he so transmuted the borrowed plans and materials that his works are
                    original wholes unmistakably stamped with his own individuality. Whatever he
                    appropriated, whether ore or wrought metal, all passed through his own alembic,
                    and his moulds were his own, though shaped according to the fashion of the
                    school. The very affluence of Chaucer’s pages, their wealth of colour, of tender
                    and humorous incident, of worldly wisdom, is due to his peculiar relations to
                    his predecessors, to the circumstance which enabled him to lay them so royally
                    under tribute. He was not the architect of his own fortune, but the son and heir
                    of a family which for generations had been accumulating wealth. Edward III.’s
                    spoliation of the French was nothing to Chaucer’s, and the poet had this
                    advantage, that his appropriations neither left the spoiled country desolate nor
                    corrupted the spoiler.</p>
                <p>“The ground-work of literary genius,” Mr Matthew Arnold says, “is a work of
                    synthesis and exposition, not of analysis and discovery; its gift lies in the
                    faculty of being happily inspired by a certain intellectual and spiritual
                    àtmosphere, by a certain order of ideas, when it finds itself in them, of
                    dealing divinely with these ideas, presenting them in the most effective and
                    attractive combinations— making beautiful works with them, in short.” The poet’s
                    constructive power must have materials, and ideas round which materials
                    accumulate. The secret of the richness and enduring character of Chaucer’s work
                    is that he had a fruitful idea ready to his hand, an idea which had been
                    flowering and bearing fruit in the minds of two centuries, which had inspired
                    some later songs and tales, which had been illustrated, expounded, formulated by
                    every variety of native invention and critical ingenuity. Chivalrous love had
                    been the presiding genius, the inspiring spirit of several generations of poets
                    and critics when Chaucer began to write. Open any of his works, from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Court of Love</hi> down to the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury
                    Tales,</hi> and you find that the central idea of it is to expound this
                    chivalrous sentiment, either directly by tracing its operation or formulating
                    its laws, or indirectly by setting it off <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    dramatically against its counterpart, the sentiment of the villain or churl.
                    Gradually as years grew upon him, and his mind assumed more and more its natural
                    attitude of descriptive impartiality, he became less a partizan of the
                    sentiment, more inclined to view it as one among the varieties of human
                    manifestation, but never to the last does he become wholly impartiaL Not even in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi> does he set the churl on a level
                    with “the gentles.” Thoroughly as he enjoyed the humour of the churl, freely as
                    his mind unbent itself to sympathize with his unrestrained animal delights, he
                    always remembers, when he comes forward in his own person, to apologize for this
                    departure from the restraints of chivalry.</p>
                <p>The very opposite of this is so often asserted about the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canterbury Tales</hi> that it almost has a paradoxical air, although nothing
                    can be more plain to any one who takes the trouble to read the tales
                    observantly. It has been said to be the crowning merit of Chaucer that he
                    ignores distinctions of caste, and that his pilgrims associate on equal terms.
                    It should be noticed, however, in the first place, that in the Prologue, he
                    finds it necessary to apologize for not “setting folk in their degree,” “as that
                    they shouldè stand;” and, in the second place, that although he does not
                    separate the pilgrims according to their degrees in the procession, yet he draws
                    a very clear line of separation between them in the spirit of their behaviour.
                    At the outset of the pilgrimage the gentles are distinctly so mentioned as
                    taking a sort of corporate action, though in vain, to give a more decorous
                    aspect to the pilgrimage. When the Knight tells his tale, it is loudly applauded
                    by the wht&gt;le company, but the poet does not record their verdict
                    indiscriminately; he is careful to add, particularly by “the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gentles</hi> every one.” And though all applauded the tale, the more vulgar and
                    uproarious spirits were somewhat restive under its gravity, the host called for
                    a merry tale, and the Pardoner eagerly stepped forward to comply with his
                    request. But “the gentles” interposed, and began to cry that they must have no
                    ribaldry; “tell us,” they said, “some moral tale that we may learn.” And the
                    gentles would have carried their point if the Miller, as the poet is most
                    careful to make clear, had not been so drunk that he insisted upon telling a
                    noble tale that he knew, and would forbear for no man. Chaucer is profuse in his
                    apologies for introducing such a tale; it was a churlish <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n464/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0464-0453"/> laie, he admits, told in a churlish manner, and
                    he does not wish to be responsible for it.</p>
                <p>“Every gentle wight I pray For Goddès love, deemeth not that I say Of evil
                    intent; but for I must rehearse Their tales all, be they better or worse, Or
                    ellès falsen some of my matter”</p>
                <p>If gentle readers do not like it, they may turn over the leaf, and choose another
                    tale; there is plenty “of storial thing that toucheth gentillesse.” They must
                    not blame him for repeating this churlish tale; “the Miller is a churl, ye know
                    well this,” and such tales are in his way. Gentle readers must not take it too
                    seriously; “men should not make earnest of game;” it is, after all, only for
                    their amusement that he thus exhibits to them the humours of the lower
                    orders.</p>
                <p>Such is the elaborate apology that Chaucer makes for introducing into his verse
                    anything inconsistent with the sentiments of chivalry. It may be said that it is
                    all a humorous pretence; and so no doubt it is, still it is characteristic that
                    the pretence should be of so courtly a tone. All through the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canterbury Tales</hi> Chaucer is very careful to remember that he was writing
                    for a courtly audience, studious to guard against giving offence to the
                    chivalrous mind. He contrives that the gentles shall mix with the churls without
                    sustaining any loss of dignity; they give the churls their company, and with
                    polite compliance let them have their own gross will, but they never lay aside
                    the restraints of their own order. Every here and there is some trace of
                    deference to them, to show that their ribald companions have not wholly
                    forgotten themselves, and are only receiving a saturnalian licence for the time.
                    Nothing is done to throw any disrespect on the gentle order; its members—the
                    Knight, the Squire, the Monk, the Prioress, the Second Nun; and the professional
                    men—the Lawyer, the Doctor, the Clerk—admit no ribaldry into their tales, and no
                    ribald tales are told about them. The ribaldry is confined to the meaner members
                    of the company, —the Reeve, the Miller, the Friar, the Summoner, the Wife of
                    Bath; the narrators as well as the subjects of the ribald tales are of churlish
                    and not of gentle position.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi> are really in their underlying design
                    an exposition of chivalrous sentiment, thrown into relief by contrast with its
                    opposite. The spirit of chivalry is the vital air of all Chaucer’s creations,
                    the rain, the wind, and the sun which have quickened their germ and fostered
                    their growth. We to whom the chivalrous spirit, at least in the fantastic
                    developments of its vigorous mediaeval youth, is an historical thing are apt to
                    overlook this. There is so much on the surface of Chaucer’s poems, such vivacity
                    of movement, such tender play of feeling, such humour, such delight in nature,
                    in green leaves and sweet air, sunshine and bird singing, that few of us care to
                    look beneath. The open air, on the breezy hillside or by the murmuring brook,
                    seems the only proper atmosphere for such a poet. There, no doubt, with sun and
                    wind contending playfully to divert us from the printed pages, there perhaps
                    more than anywhere else, Chaucer is a delightful companion; but it is the duty
                    of the dry-as-dust critic to remind us that Chaucer’s sweet verses were first
                    read under wholly different conditions, in tapestried chambers, to the gracious
                    ear of embroidered lords and ladies. It was from such an audience that Chaucer
                    received in a vapour what he poured back in a flood. This is the secret of his
                    exquisite courtliness of phrase, his unfailing tone of graceful deference, his
                    protestations of ignorance and lack of cunning, his tender handling of woeful
                    love-cases, the gentle playfulness of his satire, the apologetic skill with
                    which he introduces a broader and more robust humanity into his verse. If you
                    place yourself within the circle for which the poet wrote, you see the smile
                    play on sweet lips as he proceeds; you see the tear gather in the eye; you see
                    the needle laid aside, as the mind of the fair listener is transported to the
                    poet’s flowery mead, or plied more briskly as she bends over her work to conceal
                    her laughter at his more vulgar adventures. It was because Chaucer wrote for
                    such an audience that his picture of the life of the time, various and moving as
                    it is, is so incomplete on one side.</p>
                <p>There was more than romancing in green fields and Canterbury pilgriming in the
                    travelled times in which Chaucer lived; there were wars, plagues, insurrections,
                    much misery and discontent. But for the disagreeable side of the 14th century we
                    must go to the writer of Piers the Plowman; we find little trace of it in
                    Chaucer. The outside of the walls of the Garden of Mirth is painted with
                    horrible and squalid figures,—Ire, Envy, Covetice, Avarice, Felony, Villany,
                    Sorrow, Eld, and Poverty; but no such figures are admitted within the gates; the
                    concierge is Idleness; the chief inmates are Love, Sweetlooking, Beauty,
                    Richesse, Largesse, Franchise, and Courtesy; and Mirth and Gladness are the
                    master and mistress of the ceremonies.</p>
                <p>All Chaucer’s works are steeped in the nectar of the court; the perfume of
                    chivalrous sentiment breathes from them all. It is impossible, as we have said,
                    to determine strictly the order of their composition, though it is very easy to
                    distinguish his earlier from his later work. There is a passage in the Prologue
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Legend of Good Women</hi> which settles the position of
                    that poem. The poet there pretends to have an interview with the king and queen
                    of love, as he is out on a May morning to worship the daisy. The king challenges
                    his worthiness to do homage to this his own flower, and upbraids him with having
                    translated the <hi rend="italic">Romance of the Rose,</hi> which (in its second
                    part at least) is a heresy against love’s law, and also with having told the
                    story of Cresside, and thrown discredit on women. But the queen of love,
                    Alcestis, speaks up for the poet, perhaps, she pleads, he was ordered to do
                    these translations and durst not refuse; and he had done good service by
                    extending the praise of love among the unlearned folk, for—</p>
                <p>“He made the hook that hight the house of Fame, And eke the death of Blanchè the
                    Duchess, And the Parliament of Fowlès as I guess, And all the love of Palamon
                    and Arcite, Of Thebes, though the story is knowen lite; And many a hymnè for
                    your holy days That highten Ballads, Roundels, Virelays.”</p>
                <p>The translation of the <hi rend="italic">Romance of the Rose</hi> was probably
                    thefirst of these works. It may have been written soon after or during his
                    captivity in France, when he was a youth of twenty, but there is no appreciable
                    difference of style between it and the <hi rend="italic">Book of the
                    Duchess,</hi> which if it commemorates, as there is every reason to believe, the
                    death of the first wife of John of Gaunt, must have been written after 1369,
                    when Chaucer was twenty-nine. The idea of writing in the vulgar tongue may have
                    been suggested to him by the example-of Dante. The <hi rend="italic">House of
                    Fame</hi> is probably later than the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Duchess.</hi>
                    The <hi rend="italic">Court of Love</hi> is not mentioned by name in the above
                    list, but it may be referred to in the following fines of the prologue :—</p>
                <p>“Hast thou not in a book lyeth in thy chest The greatè goodness of the Queen
                    Alceste That turned was into a dayèseye ' <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi>.”</p>
                <p>Alcestis is, under Venus, the lady and queen of the Court of Love. It is easy to
                    conceive why Chaucer should have kept the <hi rend="italic">Court of Love</hi>
                    in his chest. The tide of Puritanic religious sentiment which was destined to
                    sweep into temporary oblivion the airy structures of the chivalric imagination
                    had already in the middle of Chaucer’s life begun to rise. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Court of Love</hi> he fully accepted the troubadour notion of love
                    and marriage, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n465/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0465-0454"/> making the husband the natural enemy of the
                    lover; and he may have had to accommodate himself to the taste of the Fair Maid
                    of Kent, the widow of the Black Prince, the Alcestis of the time, and put his
                    poem out of sight, only pleading that even in it he had paid homage to “the
                    greatè goodness of the Queen Alceste.”</p>
                <p>There is no good edition of Chaucer, not even a good text. The only text or
                    rather collection of texts that the Chaucerian scholar would think of using is
                    the valuable parallel six-text edition, published by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chaucer Society.</hi> For the general reader one text is about as good as
                    another; there is little to choose between Tyrwhitt’s, Bell’s, and Dr Morris’s
                    text in the Aldine edition. (W. Μ.)</p>
