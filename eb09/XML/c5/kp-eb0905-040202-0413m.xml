                    dying in 771, Charlemagne was proclaimed sole ruler. The monarchy he thus
                    inherited was a very extensive one; for, in addition to the Frankish territory,
                    stretching from the Loire to the east of the Rhine, there were Burgundy and
                    Allemania, which had been incorporated by his ancestors, while almost all round
                    the direct empire of the Franks stretched a group of vassal nations. Aquitaine,
                    Brittany, Frisia, Thuringia, and Bavaria were in more or less close subjection
                    to them. They were, moreover, the protectors of the popes against the Greeks and
                    Lombards, and the champions of Christianity against the Saracens on the
                    south-west and the heathen Saxons of the north-east. In fact, before the
                    accession of Charlemagne the Franks had attained to a real supremacy over most
                    of the Germanic nations, and were the bulwark of the Christianity of the West.
                    This many-sided and lofty position imposed a corresponding complexity of duty on
                    the new king, which he fulfilled with an energy and success almost unexampled in
                    the history of the world, maintaining and extending on all hands the influence
                    of Christian culture, and taking the first steps towards converting the military
                    monarchy of the Franks into an organized polity. His first task was to suppress
                    a rising in Aquitaine. In 772 commenced the great mission of his life, the
                    conquest and conversion of the Saxons, a work which could be effected only after
                    thirty-two years of the fiercest and most passionate warfare. With the doubtful
                    exception of the Frisians, the Saxons were the last remnant of the old Germanic
                    resistance to the military supremacy of the Franks, and the last Germanic
                    champions of the religion of Odin against the onward progress of Christianity.
                    Charlemagne never had much difficulty in vanquishing the badly-organized Saxon
                    forces, and in compelling a temporary or partial submission; but with a loose
                    confederation like the Saxons, which had no definite organization and no
                    properly recognized representative, it was difficult to make a fixed and
                    universally accepted arrangement. Hence the incessant renewal of an apparently
                    decided conflict, and the outcry of the Franks against the treachery of their
                    enemies. The encroachments of the Saxons on his eastern frontier was the
                    occasion of his first expedition, which was directed into the ancient forest of
                    Teutoburg, famous as the scene of the old Germanic resistance to the Romans.
                    Here he stormed the fortress of Ehresburg, overthrew the Irminsul, a mysterious
                    column-shaped idol much revered among the Saxons, destroyed the sanctuary of
                    Odin, and compelled the Westphalian Saxons to submit. Events in Italy now
                    summoned Charlemagne to the other side of the Alps, in order to chastise the
                    Lombards who were invading the possessions of the Pope. The Frankish king was
                    victorious, dethroned Desiderius the Lombard king, and placed the Lombard crown
                    on his own head (774). Meanwhile, the Saxons had profited by his absence to
                    expel the Frankish garrisons, and even to renew their old ravages. Charlemagne
                    immediately set out against them, and in two campaigns enforced the submission
                    of the entire Saxon confederation. In a great Champ-de-Mai at Paderborn the
                    Frankish king, surrounded by his chiefs and by ambassadors from distant nations,
                    received the homage of the Saxon warriors, many thousands of whom submitted to
                    be baptized (777). The Saxons apparently <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n414/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0414-0403"/> subdued, Charles crossed the Pyrenees, and
                    received the submission of the country as far as the Ebro. On his return,
                    however, the rear-guard was assailed and cut off by the mountaineers in the pass
                    of Roncesvalles; Roland their leader was slain, and the overthrow of the Franks,
                    transformed and wrought up in every possible way, became one of the great themes
                    of song and romance (778). His march home from Spain had been unseasonably
                    hastened by a general revolt of the Saxons, this time assisted by the Danes.
                    Charles was again easily victorious, but no sooner had he left the country than
                    the Saxons, mad with revenge, and animated by the fiercest national and
                    religious hate, resumed the struggle. Even the massacre of Verden (782), in
                    which 4500 Saxon prisoners were slain in cold blood, served only to intensify
                    the spirit of resistance; but their rude courage was no match for the large and
                    well-disciplined armies of the Frankish king. They were again completely
                    defeated; even Wittikind, the hero of the whole war, was compelled to confess
                    the superiority of the God of Charlemagne, and at Attigny received the rite of
                    baptism (785). His example was generally followed; and the Frankish
                    organization, political and ecclesiastical, was systematically introduced.
                    Germany had become Christian; it was now the Northmen, among whom thousands of
                    Saxons had found refuge, that took up the task of supporting a gradually
                    declining cause. But though this may be looked upon as the deciding act in the
                    drama of old Germanic resistance, there were still many bloody and almost
                    general revolts of the Saxons. To punish these Charles adopted even a more
                    effective method than the planting of Frankish garrisons; thousands of Saxon
                    families were deported into other provinces of the empire, and more loyal
                    subjects introduced to fill the vacant space. It was not till 804 that the last
                    sparks of resistance were quenched.</p>
                <p>In the year 788, Bavaria was incorporated with the Frankish empire. Its duke,
                    Thassilo, had more than once incurred the displeasure of Charles by too
                    pronounced measures towards the recovery of his independence, and had even
                    alienated his subjects by schemes of alliance with the heathen Avars and the
                    heretic Greeks. Consequently Charles bad no difficulty in dethroning him. This
                    was followed in 791 by a vast and well-organized expedition against the Avars, a
                    savage robber nation of Mongols inhabiting the modem Hungary. The Franks were
                    again victorious everywhere; but other work of a more pressing kind prevented
                    Charles from completing their reduction, which was afterwards effected chiefly
                    by his lieutenants. Their immense circular encampments, or rings, from which
                    they had issued to carry havoc into all the surrounding countries, were forced,
                    and their treasures became the spoil of the Christian armies (798). They
                    submitted; and German colonists were introduced into many of those regions. In
                    this way Pannonia was added to the empire of Charles. Other campaigns carried on
                    at various times by Charlemagne or his lieutenants, on the Elbe and even in
                    Bohemia, against the Danes, the Wends, and the Czechs, still further increased
                    the prestige of the Frankish armies, and enlarged the empire of their great
                    monarch against Slavish and Scandinavian heathendom, while his troops maintained
                    the Spanish march against his south-western enemies, Moslem and Christian, and
                    the duke of Bene ventum in Southern Italy was obliged to become his vassal. Thus
                    from the Eider to Sicily, and from the Ebro to the Theiss, the will of Charles
                    was supreme; while over the Slavonic tribes, as far as the Oder or even the
                    Vistula, his influence was felt in no feeble way. The genius and energy of one
                    man had succeeded in arresting the progress of political disintegration, and, in
                    the interest of culture and constructive order, in welding into one great
                    monarchy all the races of continental Germany. It was no wonder that men who
                    associated the ideas of imperial order and constructive civilization with the
                    name of Rome should have recognized in the monarchy of Charles the restoration
                    of the power of the Caesars. When, therefore, at Rome, on Christmas eve of the
                    year 800, he was crowned emperor of the Romans, it seemed the natural
                    consummation of hia whole career. And when in 801 an embassy arrived with
                    curious presents from Harun-al-Rashid, the great caliph who held in the East the
                    same plaβe as Charles in the West, men recognized it as a becoming testimony to
                    the world-wide reputation of the Frankish emperor.</p>
                <p>Charles was far more than an ordinary conqueror. Ht displayed not less energy in
                    the internal organization and administration of his kingdom than in foreign
                    affairs. The whole empire was divided into districts, presided over by counts,
                    who were responsible for their good government; while in the exposed frontiers
                    or marches, other counts <hi rend="italic">(Markgrafen)</hi> were stationed with
                    forces capable of defending them. In order to superintend these provincial
                    authorities, to give effect to the royal will, to preserve the due subordination
                    of the outlying portions of the empire to the central power, and in this way to
                    complete and secure the organization of the empire, the <hi rend="italic">missi
                    dominici,</hi> experienced men both of the laity and clergy, were despatched in
                    all directions. Two great assemblies were held every year,—the Champ de-Mai,
                    which was a kind of national muster, essentially military, and another in
                    autumn, of the high officials, of a deliberative and advisory nature. In the
                    capitularies (edicts issued as the necessities of the empire required), in his
                    endeavours to promote education, in his organization of the church and the
                    definitive institution of tithes, in the unsuccessful attempt to join the Danube
                    and the Rhine by a canal, he gave proof of the noblest desire to conserve and
                    propagate the culture of former times. Learned men—Eginhard, Paul Warnefried,
                    and, above all, Alcuin—were his intimate friends «and teachers; Guizot calls
                    Alcuin his intellectual prime minister.</p>
                <p>Charlemagne died on 28th January 814, at Aix-la-Chapelle, and was buried there.
                    The empire created and organized by his genius gradually fell to pieces after
                    his death. His endeavour to resuscitate an old civilization, to engraft the
                    Christian Roman culture on the vigorous stem of the Teutonic races, and to unite
                    all the Germanic tribes ifi one empire, before the long action of historic
                    influences had stamped upon them a distinct national character—this was to a
                    great extent a failure, because one life-time was too short for its
                    accomplishment. His greatness lies ifl the nobility of his aim, in the energy
                    and wisdom with which he carried it out during his life, and also in the
                    enduring traces of valuable work which remained notwithstanding the genera!
                    wreck of his empire; for, though the central organization was swept away, the
                    provincial authorities remained, to be transformed into the new feudal
                    organization of Western Europe, whilst the idea of the revival of the Christian
                    Roman Empire was to be taken up by other sections of the Germanic race. Though
                    the circumstances of his time prevented him from being the founder of a new
                    epoch in history, like Caesar or Alexander, yet, in the greatness of his
                    character, in his marvellous many-sided activity, and In the magic influence of
                    his name on subsequent generations, he was equal to either.</p>
