                    navigator, was born, at St Malo, in Brittany, in 1494. According to the custom
                    of the place, even his early youth was passed upon the sea; and he was probably
                    already acquainted with the coast of Newfoundland when he was appointed by
                    Francis I. to the command of the two ships, which, on the 20th of April 1534,
                    set sail from St Malo, for the purpose of exploring the district beyond the
                    fishing grounds. Cartier first touchèd at Cape Buonavista, on the east coast of
                    Newfoundland, then passed northward along the coast, and, sailing south-west
                    through the Straits of Belle Isle, discovered the mainland of Canada, which he
                    claimed for France, by erecting a wooden cross with the inscription “Vive le Roy
                    de France.” Next year a second expedition was placed under his control to
                    explore the estuary of the St Lawrence. He penetrated as far as Hochelaga, a
                    large fortified village at the foot of a hill, to which he gave the name of Mont
                    Royal, and which is the site of the modern Montreal. But he did nothing more,
                    and returned on the 16th May 1536, disgusted with the climate and with his crew
                    weakened by scurvy, a disease then unknown in Europe. The idea of colonizing
                    Canada was abandoned after this, till in 1540 Jean Francis de la Roche, Seigneur
                    de Roberval, obtained permission to form a settlement. The project was carried
                    out partly at RobervaΓs and partly at the king’s expense; Cartier was sent out
                    in command of five ships, in the spring of 1541; and in the autumn he arrived at
                    the mouth of the St Lawrence. Near the present situation of Quebec he built a
                    fort named Charlesbourg. But the Indians, whose king he had carried off with him
                    on his last voyage, annoyed him so much with their attacks that he determined to
                    return to France; and though Roberval arrived at Newfoundland in June 1542, with
                    three ships and a colony of 200 men and women, and commanded him to turn back,
                    he continued his homeward voyage. Whether this was his last expedition is
                    disputed. Some say that he returned to the assistance of Roberval, in the autumn
                    of 1543; but if this be so, we know nothing more. The rest of his life was spent
                    in his native town or at the village of Limoilon, of which he was created
                    seigneur by his patron Francis I. He was alive in 1552; but the date of his
                    death is not known.</p>
