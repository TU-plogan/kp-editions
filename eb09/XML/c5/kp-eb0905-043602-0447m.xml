                    de</hi></label> (1768-1848), the most brilliant representative of the reaction
                    against the ideas of the French Revolution, and the most conspicuous figure in
                    French literature during the First Empire, was born at St Malo, September 4,
                    1768. Here, as beautifully narrated by himself, his naturally poetical
                    temperament was fostered by picturesque influences, the mysterious reserve of
                    his morose father, the ardent piety of his mother, the traditions of his ancient
                    family, the legends and antiquated customs of the sequestered Breton district,
                    above all, the vagueness and solemnity of the neighbouring ocean. He received
                    his education at Dυl and Rennes, and after declining to enter the church from an
                    absence of vocation, obtained a commission in the army when on the point of
                    proceeding to try his fortune in India (1788).</p>
                <p>His thirst for distinction, further excited by the political convulsions of the
                    following year, found vent in a romantic scheme for the discovery of the North
                    West Passage, in pursuance of which he departed for America in 1790. The passage
                    was not found or even attempted, but the adventure∣ retai ned enriched with the
                    to him more important discover; of his own powers and vocation, conscious of his
                    marvellous faculty for the delineation of nature, and stored with ideas and
                    imagery, the material of much of his future work. Hi.- return coincided with the
                    execution of Louis XVI. Chateaubriand, a Breton and a soldier, could net do
                    otherwise than throw himself into the ranks of the emigrants. ∙ After the
                    failure of the duke of Brunswick’s invasion he retired to England, where he
                    lived obscurely for several years, gaining an intimate acquaintance with English
                    literature, and elaborating <hi rend="italic">The Natchez,</hi> a prose epic
                    designed to portray the life of the Red Indian tribes, and inspired by
                    reminiscences of his American travels. Two brilliant episodes of <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">René,</hi> have acquired universal renown; but the work as a
                    whole, to say nothing of the unreality of its pictures of savage life, belongs
                    to that unfortunate compromise between the forms of prose and poetry in a manner
                    imposed upon the French language by the penury of its poetic diction, but
                    incapable of the perfection of either poetry or prose. Chateaubriand’s first
                    publication, however, was the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Revolutions (ì
                    7$7).</hi> ln this remarkable work, which the author subsequently retracted, but
                    took care not to suppress, he appears as a mediator between royalist and
                    revolutionary ideas, a freethinker in religion, and in philosophy imbued with
                    the spirit of Rousseau. A great change in his views was, however, at hand,
                    induced, as he would have us believe, by the death of his mother in the same
                    year. It is certain that upon his restoration to his country three years
                    subsequently, the <hi rend="italic">Genius of Christianity</hi> was already in
                    an advanced state. Before publishing it, however, he determined to make an essay
                    with an episode of his romance. <hi rend="italic">Atala,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">The Loves of Two Savages,</hi> appeared in 1801, and immediately
                    raised the author to the summit of literary distinction. Exquisite style,
                    impassioned eloquence, and glowing descriptions of nature, gained indulgence for
                    the incongruity between the rudeness of the personages and the refinement of the
                    sentiments, and for the distasteful blending of prudery with sensuousness; the
                    latter was indeed conformable to the example of the author’s models and
                    predecessors. Alike in its merits and defects, the piece is a more emphatic and
                    highly-coloured “Paul and Virginia;” it has been justly said that Bernardin
                    Saint Pierre models in marble and Chateaubriand in bronze. Encouraged by his
                    success, the author resumed his <hi rend="italic">Genius of Christianity,</hi>
                    which appeared in the following year, just upon the eve of Napoleon’s
                    re-establishment of the Catholic religion, for which it thus almost seemed to
                    have prepared the way. No coincidence could have been more opportune, and
                    Chateaubriand might almost be pardoned for esteeming himself the counterpart of
                    Napoleon in the intellectual order, as be certainly did. In composing his work
                    he had borne in mind the admonition of his friend Joubert, that the public would
                    care very little for his erudition and very much for his eloquence. It is
                    consequently an inefficient production from the point of view of serious
                    argument. The considerations derived from natural theology are but commonplaces
                    rendered dazzling by the magic of style; and the parallels between Christianity
                    and antiquity, especially in arts and letters, are at best ingenious
                    sophistries. The less polemical passages, however, where the author depicts the
                    glories of the Catholic liturgy and its accessories, or expounds its symbolical
                    significance, are splendid instances of the effect produced by the accumulation
                    and judicious distribution of particulars gorgeous in the mass, and individually
                    treated with the utmost refinement of detail Taken altogether, the work is a
                    masterpiece of literary art, and its immediate effect was very considerable. It
                    admirably subserved the statecraft of Napoleon, who appointed the writer attaché
                    at Rome, and when his insubordinate and intriguing spirit compelled his recall,
                    transferred him as envoy to the canton of the Valais. The murder of the duke of
                    Enghien took place during his absence on this mission. Chateaubriand, to his
                    honour, immediately resigned his post, and subsequently manifested great courage
                    in his indirect censures of Napoleon in a journal of which he had become
                    proprietor, and which was ultimately suppressed. Ere this he had departed on a
                    pilgrimage to Jerusalem, undertaken, as he subsequently acknowledged, less in a
                    devotional spirit than in quest of new imagery, and in deference to the wishes
                    of a lady friend. The journey produced (1811) a record of travel distinguished
                    by his habitual picturesqueness, and also inspired his prose epic of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Martyrs,</hi> published two years previously. This work may be
                    regarded as the argument of the <hi rend="italic">Genius of Christianity</hi>
                    thrown into an objective form. Moore’s <hi rend="italic">Epicurean,</hi> and the
                    more ambitious passages of Bulwer’s earlier romances, may convey an adequate
                    notion of it to the merely English reader. As in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epicurean,</hi> the professed design is the contrast between Paganism and
                    Christianity, which fails of its purpose partly from the absence of real insight
                    into the genius of antiquity, and partly because the heathen are the most
                    interesting characters after all. Two years previously had appeared <hi
                    rend="italic">Rene,</hi> another detached episode of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Natchez,</hi> and perhaps Chateaubriand’s most characteristic production. The
                    connecting links in European literature between <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold,</hi> it paints with wonderful mastery the
                    misery of a morbid and dissatisfied soul, the type of a character blighted by
                    over-sensitiveness on the one hand, and an egotism thinly disguised by poetical
                    sentiment on the other. The representation is mainly from the life, and
                    Chateaubriand must certainly be acquitted of the unreality and affectation which
                    so frequently characterize similar delineations of the poetic temperament.
                    René’s morbid despondency is but the too faithful protrait of the desolation
                    begotten in his own mind by the unnatural alliance between opulence of
                    imagination and poverty of heart. His sister Lucile is the Amélie of the story.
                    <hi rend="italic">The Natchez,</hi> of which <hi rend="italic">René</hi> was to
                    have formed an episcde, was not published until 1826, at which time also
                    appeared the beautiful tale of <hi rend="italic">The Last of the
                    Abencerrages,</hi> written about 1809, and, as the author asserts, withheld from
                    publication on account of the Peninsular War. With this composition
                    Chateaubriand’s career as an imaginative writer is closed; and we have
                    henceforth chiefly to consider him as a politician. His character in this point
                    of view may be comprised in a sentence; he was equally formidable to his
                    antagonists when in opposition and to his friends when in office. His poetical
                    receptivity and impressionableness rendered him honestly inconsistent with
                    himself, while his vanity and ambition, too morbidly acute to be restrained by
                    the ties of party allegiance, made him dangerous and untrustworthy as a
                    political associate. His pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Bonaparte and the
                    Bourbons,</hi> published in 1814, while the fate of Napoleon yet trembled in the
                    balance, was as opportune in the moment of its appearance as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Genius of Christianity,</hi> and produced a hardly less signal
                    effect. Louis XVIII. declared that it had been worth a hundred thousand men to
                    him. Chateaubriand was called to his councils, accompanied him to Ghent during
                    the Hundred Days, and for a time associated himself with the excesses of the
                    royalist reaction. Political bigotry, however, was not among his faults; he
                    gradually drifted into liberalism and opposition, anti upon a change of
                    ministry, obtained the London embassy, from which he was transferred to
                    represent his country at the Congress of Verona. He here made himself mainly
                    responsible for the iniquitous invasion of Spain,—an expedition undertaken, as
                    he himself admits, with the puerile idea of restoring French prestige by a
                    military parade. He next received the portfolio of foreign affairs, which he
                    soon lost by his desertion of his colleagues on the question of a reduction of
                    the interest on the national debt. After another interlude of effective
                    pamphleteering in opposition, he accepted the embassy to Rome under the
                    Martignac administration, resigned it at Prince Polignac’s accession to office,
                    and on the downfall of the elder branch of the Bourbons, made one last extremely
                    brilliant but inevitably fruitless protest from the tribune in defence of the
                    principle of legitimacy. During the first half of Louis Philippe’s reign he was
                    still active with his pen, and was regarded as the most efficient champion of
                    the exiled dynasty, but as years increased upon him, and the prospect <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0449-0438"/> of his again performing a conspicuous part
                    diminished, he relapsed into an attitude of complete discouragement, and
                    contributed to chill the ardour of his own party. His narrative of his share in
                    the Congress of Verona, the <hi rend="italic">Life of Rance,</hi> and his
                    translation of Milton, belong to the writings of these later days. He expired on
                    July 4, 1848, wholly exhausted and thoroughly discontented with himself and the
                    world, but affectionately tended by his old friend Madame Récamier, herself
                    deprived of sight. His remains were interred in Grand Bey, a lonely islet off
                    the coast of Brittany. Shortly after his death his memory was powerfully
                    revived, and at the same time exposed to much adverse criticism, by the
                    publication, with sundry mutilations as has been suspected, of his celebrated
                    <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Outre-Tombe,</hi> the composition of which
                    had occupied him at intervals during the greater part of his life. These memoirs
                    undoubtedly reveal his vanity, his egotism, the frequent hollowness of his
                    professed convictions, and his incapacity for sincere attachment, except,
                    perhaps, in the case of Madame Récamier. They abound, on the other hand, with
                    beauties of the first order, and much of the rough treatment they have
                    experienced is attributable to the animosity of party. Their principal literary
                    defect is the frequent encroachment of the historical element upon the
                    autobiographical, the writer’s exaggerated estimate of his own consequence
                    leading him to allow a disproportionate space to transactions in which he had in
                    fact but little share.</p>
                <p>Chateaubriand ranks rather as a great rhetorician than as a great poet, rather as
                    a great writer than a great man. Something of affectation or unreality commonly
                    interferes with the enjoyment of his finest works. The <hi rend="italic">Genius
                    of Christianity</hi> is a brilliant piece of special pleading; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atala</hi> is marred by its unfaithfulness to the truth of uncivilized human
                    nature, <hi rend="italic">René</hi> by the perversion of sentiment which
                    solicits sympathy for a character rather deserving of contempt. Chateaubriand’s
                    fame owes much to the timeliness of his appearances in print, and even more to
                    the genuine conviction of his countrymen that French literature and European
                    literature are practically convertible terms. They have hence made his position
                    in the former the standard of his influence over the latter, which, for an
                    author so widely read and so generally admired, has in reality been but small.
                    Even in France he is chiefly significant as marking the transition from the old
                    classical to the modern romantic school. He belongs to the latter by the
                    idiosyncrasy of his genius, to the former by the comparative severity of his
                    taste. The fertility of ideas, vehemence of expression, and luxury of natural
                    description, which he shares with the romanticists, are controlled by a
                    discipline imbibed in the school of their predecessors. His palette, always
                    brilliant, is never gaudy; he is not merely a painter but an artist. He is a
                    master of epigrammatic and incisive sayings, and has contributed as much as any
                    great French writer to foster the disastrous national partiality for <hi
                    rend="italic">la phrase.</hi> Perhaps, however, the most truly characteristic
                    feature of his genius is the peculiar magical touch which Mr Arnold has
                    indicated as a note of Celtic extraction, which reveals some occult quality in a
                    familiar object, or tinges it, one knows not how, with “the light that never was
                    on sea or land.” This incommunicable gift is of necessity genuine, and supplies
                    an element of sincerity to Chateaubriand’s writings which goes far to redeem the
                    artificial effect of his calculated sophistry and set declamation. It is also
                    fortunate for his fame that so large a part of his writings should directly or
                    indirectly refer to himself, for on this theme he always writes weiZ Egotism was
                    his masterpassion, and beyond his intrepidity and the loftiness of his
                    intellectual carriage his character presents little to admire. He is a signal
                    instance of the compatibility of genuine poetic emotion, and sympathy with the
                    grander aspects both of man and nature, and even munificence in pecuniary
                    matters, with absorption in self and general sterility of heart.</p>
