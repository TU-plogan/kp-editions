                    (1520-1604), “the Nestor of the Elizabethan heroes,” was born at Shrewsbury in
                    1520, and was educated at Oxford. At seventeen he went to court, where he
                    roistered through such money as he had. He then became attached to the earl of
                    Surrey, applying himself during his three or four years of service to books,
                    music, and the practice of poetry. He served his first campaign in Flanders
                    (1542-1544) against the French, and his second (1547) in »Scotland. He fought at
                    Pinkie, but was captured next year at St Monance, and did not return to England
                    till 1550. A tract called <hi rend="italic">David Dicads Dream,</hi> written at
                    this time, not only involved Churchyard in a fierce quarrel with a contemporary
                    scribbler, but brought down on him the censure of the Privy Council; he only
                    escaped the pillory through the interest of his patron, the duke of Somerset. A
                    third campaign took him to Ireland, whence he returned in 1552. Having been
                    unsuccessful in a love suit, he once more betook himself to the Continent, to
                    serve his fourth campaign, at Metz and elsewhere, under the great emperor. His
                    absence extended over three years. On his return he began writing harder than
                    ever, dedicating two of his works to Queen Mary. The war with France made him a
                    lieutenant in the English army, and at Guines he acted as mediator between the
                    besieged and the besiegers. He next addressed a poetical appeal to Elizabeth; he
                    got nothing, however, but fair words, and had to write his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tragédie</hi><hi rend="italic">of Lord Mowbray,</hi> a contribution to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mirrour for Magistrates.</hi> He fought at the leaguer of Leith in
                    1560; he again attempted fortune as a courtier; and he went off to Ireland,
                    campaigning under Henry Sidney. In 1566 he wandered to Antwerp, where he headed
                    a great force of religious partizans; but he speedily had to fly the country by
                    reason, he says, of his extreme moderation. Next year he went back as one of
                    Oxford’s agents, returning to England in 1569, when he married. In 1593, after
                    another journey to Scotland, where he witnessed Morton’s execution, Elizabeth
                    gave him a pension; and eleven years later, immediately after the publication of
                    his last work, the <hi rend="italic">Blessed Balm to Search and Salve
                    Sedition,</hi> he died. Churchyard seems to have been an active, garrulous, and
                    cheerful adventurer. Strype praises him as a good soldier and poet and a man of
                    honest principles. Of his multifarious publications the <hi rend="italic">Legend
                    of Jane Shore</hi> is most highly esteemed, while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Worthinesse of Wales</hi> (1587) and <hi rend="italic">Churchyard’s
                    Chippes</hi> (1575) have been reprinted,—the former in 1776, the latter, by Mr
                    Chalmers, in 1817. See D’Israeli, <hi rend="italic">Calamities of Authors,</hi>
