                    distinct manner, in the Old Testament) there is to be found frequent mention of
                    a corporate body known as the church,—sometimes spoken of more fully as the
                    Church of God, or the Church of Christ. It is referred to by its divine Founder
                    as about to be built upon a rock (Matthew xvi. 18). In the book of Acts it has
                    become a living reality, including apostles, elders, and laity,—holding a
                    council, and making decisions upon most points of doctrine and of practice (Acts
                    xvi. 4-22). In the epistles it is spoken of in terms of great magnificence, akin
                    to the glowing language of prophecy. Christ, in His glorified humanity, is
                    recognized as its head; it is in turn His body, His fulness, and His spouse.</p>
                <p>The exact ideas involved in the word church, the questions concerning its powers,
                    its nature and essence and modes of governance and continuance, its relation to
                    Holy Scripture, and its relation to the state—have all been fruitful matters of
                    controversy. These questions have emerged in a marked manner during the
                    controversy with the Gnostics, the controversy with the Novatians and the
                    Donatists, and those arising out of the Reformation. Hence among the writings of
                    the fathers, bearing upon the nature of the church, may be specially named those
                    of St Irenaeus in opposition to the Gnostics, of St Cyprian against the
                    Novatians, and of St Augustine against the Donatists. The relations of the
                    church to the state became subjects of discussion directly Constantine had made
                    Christianity the religion of the empire. These relations are illustrated by the
                    history of Arianism, Donatism, and Priscillianism, by the career of St
                    Chrysostom, and by the fierce conflicts of the Middle Ages between Guelfs and
                    Ghibellines—the former siding with the Pope, the latter with the emperors. The
                    contest between Philip the Fair and Pope Boniface, and that of Philip Augustus
                    of France and John of England against Pope Innocent III. turned upon the same
                    great controversy, again and again renewed during the Middle Ages. Some of the
                    most striking mediaeval illustrations of the conflict are to he found in the
                    life of Occam, and in the <hi rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Commedia</hi> of Dante. The points in dispute have been keenly discussed by
                    modern historians;—those of the 18th century, as Hume, Henry, Mably, being
                    strongly on the side of the state; those of the 19th, as Guizot, Voigt,
                    Michelet, Palgrave, Arnold, Bridges, Mill, and even Macaulay, and, to some
                    extent, Milman, more or less emphatically advocating the cause of the mediaeval
                    church during at least a portion of the struggle.</p>
                <p>The Reformation in great measure turned upon both sets of questions,—the relation
                    of the church to the Scriptures and its relation to the state. Consequently,
                    they occupy no small portion both of the controversial literature and of the
                    political history of the 16th and 17th centuries. On the religious side they are
                    illustrated by the lives and writings of Martin Luther, Calvin, Melanchthon, and
                    the Continental Reformers generally, as well by those of Knox and of Cranmer in
                    Britain, and of their Roman Catholic opponents, such as Ignatius Loyola, and in
                    a later age by Cardinal Bellarmine and by Hooker, by Andrewes and others; and on
                    the political side by such events as the Thirty Years’ War, the Spanish Armada,
                    the Revolution of 1688. The last two centuries have not witnessed any
                    distinctively religious war. But these questions underlie the numerous
                    “concordats” drawn up between the Church of Rome and various states in Europe
                    and America, the entire history of Gallicanism and Jansenism, the Tractarian
                    controversy commencing in England in 1833 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and
                    the contemporary discussion in Scotland, which ended in the Disruption of 1843
                    and the formation of the powerful and energetic body of Presbyterians, known as
                    the Free Church. The disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Ireland raised
                    cognate questions, and it is evident that disestablishment, already a fact in
                    the United States, in France, in Ireland, and in some of the British colonies,
                    may at any moment become a question of no slight political importance. Among
                    more modern writers who have treated these questions may be named Bishop
                    Warburton, De Maistre, the Rev. Sir W. Palmer, Rothe, Klee, the Abbé Mignet, Mr
                    Gladstone, Dr Arnold, and many more, especially the commentators on creeds and
                    confessions, as Möhler, Bishop Burnet, Bishop Harold Browne.</p>
                <p>It remains to mention a few of the more prominent views and definitions prevalent
                    among leading bodies of Christians.</p>
                <p>1. As regards the church triumphant there would probably be little or no
                    controversy. The great bulk of Christians would acknowledge it as “the whole
                    body of the glorified, consisting of the holy angels and of the spirits of the
                    just made perfect who have been redeemed by the merits (whether foreseen or
                    actually wrought) of the divine Head of the church, Jesus Christ, the Incarnate
                    Son of God.”</p>
                <p>2. But concerning the church on earth, definitions vary considerably. In the
                    first place there emerges the important question, whether it is a visible or an
                    invisible body. This is not the place to discuss which is the view set forth in
                    Holy Scripture,—that being of course the very point at issue. It must here
                    suffice to say that the disciples of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n772/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0772-0759"/> Calvin (followed herein by a very large number,
                    probably the majority, of purely Protestant communities) maintain that it is
                    invisible; while the Lutherans, the Roman Catholics, the Oriental Christians,
                    and the great bulk of the more famous Anglican divines (in accordance with the
                    Anglican formularies) maintain it to be visible. This latter view is, it need
                    hardly be said, the one all but universally adopted by the fathers and the
                    schoolmen. In one passage, however, of his later writings, St Augustine employs
                    an expression at variance with his usual tone, and favourable to the Calvinistic
                    view, by calling the church “the society of the predestined.”</p>
                <p>3. The relations considered to exist between the visible church and Holy
                    Scripture must necessarily be those of coordination, or of sub-ordination on one
                    side or the other An impartial estimate of the Anglican formularies would
                    probably be found to support that view of co-ordinate authority of Scripture and
                    the church which is taken by a large body of her divines, such as Bishops
                    Pearson, Bull, Kay, Dean Jackson, and others; though many of her adherents would
                    undoubtedly incline, more or less completely, to that more Protestant view,
                    which subordinates the church to Scripture, a view held most strongly by those
                    bodies whose confessions of faith (as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    Westminster Confession) seem to imply that the books of Scripture attest
                    themselves as divine. In the Church of Rome there can be no question but that
                    the church is placed above Holy Scripture; for though Scripture proofs of
                    doctrine are always, if possible, sought by her controversialists, and referred
                    to in her symbolical standards (as, for instance, the Tridentine decrees), yet
                    the traditions preserved in the church are spoken of as to be venerated not
                    merely as comments on the meaning of Scripture, but as deserving equal honour
                    and reverence with Scripture <hi rend="italic">{Decret.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cone. Trident.,</hi> sessio iv.) On the other hand, the Anglican formularies
                    teach that Holy Scripture contains all things necessary to salvation (Art. vi.),
                    though the church is described as the witness and keeper of Holy Writ and as
                    having authority in controversies of faith (Art. xx.). The school of Anglicanism
                    represented by Field, Hammond, Pearson, Bull,and Bramhall regards a judgmentof
                    thechurch universal, such as that of the Council of Nice against Arius, as
                    “irrevocable, irreformable, never to be altered.” (See Sir W. Palmer’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Church of Christ,</hi> part iv. ch. iv.) The Eastern Church seems
                    to place the relation of Holy Scripture to itself in almost the same position as
                    this school of Anglicans, though it would perhaps lay somewhat stronger stress
                    on the insufficiency of Scripture without the voice of the teaching and
                    interpreting church. It may be remarked that in this, as in other matters,
                    belief has from time to time been greatly influenced by the course of events. In
                    the first age of Christianity, before the canon of the New Testament was formed,
                    the church is almost everything (as Reuss and others have observed), and the
                    Bible, which chiefly consisted of the Old Testament, was subordinate. By about
                    200 A.D., when the gospels were becoming better known, the relation between
                    Scripture and the church appears in patristic writings much more like one of
                    co-ordination. During the Middle Ages, as the church’s political power
                    increased, Holy Scripture became more and more subordinate, until we find Dante
                    complaining of the way in which not merely creeds and fathers but canon law and
                    the decretals are studied instead of the Gospel <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Paradiso,</hi> ix. 133). The Reformation necessarily caused a reaction, built,
                    as it was so largely, on new translations and on the circulation of the Bible;
                    and in the following century we find the successors of the Reformers laying more
                    stress upon what is commonly called the verbal inspiration of the Scripture and
                    its infallible authority than had been done for the most part by the fathers
                    (except perhaps St. Augustine) or by the first Reformers, Luther and Calvin, and
                    their contemporaries, who never seem to have sanctioned the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">dictum</hi> of Chillingworth, “The Bible, and the Bible only, is
                    the religion of Protestants.” Of late years the difficulties arising from
                    science, philology, history, and criticism have tended to modify this view of
                    the supremacy of Scripture. Not only in the unreformed communions and among
                    Anglicans and Lutherans, but even in Calvi nistic bodies, is this effect
                    perceived. Thus we find an eminent Presbyterian divine, a minister of the
                    Scottish Establishment, writing as early as 1848, “The living church is more
                    than the dead Bible, for it is the Bible and something more” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Life of Dr Norman Macleod).</hi> The comment made by Kant on the inconsistency
                    of those Lutherans who virtually say “Go to the Bible, but do not find anything
                    there except what we find” is well known <hi rend="italic">{Streit der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Facultaten).</hi></p>
                <p>4. Turning to the constitution and government of the church, it is singular that
                    in none of the symbolical utterances of the leading Christian communities is
                    there found such a definition of the church as would really include all that is
                    believed by those respective bodies. Nor is it easy to supply the want by appeal
                    to divines, though many have striven to set forth the “notes” of the true church
                    (see, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Klee, <hi rend="italic">Dogmatik,</hi> and
                    many others). Neither the Roman Catholic Tridentine decrees nor the Westminster
                    Confession supply any definition, and the one given in the nineteenth of the
                    Articles of* the English Church leaves the questions at issue between Rome and
                    the Reformers, between Episcopacy and Presbyterianism, entirely open. For all
                    would claim to represent that “visible church of Christ” which is there
                    described as “a congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure word of God
                    is preached, and the sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ’s
                    ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.”</p>
                <p>Concerning the question of government there are four leading views. The first is,
                    that no form of government was instituted by the divine Founder of the church or
                    His apostles, that there was originally no distinction between clergy and laity,
                    but that officers were in due time appointed as might happen in any human
                    society, for the sake of order and convenience. This view, which is probably
                    that of the majority of Protestants at the present time, has found a thoughtful,
                    devout, and highly gifted exponent’ in the historian Neander; while the
                    difficulties of reconciling it with the New Testament are all set forth by two
                    independent translators of his work, the Rev. J. H. Rose and Mr Morrison. A
                    second view is, that a government was in such wise instituted as rightly to
                    claim a <hi rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic">divinum,</hi> that this
                    government resides in presbyters, and is handed down by succession through the
                    presbyterate. This view was maintained by many foreign adherents of the
                    Reformation, and in England by Richard Cartwright, the Puritan opponent of
                    Hooker, and an entire school of his day. They appeal to history, especially that
                    of the Alexandrian Church, and to the fathers, more especially to St Jerome. The
                    third view resembles this in principle, but assigns the governance to a superior
                    order, that of the bishops, and makes the succession pass through them. The
                    Anglican communion acts upon this view, re-ordaining all ministers not
                    episcopally ordained, but accepting Greek or Roman Catholic ordination; and it
                    has been defended by many of the writers of the High Church school, above named,
                    to whom may be added Bishop Bilson, and the able Scottish controversialist
                    Bishop Sage in his work against Gilbert Rule. (See also Bishop Cotterill’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Genesis of the Church,</hi> and article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bishop),</hi> This school lays great stress on the decisions of the oecumenical
                    councils, of which it recognizes six or (according to Bishop Andrewes) seven
                    before the division of East and West <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n773/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0773-0760"/> This view, though strongly supported by the
                    Eastern churches as well as by an historical and living school of Anglicans, is
                    undoubtedly open to the difficulty, acknowledged by Mr Gladstone and others, of
                    making the church as a collective body remain silent for some thirteen centuries
                    and still unable to speak. There remains the fourth, the Roman Catholic view,
                    which subjects the entire episcopate to the bishop of Rome, and makes full
                    communion with him of the essence of churchmanship. This view has been supported
                    ever since the Middle Ages with immense zeal and learning by many able Catholic
                    writers. Although a strong case against it has been made out from the fathers,
                    especially the Eastern ones, and although the state of matters just before the
                    Reformation was everywhere one of gross abuses and much superstition, yet the
                    good points of the Papacy have been fully recognized by Protestants and Anglican
                    writers, such as Guizot, Michelet, Comte, Ranke, Sir James Stephen, Dr Arnold,
                    Archbishop Trench, and Bishop Harold Browne. Nevertheless, the increasing
                    development of the Papal claims has been strongly resisted within the pale of
                    that church by the Jansenists, by the Gallican divines such as Bossuet, and by
                    the entire body of the Port Royalists, including such brilliant names as those
                    of St Cyran, De Sacy, Arnauld, and above all Pascal. All these display a
                    Calvinistic element in their teaching, and more or less (as for instance Fleury
                    in his famous Church History) modify the distinctively Roman characteristics
                    most opposed by Protestants, and they pílace a general council far above the
                    Pope. In our own day the counter-theory among Roman Catholics, of which De
                    Maistre was a leading spokesman, has been seemingly ratified by the Vatican
                    Council and the Pope declared infallible. This extreme step has provoked a
                    schism among Roman Catholics, and alienated some of their most eminent men.</p>
                <p>Of the different views entertained concerning the relation between church and
                    state, it must be enough to say here that occasional collision seems almost
                    unavoidable. For where two independent societies lay claim to a common ground,
                    those claims, unless precisely defined, will sometimes militate. No state has
                    yet been known to carry out the theory of Locke, and confine its attention
                    purely to the preservation of life and property. But every state which considers
                    public morality to be within its sphere, and legislates on such matters as
                    marriage and education, must of necessity occupy to some extent the same ground
                    as the various Christian communities which claim to be the local church. ( J. G
