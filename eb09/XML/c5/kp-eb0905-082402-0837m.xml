                    on a technical charge of pollution, no less than 7000 families, and established
                    an entirely new constitution, transferring the government from the old senate to
                    300 of the oligarchical party. Eventually, however, he and his small force were
                    blockaded by their opponents in the Acropolis, and forced to capitulate and to
                    quit the city. On his return home he at once raised a force of Spartans and
                    allies in order to avenge his failure, and to establish a despotism at Athens in
                    the person of Isagoras. But when the expedition had reached Eleusis on its
                    march, not only some of the subject-allies but also his brother-king Dem aratus
                    (of the Proclid junior branch) refused to proceed further, and he had to return
                    without effecting his object. When the Ionian colonies revolted from Persia, in
                    500, their leader Aristagoras came to seek aid from Sparta. Cleomenes was at
                    first inclined to entertain the tempting offers of Asiatic conquest which the
                    Ionian, in his eagerness to secure the alliance, laid before him. But when
                    Aristagoras, in reply to his questions, was forced to confess-that Susa, the
                    Persian capital, was no less than three months’ journey inland from the sea, the
                    king was startled, and bade his visitor quit Sparta before sunset. The Ionian
                    then tried to bribe him; and as his offers mounted higher and higher, his little
                    daughter Gorgo, some eight or nine years old (afterwards the wife of Leonidas)
                    said, “Father, go away, or the stranger will corrupt you.” Such at least is the
                    story told by Herodotus, though Grote doubts its authenticity.</p>
                <p>During a local war between Sparta and Argos, Cleomenes by a stratagem defeated
                    the Argive forces near Tiryns. Those who escaped from the battle took refuge in
                    a consecrated grove, which was set on fire by order of Cleomenes, and no less
                    than 6000 men, the flower of the Argive citizens, are said either to have been
                    killed in the battle, or to have perished in the flames,—a loss from which Argos
                    was very long in recovering. For some reason he did not pursue his victory, but
                    returned at once to Sparta, to the great dissatisfaction of his own people. One
                    legend relates that the city of Argos was successfully defended against him by
                    its women.</p>
                <p>When Darius (491) sent heralds to demand the submission of all the Greeks, and
                    the inhabitants of Aegina <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n838/mode/1up"

                    water,” Cleomenes proceeded to the island to punish its treachery to the
                    national cause. His fellow-king Demaratus, who was always jealous of him,
                    privately encouraged the Aeginetans in their resistance, and the feud between
                    the two became so bitter, that Cleomenes brought up an old charge of
                    illegitimacy against his colleague, and succeeded in driving him into exile.
                    Retributive fate very soon overtook himself; he was convicted of having procured
                    the deposition of Demaratus by tampering with the priestess of the Delphian
                    oracle, and had to retire for safety into Thessaly, and thence into Arcadia.
                    There he endeavoured to raise war against his countrymen, who in their alarm
                    were weak enough to recall him. His renewed reign was not long. He soon after
                    showed symptoms of madness, attacking violently with his staff those who came to
                    him for audience. Some attributed this derangement to a habit of hard drinking
                    which had grown upon him; others saw in it the just punishment of his impiety,
                    both in his intrigues with the oracle at Delphi, and in the burning of the
                    sacred grove at Argos and the massacre of those who had taken sanctuary there.
                    At length he had to be placed in close confinement, when he persuaded the slave
                    who had charge of him to bring him a knife, with which he deliberately slashed
                    himself to pieces. *</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cleomenes</hi> III. the last of the Agid line, succeeded 240
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> —a king of strong and determined character, who
                    wished to restore at Sparta the old constitution and discipline of Lycurgus, and
                    to destroy the Achaean League. He met Aristomachus, the “captain” of the League,
                    with a force of 5000 men against 25,000 at Palantium, but the Achaeans, even
                    with this advantage, declined the engagement. The next year he defeated them in
                    a great battle at the foot of Mount Lycaeum. He found active opponents at Sparta
                    in the Ephors, whose anomalous authority he held to have been gradually usurped
                    in derogation of the royal prerogative, affecting dangerously the independence
                    of the kings, and which it was therefore his great object to crush. He succeeded
                    in this at last by an unscrupulous <hi rend="italic">coup d’etat,</hi>
                    surrounding the hall in which the Ephors were feasting with a body of armed
                    mercenaries, and slaughtering them on the spot. He met with no resistance from
                    the panic-stricken citizens, and at once proceeded to inaugurate his new
                    constitution, abolishing the Ephorate entirely, restoring the old prerogatives
                    of the kings, and amongst other reforms making a re-distribution of lands, and
                    extending the franchise.</p>
                <p>He had still to contend with the Achaean League for the supremacy of Greece. In
                    the war which ensued he was finally defeated by Antigonus of Macedonia, who had
                    become virtually the master of the League, in the battle of Sellasia (222), when
                    the death-blow was given to the independence of Sparta. Cleomenes took refuge in
                    Egypt with Ptolemy Euergetes, who received him kindly. But the succeeding
                    Ptolemy neglected and even imprisoned him. He escaped and attempted to head an
                    insurrection against the king, failing in which, he committed suicide.</p>
