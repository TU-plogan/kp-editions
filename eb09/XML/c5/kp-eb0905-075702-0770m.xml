                    employment of a tallow chandler, and his income for many years was derived
                    partly from this source and partly from glove-making. Through energy and
                    perseverance he succeeded in gaining a fair knowledge of mathematics, geography,
                    and some other subjects. Theology, however, was what chiefly commanded the
                    attention of Chubb and his companions, among whom he seems to have been the
                    moving spirit. His intellectual activity, and the eagerness he always displayed
                    to gain clear and distinct views of any question that occupied him, marked him
                    out from the first; and his early habit of committing his thoughts to writing
                    gave him a clear and fluent style which afterwards found much favour with the
                    public. He made his first appearance as an author in the Arian controversy, on
                    the side of Whiston. A dispute having arisen among his friends aboutWhiston’s
                    argument in favour of the supremacy of the one God and Father, Chubb was led to
                    write an essay which bore the title, <hi rend="italic">The Supremacy of the
                    Father Asserted.</hi> This, passed round his friends in manuscript, created so
                    favourable an impression that the author ultimately submitted it to the judgment
                    of Whiston, who pronounced it well worthy of publication. After a few
                    emendations by Whiston, it was printed in 1715. A number of tracts on various
                    subjects followed, which were published in a collected form in 1730. Chubb was
                    now regarded as a literary phenomenon. Among other persons of eminence, he
                    attracted the attention of Sir Joseph Jekyll, Master of the Rolls, in whose
                    house he lived for several years. The nature of his position there is not
                    precisely known; but there are stories told of his having waited at table as a
                    servant out of livery, and of the amusement caused by his short stout figure
                    standing as steward at his patron’s sideboard. His love of independence and
                    retirement drew him back to Salisbury, where by the kindness of friends he was
                    enabled to devote the rest of his days to his favourite studies. He died on the
                    8th February 1746. His moral character was excellent, and he is said to have
                    continued a regular attendant on divine worship in the parish church.</p>
                <p>Chubb was the author of a very large number of controversial tracts. His
                    principal works are— <hi rend="italic">A Discourse Concerning Reason</hi> (1731
                    ), <hi rend="italic">The True Gospel of Jesus Christ</hi> (1739), and <hi
                    rend="italic">Posthumous Works,</hi> 2 vols. (1748). The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discourse Concerning Reason</hi> aims at showing that reason is, or ought to
                    be, a sufficient guide in matters of religion. After defining the terms of this
                    proposition, he proceeds to argue that if man is accountable to God for his
                    actions, he has a right to possess a power sufficient to discover what he is
                    accountable for, and also to discover such motives to right behaviour as will
                    counterbalance those temptations which are unavoidable in the present
                    constitution of things. It will not help the case to say that man, as originally
                    constituted, had such a power, but lost it through Adam’s fall; since it matters
                    not to mankind whether Adam had originally such a power or not. Men cannot
                    justly be held accountable if they lost in Adam that power. If the power was
                    only impaired through Adam’s sin, and if every man will be judged according to
                    the ability he has, then reason is a sufficient guide in matters of religion.
                    Difficulties which unavoidably arise from the constitution of things are only
                    chargeable upon the author of that constitution. If divine revelation was meant
                    to supply the defect of reason, then millions, whom that revelation has never
                    reached, have been unjustly dealt with. The deficiency being general, the
                    revelation should have been given to the whole species. The sufficiency of
                    reason does not make revelation needless, as reason may be neglected or abused,
                    and revelation may be needed to bring men back to a right use of reason in
                    religion. True, reason could not discover how divine justice is satisfied by the
                    sufferings and death of Christ, and how the sinner is justified by faith in Him;
                    but that is repugnant to reason, and can be no part of the genuine revelation.
                    One unjust action cannot satisfy justice for another. Nor can sin, considered
                    abstractedly from the sinner, be the object of favour or displeasure. Only what
                    faith leads to, viz., repentance and turning to God, is the true ground of God’s
                    mercy and kindness to men. This is most evident to reason when discovered, and
                    must therefore be discoverable by reason. If, as is allowed, reason is a proper
                    guide in matters of revelation, it should not be less so in matters of religion,
                    for the one seems to be as much within the province of reason as the other. At
                    the close Chubb disavows any intention to injure divine revelation, or to serve
                    the cause of infidelity. <hi rend="italic">Ths True Gospel of Christ</hi> is
                    characterized by Lechler, in his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des englischen
                    Deismus,</hi> as an essential moment in the historical development of deism. Its
                    leading thought is that Christianity is not doctrine, but life. Jesus requires
                    us to regulate our life according to the eternal and unchangeable law of action
                    which is based on the reason of things. If men, through violation of this law,
                    incur God’s wrath, repentance and reformation are the only means of obtaining
                    God’s favour and forgiveness. That these truths may make a greater impression,
                    the gospel declares that God has appointed a day of judgment and retribution.
                    The law of nature is thus the essential content of the gospel. It is no
                    historical account of facts, as Christ’s death, resurrection, <hi rend="italic"
                    >kc.,</hi> for it was preached to the poor before these events occurred. Nor do
                    the private opinions of the evangelists and apostles form any part of the
                    gospel. Like Tindal, Chubb comes to the conclusion that the true gospel of
                    Christ is identical with natural religion. The greater portion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Posthumous Works</hi> is taken up with <hi rend="italic">The
                    Author'sFarewell to his Readers,</hi> in which he comes to a sceptical
                    conclusion regarding a particular providence, the efficacy of prayer, and a
                    future state of existence, although he thinks that man’s responsibility affords
                    some probability or the latter. He rejects the Jewish revelation, because it
                    sullies God’s moral character. Mahometanism, he thinks, could not have prevailed
                    by the sword alone; “it must have prevailed to a very great degree before the
                    sword could have been drawn in its favour.” He believed there was a man Jesus,
                    who collected a body of disciples, and laid a foundation for a new sect among
                    the Jews. His objections against the prophecies and miracles are often
                    far-fetched, and contain nothing beyond what had been urged by previous writers.
                    It lends a special interest to Chubb’s representation of primitive Christianity
                    that he insists on the fact that it was a gospel for the poor. There is thus a
                    democratic tendency in the view he takes of the gospel. He represents the rise
                    of deistical notions among the artisan class.</p>
