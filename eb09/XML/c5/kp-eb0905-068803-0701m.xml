                <p><label type="entry">CHRISTIANITY</label></p>
                <p>(CHRISTIANITY is derived from the adjective <hi rend="italic">Christian,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">J</hi> which is formed from the name Χριστός, the Anointed, and
                    means the religion introduced by Jesus Christ and communicated by Him to His
                    circle of followers.</p>
                <p>The Christian religion is the result of two factors, neither of which can be
                    omitted if a true description is to be given. On the one hand there is the
                    objective element, which consists in the manifestation and revelation of God to
                    His people for the purpose of salvation; and on the other side there is the
                    subjective element, which consists in the appropriation of this manifestation
                    and what it implies by man through faith. Both elements enter into and form the
                    constituent elements of a new <hi rend="italic">life,</hi> which all Christians
                    share in-common, and which is the essence of Christianity. This common life of
                    Jesus and His people has many ways by which it can make itself seen and known.
                    Christians have from the beginning exercised no small influence upon the
                    ordinary political and moral life of the world. They have been able to effect
                    changes in generally received moral ideas and maxims. They have altered the
                    course and character of legislation. They have introduced new opinions and
                    beliefs. They have formed fellowships for worship, built places of meeting, held
                    councils and assemblies, and in many ways given evidence of their presence and
                    power in the world. But it must always be remembered that Christianity is
                    neither the church simply, nor theology, nor Christian ethics. It is more than
                    all these put together. The common life of Jesus and His people, which is the
                    core of Christianity, manifests itself in an outward visible organization for
                    the purpose of worship, which is commonly called the church (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Church).</hi> But this worship is not Christianity; still less
                    are the various institutions and ceremonies according to which worship is
                    carried on.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0702-0689"/>
                <p>Christianity cannot help powerfully affecting the whole of the intellectual side
                    of man’s life. The spiritual events on which it rests must have their rationale,
                    and the spiritual forces which course through it must have their rule, and man
                    must more or less comprehend them, and assimilate them. The Christian cannot
                    help having a very different idea of God from that held by Aristotle or Plato.
                    The Christian regards sin as something which affects the whole human race, while
                    the pagan believes it to be the mistake or misfortune of individuals.
                    Christianity cannot help remoulding the beliefs and opinions of mankind, but
                    theology and Christianity are two very different things.</p>
                <p>The Christian is moved by moral impulses and guided by moral principles which are
                    peculiar to himself. He cannot look on marriage, for example, from either the
                    purely economic or the purely sensuous point of view. He cannot help
                    reorganizing the scheme of virtues, and giving to the principle of love a
                    pre-eminence which it has not in pagan ethics. Christianity cannot help putting
                    a new face on morality, but Christian ethics and Christianity are still not one
                    and the same thing.</p>
                <p>Christianity includes all these and much more besides. It is nothing less than
                    the whole round of human life in all its various departments in so far as it is
                    related to and illumined and dominated by the divine love revealed in Jesus
                    Christ. It is the presence of Jesus among His people and all that is implied in
                    such a presence.</p>
                <p>The close and inseparable connection between Jesus Christ and Christianity, which
                    is implied in the name, and which study only makes more and more evident,
                    produces the inevitable consequence that our view of the nature and
                    characteristics of Christianity must depend on the answer which we give to the
                    question which Jesus himself put to His disciples—“Whom do ye say that I, the
                    Son of man, am <hi rend="italic">ĭ</hi><hi rend="italic">”</hi> There are
                    different theories of Christianity, because there are different theories of
                    Christ, and in order to know how various conceptions of the nature of
                    Christianity arise it is necessary to be familiar with the various views which
                    men have held and hold about the nature and work of Christ. For example,
                    different theories of Christianity arise when we ask what was the relation
                    existing between Jesus and what went before Him, what was the relation in which
                    Jesus stood to His contemporaries and His immediate followers, what is the
                    connection which subsisted between Jesus and the future. All these inquiries
                    reveal different theories about the nature and work of Christ, which are
                    reproduced in different theories of the essential nature of Christianity, and
                    enable men whose opinions and principles are widely different to call
                    themselves, to their own satisfaction at least, Christians.</p>
                <p>Jesus Christ claimed to have a definite relation to the past history of that
                    people among whom He was born. In His teaching He put himself at the end of the
                    Old Testament, and declared that He came to fulfil the Law and the Prophets.
                    Christianity, therefore, however it be explained, has a close connection with
                    Judaism, and the religion of Jesus cannot be considered without regard to the
                    religion of Moses. This is now universally acknowledged, however variously the
                    relation between the two may be explained. Criticism finds an ample confirmation
                    of the claims of Christ in the intimate connection in which His teaching, life,
                    and work stand to the Old Testament and the past life of the inspired Hebrew
                    people. The whole of the Mosaic dispensation, the whole of the Jewish economy,
                    with its prophecy, priesthood, and kingship, is recognized as summed up in the
                    person and work of Christ. The Old Testament, which without Christ is but a
                    collection of sacred books written at different times and in various manners, is
                    regarded when looked at through Christ as an harmonious whole of anticipatory
                    revelation. Indeed, one of the chief differences which critical apologetic finds
                    between the Old Testament and other so-called sacred books is, that Christ is at
                    the end of the Old Testament, and that no other scriptures have such a
                    conclusion. But all this implies that Christianity is a development from
                    Judaism, and that our idea of the one will be modified by our conception of the
                    other. Those who refuse to admit that Judaism is more than one of the many
                    natural religions of mankind can. hardly admit the supernatural character of
                    Christianity, or regard it in any other light than as the outcome, perhaps the
                    highest outcome possible, of that side in man’s nature which has been called by
                    some the religious faculty. Those who attempt to derive Mosaic institutions from
                    Egypt, who seek the basis of Hebrew prophecy in epileptic tendencies, and see
                    nothing in the theocratic idea which was not suggested by ordinary kingship,
                    cannot have much difficulty in analyzing Christianity into the natural
                    development of the religious sentiment aided by a somewhat extravagant
                    enthusiasm. Those, on the other hand, who find it impossible to accept the
                    assumptions, and to get over the innumerable difficulties attending the
                    naturalist theory of the Old Testament and of the history of the Hebrew people,
                    find in Christianity something different in kind as well as in degree from all
                    natural religions. Modern criticism even of the negative kind often indirectly
                    supports the supernaturalist theory of the Old Testament and of Christianity,
                    for its fundamental maxim, that waters cannot rise higher than their source, has
                    proved the impossibility of explaining away Old Testament institutions and New
                    Testament truths into merely the natural outcome of the religious faculties of a
                    peculiar people. It has proved that the Old Testament religion contains
                    materials which were not got from the intercourse of the Jews with other
                    nations, and which did not arise naturally from the geographical position or the
                    ethnographical characteristics of the Hebrew people. It has shown that the Old
                    Testament religion was not a natural stream gathered from many a smaller rill,
                    but came forth gushing, like the water of Hebrew history, from the Rock which
                    contained it; and in doing so it has given its testimony to the altogether
                    unique and supernatural character of Christianity.</p>
                <p>The relation of Jesus to His contemporaries, and of His disciples and their
                    writings to the founders of the various ethnic religions, is another point
                    whence proceed various views of the nature of Christianity. The old deist view,
                    adopted and intensified by the Encyclopedists, that Jesus was a charlatan, that
                    His disciples were partly cheats and partly dupes, and that Christianity was
                    founded in fraud and perpetuated by deceit, has to all intents and purposes
                    disappeared. But many believe that Christianity is only one of the many
                    religions which are all of them true though none of them contain the whole
                    truth. The modern notion of evolution has been called in to enforce this view,
                    and Christianity is explained to be the most perfect development yet reached by
                    the religious spirit of mankind; while the character of Jesus and the New
                    Testament writings are explained on the same principle. On theories of this kind
                    Christianity is the prcduction of the natural forces of the period which gave
                    birth to it, and· contains nothing which cannot be traced back to the
                    circumstances of the time, and the conditions of humanity. All such theories
                    commonly rest on the general principle that the supernatural is impossible, and
                    that whatever involves a miracle is <hi rend="italic">tpso facto</hi>
                    incredible, and then proceed by means of some special principle to explain the
                    presence of facts which seem to imply the supernatural. (See article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Apologetics.)</hi> These principles are used to explain not so
                    much the origin of Christianity itself as the origin of the Christian writings
                    of the New Testament, and the production of the scheme of doctrine and morals
                    therein <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n703/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0703-0690"/> contained. Perhaps the most ingenious of these
                    theories is that cluster which has been produced by the writers of the Tübingen
                    school, who have suggested the general method which has been almost universally
                    followed by anti-supernaturalist writers. The method is by an ingenious negative
                    criticism to separate between the original elements of Christianity as these
                    were present in the mind of Jesus and communicated by Him to His disciples, and
                    those elements which were afterwards added by more philosophical adherents, and
                    to explain how, out of the conflict between the two opposite tendencies of
                    Judaism and antiJudaism, the various and conflicting elements at last settled
                    into a somewhat harmonious whole. By this ingenious method Jesus is reduced to
                    the position of a Jewish rabbi, not much more noticeable than some of his
                    contemporaries, and Christianity is not the religion of Jesus, but what grew out
                    of that religion when it was subjected to the influences of Roman civilization,
                    Greek philosophy, and Eastern theosophy. Such theories are unsupported by
                    external, and rest confessedly on internal evidence. The weakness of internal
                    evidence when unsupported by external is well known, atíd in this case the
                    internal evidence is anything but strong. There are many serious objections to
                    be taken to the Tübingen hypotheses (see article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bible)</hi> merely as hypotheses, and these difficulties are so great that it
                    is almost evident the hypotheses would never have been put forward unless the
                    anti-supernaturalist idea of Christianity had been taken for granted at the
                    outset. There can be little doubt that if the supernatural be admitted these
                    various hypotheses, while they suggest some difficulties which have not yet been
                    solved, will be found to be at variance with the plain results both of external
                    and internal evidence.</p>
                <p>On the other hand those who believe in the supernatural take a different view of
                    the relation of Jesus to His contemporaries. He was no mere Jewish rabbi, but
                    spake as never man spake, and did what never man did. He was the manifestation
                    of God, and came to give by His presence, person, and work, as well as by what
                    He said, the full revelation of God. He was while on earth the centre of the
                    world’s history, to whom all had looked forward, to whom all look back. And
                    Christianity is not the simple product of the contemporary philosophical and
                    religious systems, but is the embodiment of the unique appearance and work of
                    Christ.</p>
                <p>The relation in which Christianity stands to the future is also a basis on which
                    various views of its nature have been rested, according to the theory of the
                    peculiar powers of diffusion and propagation which it is supposed to possess.
                    Anti-supematuralists consider Christianity to be merely a moral force, acting
                    through mere moral enlightenment; but this has already been sufficiently dwelt
                    upon. There are, however, what may be called two Christian views of the <hi
                    rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">propagandi</hi> of Christianity, which
                    produce two of the real nature of Christianity itself. This difference of view
                    is best seen in the variety of answers given to the question how Christianity
                    subsisted after the departure of Christ, and how it subsists now from age to
                    age, a more or less compact organic life in the world. The various answers given
                    may be roughly placed in two classes as they lay stress on the spiritual or the
                    mechanical side of the process, and enlarge on the spiritual or the mechanical
                    influences at work. Those who take what may be called the spiritual view of
                    Christianity hold that it was sustained after the ascension of Christ by the
                    mission and work of the Holy Spirit, whose presence and influence enable it to
                    go on from age to age, spreading in the world and developing according to the
                    laws of its growth. And they believe that as the chief result of Christ’s work
                    consisted in a change of moral relation between God and those for whom Christ
                    died, the spread and permauence of Christianity is purely moral, and manifests
                    itself mainly in a change of wilL Of course all this takes place in special ways
                    and by appropriate means. These means are called the means of grace, and are
                    usually held to be the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer; but it is always to be
                    understood that all such means are secondary or subordinate, and that the
                    primary means of grace is the Holy Spirit, who works through these subordinate
                    means, but may and does work in other ways. It is always understood that the
                    operations of the Spirit cannot be limited to special actions nor confined by
                    mechanical laws. On the other hand those who look at Christianity from what may
                    be called the mechanical point of view are inclined to lay stress upon the means
                    by which the Spirit works. They do not ignore the mission of the Holy Ghost nor
                    His work, but are apt to say that He works only in certain prescribed ways, and
                    through one set of means, and the tendency is to lay almost exclusive stress on
                    one set of subordinate means—the Sacraments, and to represent that the
                    persistence and spread of Christianity depend upon the constancy and correctness
                    of sacramental ceremonies.</p>
                <p>These opposite views of the nature of Christianity depend upon differences of
                    dogmatic conception which may be briefly indicated. All through the one view, a
                    change in the relationship between God’s will and man’s will is held to be the
                    fundamental result which flows from the work of Christ. All through the other
                    view man’s nature rather than man’s will is considered, and the result of
                    Christ’s work is looked on rather as a process within human nature than as a
                    change in moral relations between man and God. In this way the progress of
                    Christianity is looked on as the gradual semi-physical impregnation of human
                    nature by the nature of Christ, a prolongation of the Incarnation rather than a
                    development of the consequences of the finished work of Christ, to be produced
                    by keeping Christ incarnate in the sacrifice of the Mass and impregnating
                    mankind by means of Transubstantiation in the Sacrament of the altar. The one
                    view is the view of churches which have accepted the Reformation, the other is
                    that of churches which have not.</p>
                <p>These various conceptions of Christianity may be further illustrated by the views
                    which are held by the partisans of each concerning the relations between
                    Christianity and the Bible. The Bible and Christianity cannot be separated, but
                    different opinions may be and have been held about the relation in which the two
                    stand to each other. On the one hand naturalists, and those who take the
                    mechanical view of Christianity, are inclined to regard the Bible chiefly as a
                    compendium of abstract truths, which may be condensed into dogmas and summarized
                    in creeds; while those who take the spiritual view of Christianity regard the
                    Bible as the medium which reveals God and His gracious deab'ngs personally to
                    the believing reader or hearer. To the one the Bible is a quarry of doctrines to
                    be rationally criticized or implicitly accepted when once stamped as genuine by
                    the church, to the other it is above all things a means of grace which the most
                    ignorant can use and profit by. To the naturalist the Bible has been formed by
                    the church, it is simply the natural production of the minds of those who formed
                    the old Jewish and the early Christian communities, and grew to be what it is
                    without the aid of superhuman intervention. To those who have adopted a
                    mechanical view of Christianity the Bible is also the product of the church, but
                    of the supernatural power in the church, and has grown to be what it is because
                    it has been sanctioned by the church. To those who take the spiritual view of
                    the nature of Christianity, the Bible, on the other hand, is and always has been
                    the formative power in the church and that round which the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0704-0691"/> church gathers itself, for it is the presence of
                    God speaking to His people.</p>
                <p>Both naturalists and those who hold a mechanical theory of Christianity agree in
                    holding that there is an external sort of development in the Bible, and that the
                    church can go beyond the Bible, whereas those who hold the spiritual view of
                    Christianity deny both these positions. Naturalists hold that one part of the
                    Bible is beyond the other, and since the Bible is simply the outcome of man’s
                    religious thoughts and feelings in certain ages and places, they believe that
                    men now may give utterance to thoughts and sentiments which in depth of feeling
                    and insight may surpass those contained in the Bible. The Tübingen theologians,
                    for example, believe that the New Testament is a series of deposits of religious
                    truth, in which the truths taught by Jesus are supplemented by the teachings of
                    His disciples, by the lessons of Paul, and by the theories of Christians
                    educated in the philosophy of Greece; while Dr Newman considers that the church,
                    in virtue of a supernatural gift bestowed upon her, can add to the doctrines
                    contained in the Bible according to certain well-defined lines of development.
                    On the other hand those who hold the spiritual view of Christianity believe that
                    the church can never go beyond the Bible, and that progress in Christian
                    theology means greater insight into the manifestation of God in the Bible and
                    greater power to interpret the supernatural facts and forces made known
                    therein.</p>
                <p>The various theories differ also in the closeness of connection which they think
                    subsists between Christianity and the Bible. The naturalist and those who put
                    the church above the Bible as the formative power in Christianity both make the
                    relation between Christianity and the Bible a purely intellectual one, whereas
                    those who hold by the spiritual view make the Bible a means of grace and not
                    merely the quarry whence to hew theological dogmas. But the naturalist agrees
                    with spiritual Christians in maintaining the authoritative character of the
                    Bible, while the mechanical Christian sets the Bible aside when it does not
                    agree with church tradition. With the naturalist, however, the Bible is
                    authoritative because it is the only set of documents which tell him about
                    Christianity in its primitive state. It is authoritative because it is the only
                    witness to the historical facts of Christianity, not because it is to be a law
                    to him. To the spiritual Christian, on the other hand, the Bible is
                    authoritative because it is a revelation of those spiritual forces and a record
                    of those spiritual events on which Christianity still depends, and which teach
                    him the way of salvation.</p>
                <p>To sum up, then, Christianity claims to be no mere social revolution or natural
                    step in the march of human progress. It is a religion whose sources are not to
                    be found within man’s nature but outside of it in the saving revelation of God
                    in Christ, and Jesus is thus the author and giver of an eternal life which
                    spreads itself and is maintained, not by mechanical contrivance, but by the
                    living Spirit of God entering into human history, and building on the basis of
                    reconciliation a kingdom of God which is both human and divine, and which comes
                    and comes again and again in wave after wave of developing completion until the
                    will of God is done on earth as in heaven.</p>
                <p>Christianity began its career in the world at a time singularly propitious both
                    politically, socially, and religiously for the advent of a new universal and
                    spiritual religion.</p>
                <p>Even apart from the entrance of Christianity the reign of Augustus over the whole
                    Roman empire was an epoch-making period. Never before had the various races of
                    mankind been united under one universal empire which promised to be permanent.
                    For the Roman power was different from the governments of Asiatic adventurers
                    and Greek warriors. Where Rome planted her foot was fated to remain Roman. The
                    ancient Asiatic empires had been for the most part the creation of victorious
                    generals, and had been kept in life only by a tolerably rapid succession of
                    dynasties; their power seemed to depend on the character of the individual
                    ruler. And the empire of Alexander, while more enduring, was not coherent. But
                    from the beginning of her conquests the spirit of Rome herself seemed always to
                    be greater than the vigour and ability of her generals and rulers, and she alone
                    of empires seemed to be indifferent to the precarious stability of government
                    ensured by regular dynastic succession. “The Romans conquered like savages, but
                    ruled like philosophic statesmen, till, from the Euphrates to the Atlantic, from
                    the shores of Britain and the borders of the German forests to the sands of the
                    African desert, the whole Western world was consolidated into one great
                    commonwealth, united by bonds of law and government, by facilities of
                    communication and commerce, and by the general dissemination of the Greek and
                    Latin languages.” The world had a centre as it never had before, and the golden
                    threads of well-established government connected all the world with Rome. Roads
                    were made connecting Rome with the remotest countries, and a system of posts
                    established which provided for easy communication with the capital. Military
                    colonies carried Roman usages and manners, civilization and privileges, to the
                    remotest corners of the empire. Magnificent cities were built in such outlying
                    dependencies as Britain, Gaul, and Germany. The arts and civilization were
                    gradually extending their dominion and subjugating the most distant and most
                    desolate places. To all this Augustus added a more perfectly devised
                    centralization which made the empire a more compact whole, so that any new
                    influence made its throbs felt from centre to extremities in a wonderfully short
                    time. The world was made ready for the furtherance of the spread of opinions as
                    it had never been before, and for becoming spell-bound by invisible spiritual
                    laws like those which Christian morality weaves around its disciples. The time
                    of Augustus, if it was the beginning of the decline and fall of the Roman empire
                    as a visible earthly dominion, was also the beginning of its permanent
                    establishment on earth in a purely invisible way, when its policy,
                    statesmanship, and legislation were to pass into all the nations of the earth
                    and become part of their lives so long as the world endured.</p>
                <p>Socially, too, the world was wonderfully ripe for the entrance and spread of a
                    universal religion. Slavery it is true flourished, and there were conquerors and
                    conquered, privileged and unprivileged classes. But the beginning had already
                    been made of that lavish distribution of Roman citizenship which laid the
                    foundation of a common political life throughout the empire.</p>
                <p>The religious character of the times was also marvellously adapted for furthering
                    the advance of Christianity. The old national creeds were fast disappearing, and
                    were being submerged in the vast cosmopolitan religion of Rome. It was the wise
                    custom of conquering Rome to do nothing to disturb the religions of the peoples
                    subdued by her armies, and commonly the principal deities of the conquered
                    nations were added to the overcrowded pantheon of Rome. This religious tolerance
                    or indifference gradually began to eat the heart out of paganism, and all over
                    the civilized world the pagan creeds sat lightly on their worshippers. The
                    various deities were looked on as interchangeable manifestations of a supreme
                    fate-power who reigned alone in the invisible world, while in this visible earth
                    the genius of Rome seemed to be the one object of worship. The old national
                    religions with their well-defined outlines and limits were being gradually
                    effaced, and men were longing for some religion which, while it had the
                    universal character which the times required, should have more individuality and
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n705/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0705-0692"/> personal power in it than were supplied by the
                    thoughts of a supreme spiritual fate, or by the mere materialist conception of
                    the genius of Rome. And all this bred a thirst for information about sacred
                    things which was unknown in earlier times. The claims of conflicting religions
                    were philosophically discussed, and amid all the gross materialism of the period
                    there were longings for some deeper, truer religion than any they had known.
                    These longings were further stimulated by the gradual but almost universal
                    advance of new religious ideas coming from the far East, which was then regarded
                    as the cradle of science and philosophy. In the 5th century before our era the
                    vast Buddhist movement had overspread all the East from Thibet to Ceylon, and
                    the Greek and Roman conquests in Asia brought Europe within the intoxicating
                    influence of its subtle religious ideas. This strange Eastern theosophy, which
                    during the first four centuries of our era is known by the name of Gnosticism,
                    had a most powerful influence on the old religions of the West, which seemed to
                    dissolve under its touch. Everywhere in the art and literature of the period we
                    find its prevalence in the West during the age of Augustus and his successors.
                    It insensibly undermined the beauteous sensuous mythology of Greece and the
                    harder sterner religion of Rome, and substituted for them a religion in which,
                    if fear was the prevailing emotion, worshippers still felt that there was more
                    spirituality and greater claims to universality than their old national
                    religions could give. And thus the gradual defacement of old religious outlines,
                    the stimulation of strange cravings to know the mysteries of nature and of
                    worship, and the longing for rest in a universal religion of deliverance
                    prepared the world for the coming and spread of the religion of Jesus
                    Christ.</p>
                <p>The great problem Christianity had to face and to solve was one of no ordinary
                    difficulty, and one involving a number of side issues which greatly perplexed
                    the early church. The practical side of the problem as it met the early
                    Christians may be put thus :—How could Christianity, which was rooted in
                    Judaism, be at the same time a religion equally open to Jew and Gentile; how
                    could the exclusiveness of Judaism and the utter want of exclusiveness in
                    Christianity be reconciled with each other? And the solution of this problem
                    brought the early Christians into conflicts of a special kind with the
                    government and philosophy of the times.</p>
                <p>When Jesus proclaimed His mission, and when He sent forth His disciples on
                    preaching tours to make known himself and His work, we find the phrase “kingdom
                    of heaven” perpetually occurring; and it was this phrase and what it suggested
                    that brought the early Christians face to face with the great problem they had
                    to solve. When Jesus announced that the kingdom of God was at hand, His message
                    was quite intelligible to His Jewish audiences. The phrase was sacred and
                    familiar, and their thoughts went back at once to the old theocracy of Israel.
                    And when after the death and ascension of our Lord, His Jewish believers got a
                    truer and deeper insight into the meaning of the expression, still the idea it
                    conveyed bound Christianity, with bands that could not be untied, to Judaism,
                    the Old Testament Scriptures, the miraculous life of the J ewish nation, and the
                    ideal Israel long expected and long announced. Throughout the Old Testament
                    Scriptures we find three ideas connected with the thought of the kingdom of God.
                    It implied first and primarily the share in the inheritance in the land which
                    the Lord gave to His people and to their children; and then it implied security
                    in this possession, deliverance from Egypt and a succession of enemies, and,
                    lastly, the possession of an inward spring of covenant life, which guaranteed
                    them both salvation and possession, These three things were the historical and
                    material basis on which rested the whole spiritual and prophetic superstructure
                    of the ideal kingdom of God, which lay enshrined in the heart of every devout
                    Hebrew. When our Lord by His preaching, by His life, death, and rising again,
                    and by His mission of the Holy Spirit, gave new meanings to these thoughts, He
                    only widened, deepened, spiritualized, and gave personal point and application
                    to what the prophets and holy men of old had already declared. And when He and
                    His apostles guided by His Spirit taught His early followers that His kingdom of
                    God meant possession of the spiritual blessings of God’s grace, and deliverance
                    from sin, death, and Satan, and a life of adopted sonship which guaranteed them
                    in all these blessings, devout Jews could feel that now they were only learning
                    what the prophets had taught, and they rejoiced in the thoroughgoing oneness
                    which existed between the kingdom of God as proclaimed in the Old Testament and
                    the kingdom of heaven which Jesus preached. But if it was a <hi rend="italic"
                    >sine qua non</hi> that Christianity should spring out of the Old Testament
                    Scriptures and be identical in all essentials with the Old Testament church, it
                    was no less necessary that it should be now a religion for Gentiles as well as
                    Jews, and here the difficulty emerged. Could the old Jewish church be carried
                    over into the Christian church if all that outwardly distinguished it were
                    abolished? Could the continuity be preserved if the ceremonies and restrictions
                    which made up the visible life of the Old Testament worship were no longer to be
                    observed? Would not the Old Testament church be entirely destroyed and the
                    continuity between it and the New Testament church be done away with if the Old
                    Testament ceremonial law was abandoned? So long as the members of the Christian
                    church were Jews only or Gentiles who had become proselytes the difficulty was
                    not felt. The Christians had not openly broken with Judaism, and were
                    acknowledged even by their Jewish opponents to be a Jewish sect,—a sect
                    everywhere spoken against it is true, but still a sect just as the Sadducees
                    were a sect. But whenever Gentiles who were not proselytes became believers then
                    a fierce struggle arose between those who thought that the continuity between
                    the Old Testament and Christianity could not be kept up unless it were visibly
                    perpetuated in those observances which distinguished the Jewish religion from
                    all others, and those who were contented with a continuity which was more of the
                    spirit than of the letter and the form. The practical shape which the struggle
                    at first assumed was, whether Gentiles could be Christians without first
                    becoming proselytes, and whether Jewish Christians mustcease to be believers if
                    they associated with Gentiles who had not been circumcised, and had not rendered
                    themselves servants to the law of Moses. To understand the difficulty rightly it
                    should be remembered that when the difficulty arose the New Testament canon was
                    not in existence, and the (⅛urch had to be guided mainly by the Old Testament
                    Scriptures and the memory of Jesus preserved by the apostles. In spite of what
                    has been advanced by critics of the Tübingen school, it seems evident that the
                    apostles one and all in their letters to the church faithfully followed out the
                    solution which Christ’s discourses gave. In these discourses our Lord carefully
                    distinguished between the permanent and the temporary elements in the Old
                    Testament dispensation, and assumed that His office as Messiah gave him full
                    authority to abolish or alter the latter. He also pointed out that the permanent
                    parts of the Mosaic economy were the various modes of expressing that love to
                    God and to man which He declared to be the sum of the law and the prophets.
                    These were unalterable, but any change might be made in the subordinate and
                    temporary elements, if only this great principle was more fully and better
                    expressed by the change. This leading thought Christ used <pb break="no"

                    of Jesus carried out the principles of their Master. There is not a trace in the
                    epistles of Peter, James, and John of the idea that salvation and entrance into
                    the kingdom of God could only be obtained by those who were first Jews and then
                    Christians. There is no statement, for example, that Gentiles must be
                    circumcised before they can be baptized. On the contrary, James speaks of the
                    perfect law of liberty, and Peter and John have expressions equally strong.
                    Within the writings of the apostolic circle everything goes to show that the
                    church was taught from the beginning that Christianity was not to be confined
                    within the limits of natural or adopted Jewish nationality.</p>
                <p>But when we turn to the Acts of the Apostles, and to the epistles of Paul,
                    especially to the Epistle to the Galatians, we find that the apostolic solution
                    of the difficulty was not acceptable to the early Jewish Christians, and was not
                    accepted by many of them. We even find that the practice of members of the
                    apostolic circle was not always in accordance with the principles which they had
                    enounced in accordance with the guidance of the Holy Spirit. There was a strong
                    ultra-Je wish party in the early Christian church, which was able in some
                    measure to control the conduct of the apostles themselves. And this was what was
                    to be expected. Men who had been trained in Judaism, where the connection
                    between religion and politics was so very close, whose religious thoughts were
                    always expressed in outward ordinances, could scarcely avoid insisting upon some
                    visible connection between Judaism and Christianity. They could not see that
                    Christianity was the completion of Judaism if the practices of the Mosaic
                    economy were not kept up. Thus we find at least two parties, a Judaizing and a
                    Gentile party, in the early church. At first the Jewish party was so strong as
                    to force a compromise upon the leaders of the Gentile church, and require that
                    every Gentile Christian should at least become a proselyte of the gate by
                    abstaining from things offered to idols, from things strangled, from blood, and
                    from <hi rend="italic">πopvda</hi> or a breach of the Old Testament regulation
                    about marriage; and it is probable that Jewish Christians were required to keep
                    up all the practices of the Jewish religion and more especially to share in the
                    sacrificial worship of the temple. Afterwards this Jewish party grew weaker, and
                    it became the universal belief in the early church that Christians born Jews did
                    not need to observe the ceremonial law of Moses or to share in the
                    temple-worship, and that Christians born Gentiles did not require to show, by
                    keeping certain Jewish regulations, that they were believers in a creed which
                    was a development of Old Testament ideas. The capture of Jerusalem and the
                    destruction of the temple separated the Christian Jews who were of the sect of
                    the Pharisees from their fellow Christians, and the severe persecution of Jewish
                    religion and rites which followed the revolt under Bar Cochba sent most of them
                    over into the ranks of the Essenes, and thus the Christian church was left in
                    peace to reconcile its intimate connection with Judaism with its abandonment of
                    Jewish ritual on the principles of Christian liberty. But in solving the problem
                    the early Christian church was scarcely true to the principles of its Master. In
                    order to defend more strenuously their separation from Judaism, it was customary
                    for the fathers of the church to look at Christianity as supplying in detail all
                    that Judaism possessed, and this led them almost as far from the fundamental
                    principles of continuity laid down by Christ as the old Judaizers had gone. They
                    required a new law to set over against the old law of Moses, a new service to
                    take the place of the temple service of the Old Testament, a new daily
                    sacrifice, “the new law’s new oblation” instead of the sacrifices of Moses, a
                    new ritual which after it had gradually grown complex enough was found to
                    correspond bit by bit with the ritual of Jerusalem, and a new priesthood whose
                    functions were to be not unlike the duties of the sons of Aaron. In church
                    traditions, a ritual of worship, and a service of priests, they found the proof
                    of their relation to the religion of the Old Testament, and forgetting the
                    unseen continuity of sameness of spiritual principle, found a consolation in a
                    fancied similarity in external routine of worship. In this way early
                    Christianity succeeded and failed in realizing to herself the real continuity
                    between the Old Testament and the New Testament kingdoms of God.</p>
                <p>But if early Christianity found it difficult to reconcile the New Testament idea
                    of the kingdom of God with the Old Testament conception, it was no less troubled
                    when it came to work out this New Testament thought on the broad basis prepared
                    for it by the existence and character of the Roman empire. There were
                    difficulties without as well as difficulties within. Christians are men with
                    bodies as well as souls, and Christian ideas tend to take sensible shape,
                    sometimes false and sometimes true. No sooner had Christianity shaken off its
                    Jewish thraldom than it seemed eager to betake itself to a new slavery—eager to
                    lay down the kingdom of God on lines already furnished by the government of
                    pagan Rome, or the creeds of pagan philosophy. At all events we can trace in
                    early Christianity the workings of two subtle influences, the one of which
                    strove to reduce the kingdom of God to a material and earthly empire, while the
                    other would have dissolved it into a system of philosophy. The ecclesiastical
                    empire of the Middle Ages and the scholastic theology overthrown at the Great
                    Reformation were slowly built up by principles which Christianity almost
                    unconsciously assumed during her long struggle with pagan Rome and with pagan
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>The relation of Rome to Christianity was very peculiar. Both aimed at world-wide
                    dominion, and the one was the very incarnation of polytheism, while the other
                    forbade in the sternest terms all idolatrous worship. The Christians, while
                    citizens of the great empire which ruled the world, found the idolatry which
                    they hated and denounced interwoven inextricably with the law of the land,
                    possession of property, social observances, and public ceremonies. And
                    Christianity had scarcely emerged from Palestine when it found itself engaged in
                    a hand to hand struggle with the imperial power of Rome herself.</p>
                <p>The uniform policy of Rome was to respect the laws and the religion of the
                    conquered peoples who came under her dominion. The Roman system of
                    jurisprudence, it is true, was extended to all parts of the empire, and capital
                    offences were generally tried according to Roman law before Roman tribunals;
                    but, generally speaking, conquered nations lived under their own laws and were
                    allowed to practise their own religions. By this wise policy Rome not only
                    avoided stirring up religious wars, but contrived to be the religious and legal
                    as well as political centre of all the conquered tribes. In one way only was the
                    religion of the conquered interfered with, when the worship of the emperor was
                    forced upon all his subjects. Whatever motives of policy urged this haughty
                    indifference to all creeds, and this easy toleration of every form of pagan
                    faith, they were in reality founded on an intense belief in the eternity ιnd
                    almost divinity of Rome itself. Rome had remained for ages and seemed likely to
                    endure the Eternal City, and when all other feelings of reverence had fled, the
                    heart of the genuine Roman was fuU of awe for the majesty and might of
                    perenduring Rome. It was no mere servile adulation which led to the deification
                    of the emperors. The emperor was God, and divine honours were paid to him
                    because he was the visible symbol of imperial Rome making manifest its <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0707-0694"/> power and permanence. And it was a real feeling
                    of worship that raised in every house the altar to the <hi rend="italic">divus
                    imperator,</hi> and spread over the whole of the Roman empire, jostling aside
                    its myriad creeds, the one faith in Rome, in its power, its eternity, and its
                    mysterious strength. It was in this way that paganism and Rome became almost
                    synonymous, and that Christianity and Rome were foes from the first.</p>
                <p>Rome never treated Christianity as other religions were treated. Gibbon tells us
                    that the Romans were already somewhat intolerant of Judaism and extended their
                    intolerance to the new Jewish sect, somewhat more intractable than their
                    neighbours, which Christians were supposed to be. He also shows that Christians
                    who had neither temples nor synagogues were supposed to be atheists, and so
                    beyond the pale of toleration, and that the secret assemblies of Christians were
                    supposed to have a hostile political meaning. But something more is required to
                    explain the uncompromising hostility of Rome, especially when we find that
                    latterly that hostility was strongest under the greatest and noblest emperors.
                    Since Roman toleration was founded on public policy, there was an end of it with
                    regard to a religion which was of no use in curbing a conquered people. ∙ The
                    Christian religion was <hi rend="italic">nova</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >illidta</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it was not a national religion nor a
                    recognized faith, and was a new and unaccountable phenomenon which might be, and
                    most probably was, fraught with danger to the sacred state. We find, too, in
                    many of Rome’s ablest statesmen a strange instinctive dread of Christianity.
                    They made inquiries about it and were watchful of it, and yet could get no real
                    insight into it. They could not help noticing how in spite of edicts and
                    persecutions Christianity was rapidly increasing; they saw how, with a daring
                    which to them was simply inexplicable, it was nothing loath to match itself
                    against the power of Rome. To the ears of these dark and jealous emperors came
                    tidings of Christianity copying the jurisdic tion of Rome in its ecclesiastical
                    divisions of the land, of its success in the large towns in the empire, of its
                    entrance into the army. They saw, too, what Constantine was the first to make
                    use of, that Christianity acted in such a way upon the physical frame that
                    Christian soldiers were stronger and braver than their fellowS, and man for man
                    and battalion for battalion were more than a match for the pagans. Above all,
                    they heard rumours of a new kingdom which the Christians were to establish, of
                    confidently expressed hopes that the kingdom would soon come, and of openly
                    asserted resolutions and prophecies that it would be established on the ruins of
                    Rome itself. And, on the side of the Christians, Tertullian was ready to boast
                    that in a few years the Christian empire had more extensive boundaries than the
                    Roman, and that Christian soldiers had penetrated and triumphed in regions where
                    the Roman arms were unknown or defied. Christian martyrs marching to the arena
                    confidently predicted the speedy overthrow of the cruel paganism which sent them
                    there. As the struggle deepened, too, there entered a distinctly new element on
                    the Christian side, and the contest became not merely one of the true religion
                    against a false paganism and a pagan and persecuting state; it became a battle
                    between two kingdoms. The Christian bishop and the Roman governor were two rival
                    authorities, viceroys in two warring empires; and the saints would inherit the
                    earth, when the church ruled instead of Rome as the mistress of the world.
                    During the long struggle between Rome and Christianity we see this subtle
                    influence entering into and withering the true spiritual conception of the
                    kingdom of God, until at last it is almost transformed into an earthly empire.
                    St Augustine has seized on and represented this idea with sublime dramatic power
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Civitas</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">peregrinatione</hi><hi rend="italic">per terras,</hi> where the
                    <hi rend="italic">Civitas</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei,</hi> or the church, is set
                    over against the <hi rend="italic">Civitas Terrena,</hi> or state; and where the
                    kingdom of God, however grandly pictured, is almost as material, earthly, and
                    sensible as the empire of pagan Rome. From this fatal influence have come all
                    the attempts to realize the universality and catholicity of the church in a
                    purely external or visible way, and the failure to understand how Christianity
                    may be all-embracing without <hi rend="italic">visibly</hi> covering and
                    controlling the earth.</p>
                <p>In her contest with Rome Christianity succeeded in realizing and giving
                    expression to her claim to universal dominion, but in Rome’s overthrow she
                    inflicted an almost fatal wound on herself when she was unconsciously induced to
                    take the government of a pagan empire as her model for the organization of a
                    spiritual kingdom.</p>
                <p>In the contest which Christianity had to maintain with pagan philosophy the early
                    Christians were compelled to work out another side of the great problem which
                    confronted the early church—the relation of the Old Testament to the New
                    Testament kingdom of God. Philosophy when engaged upon topics which belong to
                    Christianity is always easily distinguished by the way in which it puts its
                    questions. The question with philosophy, for example, is, What is Sin? How can
                    its existence be explained? But the Christian question is: How can I get rid of
                    sin? To the philosopher sin is food for meditation, but to the Christian it is
                    something to be escaped from. Outside Christianity there were many schools of
                    thinkers who busied themselves with speculations about the origin and nature of
                    sin, death, God, judgment, holiness, and so on, and there were many philosophers
                    who were quite willing to take help from the Hebrew Scriptures in their
                    difficulties. It was always a matter of earnest endeavour on the part of
                    Christian theologians to make it clear that Christianity was not a philosophy to
                    be discussed but a life to be lived; but when they were called, by the views of
                    some of the Gnostics, to explain their relation to the Old Testament Scriptures
                    and to the New Testament canon, we find them unable to realize the full
                    significance of the problem. To the early Christians the Old Testament was
                    pre-eminently the scripture, it was in their possession before the New
                    Testament, and the New Testament canon was gradually formed as one after another
                    of the writings which compose it were found worthy of a place beside the Old
                    Testament Scriptures. Certain of the Gnostic sects made use of the facts,
                    statements, and truths contained in the Scriptures in their theories of creation
                    and redemption, of man, sin, and salvation; and Christian theologians were
                    compelled to refute the Gnostics by setting forth over against the false
                    doctrines what they held to be the truths concerning the matters taught. In this
                    way and gradually there grew up an intellectual system of Christian truth,
                    embodied in the creeds of the church and in the writings of her theologians. The
                    necessity was laid upon Christian theologians to present Christianity
                    intellectually in this way, and oppose a true to the false <hi rend="italic"
                    >γvωσις</hi>; but just as in her contest with Judaism and Rome Christianity
                    insensibly adopted part of the error contended against, so here the struggle
                    against intellectual evil had the result of tending to dissociate Christian life
                    from the Holy Scriptures, and of creating two kingdoms of God—one of life which
                    was to be lived on the lines of the old Roman empire, and one of doctrine which
                    was to be based on the foundations of Greek philosophy. This latter tendency did
                    not appear in the church until the early Jewish element had almost died out. To
                    the Jew Judaism was an historical past which it was not to the Gentile, who
                    could with difficulty think of the church of the Old Testament as a spiritual
                    organization into which he was actually brought by regeneration. To <pb

                    Scriptures generally did not so much mean a series of commandments or
                    prescriptions as a mode of life. No doubt when they thought of the Old Testament
                    their minds were full of laws and commandments, but still the most prominent
                    idea was that their fathers had <hi rend="italic">lived</hi> and had been
                    enjoined to live a particular mode of life. To the Jew the Old Testament was the
                    past covenant life of his fathers in which he might share, and it showed him God
                    much more as the covenant God with whom Israel had lived in communion than as a
                    mere Lawgiver. But it was more difficult for the Gentile to feel this. He could
                    not easily feel that the covenant life described in the Old Testament was the
                    life into which Christ had brought him, and he felt as much outside of it as the
                    Jew felt within it. And so to him the Old Testament was not so much a haven of
                    religious fellowship as a series of commandments which he might understand and
                    at least could obey. When the Gnostics drew false inferences from statements in
                    the Old Testament, and when the church theologians corrected these in creeds,
                    this forced making of creeds intensified the tendency to look at the Bible—Old
                    Testament and New Testament—rather as a storehouse of theological weapons, than
                    as the medium of personal intercourse between a covenant God and His people. One
                    of the main characteristics of the Biblical idea of the kingdom of God was
                    lost—the thought of personal intercourse with the King through His word realized
                    in an act of personal trust, and the idea of faith lost its sense of trust with
                    personal communion and took the character of assent to intellectual truths. But
                    as the life can never be fed upon abstract truths and their comprehension, and
                    must have some support, Christian life became gradually divorced from any
                    relation to the Word, and became rooted on a system of observances, of which the
                    sacrament of the Supper became the centre. The efforts of the church to realize
                    its relation to the Scriptures were in this way partly successful, because it
                    recognized its duty to set forth the truth of God; but from the way taken the
                    result was to displace Christianity from its position of rest upon the Old
                    Testament church and the Scriptures, and to send it to its own machinery for
                    life and strength.</p>
                <p>One other phase of early Christianity ought to be referred to, as it illustrates
                    another side of the same great problem which was presented for solution. Both in
                    the Old Testament and in the New Testament conceptions of the kingdom of heaven
                    the idea of a new life, or at least of a separate consecrated life, is a
                    conspicuous element. The kingdom of God implies that those who are within the
                    kingdom live a life different from those without. In all ages of Christianity
                    this new and separate life has been an object of speculation, and many various
                    ideas of its true nature have been promulgated. The very conception of a life
                    which is new is sufficient of itself to produce strange conjectures respecting
                    its nature, and in the epistles of St Paul we find evidence that many of the
                    Gentile Christians were disposed to think of the new life of Christianity as one
                    entirely outside of the realm of ordinary moral law. This lawless or immoral
                    tendency was sternly checked in the Christian church, and only gained head in
                    sects outside of it; but traces of the tendency were not infrequent. The
                    function of the Holy Spirit in the church was always made a ground of conjecture
                    concerning the real nature of the new Christian life, and it was from mistaken
                    views of the character of the Spirit’s influence and work that disturbing
                    pietist theories perplexed early Christianity. These pietist theories gained
                    distinctive form and acquired great power in what has been called Montanism, and
                    the church’s efforts to rid herself of this incubus, while well intentioned, led
                    to permanent results by no means satisfactory. One of the chief characteristics
                    of this early pietism was the idea that the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit
                    rendered possible a continuous revelation, and it was believed that the
                    prophetic gift was permanent in the Church. The Montanist prophets presumed to
                    add to revelation, and to overturn ecclesiastical laws and jurisdiction by means
                    of infallible utterances disclosed to them. The practical effect would have been
                    to reduce the organization of Christianity and the intercourse between
                    Christians to a precarious dependence upon the dictates of self-constituted
                    prophets, whose ideas of revelation resembled the heathen soothsaying much more
                    closely than the Old Testament prophecy or the New Testament inspiration, and
                    this led the church to adopt a severer discipline and more monarchical
                    constitution. But this must be afterwards referred to.</p>
                <p>To sum up, then, early Christianity, in working out the problem of its connection
                    with Judaism and the Old Testament Scriptures, achieved success in four great
                    directions, but at the same time made four great mistakes. It insisted rightly
                    on the fact that in order to be a development of Judaism Christians did not
                    require to become Jews first, but it erred in attempting to make Christianity
                    the exact counterpart and rival of Judaism. It insisted rightly that the kingdom
                    of heaven was a kingdom to be set up on earth and so all-embracing as to include
                    the whole earth within its boundaries, but it erred when it conceived it to be a
                    kingdom which in any way could be compared with the Boman empire, and when it
                    began to translate spiritual power and possession into physical and temporal
                    dominion. It insisted, rightly, that the church was the custodier of truth, but
                    it erred when it made faith intellectual assent, when it gave to the Bible an
                    entirely intellectual aspect, and laid the foundations for infallible creeds. It
                    rightly expelled from its midst a false pietist prophecy, which in course of
                    time would have undermined alike scriptural and ecclesiastical authority, but it
                    erred when it conferred on a consecrated privileged caste the sole authority to
                    interpret scripture and regulate ecclesiastical discipline. These attempts and
                    failures in early Christianity have been so often repeated that they may be
                    looked upon as true and false principles ot development inherent in it.</p>
                <p>The history of the world presents no phenomenon so striking as the rise and early
                    progress of Christianity. Originating in a country not remarkable for any
                    political, commercial, or literary influence, emanating from One who occupied a
                    humble sphere in the community amidst which He appeared, and announced in the
                    first instance by men of mean extraction, of no literary culture, and not
                    endowed with any surpassing gifts of intellect,—it nevertheless spread so
                    rapidly that in an incredibly short period of time it had been diffused
                    throughout the whole civilized world, and in the fourth century of its existence
                    became the recognized and established religion of the Roman empire. When it is
                    remembered that this result was achieved not only without the aid of any worldly
                    influence, but in the face of the keenest opposition on the part of all the
                    learning, wealth, wit, and power of the most enlightened and mightiest nations
                    of the earth, the conclusion is strongly forced upon us that a power beyond that
                    of man was concerned in its success, and that its early and unexampled triumphs
                    afford an incontestable proof of its inherent truth and its divine origin. Nor
                    has the rapid advance of Christianity been confined to its earlier years. “After
                    a revolution of fourteen or fifteen centuries that religion is still professed
                    by the nations of Europe, the most distinguished portion of human kind in art
                    and learning as well as in arms. By the industry and zeal of Europeans, it has
                    been widely diffused to the most distant shores of Asia and Africa, and by means
                    of their colonies has been firmly established from Canada to Chili in a land
                    unknown to the ancients.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0709-0696"/> And when we turn to the results of modern
                    missionary enterprise we find a success no less remarkable.</p>
                <p>Historical critics who have no. sympathy with the supernatural elements in
                    Christianity have attempted to account for this wonderful success by natural
                    causes, and have pointed out various circumstances which go far to account for
                    the rapidity of its spread. Sceptical critics of a past generation contented
                    themselves with enumerating various distinct causes combining to produce the
                    effect, while naturalist writers of our own day try rather to show that
                    Christianity was the natural outcome of the intellect of the age which produced
                    it. The great disadvantage attaching to the one mode of criticism is that no
                    parade of causes or conditions of success can ever get rid of the supernatural
                    character of Christianity, for it is always impossible to show that these are
                    the only causes at work, and the retort can be made that these causes are
                    themselves part of the supernatural plan for the introduction and furtherance of
                    Christianity, while the other labours under the necessity either of getting rid
                    of the Christ of history and putting in his place an elaborate poem—an attempt
                    not yet successful—or of reducing the character and work of Jesus to the level
                    of those of Confucius, Buddha, Mahomet, or other founder of a purely naturalist
                    religion. The celebrated five causes of Gibbon are perhaps the best specimen of
                    the one mode of argument, while the elaborate theories of the Tübingen school
                    are certainly the most noteworthy instance of the other. Gibbon thinks that the
                    Christian faith obtained so remarakable a victory over the established religions
                    of the earth because it was effectually favoured and assisted by the five
                    following causes :—1. The inflexible, and if we may use the expression, the
                    intolerant zeal of the Christians, derived it is true from the Jewish religion,
                    but purified from the narrow and unsocial spirit, which instead of inviting had
                    deterred the Gentiles from embracing the law of Moses; 2. The doctrine of a
                    future life improved by every additional circumstance which could give weight
                    and efficacy to that important truth; 3. The miraculous powers ascribed to the
                    primitive church; 4. The pure and austere morals of the Christians; <hi
                    rend="italic">5.</hi> The union and discipline of the Christian republic, which
                    gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart of the Roman
                    empire. It does not need the possession of an anti-Christian spirit to admit
                    that these causes of Gibbon’s may have helped greatly to spread the Christian
                    religion, and indeed the Christian critic has to object not so much to this
                    statement of causes as to the covert insinuation which lurks in the historian’s
                    exposition of their influence. For the question still remains to be put, why was
                    it that Christianity possessed so many characteristics which made it adapted as
                    no other religion was to the needs and capacities of mankind. Still it ought to
                    be observed that when we turn to the pages of the early Christian Apologists,
                    especially to the writings of those of them who were converted to Christianity
                    after having spent many years as intelligent pagans, we find them almost
                    unanimous in declaring that they themselves were attracted to Christianity
                    chiefly by these three reasons :—1. The sublimity and simplicity of the
                    Christian doctrines of God, sin, and salvation; 2. The noble purity of the
                    Christian life, more especially of the life of a Christian woman; and 3. The
                    grandeur of the doctrine of creation contained in the Old Testament Scriptures.
                    The inefficiency of the theories of modern critics who would explain the origin
                    and success of Christianity on purely naturalist grounds has already been
                    discussed under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps">Apologetics.</hi></p>
                <p>The strong and deep influence which Christianity soon began to have even over the
                    lives and opinions of those who were not Christians, is even a more striking
                    testimony to its paramount claims than the rapidity of its spread. The struggle
                    of Christianity with Rome has already been alluded to, but even before Rome gave
                    up the struggle in despair, before the last persecution, and before the triumph
                    under Constantine, the influence of Christianity was making itself felt morally,
                    socially, and politically, while its influence on intellect and science was no
                    less remarkable.</p>
                <p>It is almost impossible for us to realize how powerfully paganism acted upon the
                    general morality of the great peoples of antiquity and encouraged all manner of
                    lawlessness and indecency. In the time of the later republic and of the early
                    empire we have the spectacle of Roman law and philosophy powerless to restrain
                    the brutal and obscene passions of the people excited by the influence of the
                    popular religion, even when they had ceased to regard it as an intelligible
                    creed. All paganism is at bottom a worship of Nature in some form or other, and
                    in all pagan religions the deepest and most awe-inspiring attribute of nature
                    was its power of reproduction. The mystery of birth and becoming was the deepest
                    mystery of nature; it lay at the root of all thoughtful paganism and appeared in
                    various forms, some of a more innocent, others of a most debasing type. To
                    ancient pagan thinkers, as well as to modern men of science, the key to the
                    hidden secret of the origin aud preservation of the universe lay in the mystery
                    of sex. Two energies or agents, one an active and generative, the other a
                    feminine, passive, or susceptible one, were everywhere thought to combine for
                    creative purpose, and heaven and earth, sun and moon, day and night, were
                    believed to co-operate to the production of being. Upon some such basis as this
                    rested almost all the polytheistic worship of the old civilization, and to it
                    may be traced back, stage by stage, the separation of divinity into male and
                    female gods, the deification of distinct powers of nature, and the idealization
                    of man’s own faculties, desires, and lusts, where every power of his
                    understanding was embodied as an object of adoration, and every impulse of his
                    will became an incarnation of deity. But in each and every form of polytheism we
                    find the slime-track of the deification of sex; “there is not a single one of
                    the ancient religions which has not consecrated by some ceremonial rite even the
                    grossest forms of sensual indulgence, while many of them actually elevated
                    prostitution into a solemn service of religion.” The corrupting influence of
                    paganism entered into the very essence of the social life of the Roman at the
                    time when Christianity began its career. The thoughtful reader of contemporary
                    literature cannot fail to observe how day by day the poison instilled itself
                    into every nook and cranny of the social life of the people. “It met him in
                    every incident of hfe, in business, in pleasure, in literature, in politics, in
                    arms, in the theatres, in the streets, in the baths, at the games, in the
                    decorations of his house, in the ornaments and service of his table, in the very
                    conditions of the weather and the physical phenomena of nature. It is not easy
                    to call up as a reality the intending sinner addressing to the deified vice
                    which he contemplates a prayer for the success of his design; the adulteress
                    imploring of Venus the favours of her paramour; the harlot praying for an
                    increase of her sinful gains; the pander begging the protection of the goddess
                    on her shameful trade; the thief praying to Hermes Dolios for aid in his
                    enterprizes, or offering up to him the first-fruits of his plunder; young
                    maidens dedicating their girdles to Athene Apaturia; youths entreating Hercules
                    to expedite the death of a rich uncle. And yet these things and far worse than
                    these meet us over and over again in every writer who has left a picture of
                    Roman manners in the later republic and under the beginning of the empire” <hi
                    rend="italic">(North, Brit. Rev.,</hi> vol. 47). When we turn to the writings of
                    the early Christian Apologists we find them exposing in a scathing way this
                    whole state of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n710/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0710-0697"/> things and contrasting it with that moral law
                    which is written by nature on the heart of men; and the pure lives of the
                    Christians in the midst of this sea of iniquity had a wonderful effect. There is
                    no contrast more wonderful than that which may be drawn between the grandeur of
                    Roman law and the debasement of the ordinary social life of the Roman people;
                    but Roman law was founded much more on economic than on moral foundations. But
                    when Christianity entered into the Roman empire, and when it at last had made
                    head against paganism, the imperial law found an ally in Christian ethics which
                    it had been without during the reign of paganism, and discovered, too, a higher
                    sanction for its precepts than mere economic interests. From the time of
                    Constantine onwards the influence of Christianity on Roman law is remarkable,
                    and always on the side of morality in the highest sense of the term. We find
                    from the Acts of the Apostles that the first organization of Christians was for
                    the better distribution of charity to those in need of it, and one of the
                    earliest results of the political triumph of Christianity in the empire was the
                    promulgation of laws ensuring the protection of the feeble and the helpless. The
                    nineteen years of civil war which preceded the final victory of Constantine had
                    produced the usual scenes of misery, and great numbers of orphan children were
                    thrown upon the world without protection. The influence of the celebrated
                    Lactantius, to whose care Constantine had committed the education of his son
                    Crispus, was able to secure the publication of a law declaring that the emperor
                    was the father of all these children, and that the expense of their upbringing
                    was to be defrayed by the state. At the same time the exposure for sale of
                    unfortunate children was sternly forbidden, and those who so exposed them were
                    condemned to the amphitheatre. The condition of slaves was also greatly
                    ameliorated by the new spirit of Christianity which was then working in society.
                    Slavery was not abolished, but various laws were made restricting the power of
                    slave-holders. The master was deprived of the arbitrary power of life and death.
                    It was ordained that when royal estates were divided the families of slaves of
                    the soil were not to be separated. New laws breathing a more Christian spirit
                    regulated the relation of the sexes. Divorce was made a much more difficult
                    matter. The laws against rape and seduction were made more severe, and adultery
                    became a capital offence. The nameless crime, which was the disgrace of Greek
                    and Roman civilization, was made punishable by death. The making of eunuchs was
                    forbidden, and it was enacted that slaves who had suffered this mutilation might
                    claim their freedom. But the silent revolution which Christianity wrought in
                    social morality cannot be measured by legislation. It is to be traced in a purer
                    literature, a higher moral life, a better public spirit, and, above all, in the
                    establishment of buildings for the reception of strangers <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ξevωves),</hi> alms-houses for the poor <hi rend="italic">(πτωχoτpoφAa),</hi>
                    hospitals and orphan-houses for the sick and the forsaken, and houses of refuge
                    for the support of helpless old men and women. AU these were due to the church,
                    and the bishops vied with each other in the proper exercise of a munificent
                    charity. One of the most celebrated of these establishments was the Basil ias of
                    Basil of Caesarea, where strangers were hospitably entertained, and medical
                    attendance and nursing were provided for those sick of whatever disease. In the
                    Basilias everything was on the most magnificent scale. The physicians of the
                    establishment resided within the walls, and workshops were provided for all the
                    artizans and labourers whose services were needed. The presence of such
                    institutions, and the Christian charity to which they bore witness, must have
                    had a wonderfully restorative influence on the corrupt pagan society in which
                    they were set up. Law and religion became allied, not opposing forces.</p>
                <p>The political influence of Christianity is as marked as its moral power, and had
                    as great an effect upon the paganism into which it was thrown. It was
                    Christianity which gave to the world those two great factors in civü liberty,—a
                    consolidated public opinion and an efficient system of representative
                    government. Gibbon has gone out of his way to sneer at the passive resistance of
                    the early Christians, and has lent the weight of his authority to the idea that
                    a struggle for civil liberty is opposed to the whole tenets of primitive
                    Christianity; but whatever the views of the Christians were on these points, it
                    is plain that Christianity put a new public life into the Roman empire which
                    greatly retarded its final faU. It has been frequently remarked that
                    Christianity did as much for Constantine as he did for it, and the history of
                    the time amply justifies the observation. Whatever be the truth about the
                    sincerity of his conversion, it is undoubted that he, from first to last, looked
                    at the church from a political point of view, and made use of it accordingly for
                    his own political aggrandizement. It should be remembered that the Roman empire
                    hung badly together, and that apart from the sentiment which may be called
                    belief in the genius of Rome there was no common life and no common nationality.
                    There was no popular life, such as we are accustomed to in modern Europe. From
                    the beginning the empire had been a military tyranny. The emperor was imperator,
                    and ruled because he commanded the state as an army, and the rule in the
                    provinces was really military. It was imposed on the people from without and did
                    not spring from themselves. There was not even that solidarity in it which an
                    hereditary absolutism begets. Of course such an empire had very little cohesion,
                    and was only kept together by the feeling of the genius of Rome and by the grand
                    system of Roman law. But there was within the empire a new corporate life, a new
                    kingdom, which subsisted in virtue of the life which was in it, held together by
                    the inward power of growth. When Constantius and Constantine looked at the
                    Christian church with the eyes of statesmen, they saw before them a great
                    selfregulating organization which had a common life, a cohesion, and a corporate
                    character quite unlike anything else in the empire. It was impossible to touch
                    the church anywhere without the whole body being thrilled throughout from end to
                    end, so thoroughly was it one. If the emperor could bring any influence to bear
                    on the Christian organization, he might hope to move these hidden spiritual
                    springs of action which are so much more powerful than anything lying at the
                    command of a mere military government. The organization of Christianity was such
                    that all over the empire and beyond it there was, without undue centralization,
                    a confederation of local churches whose government was thoroughly democratic and
                    based on the principle of representation by means of office-bearers elected by
                    the people, which produced a unity of sympathy and action. Besides all this the
                    common fife was kept up by active sympathy between the various churches. If
                    there was a famine in Africa, the churches in Spain and Gaul sent grain. If
                    Christian Gauls had been carried off into captivity by the pagan Germans, the
                    wealthy African and Roman churches sent money for their redemption. The military
                    roads, the system of posts, the relays of ships which Rome kept up to bring
                    intelligence and produce from the provinces, were all used by the church for the
                    purpose of keeping up a lively communication between all the various parts of
                    the Christian world. In this way Christianity within the empire was the one
                    organization for creating, stimulating, and guiding public opinion. It was that
                    one part of the Roman empire which, scattered over all its extent, had common
                    feelings and all those various common instincts which go to make up a
                    commonwealth. This was the force that Constantine sought to put himself at the
                    head <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n711/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0711-0698"/> of, and. because he succeeded he was the first
                    Roman emperor who ruled with something like what we should call “public opinion”
                    at his back. The victory of Constantine was the first instance of the triumph of
                    that mysterious popular force which has given organized freedom to the civüized
                    nations of Europe, and which is equally removed from the civic freedom of the
                    ancient democracy and from the military tyranny of the great empires of
                    antiquity. It is to Christianity that modern Europe owes organized public
                    opinion and representative government.</p>
                <p>The silent influence which Christianity has exercised upon the human intellect,
                    and especially upon its scientific researches, is too important to be passed
                    over. AntiChristian writers have combined to show the hostility which they think
                    exists between religion and science, and have painted in glowing colours the
                    hindrances which Christianity places before the advance of scientific ideas; but
                    suchattempts resemble the effortsof a man to kick down the ladder which has
                    enabled him to reach the elevation on which he stands. Christianity did not
                    create philosophy nor science, and many of the earlier Christian theologians
                    denounced in no measured terms the philosophies of Greece and Rome because of
                    their connection with paganism, while philosophy on its side was the last
                    remnant of the old pagan civilization which withstood the Christian conquest.
                    Soon, however, philosophy and Christianity came to terms, and in the writings of
                    St Augustine we find the noblest Platonism allied with the loftiest Christian
                    theology. The science of paganism has never been on a par with its philosophical
                    speculations, and whether we examine the ancient civilizations of Greece and
                    Rome which have passed away, or those of India and China which remain, we seek
                    in vain science and scientific knowledge in the modern sense of the term. The
                    truth seems to be that science requires to build on a foundation supplied by
                    Christianity, and which paganism is unable to furnish, or at least has never yet
                    furnished. Science presupposes and rests on the idea of the oneness and
                    uniformity of the universe, and this idea is, strictly speaking, a Christian
                    conception. Aristotle, the most scientific of the ancients, was unable to
                    conceive the uniformity of nature or the totality of things in anything like the
                    sense which these phrases have to modern thinkers. His conceptions of matter and
                    form, of potentiality and actuality, and so on, implied a subtle duality which
                    effectually stood in the way of such a thought. The uniformity of nature, the
                    capacity of the ideal to realize itself in actual things, was always apt to be
                    thwarted by an inward stubbornness of matter which declined on occasions to
                    submit itself to law. It was this idea which stood in the way of the modern
                    thoughts of the uniformity of nature and of the totality of things which are so
                    essential to science. But such a stubborn, formless matter as pagan philosophy
                    and science delighted to speculate about was quite foreign to Christian
                    speculation and was opposed to the deepest instincts of the Christian life—of
                    trust in the Father who is in Heaven. Christianity did not propose to itself the
                    solution or even the statement of scientific problems, but its yearning to get
                    near God enabled it to see deeper into the problem of the basis of science than
                    the whole of pagan thought had been able to do. The Christian doctrine of
                    creation and the Christian doctrine of providence furnish the foundations on
                    which modern science rests. The Christian doctrine of creation states the
                    absolute dependence of all things on God. He made them out of nothing; and the
                    religious nerve of the doctrine consists in the feeling of absolute dependence
                    on God which this implies. We and all things have our birth and being from God,
                    and from nothing else. Practically God is all in all to us, for on Him all
                    things depend for their origin, and they depend on Him alone. The Christian
                    doctrine of providence presents the same thought in another form The nerve of
                    this doctrine is that God can and does make all things work together for the
                    good of His people. Here again is the idea of the absolute dependence of all
                    things on God, not merely for their origin but also for their existence and
                    endurance. In this way the thought of God as the creator and preserver of all
                    things gives a complete unity to the universe which pagan thought never reached,
                    and gave that basis for the thought of the uniformity of nature which science
                    demands. It was long ere Christianity could force this thought on the human
                    intelligence, but until it had permeated the whole round of man’s intellectual
                    work it was vain to look for advances in science. It was the task of the
                    scholastic theology and philosophy to knead into human thought Christian ideas,
                    and among the rest this idea of the unity and uniformity of nature.
                    AntiChristian critics have spoken of the deadness and uselessness of
                    scholasticism, but its value for science and scientific inquiry can scarcely be
                    over-estimated <hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">for</hi> it was
                    scholasticism which worked Christianity into every department of human and
                    intellectual activity, and so leavened them with it, that when its work was
                    done, the intelligence of man was so thoroughly saturated with the Christian
                    view of nature that it could never again forget it. When scholasticism had
                    accomplished its task modern science sprang into being dependent for its very
                    foundation on that Christianity to which it is supposed to be so bitterly
                    hostile.</p>
                <p>The organization of Christianity belongs more properly to the description of the
                    church, but it is impossible to pass the subject without any allusion.
                    Christianity, which has been described to be a new life which takes an organic
                    form and grows like other living things, cannot help taking to itself an
                    external form or organization which approaches perfection in the proportion in
                    which it is adapted to express the life which it contains. On the one hand, the
                    external form of Christianity must not be confounded with Christianity itself,
                    and on the other it must be remembered that Christianity does, and must from its
                    very nature, embody itself in an external organization And a two-fold danger
                    arises from the neglect of this principle, when on the one hand the machinery of
                    Christian worship and discipline is mistaken for Christianity itself, and when
                    on the other it is mischievously imagined that the purity of Christianity
                    depends on tho realization of an impossible invisibility or absence of
                    organization.</p>
                <p>All the various modes of Christian organization or çhurch government profess to
                    imitate the apostolic model, and to be founded on and agreeable to the New
                    Testament Scriptures, and the comparative scantiness of information therein
                    supplied has led to violent controversies upon the subject into which we need
                    not now enter. Many have supposed with great probability that the New Testament
                    contains so few positive instructions on this subject, because the apostles did
                    not invent a new organization for Christianity, but simply took over from
                    Judaism that organization for worship and discipline which had no connection
                    with the temple service—the synagogue system—and that the early Christian
                    worship was simply a reproduction of the synagogue service. We may at all events
                    believe that the early Christian organization, if not exactly the same, was
                    modelled upon that of the synagogue, and that the reaso⅛ why we have so few
                    descriptions and instructions in th· New Testament is that the apostles did not
                    require to describe what was so very well known to the Jewish Christians who
                    composed the apostolic church. At first the Christians seem to have shared in
                    the common worship of the Jews and to have engaged at the same time in services
                    which were peculiarly Christian (Acts ií 46), and in this way they appeared to
                    be and were called <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n712/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0712-0699"/> a sect (α"pεσιs) of the Jews. They do not seem to
                    have had any ecclesiastical organization distinctive enough to separate them
                    from the Jews. Founding on these and other facts Vitri nga has derived the whole
                    of the Christian machinery of worship and discipline from the Jewish synagogue.
                    But this is going too far. Two influences, so far as we can gather, seem to have
                    combined to modify the early state of matters which we see existing in the first
                    chapters of the Acts of the Apostles, and these were the hatred of the Jews and
                    the entrance of Gentile Christians. These two circumstances led to the
                    introduction of a new church organization distinct from the Jewish and more
                    suited to the requirements of Christianity. This early Christian organization,
                    whose growth can be obscurely traced in the New Testament, is characterized by
                    two special features. It was evidently founded on and in many respects analogous
                    to the Jewish religions community, and the constitution was thoroughly
                    democratic.</p>
                <p>When Christianity arose, Palestine, and indeed the whole of the civilized world
                    where Jews had penetrated and settled, was covered with a network of synagogues
                    in constant correspondence with each other. The synagogue system was an
                    organization for public worship, but also had to do with the lives and conduct
                    of the worshippers, and possessed quasi-judicial functions. The worship of the
                    synagogue was not sacrificial, like that of the temple. It was simply
                    devotional, consisting in prayer, praise, reading, and preaching, and was
                    regulated by a fixed liturgy. The synagogues were ruled by a variety of
                    office-bearers. In the first place, there was commonly a college of elders, with
                    the chief of the synagogue at their head. These elders had a variety of
                    names—almost all of the designations given in the New Testament to the Christian
                    office-bearers are used to denote these Jewish Z’Kenim. These elders were the
                    real rulers; they had the power of excommunication, and superintended the
                    worship and charities of the synagogue. Besides these elders there was an
                    officiating minister who was the delegate of the congregation; the rules which
                    Paul laid down to be observed 'n the choice of a bishop almost exactly
                    correspond to the conditions to be satisfied in the election of the Sheliaeh.
                    The lowest class of office-bearers were the ordained servants or ministers of
                    the synagogue, who are sometimes called the young men, and who like the Sheliaeh
                    and the Z’Kenim were ordained by laying on of hands. In this synagogue system,
                    with its simple devotional worship, its office-bearers to preserve discipline
                    and encourage the exercise of charity, the early Christians found an
                    organization ready to hand which they could at once take advantage of and either
                    adopt or at least copy in important details.</p>
                <p>All throughout the New Testament we are reminded that the office-bearers exist
                    for the community and not the community for the office-bearers, and this truth
                    is enforced with emphasis when the diversity of office in the Christian church
                    is made to depend upon diversity of gifts (Eph. iv. 4-16), and upon the
                    appreciation of those gifts by the Christian community testified to in the
                    process of election.</p>
                <p>We get these two primary ideas therefore about the early Christian community,
                    that possession of office meant the possession of gifts suitable for the
                    edification of the community, and the recognition of this fact by the people. In
                    the New Testament the ordinary office-bearers in the Christian communuity have a
                    variety of designations. They are called <hi rend="italic">προϊστάμενοί,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">πpεσβυτεpoι,</hi><hi rend="italic">επίσκοποι,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">πoιμεvες,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ηγούμενοι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> but all these names are used evidently to express the same
                    kind of officers, for they are continually used interchangeably the one for the
                    other. In the earlier times of Christianity the service was probably very
                    simple, and the meetings were held in the houses of the first converts or of the
                    officers of the little Christian community. In an old liturgy we find a rubric
                    enjoining the deacons to order all mothers to take up their infants at a
                    peculiarly solemn part of the worship, which shows us a picture of an early
                    Christian assembly with the babies crawling peacefully over the floor during the
                    greater part of the service.</p>
                <p>Many controversies have arisen about the relation of these office-bearers to the
                    community on the one hand, and to the apostles on the other. As the New
                    Testament writings do not give us more than passing allusions to the mode in
                    which the government of the Christian community was carried on, and describe it
                    in action rather than give a detailed account of the principles on which it was
                    founded and the way to apply them in practice, we may be expected to find there
                    descriptions of the Christian organization at various stages of early
                    development. Some have believed, not without great probability, that we have in
                    the account of the choice and consecration of the seven men (Acts vi. 1-6) the
                    beginning of the Christian organization on a distinct and separate basis of its
                    own, and that these seven men were the first regularly chosen office-bearers in
                    the early Christian community. These seven men were chosen to take charge of the
                    charities of the small Christian community, and it is not difficult to see now
                    from this how they came to rule the community. We find no trace of a distinct
                    and separate election of elders or pastors; and it is worthy of note that the
                    special service to which these men were appointed, viz., to take charge of the
                    poor, is the work which we find the elders engaged in on the first occasion on
                    which they are mentioned (Acts xi. 29-30). Habitual almsgiving was regarded as a
                    religious service of no ordinary significance, and was specially enjoined on all
                    true believers, and the men appointed to take charge of this must have held a
                    very high position in the church. It is evident, besides, that the
                    superintendence of the charities involved a certain amount of disciplinary
                    control, and so the other duties of the office-bearers in the Christian church
                    naturally clustered around this one. The recipients of charity were to be
                    suitable persons (1 Thess. v. 12 -15, 1 Tim. V. 9-16); and we can easily see how
                    gradually the benevolent oversight passed over into the rule of discipline,
                    until men originally elected to regulate the benevolence of the community became
                    the rulers of the church.</p>
                <p>But whatever the earliest office-bearers were, and however they were chosen, it
                    seems evident that their special function was to rule or to exercise discipline
                    rather than to teach. In the apostolic church there seem to have been two kinds
                    of teaching recognized, the apostolic announcement of the evangel and the
                    preaching of the word. The latter was evidently at first open to all and sundry
                    who had or who thought that they had the gift, and the only restriction placed
                    upon indiscriminate exhortation was the command forbidding women to speak in
                    public. The gift of preaching or exhortation was looked upon as a gift of the
                    Spirit independent of office; and the earliest office-bearers were men who ruled
                    rather than men who taught. Open preaching continued for a long time in the
                    post-apostolic church, and is distinctly recognized in the so-called Apostolic
                    Constitutions; but there are evidences in the New Testament that the practice
                    had its inconveniences and was discouraged by the apostles. James warns heedless
                    preachers that they take great responsibility upon them, and shall receive the
                    greater condemnation (Jas. iii. 1), and Paul in several passages takes notice of
                    the irregularities and unedifying confusion attending the practice. Hence we
                    find the function of instruction at an early period engrafted on that of rule,
                    just as the function of rule had grown out of that of oversight of the
                    distribution of charity; and one of the special qualifications of elders of the
                    church was aptness to teach. In the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n713/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0713-0700"/> Epistles to Timothy we even find traces of a plan
                    for giving a special education and training to young men who were set apart to
                    prepare themselves for the office of elders who were to teach. In the
                    post-apostolic Church we find another office quite distinct from the eldership,
                    the office of deacon. The deacons in the post-apostolic church were officers who
                    waited upon the bishop, and many have thought that the election of the seven men
                    was really the election not of elders but of deacons; but there seems no reason
                    to suppose this. The real warrant for the existence of the diaconate consists in
                    the fact that the office and duties of the deacon correspond very nearly to
                    those of the “ministers” of the synagogue, and also in the many scattered
                    references in the New Testament to the existence of “young men” (one of the
                    technical terms for the synagogue deacons), who waited upon the apostles. To sum
                    up then, the office-bearers in the early Christian community were men selected
                    by the voice of the congregation, and confirmed by the apostles, to administer
                    the charities of the community; and to this primitive function there was added
                    soon after the duty of oversight, leadership, or rule, and somewhat later the
                    duty of providing for the proper teaching of the people.</p>
                <p>The relation of the apostles to these office-bearers and to the Christian
                    community is a problem not without difficulties. Apostle primarily denotes one
                    who is sent on a special mission, and in the Seρtuagint is used to translate the
                    Hebrew Shaluach, meaning one who has a special commandment from God. The word
                    was in common use among the Jews to denote a special messenger and more
                    especially messengers sent on foreign missions. Thus the Jews who were sent from
                    Palestine to stir up the foreign synagogues against the Christians are called
                    apostles. All these ideas help to show us what the Christian apostles were. It
                    should be remembered, however, that the term apostle is used in its Christian
                    sense in two ways at least, in a wider and in a narrower sense. In the narrower
                    and more strictly technical sense the apostles were the eleven whom Christ chose
                    to be special witnesses for Him because they had been with Him from the
                    beginning, together with Matthias, selected by the apostles to fill the place of
                    Judas before the descent of the Holy Spirit, or as some with more probability
                    think, Paul, who was selected for this place by Christ Himself. On the other
                    hand, many others are called apostles who did not belong to this
                    company,—Barnabas, for example (Acts xiv. 14), Andronicus and Junias (Rom. xvi.
                    7), and others (2 Cor. viii. 23; Phil. ii. 25). This vagueness in the New
                    Testament use of the term makes it somewhat difficult to βpeak with anything
                    like precision of the relation in which the apostles stood to the office-bearers
                    and members of the early Christian community. But one or two statements enable
                    us to see what were the functions of the apostles strictly so called. It is
                    said, for example, that Christians are built upon the foundation of the apostles
                    and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner-stone (Eph. ii. 20),
                    and the capacity of the apostles to act in this way as &amp; foundation is
                    explained by passages which seem to say that the qualifications for apostleship
                    were—to have been with the Lord from the beginning, to have seen and recognized
                    Christ after the resurrection, to have been witnesses of the ascension, and to
                    have been gifted with peculiar spiritual gifts. And we may say generally, that
                    just as the prophets of the Old Testament were the links between their own
                    generation by their speech, and between future generations by their writings,
                    and the •Saviour that was to come, so the apostles were the links between the
                    first generation of Christians by their presence and influence, and between all
                    succeeding generations of Christians by their writings, and the Saviour who had
                    come. They were to serve as the connection between the first generation of
                    Christians and Jesus, and were to have no successors but the writings of the New
                    Testament canon, which has taken their place and done their work for all
                    succeeding generations.</p>
                <p>The relation of the apostles, therefore, to the primitive church was altogether
                    unique, as indeed is implied in their name; and when they act or give official
                    advice apart from their apostolic office, which they did in certain cases, they
                    do so as elders chosen to act along with the other elders who did not possess
                    apostolic gifts. If these views are correct the autonomy of the early Christian
                    communities was complete during the lifetime of the apostles, and was quite
                    independent of the apostolic office and authority.</p>
                <p>This thought has an important bearing on the history of the growth of the
                    Christian government. In the 5th and 6th centuries we find that the government
                    was episcopal, and that the principles on which it rested were very different
                    from those which lay at the basis of the government of the Christian community
                    during the apostolic times. The identity of the terms bishop and presbyter
                    within the apostolic church is now so universally admitted by scholars that the
                    sole question really is, When did bishops begin to exist as separate and
                    superior officers? and the dispute becomes one of historical facts rather than
                    dogmatic theories. According to one account the episcopate became the form of
                    the government about the year 70 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> to meet and
                    supply in a legitimate way a want which, if not supplied, might have caused the
                    ruin of Christianity; and according to another and more probable theory, the
                    episcopate in the strict sense of the word was not established until the 3d or
                    4th century. It arose during a panic, and was really a false development of the
                    primitive government, and sanctioned neither by scripture nor by the necessities
                    of the times. Of course the discussion is very much mixed up with the question
                    whether the apostolic office was or was not a permanent one in the Christian
                    church.</p>
                <p>According to the one theory, the year 70 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> may be
                    taken as the turning point. In that year Jerusalem was destroyed and the Jewish
                    church of Jerusalem rudely shaken, and by this time John only of the apostles
                    remained alive, and he had already left Jerusalem. It was at this time,
                    according to several scholars, that the episcopate arose to take the place of
                    the apostolate and preserve the church from breaking up into several small sects
                    when no longer governed by the apostles and not yet in full possession of the
                    New Testament canon. Apart from the historical evidence to be urged in support
                    of this theory, its chief strength lies in the mere assumption that the
                    presbyterian rule of the apostolic church was unfit to carry on the government
                    when unsupported by the authority of the apostles, and had to be supplemented by
                    an episcopate. When examined, the historical proofs for this state of affairs
                    are not very satisfactory. We certainly soon find men who are called bishops
                    distinct from the other elders, and are superior to them; but the name and the
                    duties which belong to them appear to be not so much those which pertain to a
                    bishop in the episcopal sense of the term, but rather those which are performed
                    by a minister or preaching elder in the modern Presbyterian organization. In the
                    early church the first convert, the best speaker, he whom the apostle had made
                    his friend during his brief stay, would naturally be elected to preside at the
                    meetings of the college of the elders who ruled the affairs of the community,
                    and to represent it at conferences with other communities, and would naturally
                    be invested with the name which denoted special oversight. And the extension of
                    the church would naturally involve a further development of this process. When
                    one church became too small, another was built, and a presbyter sent from the
                    first congregation to work there under the superintendence of his bishop, and so
                    on until the minister or <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0714-0701"/> presiding elder of the earliest planted or mother
                    church became the perpetual president or overseer of various dependent
                    congregations. But this is very different from the theory which afterwards
                    became dominant in the church, and fails to account for the origin and almost
                    universal supremacy of episcopacy. Perhaps of all the accounts which have been
                    given of its origin, that which connects it with the disturbances engendered by
                    Montanism is the most satisfactory. While the church was governed in the manner
                    described above, a wave of religious excitement passed over it, connected
                    doubtless in some way with the striking phenomena of Montanism and the new
                    prophecy, and characterized by an overstrained zeal for enforcing discipline in
                    all cases of departure from a high standard of Christian life. It was the
                    peculiar characteristic of Montanism to set forward its prophets as successors
                    of the apostles, having the same gifts from the Holy Spirit, and sent on a
                    similar message of instruction to the Christian church. They uttered prophecies
                    which were deemed supplementary to the revelation contained in the Old and New
                    Testaments, and they did not scruple to set aside the authority of the regularly
                    ordained officials of the church in order to execute the behests of a supposed
                    spirit of prophecy. And thus the Christian communities were everywhere burdened
                    by the presence of ignorant intolerant fanatics, who insisted that all their
                    fellows should follow the dictates of their narrow and ignorant conscience, and
                    who backed up this unwarranted interference with Christian liberty and
                    responsibility by claiming to hold the place and exercise the powers of inspired
                    successors to the apostles. It was at this juncture, according to a not
                    improbable theory, that Cyprian of Carthage was able to popularize and gain
                    acceptance for a theory of Christian organization which had been slowly growing
                    up within the church, and which is now known as Episcopacy. Cyprian, bishop of a
                    church which more than any other had suffered from the consequences of Montanist
                    excesses, was the founder of a revolution of a kind which has been frequently
                    repeated in the political world. Montanism and its after wave had influenced in
                    an especial way the minor clergy and the more fanatical laity. Cyprian, like
                    many a succeeding absolutist, seems to have subverted the aristocracy of a
                    presbyterate infected with Montanism by persuading the people to make common
                    cause with the bishop. He promised deliverance from arbitrary and unofficial
                    successors of the apostles by boldly setting forth the episcopate as the true
                    successors of the apostles. He transferred, in all sincerity, to the episcopate
                    all the powers and gifts laid claim to by the Montanist prophets, and at the
                    same time showed the people how easy the yoke of a legitimate monarchy was when
                    compared with the lawless rule of a mob of self-anointed tyrants. From Cyprian’s
                    time onwards the whole constitution of the church became changed, and the
                    foundations of what ultimately became Ultram ontanism were laid. The episcopate
                    claimed and exercised as part of its official duties all those gifts of rule and
                    special inspiration which the Montanist prophets had laid claim to. The bishops
                    laid claim to powers of rule over the Christian community not as chosen
                    representatives of the Christian people, but as the official representatives of
                    the apostles.</p>
                <p>It only remains to allude briefly to the corruptions of Christianity. It has been
                    already stated that Christianity had a fourfold conflict to maintain with
                    Judaism, Rome, Gnosticism, and an enthusiastic and sometimes immoral pietism. If
                    we add to these pagan superstition, we shall have the chief heads of the
                    opposition which Christianity had to encounter. After its triumph these sources
                    of antiChristian action still remained to be contended against, and became the
                    chief springs of its corruption. The spirit of Judaism, of Roman worldly policy,
                    of pagan superstition, of pagan philosophy, and of immorality entered into
                    Christianity and tended to corrupt it.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest causes of the corruption of Christianity was the attempt to
                    translate the Christian kingdom of God into a visible monarchy in which the
                    saints inherited the earth in a literal way. The Church was the more tempted to
                    enter into this course during the period of the decay of the Roman empire, when
                    civil authority became very weak and the real rulers were in many cases the
                    principal clergy of the place. The consciousness of power inspired a desire for
                    its insignia, and soon the bishop and superior clergy adorned themselves in the
                    official robes of Rome’s municipal and provincial officers. This whole tendency
                    received a great impulse during the period that Rome was abandoned by her
                    emperors, and when the chief citizen in the imperial city was undoubtedly the
                    Christian bishop. How all this tended to corrupt Christianity is very apparent.
                    In the first place it generated the idea that the Christian kingdom is a visible
                    monarchy and that its marks are such as can be seen; and it led Christians to
                    postpone everything to the earthly aggrandizement of the church. It translated
                    spiritual forces into mechanical and physical equivalents. The very term
                    spiritual, which belongs to the affections and emotions and thoughts and will,
                    to the whole inward life, was used to denote whatever belonged to the church or
                    the clergy. Land became spiritual when it passed into the hands of the bishops;
                    men were spiritual if they were servants of the church; things were spiritual if
                    they were church property. There resulted, in short, a gradual coarsening of
                    ideas, and all that was most inward, hidden, and sacred was forgotten in the
                    strife for worldly position and power and wealth. On the other hand, this
                    tendency worked a good deal deeper. Worldly men who found their way into the
                    ministry were tempted to favour any kind of superstitious error that tended to
                    bring them profit and power. The people were often disposed to fancy that the
                    priests could serve God in their stead, and that there were mysteries in
                    religion which the priests understood, but which the laity need not know
                    anything of and ought not to inquire into. Hence they were ready to follow
                    blindly the guidance of the priests in religious matters, just as a man trusts
                    his legal concerns to his lawyer, doing what he directs and not considering it
                    necessary himself to study law. Ambitious and worldly minded rulers, too, are
                    generally glad to make use of religion as an instrument for securing the
                    submission of the people to tyrannical oppression, and for aiding their
                    ambitious views when they seek to subdue their neighbours under the pretext of
                    propagating the true faith. Then again, this idea tends to breed false views of
                    Christian unity. It leads men to think that they cannot be true Christians
                    unless they belong to one community which is visible and universal. And this
                    idea tends to keep up and intensify other errors. For if a man is convinced that
                    all Christians are bound to belong to some one community on earth, he will dread
                    nothing so much as separation from that church, whatever it may be, which he
                    considers as having the best claim to be that one community.</p>
                <p>Many corruptions of Christianity have been either introduced or favoured and kept
                    up by moral corruption in the members of a Christian Church. For it belongs to
                    the true gospel to purify and also to elevate the moral character. Hence there
                    is a complete and constant opposition between genuine Christianity and all the
                    evil and base propensities of man’s nature. Every kind of depravity or moral
                    defect therefore predisposes men either to reject Christianity altogether, or
                    else to introduce or to accept some erroneous views of it. And there is no kind
                    of religious corruption against which men are usually less on their guard. They
                    are well aware, indeed that there is a danger of mens <pb break="no"

                    religion, but they are too apt to think that a man who has embraced a true faith
                    will therefore be made a good moral man. This erroneous idea appears in its most
                    extreme form in the views of those who have been called Antinomians, and who
                    have appeared in all ages of the church from apostolic times down to our own
                    day. They appear to believe that whoever has faith is thereby lifted into a new
                    life to which the moral laws of the old life are inapplicable, and are therefore
                    privileged to do without censure or danger what others would be condemned
                    for.</p>
                <p>Nothing perhaps has tended more thoroughly to corrupt Christianity than the
                    introduction into it of superstitions which are really pagan themselves, or have
                    been suggested by pagan practices. Paganism, unable to oppose Christianity
                    successfully, has done much to corrupt it, and in numberless ways has made
                    inroads upon its purity.</p>
                <p>The corruptions which entered into Christianity from Judaism have already been
                    noticed, and the corrupting effects of the reproduction of the symbolic temple
                    worship and the Jewish idea of priesthood need not be again referred to. It only
                    remains to speak of those corruptions which have arisen from the contact of
                    Christianity with pagan philosophy. The special corruptions which have arisen
                    from this contact have been called heresies, and have been of various kinds and
                    degrees, but of these we need not speak. A more subtle influence, and one to be
                    even more jealously guarded against, is the transformation of Christianity
                    itself into an intellectual system or philosophy, or the supposition that it is
                    the intellectual side of Christianity which is the only one or the chief. The
                    inevitable tendency of such an impulse is to remove Christianity as a system to
                    be apprehended from the Christian people, and to reduce their relation to it to
                    a submissive assent to Christian doctrine as that is manufactured for them by
                    the dogmatic machinery of the church. And thus, in place of that whole-hearted
                    trust which waits for personal illumination, there is on the side of the people
                    a blindfold assent, and on the other side the claim to an infallible system of
                    intellectual truth.</p>
                <p>The continual and steady growth of Christianity, its vigorous life in spite of
                    various seasons of unavoidable ebb and notwithstanding the presence of all these
                    and other sources of corruption, and its continual rejuvenescence, are no
                    ordinary proof of its divine origin as well as of its supreme fitness for the
                    position in the world which it claims to occupy.</p>
