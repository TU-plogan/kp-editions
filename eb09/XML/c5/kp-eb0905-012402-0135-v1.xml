                        rend="smallcaps">Nicolas Marguerite</hi> (1753-1823), was born at Nolay in
                    Burgundy, May 13, 1753. After receiving a good mathematical education in his
                    native province, he was admitted as an officer of the engineer corps under the
                    patronage of the prince of Condé; and he was beginning to gain some reputation
                    as an author by means of a prize eulogy on Vauban, two mathematical essays, and
                    a number of verses of no great value, when the Revolution drew him into
                    political life. In 1791 he was returned to the National Assembly for the Pas de
                    Calais, and it was not long before he became a member of the Committee of Public
                    Safety under Robespierre. He took a leading part in the most revolutionary
                    measures; before his election he had addressed a paper to the Assembly proposing
                    the seizure of the property of the church, and he now proposed to arm 30,000 <hi
                        rend="italic">sans-culottes</hi> with pikes, and to destroy all the citadels
                    in France, and voted for the overthrow of the nobility and the execution of the
                    king. His genius, however, was more military than political; he effected an
                    important improvement in the discipline of the army, and his activity and spirit
                    contributed materially to the successes of the Republic. One of his chief
                    exploits was the victory of Wattignies, where he led in person, and headed a
                    charge on foot. In 1794, after the fall of Robespierre, Carnot had to defend his
                    colleagues, Collot d’Herbois and Barère, from the charge of complicity with the
                    crimes of their leader, and himself only escaped arrest through the glory of his
                    military services. He based his defence on the argument that no member of the
                    Committee was to be held responsible for the deeds of any of the others, since
                    pressure of business made it necessary to sign orders with mt staying to learn
                    their contents; and, though the excuse is far from sufficient, it was probably
                    true that Carnot, amid the unceasing toils of a minister of war, was not aware
                    of many of the atrocities which were committed. In 17 95 he became one of the
                    five directors of the Republic, and it was now that he projected his famous <hi
                        rend="italic">Plan for the Invasion of England,</hi> by landing two armies
                    simultaneously on the coasts of Sussex and Yorkshire. But not long after he was
                    proscribed, and compelled to take refuge in Germany. Here, though under the
                    protection of a monarch, he published his <hi rend="italic">Mémoire
                        Justificatif,</hi> in which he declares himself the “irreconcilable enemy of
                    kings.” On the downfall of the Directory he returned to France, and became
                    minister of war, but he soon resigned this office, consistently refusing to
                    consent to the election of Napoleon as consul for life; and on the abolition of
                    the tribunate in 1806 he retired into private life, became an active member of
                    the Institute, and devoted himself to the pursuit of science. After the Russian
                    campaign, believing that the independence of France depended upon the success of
                    its emperor, he offered his services to Napoleon, and was made governor of
                    Antwerp, which he defended till the abdication in 1814. He was still faithful to
                    the Republic, and his revolutionary <hi rend="italic">Mémoire au Roi</hi> did
                    powerful service to the anti-royalist cause. On Napoleon’s return from Elba,
                    Carnot was made minister of war, but the time was past for carrying out the
                    vigorous measures which he proposed. On the overthrow of the empire he retired
                    first to Warsaw, and then to Madgeburg, where he died in 1823.</p>
