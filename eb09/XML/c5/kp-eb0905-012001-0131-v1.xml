                <p><label type="entry">CARNEADES</label>, a Greek philosopher, founder of the Third
                    or New Academy, was born at Cyrene about 213 B.c. Little is known of his life.
                    He learned dialectics under Diogenes the Stoic, and under Hegesinus, the third
                    leader of the Academy in descent from Arcesilaus. The chief objects ofhis study,
                    however, were the works of Chrysippus, opposition to whose views is the
                    mainspring of his philosophy. “If Chrysippus had not been, I had not been
                    either,” he is reported to have said on one-occasion. The most notable incident
                    in his life was the embassy to Rome in 156. His eloquence and powerful reasoning
                    excited among the Roman youth an enthusiasm for philosophical speculations, and
                    roused the ire of Cato, who insisted on Carneades, with his companions, being
                    sent from the city. According to Diogenes Laertius, Carneades died in his
                    eighty-fifth year, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in 129 B.c.; according to Cicero
                    ho survived to the age of ninety.</p>
                <p>Carneades is the most powerful of the ancient sceptics. Fundamentally he is at
                    one with Arcesilaus (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Arcesilaus)</hi>; but he carried
                    out his principles with such fulness and skill, both on the negative and on the
                    positive side, that he is called with justice the founder of the New Academy.
                    Negatively, the philosophy of Carneades is a polemic against the Stoic theory of
                    knowledge in all its aspects. Experience, he thinks, clearly shows that there is
                    no true impression. There is no notion that may not deceive us; it is impossible
                    to distinguish between false and true impressions; <hi rend="italic">φαντασία
                        καταληπτική</hi> must be given up. There is no criterion of truth. Not
                    content with attacking this fundamental position of the Stoic philosophy,
                    Carneades also assailed their theology and physics. In answer to the Stoic
                    doctrine of final cause, of design in nature, he points to those things which
                    cause destruction and danger to man, to the evil committed by men endowed with
                    reason, to the miserable condition of humanity, and to the misfortunes that
                    assail the good man. There is, he concludes, no evidence for the doctrine of a
                    divine superintending providence. Even if there were orderly connection of parts
                    in the universe, this may have resulted quite naturally. No proof can be
                    advanced to show that this world is anything but the product of natural forces.
                    Carneades further attacked the very idea of God. He points out the contradiction
                    between the attributes of infinity and individuality. Like Aristotle, he insists
                    that virtue, being relative, cannot be ascribed to God. Not even intelligence
                    can be an attribute of the divine Being. Many of the arguments employed in this
                    connection by Carneades have little value, but the general line of criticism is
                    highly suggestive and anticipates much in modern thought.</p>
                <p>The positive side of Carneades’s teaching resembled in all essentials that of
                    Arcesilaus. Knowledge being impossible, a wise man should practise <hi

                    that he can be sure of nothing. Ideas or notions are never true, but only
                    probable; nevertheless, there are degrees of probability, and hence degrees of
                    belief, leading to action. This theory <pb break="no"

                    but little is known of its application to practice. The views of Carneades on
                    the <hi rend="italic">summum</hi><hi rend="italic">boηurn</hi> were not clearly
                    known even to his disciple and successor Clitomachus. He seems to have held that
                    virtue consisted in the direction of activity towards the satisfaction of the
                    natural impulses. Carneades left no written works; his opinions seem to have
                    been systematized by his follower Clitomachus. (See Diog. Laer. bk. iv., Cicero,
                    and Sextus Empiricus. An admirable survey of Carneades is given by Zeller, <hi
