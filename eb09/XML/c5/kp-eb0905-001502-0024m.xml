                    relations with the secular power, its own internal administration, or the
                    conduct of its members, were called canons <hi rend="italic">(κανόνες,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">reguloe),</hi> in contradistinction on the one hand to its
                    articles of doctrine (δόγματα), and on the other to the enactments of the civil
                    lawgiver <hi rend="italic">(νόμοι,</hi><hi rend="italic">leges).</hi> Though at
                    first applied only to the ordinances of an assembly of the church, the term
                    canon came to be extended to include opinions of the fathers and decretals of
                    the popes. Any collection of such laws was <pb break="no"

                    the church for its subject. During the growth of the canon law the church
                    extended her influence into all departments of life. Churchmen filled high
                    offices of state and performed the duties of practical lawyers, while prelates
                    often exercised civil jurisdiction over a considerable tract of country. Hence
                    the legislation of the church embraced many subjects which properly belonged to
                    the domain of municipal law. Ecclesiastical law on the other hand derives its
                    binding authority solely from the state, and treats of the church as a religious
                    institution. But its principles cannot be properly understood without a
                    knowledge of the canon law, on which it is largely based.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Early History.</hi> —The earliest body known to us of
                    purely church law is the spurious work called the <hi rend="italic">Apostolic
                    Constitutions</hi> (διδασκαλία των αποστόλων, <hi rend="italic">Constitutiones
                    Apostolorum),</hi> which originated in Syria. Its eight books, uf which the
                    first six date from the end of the 3d century, and the two remaining ones from
                    the first quarter of the 4th century, contain a variety of moral and liturgical
                    precepts, and regulations on ecclesiastical discipline, bearing to proceed from
                    the apostles themselves. As a supplement to the eighth book there appeared also
                    in Syria, about the beginning of the 6th century, a collection of eighty-five
                    disciplinary regulations under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Apostolic
                    Canons</hi><hi rend="italic">(κανόνες</hi> τών αποστόλων, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canones</hi><hi rend="italic">Apostolorum).</hi> The Council in Trullo (692)
                    sanctioned the Constitutions as law for the Greek Church, but rejected the
                    Canons. The Latin Church adopted neither, but subsequently fifty of the Canons
                    found their way into the Western collections. Though not what they profess to
                    be, these writ ings are instructive on early ecclesiastical usages and
                    discipline.</p>

                <p>In the 4th and 5th centuries collections which have not come down to us were made
                    of the canons of the Eastern councils of Antioch, Ancyra, Neocaesarea, Nicaea,
                    Sardica, Gangra, Laodicaea, Ephesus, Constantinople, and Chalcedon. (See the <hi

                    >Ecclesioe</hi><hi rend="italic">Universae</hi> of Justellus, Paris, 1610.)
                    Joannes Scholasticus, patriarch of Constantinople in the reign of Justinian
                    (564), reduced these and other canons into a systematic work divided into fifty
                    books. A little later this was digested with corresponding fragments of the
                    civil law relating to ecclesiastical affairs into a code called, from its
                    combination of civil and ecclesiastical enactments, a Nomocanon. Of later
                    compilations of the same description the most widely-known was the Nomocanon of
                    the patriarch Photius (883). A most important consolidation of Greek canon law
                    was effected in the year 692 by the labours of the Council in Trullo <hi
                    rend="italic">(Concilium Trullanum,</hi> from Trullus, the hall in the imperial
                    palace at Constantinople in which they sat, also called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Concilium Quinisextum,</hi> from its being considered supplementary to the 5th
                    and 6th general councils). They drew up an authoritative list of the subsisting
                    laws of the church, comprising the Apostolic Canons, the canons of the ten
                    councils mentioned above, those of several synods held at Carthage, and one at
                    Constantinople (394), and the decisions of twelve Eastern patriarchs and
                    prelates from the 3d to the 5th century. They added 102 canons of their own, and
                    this code, with the addition of 22 canons of the Seventh (Ecumenical Council
                    held at Nicaea in 787, was the leading authority in the Greek Church till the
                    middle of the 9th century. (For the later ecclesiastical literature of the East

                <p>Translations from the Greek collections gradually came into circulation among the
                    Western clergy. The best known are two that date from the 5th century,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Versio</hi><hi rend="italic">Iiidoriana,</hi> originating in
                    Spain, and the so-called <hi rend="italic">Prisca</hi> (sc. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canonum Translatio),</hi> which came from Italy. The Latin Church was thus
                    enabled to add to the canons of African, Italian, French, and Spanish provincial
                    councils those of the oecumenical councils of Nice, Constantinople, and
                    Chalcedon, and of numerous Oriental synods. About the same time a new source of
                    church law rose into importance in the letters addressed by the popes to the
                    bishops of the various dioceses in answer to requests for advice on points of
                    ecclesiastical management. Such letters were called <hi rend="italic">epistolas
                    decretales,</hi> or shortly <hi rend="italic">decretales,</hi> sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">constituta decretalia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">decretalia.</hi>
                    Being communicated by the bishops to whom they were addressed to the
                    neighbouring dioceses they ruled similar cases occurring there. They were
                    regarded as of equal authority with the canons of councils, and soon proved the
                    most prolific source of canon law.</p>
                <p>Both classes of material contributed to the collection formed (in two separate
                    parts afterwards conjoined) about the beginning of the 6th century by a learned
                    Scythian monk Dionysius, surnamed <hi rend="italic">Exiguus</hi> from the
                    epithet he modestly applies to himself in the preface. The first part contains a
                    translation of the Apostolic Canons, and of the canons of the councils of Nice,
                    Ancyra, Neocaesarea, Gangra, Antioch, Laodicaea, and Constantinople, those of
                    Chalcedon and Sardica in the original Latin, and the acts of the synod of
                    Carthage (419) and other African synods. The second part is made up of papal
                    decretals from Pope Siricius (385) to Anastasius II. (498), arranged in
                    chronological order. Though never formally authorized, this collection, from its
                    clear arrangement, the fidelity of its translations from the Greek, and the
                    general authenticity of its contents, obtained speedy acceptance, and long
                    maintained its ground against later compilations.</p>
                <p>It is printed in the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Canonum</hi><hi rend="italic">Fetus Ecclesioe Romance</hi> of Franc. Pithoeus,
                    Paris, 1687, fol. A copy of it, containing some additional matter, and known as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Collectio Dionyso-Hadriana,</hi> was presented to
                    Charlemagne during his first visit to Rome in 774 by Pope Hadrian I., and was
                    sanctioned by the synod of Aix-la-Chapelle (8^02) as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >codex</hi><hi rend="italic">canonum</hi> for the Frankish empire. A collection
                    of 232 African canons may also be mentioned, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Breviatio Canonum,</hi> published by the Carthaginian deacon, Fulgentius
                    Ferrandus, about the year 547. It formed the basis of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Concordia</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonum,</hi> a more complete work, by the
                    African bishop Cres-conius (690). A similar collection had been made about 580
                    by the Spanish bishop Martin of Braga <hi rend="italic">(Martinus
                    Bracarensis).</hi></p>
                <p>In Spain a large body of law had accumulated in the canons of the numerous
                    councils which followed that of Elvira (305), the earliest known to us. A
                    collection of native and foreign canons was in circulation there in the 6th
                    century, and after being added to at various times was generally received
                    towards the close of the next century. It was called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hispana</hi> (sc. <hi rend="italic">Collectio)</hi> from the country of its
                    origin, and being erroneously attributed to Bishop Isidore of Seville, who died
                    in 636, also acquired the name of <hi rend="italic">Collectio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Isidoriana.</hi> Like the <hi rend="italic">Dionyso-Hadriana</hi>
                    it is divided into two parts,—the first containing a classified series of Greek,
                    African, French, and Spanish canons, and the second the decretals from Pope
                    Damasus (366) to Gregory the Great (604).</p>
                <p>The Frankish clergy used, besides the <hi rend="italic">Dionyso-Hadriana,</hi>
                    the original work of Dionysius Exiguus, as well as a collection of Greek and
                    African canons, Papal <pb break="no"

                    which was produced in Gaul about the beginning of the 6th century, and is known
                    to us as QuesneΓs <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonum</hi>
                    from the name of its first editor (Paris, 1675). The different ecclesiastical
                    provinces possessed in addition the canons of their own particular synods, and
                    Papal decretals addressed to the bishops within their bounds; and many Frankish
                    prelates were in the habit of drawing up fortheir subordinate clergy short
                    compendiums of canon law, in which they inserted any particular regulations the
                    local circumstances demanded. These so-called <hi rend="italic">Capitula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Episcoporum</hi> are printed in vols, xiii,-xv. of Mansi’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Sacrorum Conciliorum Collectio.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hispana</hi> got into circulation among the Franks in a
                    more or less corrupt form. One edition, which appeared about the middle of the
                    9th century, has become celebrated in church history as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Collectio</hi><hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Isidoriαna</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >False Decretals.</hi> Everything connected with this collection, its date, its
                    author, its subject-matter, its purpose, has formed the subject of controversy,
                    giving rise to a con siderable literature. We must here confine ourselves to the
                    results of the latest criticism.</p>
                <p>The following particulars seem to be settled. The wo*∙k, which is divided into
                    three parts, was compiled by a single author, a Frankish ecclesiastic, between
                    the years 840 and 860. From his styling himself in the preface <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isidorus Mercator,</hi> Bishop Isidore of Seville was mistakenly supposed to be
                    the author, and hence the name <hi rend="italic">Pseudo Isidore.</hi> After the
                    preface, and some minor apocryphal documents, the first part contains fifty of
                    the Apostolic Canons extracted from the <hi rend="italic">Hispaηα,</hi> and
                    sixty spurious decretals of the popes from Clement I (101) to Melchiades (314),
                    chronologically arranged. The second part consists chiefly of canons taken from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hispana.</hi> The author has also used the latter as the
                    substratum of the third part, but has interpolated thirty five fictitious
                    decretals. A supplement is appended to some of the manuscripts containing, with
                    a few unimportant pieces, a series of brief regulations regarding processes
                    against bishops. These are the so-called <hi rend="italic">Capitula
                    Angilramni</hi> (a bishop of Metz), which are now thought to be older than the
                    main collection.</p>
                <p>No suspicion attached to the <hi rend="italic">Pseudo Isidore</hi> at the time of
                    its appearance. On the contrary, it was everywhere accepted without question
                    till Cardinal Nicolas of Cusa, in the 15th century, expressed doubts of the
                    genuineness of some of its contents. During the next hundred years the
                    untrustworthy nature of the book (printed by Merlin in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Concilia</hi><hi rend="italic">Generalia,</hi> Paris, 1523) was irrefragably
                    demon, strated by the labours of Erasmus, the Magdeburg Centuriators, and
                    especially the Calvinistic pastor, David Blondel. It was subjected to the fierce
                    attacks of the Protestant Reformers, who approached the question less in a
                    scientific spirit than with a desire to reveal the iniquities of the Church of
                    Rome They maintained with much acrimony that the work was a deliberate forgery,
                    undertaken by command, or at least with the connivance, of the Pope, to exalt
                    his temporal and spiritual power. In modern times the controversy has been
                    carried on chiefly by lawyers, and, the theological dust having subsided, it has
                    become easier to define the limits within which lie the only probable views as
                    to the sources and object of the work. It is to be regretted that some symptoms
                    have recently appeared of a revival of the former bitter feeling in con nection
                    with the Old Catholic movement in Germany. <hi rend="italic">(The Pope and the
                    Council,</hi> by Janus, 3d. ed., London, 1870).</p>
                <p>The idea is exploded that the <hi rend="italic">False Decretals</hi> were the
                    invention of their author’s brain, fabricated for purposes of Papal
                    aggrandizement. Many of the apocryphal portions (the Apostolic Canons, &amp;c.)
                    had been for centuries in circulation as genuine. Of the decretals a
                    considerable number are authentic, though antedated and ascribed to early popes
                    to give them the authority of antiquity, while others embody the traditional
                    contents of actual but lost decretals. The sources from which the compiler
                    principally borrowed his materials were the Bible, the fathers, genuine canons
                    and decretals, Roman law from the West Gothic Breviary of Alaric, the works of
                    Rufinus and Cassiodorus on ecclesiastici 1 history, and the biographies of popes
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Liber Pont&gt;ficahs.</hi> It is now admitted by
                    Protestant writers that the compilation was produced in the interest not of the
                    Pope but of the bishops, in order, by protecting them from the oppression of
                    temporal princes on the one hand and ecclesiastical councils on the other, to
                    correct some abuses prevailing among the Franks. The tendency of the authorities
                    collected, was to support a right of appeal to the Pope in every <hi

                    to make the permission of the Pope a necessary preliminary to the assembling of
                    a provincial council. This arrangement did not really secure the independence of
                    the episcopate. It merely shifted the supreme control from a body of men to a
                    single individual, in accordance with the constitutional ideas of the Middle
                    Ages.</p>
                <p>It is still a matter of controversy how far the course of ecclesiastical history
                    has been influenced by the <hi rend="italic">False Decretals.</hi> On the one
                    hand it is maintained, chiefly by Roman Catholic writers, that they effected no
                    essential alteration on the previous constitution or discipline of the church,
                    that they merely gave the form of enactment to the prevailing ideas of the time
                    on church government, and that the latter would have developed in the same
                    direction had no such compilation ever appeared. It is argued reasonably enough
                    that if any great innovation had been introduced the genuineness of the work
                    would not have remained so long unchallenged. Some Protestant writers on the
                    other hand assert that the Papal claim to absolute supremacy, over councils and
                    hierarchy within the church and the laity without, was a pretension unknown till
                    the 9th century, and entirely based upon the <hi rend="italic">False
                    Decretals.</hi> The truth probably lies between the two views. The influence of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Isidore</hi> has been greatly overrated. But it
                    cannot be denied that the embodiment in a definite shape of the indistinct but
                    yet perceptible tendency of church development in the 9th century was of
                    considerable service to the popes during the struggle of the Hildebrandine era.

                    codes, Julian’s Epitome of the Novels, and the Breviary of Alaric) and the <hi

                    Ansegisus of Fontanella in 827, and officially promulgated. A more important
                    collection from an ecclesiastical point of view was that of Benedict, a deacon
                    of Mainz (Benedictus <hi rend="italic">Levita),</hi> who, by order of Bishop
                    Otgar of Mainz compiled a supplement to Ansegisus in three books about the year

                    above-named Roman and German sources, from the Bible, penitential-books, the
                    fathers, and other ecclesiastical writers, as well as canons copied apparently

                <p>II. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Corpus Juris</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Canonici.</hi>
                    —The manuals of church law above referred to had not only become embarrassing by
                    their number but laboured under defects that seriously impaired their practical
                    utility. They contained much that was obsolete and much that was contradictory,
                    many of them mixed up civil with church law, and their arrangement was
                    unmethodical and cumbrous. These faults were to some extent remedied in the
                    great collection that was formed between the middle of the 12th and the end of
                    the 16th centuries, and became the recognized canon law code. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus Juris CanoΛici,</hi> as it was called, consists of six
                    portions, which may be classed under two heads, the Decretum and the
                    Decretals.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Decretum Gratiani.</hi> Up to this time canon law was
                    regarded as a branch of theology, and was studied only in the seminaries
                    attached to cathedrals or monasteries. Gratian, a Camaldolensian monk of
                    Bologna, first taught it as a separate science towards the middle of the 12th
                    century. The school of Roman law founded in that city thirty or forty years
                    before by Irnerius was then flourishing, and Gratian, living within the sphere
                    of the new movement, became ambitious of introducing a similar scientific
                    cultivation of canon law. He selected the whole subsisting law of the church
                    from among the mass of canons, decretals, writings of the fathers, and
                    ecclesiastical historians, ⅛c., and digested it into the systematic work since
                    called after him the <hi rend="italic">Decretum Gratiani,</hi> which soon
                    superseded all preceding compilations. It was early known by the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Concordia</hi><hi rend="italic">Discordantium Canonum,</hi> from
                    an expression in one of the author’s notes (“<hi rend="italic">auctoritatum
                    dissonantia</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">concordiam
                    revocari</hi> ”); but whether Gratian himself made use of either name is
                    uncertain. The work consists of three parts <hi rend="italic">(partes).</hi> The
                    first, treating of the sources of canon, law and of ecclesiastical persons and
                    offices, is divided according to the method of Paucapalea, Gratian’s pupil, into
                    101 <hi rend="italic">distinctiones,</hi> which are subdivided into <hi
                    rend="italic">canones.</hi> The second part consists of 36 <hi rend="italic"
                    >causoe</hi> (cases proposed for solution), subdivided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >quaestiones</hi> (the several questions raised by the case), under each of
                    which are arranged the various <hi rend="italic">canones</hi> (canons,
                    decretals, &lt;fcc.) bearing on the question. But <hi rend="italic">causa</hi>
                    xxxiii. <hi rend="italic">quoestio</hi> 3, headed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tractatus</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Poenitentia,</hi> is
                    divided like the main part into seven <hi rend="italic">distinctiones,</hi>
                    containing each several <hi rend="italic">canones.</hi> The third part, which is
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Consecratione,</hi> gives,
                    in five <hi rend="italic">distinctiones,</hi> the law bearing on church ritual
                    and the sacraments. The following is the method of citation. A reference to the
                    first part indicates the, initial words or number of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >canon</hi> and the number of the <hi rend="italic">distinctio,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> can. Propter ecclesiasticas, dist. xviii. or c. 15, d.
                    xviii. The second part is cited by the <hi rend="italic">canon, causa,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">quaestio,</hi> e.^.,can. Si quis suadente, C. 17, qu. 4, orc.
                    29, C. xvii,qu. 4. The treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Poenitentia,</hi> forming the 3d <hi rend="italic">quoestio</hi> of the 33d <hi
                    rend="italic">causa</hi> of the second part, is referred to as if it were a
                    separate work, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> c. Principium, D. ii. de poenit. or
                    c. 45, D. ii. de poenit. In quoting a passage from the third part the <hi
                    rend="italic">canon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">distinctio</hi> are given, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> c. Missar. solenn. D. I. de consecrat., or c. 12, D. L
                    de consecr.</p>
                <p>The original notes appended by Gratian to many of the canons <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dicta</hi><hi rend="italic">Gratiani),</hi> though not entitled to the same
                    weight as the text, are of great authority as emanating from the “fatherof canon
                    law.” The passages headed “Palea” (about fifty in number) are supposed to be
                    additions made by Gratian’s pupil Paucapalea, and are of equal credit with the
                    rest of the work. The notes in the modern editions with the prefix “corr. Rom.”
                    are by the <hi rend="italic">Correctores</hi><hi rend="italic">Romani,</hi> who
                    published a revised text under the sanction of Pope Gregory XIII.</p>
                <p>Gratian had included in the <hi rend="italic">Decretum</hi> the Papal decretals
                    down to the year 1139. During the following century, owing to the struggles of
                    the popes and emperors, and the general extension of ecclesiastical
                    jurisdictions, the pontifical constitutions increased greatly in frequency.
                    Innocent III. alone <hi rend="italic">(pater juris)</hi> is said to have
                    published 4000 laws. These constitutions went by the name of <hi rend="italic"

                    sanction.</p>
                <p>2. The second part of the <hi rend="italic">Carpus Juris Caηaηici</hi> is made up
                    of the following four collections of decretals :—</p>
                <p>(a.) <hi rend="italic">Decretals of Gregory IX.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    same causes that occasioned the compilation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decretum</hi> induced Pope Gregory IX. to commission his chaplain, Raymond of
                    Pennaforte (near Barcelona), formerly a professor of canon law in Bologna
                    university (and since canonized), to digest into a code the decretals since the
                    time of Gratian. The usual arrangement in five books was observed, and these
                    were subdivided into <hi rend="italic">tituli,</hi> consisting of <hi
                    rend="italic">capita</hi> in chronological order. It was completed in four
                    years, and officially promulgated in 1234. Its original name was <hi
                    rend="italic">Libri</hi><hi rend="italic">extra</hi> (sc. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decretum)</hi> which was abbreviated to X. for convenience in citation, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> cap. 9, X. de eo qui cognovit (iv. 13), or c. 9, X. 4,
                    13 refers to the 4th book, title 13, chap. 9. The laws are in the form of
                    decisions pronounced in cases submitted to the Pope from all parts of
                    Christendom. Among these are several cases from England and Scotland. (For a
                    list of the latter see <hi rend="italic">Ecclesioe Scoticanoe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Statuta,</hi> ii. 232). Raymond, in accordance with the Pope’s
                    instructions, omitted such facts and other matter as he considered irrelevant to
                    the case in hand. These so-called <hi rend="italic">partes decisoe</hi>
                    (generally indicated in the text by the words “et infra” or shortly “etj.”) have
                    been restored in modern editions, since without them the law is often to us
                    unintelligible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(b∙)</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Liber Sextus</hi> was published
                    by Pope Boniface VIII. in 1298. It contains the decretals down to that date from
                    the time of Gregory’s collection, and acquired its name from being intended as a
                    supplement to Gregory’s five books. In one important respect it differs from the
                    latter. Instead of a case being stated with the Papal decision thereon, abstract
                    rules of law are laid down, extracted originally, no doubt, from actual
                    judgments. A series of eighty-eight <hi rend="italic">Régulai</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Juris,</hi> chiefly borrowed from Roman law, are appended to the
                    work, having been added, it is said, by the civilian Dinus to procure its
                    acceptance among the <hi rend="italic">legistoe</hi> of Bologna. In citing from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Liber Sextus</hi> it is usual to give the number of the
                    chapter, with the abbreviation “in vi <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi>” or “in 6,”
                    the number of the book, and the number and rubric of the title, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> c. 1. in vi <hi rend="superscript"> t0</hi> de const.
                    I., 2, or c. 1. de const, in 6, I. 2.</p>
                <p>(c.) The <hi rend="italic">Clemeìüinoe.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> By direction
                    of Pope Clement V. the canons of the Council of Vienne in 1311 (at which he
                    presided, the Papal court having been transferred to Avignon), and his own
                    decretals before and after that date, were collected and published in 1313. They
                    were almost immediately withdrawn again for revision, and were promulgated in
                    their present form by his successor Pope John XXII. in 1317, under the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Constitutiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Clementis Papoe V.</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Clementinoe.</hi> The mode of citation is either by the
                    chapter, the title-rubric, the words “in Clemen tinis,” and the number of book
                    and title <hi rend="italic">(eg.,</hi> c. 1. de summa trin. in Clem. I. 1.), or
                    by calling the chapter itself the Clementina, and adding its number, with the
                    title-rubric, and numbers of book and title <hi rend="italic">(e.g..</hi> Clem.
                    1., de summa trin. I. 1).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(d.)</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Extravagantes.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> The Clementinae were the last of the collections formally
                    promulgated by the popes. In the 15 th century the term <hi rend="italic">Corpus
                    Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonici</hi> was applied to the body of law
                    composed of the <hi rend="italic">Decretum</hi> and the collections of Gregory,
                    Boniface, and Clement, as appears from the canons of the councils of Constance
                    and Basel. The more important of the decretals omitted from the Clementinae or
                    issued subsequently (distinguished from those in the <hi rend="italic">Corpus
                    Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonici</hi> by the name “Extravagantes ”) were
                    circulated or added in the manuscripts as a supplement to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corpus Juris,</hi> and studied along with it at the universities. Two
                    collections of them were printed by Jean Chappuis in his edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonici,</hi> published at
                    Paris in 1500. The first, which was entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Extravagantes</hi><hi rend="italic">Joαnnis XXII.,</hi> comprised twenty
                    constitutions of that pope, arranged in fourteen titles. The second collection
                    was called <hi rend="italic">Extravagantes</hi><hi rend="italic">Communes,</hi>
                    and consisted of 73 decretals issued in the period from Boniface VIII. to Sixtus
                    V. (1298-1484), systematically arranged according to the traditional scheme of
                    five books (“sed vacat liber quartus,” devoted in previous compilations to the
                    law of marriage), divided into titles and chapters. The following examples will
                    explain the method of citing the first and second collections respectively :—c.
                    un. Xvag. Io. xxii. 12, or (mentioning the rubric of the title) c. un. de poenis
                    in Extrav. Io. xxii. (12),andc. 2, Xvag. comm. III. 2, or (giving the
                    title-rubric) c. 2, de praeb. et dig. in Extrav. comm. III. 2. Neither
                    collection was sanctioned as such; each decretal is independent, and
                    authoritative <hi rend="italic">proprio vigore.</hi> The two sets of
                    Extravagantes being retained in subsequent editions have become by use and wont
                    part of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonici.</hi>
                    They received a semi-official approval by being included in the edition revised
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Correctores</hi><hi rend="italic">Romani</hi> (a
                    learned commission appointed by Pius IV. in 1563), and published as the
                    authorized text by Pope Gregory XIII. in 1582.</p>
                <p>The different portions of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Canonici</hi> stand to each other in the relation of <hi
                    rend="italic">lex prior</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lex posterior,</hi> so that
                    in cases of contradiction the latest in date is preferred. The same rule is
                    applied to the single <hi rend="italic">capita</hi> or laws of the private
                    collections (the <hi rend="italic">Decretum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Extravagantes),</hi> but not to those* of the other books, which were published
                    as official codes, and the different <hi rend="italic">capita</hi> of which are
                    all regarded as bearing the date of promulgation of the whole. A distinction is
                    also made respecting the authority of the rubrics of the titles. Those found in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Decretum,</hi> irrespective of the fact that they are not
                    the work of Gratian, have no sanction except that of usage; while in the
                    decretals of Gregory, Boniface, and Clement the rubric <hi rend="italic"
                    >(rubrum)</hi> has as much authority as the text <hi rend="italic"
                    >(nigrum),</hi> both having been issued together. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >sum-maria,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">summoe,</hi> prefixed to the canons and
                    chapters emanate from the glossators, and have no legislative authority. But
                    they generally state the substance of the law correctly, and are useful for
                    purposes of interpretation. The <hi rend="italic">Superscriptiones
                    Capitulorum,</hi> giving the source and date of a law, and in the case of each
                    decretal, the person to whom it was addressed, are, so far as we know, in their
                    original state, but are not to be depended upon in all cases. A few of Gregory’s
                    decretals, for instance, bear the dates 1235 and 1236, whereas we know they must
                    have been pronounced prior to the promulgation of the collection in 1234. No
                    decretal anterior to 1298 is of authority unless found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decretum</hi> or the collections of Gregory or Boniface. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clementinoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Extravagantes,</hi> on the contrary, are
                    not exhaustive for the period they cover, and omission from them does not affect
                    the credit of an otherwise genuine constitution. André <hi rend="italic">(Cours
                    de Droit Canon,</hi> 3 <hi rend="superscript"> mβ</hi> éd., 1860, vol. iii. p.

                    and Gregory’s <hi rend="italic">Decretals.</hi> They are more numerous in the
                    former, owing to Gratian’s having selected his materials from the older
                    compilations instead of the original sources, many of which were lost, and are
                    of no authority except so far as adopted by sub <pb break="no"

                    decretals in Gregory’s collection are of equal authority with the others, the

                    which appears in a supplement to some editions of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus
                    Juris,</hi> is a mere private collection formed by Peter Matthaeus, a lawyer of
                    Lyons, in 1590. The <hi rend="italic">Institutiones</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonici</hi> of J. P. Lancelottus of Perugia are
                    of the same character, but they form a useful and trustworthy compendium and are
                    of considerable authority. They were written, as the author tells us in his
                    preface, to complete the parallel between the two <hi rend="italic">Corpora
                    Juris,</hi> civil and canon. The <hi rend="italic">Decretum</hi> of the
                    canonists corresponded to the <hi rend="italic">Pandects</hi> of the civilians;
                    the <hi rend="italic">Decretals</hi> of Gregory to the <hi rend="italic"

                    1839), of which a second edition is in the press. But it has not superseded that
                    of J. ∏. Boehmer (2 vols. 4to, Halle, 1747), which is rendered valuable by his
                    notes and copious indices, and contains much useful supplementary matter,
                    including the <hi rend="italic">Liber Septimus</hi> and Lancelot’s <hi

                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mediaeval History.</hi> —From the 12th century Bologna
                    university possessed two faculties of law—a civil and a canon. The members of
                    the latter were called <hi rend="italic">doctores</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >decretorum</hi> (a degree which required six years’ previous study)
                    corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">doctores</hi><hi rend="italic">legum</hi>
                    of the civil law. Those who graduated in both faculties were doctors <hi
                    rend="italic">utriusgue juris.</hi> The students were classed as <hi
                    rend="italic">canonistoe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">decretistoe</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">civilistoe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">legistoe.</hi> The system of
                    tuition was oral <hi rend="italic">(lecturoe)</hi> with minute study of the
                    original authorities. Explanatory notes <hi rend="italic">(glossoe)</hi> were
                    added by many of the professors (hence called <hi rend="italic"
                    >glossatores)</hi> to their copies of the text, written either on the margin or
                    between the lines. These were transcribed along with the text in the manuscripts
                    circulating among the students. Gradually the glosses took the shape of a
                    consecutive commentary <hi rend="italic">(apparatus)</hi> in which the author
                    incorporated what was most valuable in the notes of his predecessors. One of
                    these always came to be accepted as of more authority than the rest, and on that
                    account was entitled in the manuscripts <hi rend="italic">Glossa Ordinaria,</hi>
                    or simply <hi rend="italic">Glossd.</hi> Such are the gloss on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Decretum</hi> by Joannes Teutonicus (1212), revised and
                    supplemented by Bartholomaeus Brixensis (of Brescia) in 1258, and that on
                    Gregory’s <hi rend="italic">Decretals</hi> by Bernardus Parmensis (1266). The
                    ordinary gloss of the <hi rend="italic">Liber Sextus</hi> and Clementines is by
                    Joannes Andreae (1348), the author of the <hi rend="italic">Arbor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Consanguinitatis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Affi</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">nitatis</hi>
                    since inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Decretum.</hi> (The last edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonici,</hi> with the
                    gloss, was published in 1671, 3 vols, fol, Lyons, sumpt. Huguetan et Barbier.)
                    Abridgments of the text, giving briefly the substance of the titles in their
                    order, with cross references, were composed under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Surnmcε</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Distinctiones.</hi> The more intricate
                    doctrines were explained in writings called <hi rend="italic">Repetitiones</hi>
                    at greater length than was suitable to the lecture-room. The law was also
                    expounded by means of real or fictitious cases, of which digests were compiled
                    <hi rend="italic">(casus)</hi> for use by those who took part in the
                    disputations or moots, which were regularly held <hi rend="italic"
                    >(quoestiones).</hi> These were conducted by different professors on different
                    days, and hence were often named from the days of the week <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dominicales, Mercuriales,</hi><hi rend="italic">Veneriales,</hi> &amp;c.
                    Collections were made of unsettled and controverted points <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dissensiones Dominorum)</hi> and of rules or maxims of law <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Brocarda,</hi><hi rend="italic">Brocardicα, Paroemia,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Reguloe Juris).</hi> In both faculties law was at this time
                    cultivated in a thoroughly practical spirit, and their friendly rivalry and
                    mutual influence were beneficial to both. The mode of study was similar in the
                    other European schools, which were all modelled after those of Bologna or
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>The church was thus supplied by the universities with a well-educated class of
                    lawyers for administering the business of the ecclesiastical courts—those
                    institutions which contributed so much to the growth and renown of the canon
                    law. Their development was gradual but steady. The primitive Christians, in
                    pursuance of apostolic precept (1 Cor. vi. 1-6), submitted their disputes to the
                    decision of their bishops, and it was enacted by several early councils that
                    questions between churchmen should be settled by a spiritual tribunal. The
                    episcopal jurisdiction was extended by Constantine to all matters which the
                    contending parties agreed to submit to it. This so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Audientia Episcopalis</hi> was confirmed by several later emperors, and the
                    bishop’s sentence was enforceable by the civil magistrate. By a law of
                    Justinian, actions against the clergy were directed to be brought before the
                    bishop in the first instance. In course of time the church-courts absorbed many
                    departments of civil jurisdiction. All matters connected in the most distant way
                    with the church or religious duties were deemed proper subjects for disposal by
                    her tribunals. The clergy dispensed the sacraments, and their assistance was
                    required on the occasion of baptisms, marriages, and deaths. Hence the <hi
                    rend="italic">curiae</hi><hi rend="italic">christianitatis</hi> took cognizance
                    of questions relating to legitimacy, marriage, and succession. They assumed
                    jurisdiction over not only the clergy, but all who were under the obligation of
                    religious vows <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Crusaders∖ as well as widows and
                    orphans <hi rend="italic">(personae</hi><hi rend="italic">miserabiles)</hi> and
                    minors. In the department of criminal law they were particularly active,
                    punishing both ecclesiastical and religious offences, such as heresy, simony’,
                    blasphemy, sacrilege, and violation of personal and social morality (adultery,
                    bigamy, fraud, perjury). For the administration of this extended judicial system
                    the church had to enact her own rules of procedure, which were generally a great
                    improvement on those prevailing in the civil courts. In fact it was by no means
                    an evil at that period of European history that the administration of the law
                    should fall into the hands of the clergy, who were the best educated men of
                    their time, and had many of them been trained as lawyers in the schools of
                    Bologna and Paris. The Teutonic and Gothic codes were very imperfect in most
                    branches of the law, and the civil and criminal procedure of the native
                    tribunals was far from settled. Their criminal law was little more than an
                    elaborate system of fines, graduated according to the race or rank of the victim
                    or the criminal. Evidence in our sense of the word was unknown, and innocence
                    could only rely for protection on compurgation, ordeal, or judicial combat.
                    Hence the people were, during several centuries, well content to resort to the
                    church courts. The exemption of the clergy from civil jurisdiction was in
                    accordance with the Teutonic principle that a man should be tried by his peers.
                    And the laity were thankful to take shelter behind the church from the fines and
                    exactions of the feudal courts, which were inflicted less in the interests of
                    justice than for the profit of the overlord.</p>
                <p>In the domain of public law the influence of the church was conspicuous. She may
                    be said to have originated modern international law. The ancient Romans regarded
                    all foreigners as <hi rend="italic">hostes.</hi> Christianity inculcated the
                    principle of the brotherhood of nations. The popes acted as arbitrators between
                    prince and prince, and between prince and people. They protected the weak
                    against the strong, and right against might. The principle grew up <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0030-0021"/> that international questions should be decided
                    according to law and Christian morality, aud that war, when inevitable, should
                    be conducted according to recognized rules laid down in the interests of
                    humanity. The system of church administration served as a model for that of the
                    state, which in mediaeval times was frequently controlled by ecclesiastics. The
                    constitutional duties of a sovereign to his people were boldly asserted by the
                    church. Kings were taught that there were obligations for discharging which they
                    were responsible to God, and that if these were neglected their subjects might
                    be absolved frcm their allegiance. Iu after times the enemies of the church
                    borrowed some of their most effective weapons from her own armoury. The writers
                    on the law of nature and of nations, who headed the rebellion against the
                    encroachments of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, adopted many principles which are
                    to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Canonici,</hi> where we may also trace the germs of some leading doctrines of
                    the French Revolution.</p>
                <p>The canon law suited the civilization of the Middle Ages. It was natural that a
                    system, claiming to regulate the most important concerns of practical life,
                    administered by courts which, though belonging to different nations, were under
                    the control of one central authority, and developed under the direction of a
                    succession of able legislators, such as Hildebrand and Innocent III., should
                    take the lead in forming the character and reconciling the conflicting interests
                    of the rising nationalities. The canon law was not so much an independent system
                    of law as a method of selecting what was best from the existing systems, and
                    transforming it, by the help of Christian morality and feeling, into one
                    homogeneous, eclectic whole. Much of the Roman element in the common laws of
                    Europe at the present day has descended indirectly through the canon law, though
                    modern jurists are too apt to ignore this and express their obligations to the
                    ancient sources alone.</p>
                <p>The decline of the canon law kept pace with that of the church from which it
                    sprang. The strife of popes and antipopes, the increased strength of national
                    feeling prompting the prelates to take their sovereign’s part in his quarrels
                    with the papacy, the arrogance of the ecclesiastical courts, the Reformation,
                    the French Revolution, in short, all those causes that weakened the church’s
                    power and influence, were prejudicial to the authority of the canon law. And now
                    that every country in Europe possesses, if not a code, at all events a matured
                    system of national law, the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Canonici</hi> possesses little more than an historical and scientific
                    interest.</p>

                    rend="italic">Germany.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The Canon Law is still the
                    common law of both sections of the Christian church of Germany, and in purely
                    religious and ecclesiastical questions affecting their internal affairs it is
                    applicable, so far as not altered by modern church standards. Such are, for the
                    Roman Catholics, the canons of the Tridentine (1545-1563) and Vatican (1869)
                    councils, and the various concordats with the temporal power; for the
                    Protestants, the evangelical confessions (Augsburg, &amp;c.) and the <hi

                    >Euangelicorum</hi> (1653-1806). The relations of the different churches with
                    the state are regulated exclusively by the law of the land. In a question of
                    private law the canon law has no validity as an independent source. Till the end
                    of last century both the civil and canon laws were by custom received as
                    authoritative in Germany. They were applied universally in the civil courts, and
                    the canon law as the <hi rend="italic">lex posterior</hi> was preferred in case
                    of conflict. These two systems, along with the feudal customs, were the three
                    constituent elements of the common law or <hi rend="italic">Gemeines Recht.</hi>
                    The jurisdiction of the latter is now confined by the provisions of the modern
                    codes to about one-third cf Germany. Within that area the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corpus Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonici</hi> may be quoted to aid in
                    interpreting a doubtful point of common law. In other words, it is of historical
                    but not of legislative authority.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">France.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The Constituent Assembly,
                    after abolishing tithes and religious orders and secularizing church property,
                    superseded the canon and all other laws for the government of the church by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Constitution</hi><hi rend="italic">Civile du Clergé,</hi>
                    enacted in 1790. Finally, in 1793 the Convention suppressed altogether the
                    Christian religion and its institutions. Since the restoration of the Church in
                    the beginning of this century, both its internal government and external
                    relations have been regulated exclusively by civil enactment, based on the
                    concordat between Napoleon I. and Pope Pius VII. (1801), and the <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">England.—</hi> The Canon Law is of no intrinsic obligation in
                    England. The English people have in all ages shown a firm determination that
                    neither the national church nor the national law should be subject to the Papal
                    legislation or jurisdiction. As early as 1138 Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury
                    brought over Vacarius and other learned ecclesiastics from Italy to introduce
                    the study of civil and canon law into England. The bishops and clergy vigorously
                    supported the new system so favourable to their order; but the nobility and
                    laity generally adhered to the old common law with great pertinacity. The
                    contest was practically decided when in the 13th century the Court of Common
                    Pleas was fixed at Westminster. This brought together the practitioners in
                    municipal law who had been, while the court was ambulatory, dispersed throughout
                    the kingdom, and shortly afterwards the victory of common law was made secure by
                    the establishment of the Inns of Court and Chancery for the education of youth
                    in municipal law.</p>
                <p>The system administered in the spiritual courts is known as “the king’s
                    ecclesiastical law.” It is based on the canon law, a knowledge of which is
                    highly useful to the English ecclesiastical lawyer. But only such portions of
                    the canon law have been adopted as have been sanctioned by the national legatine
                    and provincial constitutions, the statutes of the realm, and immemorial church
                    usage.</p>
                <p>The canon law, though not binding <hi rend="italic">proprio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vigore,</hi> is one of the sources of the common law of England. The rules for
                    the descent of land, for instance, are borrowed wholly from that system. But
                    England assimilated less of it than other countries, or than might have been
                    adopted by herself with advantage. It was not that the English people considered
                    the provisions of the canon law inferior to their own customs; they were as a
                    rule entirely ignorant of it. But their struggles against appeals to Rome and
                    other claims of ecclesiastical jurisdiction roused the feeling of the nation.
                    <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> I'hey stoutly stood up for their common law,
                    cumbrous and even barbarous in some respects as it was, not because they thought
                    it perfect, but because they were resolved to manage their own concerns after
                    their own fashion. At the parliament of Merton (1236) when the bishops proposed
                    that legitimation by subsequent marriage should be legalized, alleging that holy
                    church (that is, the canon law) sanctioned such legitimation, all the earls and
                    barons, we are told, with one voice answered, “Nolumus leges Angliae mutari.”
                    This incident shows that even at that early date canon law was of no authority
                    unless sanctioned by the law of the land, for the decretal (c. 6, X. qui filii
                    sint legitimi, iv. 17) alluded to by the bishops was addressed by Pope Alexander
                    III. to the bishop of Exeter in 1172, and was incorporated in the Decretals of
                    Gregory promulgated in 1234, two years before the parliament of Merton.</p>

                    canon law was publicly taught in the Scottish universities; and from a very
                    early period it was the custom of the Scottish youth to resort for purposes of
                    study to foreign countries, whence many of them returned doctors <hi

                    A wide jurisdiction was exercised by the consistorial courts, from which for
                    many centuries an appeal to Rome was competent, and at one time half of the
                    senators of the College of Justice were necessarily clerical, while all were
                    learned in both civil and canon law. Conveyancing, moreover, was in the hands of
                    clerical notaries, who, till 1469, were, like those of Europe generally,
                    appointed exclusively by the emperor and the Pope. But though one of the <hi

                    was of itself authoritative in Scotland. In the canons of her national
                    provincial councils (at whose yearly meetings representatives attended on behalf
                    of the king) that country possessed a canon law of her own, which was recognized
                    by the parliament and the popes, and enforced in the courts of law. Much of it,
                    no doubt, was borrowed from the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Canonici,</hi> the Tridentine standards, and the English
                    provincial canons. But the portions so adopted derived their authority from the
                    Scottish Church. The general canon law, unless where it has been acknowledged by
                    Act of Parliament, or a decision of the courts, or sanctioned by the canons of a
                    provincial council, is only received in Scotland according to equity and
