                <p><label type="entry">CINCHONA</label>, the generic name of a number of trees
                    belonging to the Natural Order <hi rend="italic">Rubiaceoe,</hi> but which, with
                    a few allied genera, have been by some authorities established as a distinct
                    order under the name <hi rend="italic">Cinchonaceae.</hi> Botanically the genus
                    includes trees of varying size, some reaching an altitude of 80 feet and
                    upwards, with evergreen leaves and deciduous stipules. The flowers are arranged
                    in panicles, white or pinkish in colour, with a pleasant odour, the calyx being
                    5-toothed superior, and the corolla tubular, 5-lobed, and fringed at the margin.
                    The stamens are 5, almost concealed by the tubular corolla, and the ovary
                    terminates in a fleshy disk. The fruit is <pb break="no"

                    from the base, and held together at the apex. The numerous seeds are flat and
                    winged all round. According to the enumeration of Bentham and Hooker, 36 species
                    have been distinguished, but of these not more than about a dozen have been
                    economically utilized. The plants are natives of the western mountainous regions
                    of South America, their geographical range extending from 10° N. to 22° S. lat.;
                    and they flourish generally at an elevation of from 5000 to 8000 feet above sea
                    level, although some have been noted growing as high up as 11,000 feet, and
                    others have been found down to 2600 feet.</p>
                <p>The trees are valued solely on account of their bark, which as cinchona bark,
                    Jesuits’ bark, or Peruvian bark is, and long has been, the source of the most
                    valuable tonic and febrifuge medicines that have ever been discovered. The
                    earliest well-authenticated instance of the medicinal use of cinchona bark is
                    found in the year 1638, when the countess of Chinchon, the wife of the governor
                    of Peru, was cured of an attack of fever by its administration. The medicine was
                    recommended in her case by the corregidor of Loxa, who was himself said to have
                    practically experienced its supreme virtues eight years earlier. The name <hi
                    rend="italic">Cinchona</hi> is due to the connection of the countess of Chinchon
                    with the introduction of the remedy; and it is argued by Mr Markham and others
                    that therefore the term should be written <hi rend="italic">Chinclιona.</hi> A
                    knowledge of the virtues of the bark was disseminated throughout Europe by
                    members of the Jesuit brotherhood, whence it also became generally known as
                    Jesuits’ bark. According to another account, this name arose from its value
                    having been first discovered to a Jesuit missionary who, when prostrate with
                    fever, was cured by the administration of the bark by a South American
                    Indian.</p>
                <p>The procuring of the bark in the dense forests of New Granada, Ecuador, Peru, and
                    Bolivia is a work of great toil and hardship to the Indian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cascarilleros</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cascadores</hi> engaged in the pursuit.
                    The trees grow isolated or in small clumps which have to be searched out by the
                    experienced Cascarillero, who laboriously cuts his way through the dense forest
                    to the spot where he discovers a tree. Having freed the stem from adhering
                    parasites and twining plants, he proceeds, by beating and cutting oblong pieces,
                    to detach the stem bark as far as is within his reach. The tree is then felled,
                    and the entire bark of stem and branches secured. The bark of the smaller
                    branches, as it dries, curls up, forming “quills,” the thicker masses from the
                    stems constituting the “flat” bark of commerce. The drying, packing, and
                    transport of the bark are all operations of a laborious description conducted
                    under most disadvantageous conditions.</p>
                <p>The enormous medicinal consumption of these barks, and the wasteful and reckless
                    manner of procuring them in America long ago, caused serious and well-grounded
                    apprehension that the native forests would quickly become exhausted. The
                    attention of European communities was early directed to the necessity of
                    securing steady and permanent supplies by introducing the more valuable species
                    into localities likely to be favourable to their cultivation. The first actual
                    attempt to rear plants was made in Algeria in 1849; but the effort was not
                    successful. In 1854 the Dutch Government seriously undertook the task of
                    introducing the trees into the island of Java, and an expedition for that
                    purpose was fitted out on an adequate scale. Several hundreds of young trees
                    were obtained, of which a small proportion was successfully landed and planted
                    in Java; and as the result of great attention the cultivation of cinchona
                    plantations in that island is now highly prosperous and promising. The
                    desirability of introducing cinchonas into the East Indies was urged in a
                    memorial addressed to the East India Company between 1838 and 1842 by Sir Robert
                    Christison and backed by Dr Forbes Royle; but no active step was taken till
                    1852, when, again on the motion of Dr Royle, some efforts to obtain plants were
                    made through consular agents. In the end the question was seriously taken up,
                    and Mr Clements R. Markham was appointed to head an expedition to obtain young
                    trees from South America and convey them to India. In 1860 under Mr Markham’s
                    superintendence a first consignment of plants was shipped from Islay in Peru,
                    and planted in a favourable situation in the Neilgherry Hills. For several years
                    subsequently additional supplies of plants of various species were obtained from
                    different regions of South America, and some were also procured from the Dutch
                    plantations in Java. Now the culture has spread over a wide area in Southern
                    India, in Ceylon, on the slopes of the Himalayas, and in BritishBurmah; and
                    recently plantations which already present a promising appearance have been
                    established in Mauritius. Exclusive of private enterprise, the trees in the
                    Government plantations in India now amountto several millions, and in
                    theNeilgherryplantations they have attained a height of from 20 to 30 feet. The
                    species introduced in the East are principally <hi rend="italic">Cinchona
                    officinalis, C. Calisaya, C. succimbra, C. pitayensis,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">C. Pahudiana,</hi> some agreeing with certain soils and climates
                    better than others, while the yield of alkaloids and the relative proportions of
                    the different alkaloids differ in each species.</p>
                <p>In the original memorial above alluded to, presented to the East India Board by
                    Sir R. Christison, he, according to a communication to the Edinburgh Botanical
                    Society <hi rend="italic">(Trans.,</hi> vol. xi. p. 111), pointed out that “the
                    transplantation, if successful, would become remunerative. For although it would
                    be a very arduous undertaking were the bark to be collected only by cutting down
                    large trees, which do not attain sufficient growth in less than twenty or
                    twenty-five years, being the only American method, the case would be rery
                    different were it shown that bark could be profitably taken from trees very much
                    younger, and without either destroying or even injuring them. Now, I had
                    ascertained,” continues Sir Robert, “by chemical analysis that—contrary to the
                    analysis of some French chemists—sulphate of quinia was to be obtained from fine
                    quills of yellow bark taken from twigs two or three years old in as large
                    proportion as from the large flat bark from the trunks and great branches.
                    Consequently, as it appeared, from the facility with which the trees grew in
                    their native forests by suckers from the old roots, when the trunks are properly
                    cut down, that young twigs might safely be cut from them at an early period, it
                    followed that the collection of cinchona bark might be conducted in the same way
                    as that of cinnamon bark at Colombo, where only twigs of one or two years’
                    growth are cut for the purpose, and without injuring the trees This doctrine has
                    proved true, so true that it has been found suitable in India even to treat the
                    cinchona plants like osier beds in England, by cutting them down altogether when
                    young, thus using only twigs for the bark, and trusting to suckers for renewing
                    the growth of the plants; and that the result has been the introduction of fine
                    bark from India in such bulk as to have been sold by auction in the London
                    market only nine years after the first cinchona plants were transplanted to
                    India.” Mr. W. G. MTvor, to whom the success of Indian plantations is largely
                    due, introduced a system of mossing the plants, which consists in wrapping the
                    growing stems in a layer of damp moss, whereby the yield of alkaloid is
                    increased, and the growth of renewed bark promoted. It has been pointed out by
                    Dr De Vrij, and the observation is confirmed by Mr D. Howard, that renewed bark
                    contains the alkaloids not only in different proportions frcm the <pb break="no"

                    principles altogether absent in the natural bark.</p>
                <p>The officinal barks of the <hi rend="italic">British Pharmacopoeia</hi> are three
                    in number :—(1) the pale or Loxa bark <hi rend="italic">(cortex cinchonoe
                    pallidae)</hi> yielded by <hi rend="italic">Cinchona officinalis;</hi> (2) the
                    yellow, royal, or Calisaya bark <hi rend="italic">(cortex cinchonaflavoe),</hi>
                    the produce of <hi rend="italic">C. Calisaya;</hi> and (3) red bark <hi
                    rend="italic">(cortex cinchonoe rubra)</hi> derived from <hi rend="italic">C.
                    succirubra.</hi> These are the sources of the tinctures, extracts, and other
                    preparations of pharmacy, while, in common with several others, they also yield
                    the alkaloids which now constitute the chief form in which the active principles
                    of the barks are administered in medicine. Among the other barks used as sources
                    of quinine, &amp;c., the principal are—the ashy crown bark, <hi rend="italic">C.
                    macrocalyx;</hi> Carthagena bark, <hi rend="italic">C. lanceolata</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> Columbian bark, <hi rend="italic">C. lancifolia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> Pitayo bark, <hi rend="italic">C. pitayensis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> grey or Lima bark, <hi rend="italic">C. micrantha,
                    C.</hi><hi rend="italic">nitida,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C.
                    peruviana.</hi></p>
                <p>Leaving out of view certain alkaloids unimportant as yet in a commercial view,
                    and found very sparingly in particular barks, the four primary alkaloids yielded
                    by cinchona barks are quinine, quinidine, cinchonine, and cinchonidine. Certain
                    secondary alkaloids are developed by chemical treatment of these primary
                    principles, and an amorphous substance precipitated from the mother liquors of
                    the quinine manufactured under the name of quinoidine is in considerable
                    medicinal use. Much confusion has arisen in the terminology of the alkaloids by
                    the application of the same name to chemically distinct principles, and by the
                    converse description of the same alkaloids or products under different names. It
                    is found that different barks derived from the same species vary greatly in
                    richness in alkaloids, and that equally great fluctuations occur in the relative
                    proportions of the various principles they yield. When a comparison is
                    instituted among the barks of different species the variations are of course
                    even more marked,—some barks having been found to yield as high as 13 per cent,
                    of alkaloids, while in others not a trace has been obtained. Certain barks,
                    however, are known as a rule to contain quinine in largest proportion, and in
                    others cinchonine is the most abundant principle. Generally quinine is the most
                    constant and abundant constituent, after which cinchonine, then cinchonidine,
                    while quinidine is the rarest both in proportion and in frequency of occurrence
                    of the principal alkaloids.</p>
                <p>The preparation of cinchona bark most extensively employed in medicine is the
                    alkaloid quinine in the form of a sulphate. As the barks from which it is
                    extracted contain besides proportions of one or other of the principal alkaloids
                    above enumerated, a demand for any of them might be supplied without interfering
                    with the production of quinine, and as they also have been proved to be potent
                    febrifuges their non-utilization is a regrettable waste. From the record of an
                    extensive series of experiments instituted by the Indian Government it is
                    demonstrated that quinidine is even more active than quinine, and it forms the
                    principal constituent of a variety of calisaya bark in extensive cultivation in
                    Java. Cinchonidine is only a little less powerful in its febrifugal effect than
                    quinine, and it is abundantly formed by the red bark cultivated in British
                    India. Cinchonine, although the least potent, is an abundant principle, and
                    still a highly valuable and efficient remedial agent. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps"
